The acquisition, Oracle’s largest since its $7.4 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems in 2010, is part of a larger push by the company to build out its so-called cloud-based software services, which are available remotely via the Web. Historically, the enterprise market has been dominated by installed software, which typically involves large upfront fees and recurring service expenses. But in recent years, more companies, large and small, have started to migrate to the Web to manage their businesses and customer relationships at a potentially lower cost. Adam Holt, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, predicted that corporations would increase their use of cloud-based services by at least 50 percent or more every year, for the next three years. The shift has prompted many of the established technology players, including Oracle and Microsoft, to build or buy their own cloud offerings.

Baird. “It raises the prospect that others, like SAP, will be more active.” As competition intensifies, analysts say the sector could see more deal-making. Already, prices are rising. On Monday, Workday, another cloud-based software service, raised $85 million, a deal that valued the company at nearly $2 billion, according to a person close to the company. The acquisition of RightNow may also signal that Oracle’s appetite for acquisitions is strengthening once again. This year, Oracle’s chief, Lawrence J. Ellison, said he was restraining his checkbook and focusing on organic growth because assets were “wildly overpriced.” While the company has made several acquisitions this year, it has focused on smaller, privately held companies, mostly in the under-$1 billion category. Then last week, the company bought Endeca Technologies, a business intelligence software company that also offers products to help online retailers improve customer service. Though the size of that deal was not officially disclosed, Oracle paid up to $1.1 billion, according to The Boston Globe, which cited documents and people with knowledge of the deal. Oracle will pay $43 a share for RightNow, nearly 20 percent above Friday’s closing price. Shares of RightNow rose more than 19 percent on Monday, while shares of Oracle rose 2 percent. “Oracle is moving aggressively to offer customers a full range of cloud solutions including sales force automation, human resources, talent management, social networking, databases and Java as part of the Oracle Public Cloud,” Thomas Kurian, Oracle’s executive vice president for development, said in a statement on Monday. The cloud is becoming increasingly important to Oracle. This month, Mr. Ellison unveiled what the company called the Oracle Public Cloud, a broad platform for enterprise services, the company’s first formal entry into the market. “We felt we had to move to a new generation, the next generation of technology,” Mr. Ellison said at the product introduction. In addition to focusing on customer service via the Web, RightNow’s technologies also provide social media management, application development and search. If adapted to work with its existing software products, Oracle would be able to provide more robust solutions for companies, including offerings for databases, personnel and sales. It also puts Oracle in more direct competition with Salesforce.com, one of the leaders in cloud-based sales management software. “If you look at what Oracle has done organically as well as through acquisition, it’s building out a complete suite for customer experience management,” said Mr. Holt of Morgan Stanley. “It’s a dynamic and rapidly growing space; there’s no clear leader, and Oracle is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the market.” Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E5D61F30F933A25753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=oraclecorporation">At Oracle Event, Time for Rivals<date>Published: October 10, 2011</date><text>Earlier this week, Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison went to greater pains than usual to beat up on the competition. Considering the stakes, it was worth it to him. Speaking at a trade show with 45,000 registered visitors, Ellison announced his company's formal entry into the business of selling software via a ''public cloud.'' The cloud is a huge conglomeration of computer technologies. Clouds, and all that they imply for business and society, are the biggest thing going in tech today, promising billions of people access to nearly limitless amounts of computing, data storage, and communications. With that in mind, Oracle's entry into the market comes as no surprise. But what Ellison kicked off, and which competitors he kicked from the stage, says a lot about how this multibillion-dollar cloud business infrastructure build out will proceed. It says as much about the millions of marketing dollars about to be spent by the side pushing for tightly-integrated systems of hardware and software and those on the other side hoping for a world with lots of diverse technologies in play. Mr. Ellison's main selling point was that both the security and performance of the Oracle cloud would best the competition because his machines were designed from the start by a company that controlled both the main hardware and software. ''If you design in concert you can do a better job,'' Mr. Ellison said earlier in the week. Engineering the hardware and the software together, he said, promises, ''better performance, better ease of use, and lower cost.'' Mr. Ellison says Oracle rewrote over 100 separate business programs, like software for sales management or running a factory, so it would work quickly and coherently in this environment. It also put Oracle in direct opposition with his emerging competitor Salesforce.com, which he said mostly used a less common software language and was less secure, partly because it was constructed by so many diffuse suppliers. ''It is a very bad security model,'' Mr. Ellison said, calling Salesforce ''the roach motel of clouds: You can check in, but you can't check out.'' Much of this is typical of the kind of trash-talking people expect at an Oracle show. It followed similar theatrics from Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff earlier in the day, after Oracle cancelled Mr. Benioff's speech to the Oracle faithful. While he still hasn't responded to Mr. Ellison's charges about the performance of his technology, during Mr. Ellison's repeated put-downs of Salesforce, Mr. Benioff took to Twitter and wrote ''You can't buy this type of advertising. Thank you Larry!'' More importantly, the same kind of competition is going on throughout the tech industry. Facebook has published specifications of almost everything in its data centers, from printed circuit boards to building cooling systems. The idea is that others can use parts of this technology themselves, or possibly contribute to its improvement. The Open Data Center Alliance is a collection of more than 300 companies which together represent over $100 billion in annual information technology spending, is also pushing for shared information. Google, which does use open standards, also keeps many things proprietary. Engineers in the company privately acknowledge that Google has developed specialized semiconductors for some of its in-house operations. It doesn't patent the products, because that would show how they work in the first place. The number of companies that can work at Google's scale is so small and powerful that it felt that would give its opponents an edge. Oracle is thinking proprietary. ''Everyone's got a cloud, we need a cloud,'' Mr. Ellison said, awkwardly introducing what he called a breakthrough product. ''Ours is a little bit different,'' he said. ''Data services, Java services, security services are all built in.'' Java is a software language developed by Sun Microsystems (which since 2009 is an Oracle subsidiary) that is used to program and deploy computer applications across the Internet. Large corporate databases, Ellison said, could be moved from a company's machine into Oracle's cloud, or simply created there, and from there moved back and forth, or into the clouds run by Amazon, I.B.M. or other computing service providers running in Java. In some ways, this battle is akin to the open source-proprietary software conflicts - Linux versus Microsoft, for example - that have gone on for decades, and each side chooses the version that suits its values and business model. Once again, there will likely be significant proof points and areas of dispute around issues like security, cost, and performance. The clouds being built today, however, have a global reach and scale of capabilities that were barely imagined a few years ago. That raises the stakes - potential security breaches involving millions of people, or performance glitches that make or sink a company - and the payoff to whichever company finds the successful formula. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The Justice Department, which pursued the case after joining a whistle-blower lawsuit, and Oracle announced the settlement on Thursday. The payout is the largest ever obtained by the General Services Administration under the False Claims Act, which lets citizens sue on behalf of the government and share in any recovery. A former Oracle employee, Paul Frascella, who filed the case in 2007, will get $40 million. “Companies that engage in unlawful or fraudulent practices to secure government business undermine the integrity of the procurement process and create an unfair advantage,” Tony West, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s civil division, said in a statement. The government joined Mr. Frascella’s case in federal court in Alexandria, Va., and filed its own complaint last year. It claimed Oracle had given companies discounts of up to 92 percent, but the government’s discounts ranged from 25 to 40 percent. Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, said in a statement that the company “denies that it did not scrupulously adhere to the pricing requirements of that contract.” Oracle has “strong controls in place to ensure that the government agencies who purchased from the G.S.A. schedule received fair pricing,” she said. “Oracle never committed any fraud whatsoever.” The events took place long ago, she said, therefore, the company “decided to avoid the distraction and high cost of litigating this case by settling.” Oracle also paid $98.5 million in 2006 to settle a case over G.S.A. pricing at PeopleSoft.Oracle will pay more than $199.5 million to settle accusations that it overbilled the federal government for nine years.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/business/a-potential-suitor-for-hewlett-packard.html?ref=oraclecorporation">A Potential Suitor for Hewlett-Packard<date>Published: October 3, 2011</date><text>Investors unimpressed by Hewlett-Packard’s dysfunctional governance have sold off shares, leaving the tech company vulnerable to a bid. And Larry Ellison’s acquisitive Oracle is a credible potential suitor. A Breakingviews analysis suggests that even while paying a big premium, Oracle could reap a hefty return.Despite H.P.’s expensive deal to buy Autonomy, a British rival, H.P.’s stock is cheap. It trades at less than five times estimated earnings for the company’s next fiscal year. If Oracle paid a 40 percent premium to gain control, the total outlay, including assumed debt, would be a bit over $80 billion. That’s more than half of Oracle’s enterprise value. But Oracle has $32 billion of cash and short-term investments. For a compelling deal, the company could always issue stock as well. And the numbers are persuasive. Analysts reckon H.P. will pull in $13 billion of operating profit in the 2012 fiscal year. Add in a fraction more from Autonomy, and that would bring Oracle a 16 percent annual return on its total investment off the bat. Oracle might be able to squeeze out some costs. If it cut 10 percent of H.P.’s selling, general and administrative expenses and its research and development costs, that would bring $1.6 billion in annual savings. Throw those in, and pro forma for the 2012 fiscal year Oracle’s return on investment would be 18 percent. Along the way, it is possible that H.P. could slightly ease the burden for an acquirer by selling businesses it bought last year in its $1.2 billion purchase of Palm. The mobile operating system may be in limbo, but the related patents are a hot commodity. There are potential snags, however. The presence at Oracle of Mark Hurd, chief executive of H.P. until just over a year ago, may delay any possible move. Moreover, Mr. Hurd might not be the ideal boss for an Oracle-owned H.P. As chief executive, he cut costs too deeply. There’s also the important broader strategic question of whether Oracle should increase its commitment to hardware. Purely on the figures, though, H.P. would make a lucrative target. Fear Factor Morgan Stanley’s October woes feel like a drama lacking a crisis. The company, which three years ago suffered a bank run, was already facing skepticism about its turnaround before the third quarter turned crummy. But that’s not behind its latest misery. Morgan Stanley’s stock has dropped more than 17 percent since Thursday after the cost of insuring its debt against default rose as investors again became anxious over the bank’s exposure to Europe. But the substance to the worries looks thin. A Zero Hedge blog post two weeks ago snowballed. It asserted that Morgan Stanley had $39 billion of French bank risk on its balance sheet, or more than half its assets minus liabilities, known as book value. But these numbers dated to 2010. The bank, led by James Gorman, has almost halved that figure. What’s more, the blog picked only the gross exposure, which included client assets, and those of the bank, held at French institutions. It ignored cash, hedges and collateral. Factor those in and the net exposure is zilch. Of course, 2008 taught investors not to take banks at their word about exposures — or the quality of their hedges. Morgan Stanley itself had almost a $10 billion loss in 2007 from disastrously hedging an otherwise-smart mortgage bet. So investors are skittish. But even after the bank’s recent rout, Morgan Stanley shares are hardly out of whack with rivals’. Like Citigroup, it trades at just about two-fifths of book value, but that is far better than Bank of America’s 27 percent. Even JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which navigated the last crisis deftly, are trading at only two-thirds of book value. Under pressure to show that its turnaround in fixed-income trading and wealth management is working, Morgan Stanley ought to trade at a discount anyway. That doesn’t mean Mr. Gorman should hold his breath and wish for the latest ruckus to pass. Providing more information on the way the company hedges its exposures, and with whom, would help — and he is likely to do that later this month. Of course, as the autumn of 2008 taught investors, once a panic over financing and capital hits a bank, all bets are off. Mr. Gorman may need to get out even further in front of this one.

You may have thought Oracle was a hard-charging sales organization even before Mark Hurd showed up. Turns out there was room for more. “I focus on the same things I always have,” said Mr. Hurd, Oracle’s co-president, in an interview. “You have got to get the strategy right, you have to get the operations right, lined up from R.&amp;D. out to the field. I can tell you who is in charge, from R.&amp;D. to sales, all the way to deliver that value proposition to the customer.” Mr. Hurd’s “strategy and operations alignment” approach served him well as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, until he was laid low by his board for expense account irregularities involving a female contract employee. Mr. Hurd resigned in August 2010, and re-emerged at Oracle a few weeks later. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. Mr. Hurd has been holding brief meetings with tightly managed groups of American and overseas reporters during this week’s Oracle OpenWorld, his first significant encounters with the press since leaving H.P. He stayed tightly on message, delivering blunt assessments of what technology customers face, and how Oracle will serve them for all technology. It was a classic “state the need, state the solution” sales approach. Holding up an Apple iPhone, Mr. Hurd states, “This is a Cray supercomputer.” It has the same processing power as that machine did in 1986 or 1987. “Over the next five years, three billion people will be mobile. There will be 65 zettabytes of data,” he says. (A zettabyte is about one million terabytes, or one sextillion — 10 followed by 20 zeros — bytes.) “The changes are real. Are people going to be doing more e-commerce? Yes. Are people going to be doing more social networking? Yes. Are people going to be more mobile? Yes. Do I think the corporate world is prepared? No.” Oracle’s proposed answer to this problem, set forth Sunday night by Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, and expanded upon by Mr. Hurd, is a computer architecture of hardware and software designed from the ground up to deliver maximum speed (using Oracle products, of course.) Always a close watcher of the balance sheet, Mr. Hurd said Oracle could deliver this as cost savings, bringing antiquated computer systems up to something like efficiency, or enabling customers to enter new businesses for growth. “We have customers in banks who say, ‘I don’t care about performance, can you save me money?’” says Mr. Hurd. Other customers, he says, want performance. Mr. Hurd has been traveling internationally as well as in the United States to take his message to corporations. It is not always comfortable, at least for the client. “I’ve spent a year trying to see a lot of customers, trying to learn our products and technology, trying to build a team,” Mr. Hurd says. “You see a C.I.O., and it’s a good meeting, because he sees everything. One level below that, you are threatening someone’s business” within the corporation. Because of the tight integration of hardware and software, he said, people gluing systems together aren’t needed anymore. “There is a major transformation that has to occur,” he said. It’s a rather strong message that works, apparently, when you are selling for a highly integrated, more competitive than ever, tech beast.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/benioff-bounced-from-oracle-stage/?ref=oraclecorporation">Benioff Bounced From Oracle Stage<date>October 4, 2011, 10:32 pm</date><text>David Paul Morris/Bloomberg NewsMarc Benioff 11:52 p.m. | Updated Added comment from Oracle. Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com and a once-close protege of Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison, says he has been removed from the lineup of speakers at tomorrow’s Oracle OpenWorld conference. “I don’t know why….Larry just cancelled my keynote tomorrow!” Mr. Benioff wrote on Twitter Tuesday evening. “I’m disappointed too!” In an e-mail to The New York Times, Oracle said, “Due to the overwhelming attendance at Oracle OpenWorld, we had to make several session changes. The Salesforce.com Executive Solution Session was moved to Thursday at 8:00am in the Novellus Theatre.” (See our follow-up post for Mr. Benioff’s response.)

If Mr. Benioff is looking for a cause, he might turn to comments he published on Twitter and Facebook on Monday, which included pointing to other Internet stories panning Mr. Ellison’s Sunday night keynote. The posts were chronicled on Bits later that day. Mr. Benioff, who in his days at Oracle went in for stunts that included tossing disks of trial software from a helicopter, appeared unbowed by the cancellation. If anything, he may see it as an opportunity to promote his company, and his vision of where corporate computing is going. He envisions a loosely associated system of open-sourced products operating in publicly available clouds of computer servers accessed over the Internet. “Join me @ St. Regis AME Restaurant at 10:30AM!” he wrote on Twitter. “The cloud can’t be stopped!” The St. Regis hotel in San Francisco is located a few hundred steps from the Oracle conference. Earlier today, Oracle president Mark Hurd held several meetings there.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/75537/?ref=oraclecorporation">Benioff Enjoys the Spotlight, Even When It Is Turned Off<date>October 4, 2011, 11:42 pm</date><text>David Paul Morris/Bloomberg NewsMarc Benioff. 11:57 p.m. | Updated Adding comment from Oracle and Mr. Benioff’s response. Mark Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, says he is very, very happy to be persona non grata at the Oracle OpenWorld trade show. “This is the best possible outcome,” Mr. Benioff said in an interview. “It’s free publicity, and it is clear that Oracle is threatened by us.” The Salesforce chief, a master a getting publicity, also lifted the curtain on a rarely-discussed part of tech industry trade shows – the C.E.O.’s who pay to talk at the shows. And apparently, if they get kicked off, they get their money back. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. “Everybody pays,” Mr. Benioff said. “You pay about $1 million to be a speaker. That is true for our show, too.” The Salesforce show, called Dreamforce, rivals – Mr. Benioff says exceeds – Oracle’s 45,000-strong registration. The sponsoring company “pays for things, and they deliver people.” Mr. Benioff, who earlier in the week publicized a series of blog posts panning Sunday’s opening talk by Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, said his company received an e-mail from Oracle about 3:15 p.m. Tuesday. He was scheduled to appear Wednesday morning. “They said we were canceled,” he said. “They are giving us our million dollars back.” In an e-mail, Oracle said: “Due to the overwhelming attendance at Oracle OpenWorld we had to make several session changes. The Salesforce.com Executive Solution Session was moved to Thursday at 8:00am in the Novellus Theatre.” Mr. Benioff said he would be unable to appear at that time, as he was previously scheduled to travel to Ohio, “and besides, the show is over then.” While that is not exactly true, Thursday consists of seven hours of seminars, without a show floor or keynote speeches. Oracle is also holding a free concert for show attendees late into Wednesday, making attendance at an early Thursday session a dubious prospect. While at first saying he was mystified as to why Oracle would bump his million-dollar appearance, Mr. Benioff later said he got scrubbed “because Sunday night was such a disaster. Larry was not prepared. The keynote was panned in the blogs and in the on Twittersphere. There was concern that we would put on a better presentation. You don’t have somebody over to your house to tell better jokes than you.” In addition, Mr. Benioff said, “We’re doing fantastic as a company, and it’s fundamentally viewed as a threat to an industry which Oracle leads, along with Microsoft.” Maybe, or maybe Oracle just doesn’t like an upstart. Salesforce.com reported annual revenue of about $2 billion and has a market capitalization of $16 billion. Oracle, with $36 billion in revenue, has a market cap of $144 billion. The Salesforce chief, a highly capable salesman, still intends to appear at a nearby hotel Wednesday. “This is the story everyone will be talking about,” he predicted. “We’re just talking about what we can do,” he said. “Maybe the first slide will be ‘The Top Ten Reasons Why I’m Not Onstage.’ ”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/technology/oracle-openworld-convention-engulfs-san-francisco.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle OpenWorld Convention Engulfs San Francisco<date>Published: October 2, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Commuters driving into this city on Monday morning will discover major downtown thoroughfares closed. More than 129,000 square feet of tents will have sprouted around the city’s convention center, where 4.25 miles of power cables, 300 miles of phone and Internet wires and enough beer trucks to sate 45,000 people are in place.This is not for a political convention or even this week’s introduction of the new iPhone. All this is for Oracle, a company that sells database management software. In a city of this size — 805,000 people — Oracle’s OpenWorld convention really takes over. The production, which runs through Thursday, requires a quarter-million cups of coffee and 14,700 hotel rooms, filling the city’s supply and spilling down the San Francisco peninsula past Redwood Shores, Oracle’s headquarters. “We have had bigger events in San Francisco — the World Series, the All-Star Game — but that is about it,” said Sgt. Michael Andraychak, a spokesman for the city’s police department. With flagship products including Database 11g, Oracle is understandably not a household name. Its technology for storing and managing data, however, is at the heart of the modern business world, bringing Oracle $35.6 billion in annual revenue and the skills to stage a sales event before a crowd equal to the population of Hackensack, N.J. Oracle’s annual gathering is also a snapshot of one of the few bright spots in the nation’s economy. Tech continues to prosper, while the people working — or not working — in other sectors struggle. Oracle used to hold smaller events in America and Asia, but it found that more people would come, traveling thousands more miles, when it turned the San Francisco fete into a monster tech party. Besides Oracle, nearly 500 other computer makers, consultants and industry hangers-on have bought booth space on a half-million-square-foot show floor. A free concert on Wednesday features Sting, Tom Petty and the English Beat, as well as a Ferris wheel. Oracle’s so-called engineered systems make sense of mountains of data, for needs as diverse as internal management and Internet commerce. The computer systems using it can cost millions of dollars, too, so they are not the sort of thing people buy over the phone. The owners of the trendy One Market restaurant in downtown San Francisco opened their doors on Sunday — normally a day off — for two private parties. The private rooms are sold out for the entire convention, and new private spaces have been partitioned, like luxurious cubicles, in the main room. “They have their expense accounts,” said Larry Bouchard, general manager, “so their tastes buds are elevated.” The W Hotel near the Moscone Center, the epicenter of the immense convention, recently spent $5 million to remodel its lobby and restaurant, which will reopen just in time for the show. Kristiann Galati, the W’s director for sales and marketing, said its rooms, costing $300 to $500 a night, have been sold out for months, as most nearby hotels have. A few bunks remain at the Orange Village Hostel, in the dodgy but nearby Tenderloin district, for $35 a night. The manager, Edward Kim, said these would most likely be gone by the time the show began on Sunday. Peter Zernik expects to get his share of the $100 million that Oracle users will spend in this town. “A businessman can close a deal here, and have a good time later,” said Mr. Zernik, the V.I.P. host at the Gold Club, a strip club a block from the convention center. “The city looks forward to it and so do I. I make my living on commissions.” Matt Richtel contributed reporting.SAN FRANCISCO — Commuters driving into this city on Monday morning will discover major downtown thoroughfares closed.

But then, you’re probably also not the chief executive of a large tech company that is competing with the Oracle Corporation. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. On Monday morning, Joseph Tucci, chief executive of the data storage giant EMC, gave a talk at the Oracle OpenWorld trade show in San Francisco. That seems odd, considering Oracle makes its own data storage devices. And on Tuesday, Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Inc., whose computer servers compete with Oracle’s machines, will take the stage. What’s with the corporate frenemies? “I walk past our booth and it’s packed,” Mr. Tucci said. “It’s great of Oracle to pound their point of view out there — it’s their show — but we can get ours out too.” In other words, the 45,000 people who show up here are all potential sales targets. Why not show up, praise Oracle onstage, and go at it on the sales floor? Indeed, the claims of Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, on Sunday that Oracle’s data analysis system was eight times faster than the competition was fresh meat for Mr. Tucci. “They’re eight times faster in what way?” he said. “Let’s hear a few specifics on that.” Like Mr. Ellison, Mr. Tucci is a veteran of the business and enjoys the competition. “I’m happy to have someone come straight at me, versus someone putting their arm around me and acting like my friend. One thing about Oracle, they tell you what they are doing.” Not all the onstage corporate talent is as kind as Mr. Tucci. Marc Benioff, the head of Salesforce.com and a onetime top protege of Mr. Ellison, spent part of his Monday morning on Facebook and Twitter, reposting the work of bloggers who panned Mr. Ellison’s Sunday night keynote speech. “A low bar has been set. See you Wednesday at 10 a.m.!” Mr. Benioff wrote on Twitter. At last check, Oracle still plans to have him onstage. The love among antagonists is also a mark of the industry changes wrought by new computer architectures and old-fashioned industry consolidation. John Chambers, the chief executive of the computer networking company Cisco Systems, will be speaking Wednesday. While Oracle does not yet have a significant networking business, Cisco makes online storage and computer server products, putting it in conflict with Oracle and EMC. But Cisco also has a joint venture to sell products with EMC and its majority-owned affiliate VMWare. EMC has also purchased analytic software companies that compete with the analytics products Oracle announced Sunday. It may be a mark of an industry in transition, but it is unlikely to end soon. Mr. Tucci recently said he will retire at the end of 2012, moving to chairman of the EMC board for two to four years. His successor is almost certain to be Pat Gelsinger, EMC’s president and chief operating officer for infrastructure products (Mr. Tucci would not comment on succession.) On Monday, Mr. Gelsinger followed Mr. Tucci onstage, where he demonstrated a new EMC data storage device that can fit right into a server — the kind made by Oracle and Dell.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/conventional-data-from-oracle-openworld/?ref=oraclecorporation">Conventional Data From Oracle OpenWorld<date>October 2, 2011, 9:55 pm</date><text>Oracle OpenWorld, the biggest convention in San Francisco, opens Sunday night with a keynote speech from Larry Ellison, the company’s founder and chief executive.

Here are some other stats about the tech fest, courtesy of Oracle: - Total hotel room nights sold throughout the week are more than 74,000. - There will be more than 3,200 speakers at more than 2,000 sessions. - Keeping it green, 100 percent of convention shuttle equipment (a k a buses) will use alternative fuels and low-sulfur diesel. The company has also hired 15 pedicabs for short-haul trips. - Union crews worked more than 20,000 man-hours before Sunday’s session. There are 3,285 feet of truss in the main hall holding lights, speakers and sound effect systems. The staff has 256 two-way radios. - Over the next few days, they expect to serve 42,000 gallons of filtered tap water, along with more than 60,000 boxed lunches. For Wednesday’s free concert, Oracle has secured 115,000 cocktail napkins, 163,000 compostable cups, Tom Petty, Sting, and a Ferris wheel about a hundred feet tall.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/larry-ellison-stares-into-the-sun/?ref=oraclecorporation">Larry Ellison Wants Data to Move Faster<date>October 2, 2011, 11:30 pm</date><text>David Paul Morris/Bloomberg NewsLarry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, at Oracle OpenWorld in San Francisco on Sunday. There is no mistaking it: Oracle is now a very serious hardware company, thanks to its 2009 acquisition of Sun Microsystems. You can tell because Larry Ellison, the chief executive, has put the absolute core of the hardware trade, chips, at the front of his very competitive world. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. “We want to take I.B.M. on in their strongest suit, microprocessors,” he said at Sunday’s opening of his OracleWorld trade show. The benchmark would be pure processing speed, he said, claiming that his new SPARC t4 chips are already faster than I.B.M. in running Java software. “We passed them in Java,” he said, “we’re going to pass them in every other area too.” When Oracle bought Sun for about $5.6 billion, lots of analysts said Oracle was just looking to buy Sun’s customer base, and would press the customers to buy Oracle’s software databases and applications while it starved Sun’s vaunted computer architecture teams. Instead, Mr. Ellison has developed a line of machines that claim to have a tight coupling of hardware and software, leading to better performance. It is a notion, he said, that worked for Apple Computer in the consumer business, and should work for enterprise computing. “The idea of engineering the hardware and the software (together) should give us better performance, better ease of use, and lower cost,” Mr. Ellison said, adding that the ultimate goal “is higher performance than I.B.M.’s fastest computer.” He took time to thank the Sun engineers for their work on chips, and indicated that he would be investing heavily to keep a competitive edge. So far Oracle has offered both database and computing systems in the new architecture, which stresses lots of parallel processing and fast networking. Oracle says the machines are up to 100 times faster than traditional models, since they can compress data tenfold, and run 10 times faster. On Sunday Mr. Ellison mentioned a machine that he claimed would do data analysis 18 to 23 times faster than could be done on existing machines using Oracle databases. The machine would be able to compute both standard Oracle structured data as well as unstructured data like e-mails, he said. It was another dig at Autonomy, a British software firm that Hewlett-Packard plans to buy for $10.2 billion, and which has lately been in a series of public disputes with Oracle. Much of the speed in these new computers, Mr. Ellison indicated, comes from things like knowing how to compress data, so only critical elements need to be stored on a computer’s memory. It is then stored on the increasingly cheap and popular flash memory, instead of standard memory disks. But it is really about fast networking among a lot of very, very fast chips, managed by software that knows how to keep them working together. “If you want to go fast you can only make a microprocessor go faster,” he said. “We have been working on doing that. There’s only so fast you can make a disc drive, we all buy the same stuff. We all have flash,” he said. And he asked: How can we make a machine 10 times faster? “Parallel everything.” Claims like Mr. Ellison’s are likely to get a rise out of I.B.M., H.P. and others, probably within the next few days.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/the-oracle-h-p-rivalry-powerpoint-version/?ref=oraclecorporation">The Oracle-H.P. Rivalry, PowerPoint Version<date>September 29, 2011, 8:30 pm</date><text>A slide about Autonomy posted by Oracle. 9:21 a.m. | Updated Corrected reference to an advanced chip H.P. was helping to develop. Did information technology just run afoul of disinformation technology? The computing giants Oracle and Hewlett-Packard, known for trash talking each other and for fighting in court, took their sniping to the Internet on Wednesday when Oracle charged that the British software company Autonomy, which H.P. is buying for $10.2 billion, tried to sell itself to Oracle last April. Oracle said it was not interested, since the $6 billion market value Autonomy had at the time was still far more than Autonomy was worth. The implication was that H.P. came in second, and is foolish, in buying Autonomy. Oracle even posted a series of slides on its Web site that it said showed that Mike Lynch, Autonomy’s chief executive, intended to sell his company. The slides, Oracle said, were “all about Autonomy’s financial results, Autonomy’s stock price history, Autonomy’s Price/Earnings history and Autonomy’s stock market valuation.” Oracle also said Mr. Lynch showed up at the meeting with “Silicon Valley’s most famous shopper/seller of companies, the investment banker Frank Quattrone.” Mysteriously, those slides, which were widely commented on in the industry press Thursday, were posted for only about 12 hours. Then they disappeared. A few hours later they were back. It seems there is less there than Oracle intended. Here’s what I learned. Oracle continued to publish a page that said Mr. Lynch came by for talks with Mark Hurd, Oracle’s co-president, and Doug Kehring, who is in charge of mergers and acquisitions at Oracle. For his part, Mr. Lynch acknowledged the meeting, but said it was just a customer visit that Mr. Quattrone organized. Why he was meeting the head of mergers was not explained. Upon request, Oracle sent The New York Times the slides, which it said were sent from Qatalyst Partners, the investment bank headed by Mr. Quattrone, not Autonomy, in January. That backs up Autonomy’s assertion that Oracle had lifted an older slide deck from Mr. Quattrone to make Mr. Lynch look bad — Mr. Quattrone wasn’t even working for Autonomy then. So what is going on here? Did Mr. Lynch try to sell Autonomy to Oracle, or did Oracle post the story and slides to make H.P. look bad? This may be a little bit of both. Mr. Lynch did talk to Oracle’s head of M.&amp;A. before he took the H.P. deal, and Oracle’s cleverly worded description of the meeting makes it look as if he went into a lot more detail than he would like to admit. The deck looks like a bit of extra “evidence” that Oracle later withdrew. Mr. Lynch probably set off Oracle’s outburst with his recent statements that Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, was lying about whether Oracle’s software could do the same kinds of things Autonomy’s software. Not that it took a lot to get Oracle started: in the last year, Mr. Ellison has publicly criticized H.P.’s board for firing Mr. Hurd, his friend and tennis partner, and then hired Mr. Hurd himself. The hiring provoked H.P. to file a lawsuit against Mr. Hurd, which was quickly settled. Another lawsuit between H.P. and Oracle, over Oracle’s decision to discontinue software development on advanced chips H.P. was helping to develop, is still going on. In between the lawsuits, Mr. Ellison said Léo Apotheker, Mr. Hurd’s replacement, conducted industrial espionage against Oracle when he was running SAP. (Though SAP settled that suit and admitted wrongdoing, it said Mr. Apotheker was not involved in the incidents.) Only one thing is nearly certain in this name-calling mess: Meg Whitman, who took over at H.P. when Mr. Apotheker was fired last week, will not be on stage for hugs and camaraderie when Mr. Ellison kicks off Oracle’s big trade show in San Francisco on Sunday evening. Or, as one observer involved in the cross-company slinging put it: “Oracle used Autonomy to give H.P. a poke in the eye. It just got ridiculous.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/barbs-fly-in-autonomy-oracle-feud/?ref=oraclecorporation">Barbs Fly in Autonomy-Oracle Feud<date>September 29, 2011, 10:51 am</date><text>Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News, Paul Sakuma/Associated Press and Peter DaSilva for The New York Times Michael Lynch, left, chief of Autonomy, Mark V. Hurd, president of Oracle, and Frank P. Quattrone, co-founder of Qatalyst Partners. It’s shaping up to be an epic war of words in enterprise software. Autonomy and Oracle traded barbs again on Thursday, in the latest installment of a fiery feud over whether Autonomy tried to shop itself to Oracle. In one corner is Autonomy, the business intelligence software maker that Hewlett-Packard agreed last month to acquire for $11.7 billion. Calling Oracle’s recent comments “an attempt at diversion from their poor positioning,” Autonomy said in a statement that there was a meeting in April of this year, between Mark V. Hurd, Oracle’s president, and Autonomy, brokered by Qatalyst Partners’ Frank Quattrone. But at the meeting, which lasted about 30 or 40 minutes, the company made it “clear that Autonomy was not for sale and no sale process was under way.” It also argued that while Qatalyst, its adviser, might have been recommending Autonomy as a target to other companies, it was not mandated to do so by Autonomy. Tony Avelar/Bloomberg NewsLarry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle. The statement is a direct rebuttal to an amusing, if unusual, press release issued by Oracle on Wednesday, which offered its detailed account of the meeting and PowerPoint slides (yes, slides). According to Oracle, the chief executive of Autonomy, Mike Lynch, visited its offices to meet with Mr. Hurd and Oracle’s head of mergers, Douglas Kehring. Oracle bristled at Autonomy’s valuation, describing its then market value of about $6 billion as “way too high.” As proof, Oracle attached two slide presentations sent to Mr. Hurd (cheekily available at the Web site address “Oracle.com/PleaseBuyAutonomy“). In its counterstatement, issued on Thursday morning, Autonomy noted that the slides, which resemble a typical pitch book, were dated Jan. 26 and said that they were not presented at the April meeting. And according to Autonomy, it had not seen the slides until Oracle posted them online. Mr. Quattrone of Qatalyst backed up his client’s story in an e-mailed statement on Thursday, acknowledging that his firm had prepared and sent the slides to Mr. Hurd, as part of an independent pitch to Oracle. For its part, Oracle says it uploaded the slides “with the hope Mike Lynch will recognize his slides, his memory will be restored, and he will recall what he and Frank Quattrone discussed during their visit to Oracle last April. Yesterday, the Autonomy C.E.O. did not remember having any meeting with Oracle. Today, he remembers the April meeting and inaccurately describes how it came about and what was discussed.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Oracle’s Ellison Says Autonomy Came Knocking But if Oracle’s chief executive, Larry Ellison, who has engaged in several spirited debates in the past, thought the smaller British competitor would simply roll over, the parting lines in Autonomy’s press release should give it some pause. “Oracle seems a little confused about the sequence of events and origins of the data it has received, something that would suggest it needs better management of and insight into the unstructured data on its internal systems. We would be delighted to help,” the company said.

Ellison, chief executive of Oracle. Few executives in the technology world love a good fight more than Lawrence J. Ellison. And when it comes to its longtime rival, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle‘s voluble chief executive is more than happy to take his gloves off and brawl. So when Autonomy, a British software company that H.P. has agreed to buy for $11.7 billion, contended that it never seriously considered Oracle as a potential buyer, Mr. Ellison apparently could not resist taking a swing in public. In an unusual press release issued on Wednesday, Oracle took exception to comments made by Autonomy’s chief executive, Mike Lynch. Soon after the H.P. deal was announced, Oracle announced that it had turned down the chance to bid for Autonomy, citing a too-high asking price. Mr. Lynch went so far as to call Oracle’s account “inaccurate” and that he had nothing to do with an Autonomy adviser approaching Oracle about a potential deal. Oracle’s response: “Either Mr. Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Oracle press release Here is a more specific recounting of events, according to Oracle: Mr. Lynch and his main adviser, Frank P. Quattrone, co-founder of Qatalyst Advisers, visited Oracle on April 1 at 11 a.m, meeting with the technology giant’s head of mergers, Douglas Kehring, and its president, Mark V. Hurd. The two Oracle executives told Mr. Lynch that at a then-current market value of $6 billion, Autonomy was already overpriced. Oracle’s poison-penned account ended with the taunt, “We still have his PowerPoint slides.” A representative for H.P. was not immediately available for comment. For Mr. Ellison, fighting with H.P. is a bit personal. He has picked on his troubled competitor time and again, especially after the rival’s board fired Mr. Hurd as chief executive after allegations of improper conduct. From an impassioned e-mail that Mr. Ellison sent to The New York Times shortly after his friend and tennis partner’s dismissal: “The H.P. board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “That decision nearly destroyed Apple and would have if Steve hadn’t come back and saved them.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/business/oracle-earnings-surge-as-sales-jump-12.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle Earnings Surge as Sales Jump 12%<date>Published: September 20, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Strong corporate demand for software helped to lift Oracle’s sales 12 percent in its first quarter despite a choppy economy and sagging demand for its hardware.The financial results announced Tuesday highlighted Oracle’s overall health while a number of other big technology companies are slumping. But they also add to concerns about Oracle’s push into hardware through its $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems last year. Hardware sales fell 5 percent to $1 billion, the second consecutive quarterly decline. Oracle executives emphatically defended the Sun acquisition Tuesday and described the decline as part of an effort to pare unprofitable sales. Lifting profit margins is far more important than increasing sales, they said. Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, mentioned one kind of server, in particular, that he described as unprofitable, before telling analysts on a conference call that he did not care if its sales “went to zero.” Oracle’s net income in the quarter, which ended Aug. 31, the first of its fiscal year, rose 36 percent, to $1.8 billion, or 36 cents a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 27 cents, in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue climbed to $8.4 billion, from $7.5 billion. The adjusted income of 48 cents a share and the revenue were slightly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 47 cents a share and revenue of $8.36 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., has weathered the economic turbulence of the last few years far better than a number of other big technology companies that primarily sell to other corporations. While Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard retool, for instance, Oracle has been able to expand sales. Recent upheaval in Europe, however, has raised doubts about Oracle on Wall Street. Nearly 30 percent of its revenue is from Europe, which is reeling from fears of Greece defaulting on its international debt as well as from worries about bank failures. Addressing analysts’ questions, Safra A. Catz, a co-president at Oracle, said that sales remained robust in Europe, including among customers considered the most vulnerable in a downturn like financial services firms and the public sector. In a thinly veiled dig at rivals, she said that “Oracle has a lot of company-specific momentum.” She added, “We were strong in all the sectors that you may be reading about struggling, both in Europe and the United States.” Given the tough economy, Oracle’s report was encouraging, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. New software license revenue in the region that includes Europe, he pointed out, grew a respectable 15 percent, more than any of the previous four quarters and more than the Americas or Asia. “Every area people were worried about, they contradicted the trends,” Mr. Barnicle said. Oracle’s primary business of selling and maintaining corporate database software showed strength. New software license revenue, a critical measure of the company’s business because it brings recurring revenue, grew 17 percent, to $1.5 billion. In hardware, Oracle is pushing a strategy to servers loaded with database software. The servers, called Exadata, compete against H.P. and I.B.M. The company has said that it has more than 1,000 customers for Exadata. In the quarter, it said that it added at least 100 more. In its financial forecast, Oracle said it expected adjusted revenue in the second quarter to rise 4 percent to 8 percent compared with the same quarter a year earlier, or slightly lower than what analysts had forecast. Shares of Oracle rose 3.4 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday to $29.04. In regular trading, they declined 2.3 percent to $28.35.

It was one of the largest verdicts in a case involving software-related theft and showed how severely jurors were willing to punish corporations for intellectual-property theft.

While the spotlight of the latest technology boom has been focused on a cluster of popular consumer applications like Facebook, Groupon and Zynga, investors are increasingly taking a shine to the start-ups building the infrastructure for those Internet powerhouses. Silicon Valley’s largest venture capital firms are raising their stakes in so-called enterprise companies, which provide software, analytics and other services to business customers. They are betting that the emerging players in this space, typically considered the least sexy part of technology, will siphon market share from lumbering giants like Oracle and Microsoft. “There’s a manifest destiny, and the old guard is slowly being shunted aside, as start-ups eat their lunch,” said Scott Weiss, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose portfolio includes enterprise players including the data storage service Box and the software maker Asana. The technological and cultural gap between the giants and the start-ups is vast. Enterprise services have commonly featured costly, multiyear licensing agreements, installed proprietary software and in-house solutions. But the old model is eroding, disrupted by a new group of Web-based companies that offer their products remotely, through what is known as the cloud. As Internet usage explodes, more companies are looking for low-cost solutions that can be installed immediately and rapidly scaled up or down. Cloud-based services can be accessed by any employee through the Web, and data usage is not restricted by the number of on-site servers. And the services are often cheaper because they charge based on usage, rather than for a fixed number of licenses. “Historically, a company may buy some heavyweight software from SAP, put it on an Oracle database and use EMC‘s servers,” said Ping Li, of the venture capital firm Accel Partners. “But you look at Google, Facebook, they don’t have that stuff — they need tools with more scale, more flexibility.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Jive Software Files for I.P.O. Mr. Weiss points to his firm’s investment portfolio. Of the roughly 60 consumer and business-related companies, including Twitter, Zynga and Groupon, not one is a customer of Oracle. Instead of huge sales forces, the enterprise start-ups often rely on word-of-mouth marketing and free trials to lure customers. Atlassian, a software development and collaboration tool, hit $100 million in revenue without hiring a single sales person. Last year, the company picked up $60 million from Accel in the venture firm’s largest software investment. “We are instantly one to many on the Web,” said Jay Simons, Atlassian’s president. The strategic shift is expected to spur mergers and acquisitions, as the older players, like Oracle, Microsoft and SAP, face pressure to change their DNA. So far this year, enterprise deal-making has surged 82.7 percent in value, to $20 billion, accounting for 14.5 percent of all technology deals — the highest level since 2003, according to data from Thomson Reuters. In Silicon Valley, the competition for start-ups is also intensifying. On Aug. 18, Andreessen Horowitz announced it had led a $15 million investment round in GoodData, a Web-based business analytics platform. Earlier this week, Wanova, a desktop management service, raised $10 million, and Pure Storage, a maker of high-capacity flash storage drives, raised $30 million. “In the next couple of years, our focus on enterprise will increase,” said Ted Schlein, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, noting that valuations in the area had jumped about 30 percent in the last year. Accel, one of the earliest investors in Facebook, is also “focusing much more on these ‘consumerized’ software services,” according to a partner, Richard Wong. GoodData’s chief executive, Roman Stanek, said he had held discussions with 12 venture firms for his latest financing round. In the end, six competed aggressively, before Mr. Stanek picked Andreessen Horowitz. “Enterprise tends to move at a glacial pace,” said Mr. Stanek, a veteran entrepreneur who has previously sold two software businesses. “But the consolidation of the industry is accelerating, and the segmentation is becoming more obvious.” Still, these start-ups face significant challenges on the way to becoming the next Oracle. Adoption can be slow since corporations are often hesitant to reconfigure big chunks of their technology infrastructure. And then there is the psychological hurdle of trusting everything to the cloud. As Web-based applications have become more robust and reliable, confidence has risen as well, but services are not bulletproof. Earlier this month, Amazon Web Services experienced two outages, which momentarily crippled Internet businesses like Netflix and Foursquare. Despite the hiccups, venture capital backers remain confident in this next generation of enterprise names, viewing them as part of a natural development of the Web. They are also prime takeover targets for the aging giants or more established upstarts like Salesforce, a $15 billion software company built during the last dot-com boom, and VMware, which has made several cloud-centric purchases this year, including acquiring SlideRocket and Socialcast. Like their consumer peers, these start-ups are finding the public markets welcoming. Jive Software, a company backed by Kleiner Perkins, filed to go public on Wednesday. “In the venture world, we talk a lot about the leading trends in social and mobile, but underneath the consumer-facing side, foundational elements are also shifting,” Mr. Wong said. “The new enterprise companies are the picks and shovels that sit behind these consumer start-ups.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/an-oracle-deal-close-to-home/?ref=oraclecorporation">An Oracle Deal Close to Home<date>June 29, 2011, 10:51 am</date><text>Lawrence J.

Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, speaking last year in Santa Clara, Calif. The founder of Oracle, Lawrence J. Ellison, is not known for being stingy. But the billionaire, a famed collector of Malibu real estate and really big boats, is closing his checkbook — at least for now. In an earnings conference late Thursday, Mr. Ellison said he was planning to hold off on acquisitions because the prices for assets were simply too steep: “We are able to grow through acquisitions when they are attractively priced and they make sense, and they are by and large not attractively priced now and don’t make sense, so we’re not doing them. If these assets are wildly overpriced, we can’t make a good business case for buying them. Instead we can focus our energies on organic growth.” To cap off Mr. Ellison’s comment, Oracle’s chief financial officer, Safra Catz, chimed in: “Price has been quite ridiculous.” Mr. Ellison and Ms. Catz’s reactions are notable — if not troubling for the market — given Oracle’s track record. The company, which focuses on enterprise software, has been one of the most aggressive buyers in the sector. Since 2005, the company has spent billions, picking up more than 70 companies. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink While many of those acquisitions fall in the sub-billion-dollar range, Mr. Ellison has not shied away from a handful of big-ticket purchases. In the last three years, for instance, he has bought Sun Microsystems and BEA Systems — both of which cost north of $7 billion. Earlier this week, the company acquired FatWire Software, a small enterprise software business. The rise in valuations of enterprise-related companies is also interesting, because the sector falls outside of the world of consumer Web businesses, like Facebook and Groupon, which have garnered the most attention from investors. According to Richard Davis, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, Mr. Ellison’s comment shows that enterprise companies are indeed benefiting from a “halo effect.” However, he doesn’t believe Mr. Ellison will be as frugal, as his comments imply. “I think they will be more tactical,” Mr. Davis said. “I think he was signaling that Oracle will not go for the big high-profile names, like Salesforce, but they can do some small, tuck-in acquisitions.”</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/technology/24oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle Posts a Profit, Despite Weak Hardware Sales<date>Published: June 23, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Oracle, long a shining star in the technology sector, posted disappointing results in its hardware segment on Thursday, leaving investors nervous about its ability to digest its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.Oracle said computer sales in its fourth quarter, which ended May 31, declined 6 percent to $1.2 billion compared with the same quarter a year earlier. When services are added in, the company’s hardware revenue was flat, at $1.8 billion. Oracle has cast hardware as an important part of its future and the poor showing raised fears that the $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun was failing to live up to its billing. Oracle’s shares fell more than 4 percent in after-hours trading. Investors have long been suspicious about Oracle being able to turn around the Sun server business, which struggled before the acquisition was completed in late January. Oracle’s fourth quarter was the first time investors were able to see a full year-over-year comparison of that segment under Oracle’s ownership. Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said the underwhelming results from the hardware business were not too worrisome. The hardware results, however, were still far lower than the company had forecast, he said. “They identified this early on that they would rationalize the Sun business,” Mr. Barnicle said. “It takes a while to do, but all of us hoped that it would be done by now.” Oracle’s executives emphatically dismissed the idea that hardware sales were suffering. They instead cast the decline as part of deliberate strategy to pare back unprofitable sales. Two Sun policies, the resale of other companies’ products and the sale of lower-cost servers, are not Oracle’s strategy, said Mark V. Hurd, Oracle’s co-president. “I just think we are following the fundamentals of building a solid business,” he said in a conference call. He described the lost revenue as “valueless.” Oracle’s profit nonetheless beat expectations. Excluding certain one-time costs, earnings were 75 cents a share; analysts had expected 71 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Oracle reported that overall net income in the fourth quarter rose 36 percent, to $3.2 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $2.4 billion, or 46 cents, in the quarter a year ago. The company said revenue climbed 13 percent to $10.8 billion, from $9.5 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $10.75 billion. The decline in hardware sales was more than made up for by increases in Oracle’s main software business. New software license revenue, a critical measure of the company’s business because it brings recurring future revenue, grew 19 percent to $3.7 billion. Executives also bragged about Exadata, a newer initiative to sell software bundled with servers to large corporations. More than 1,000 Exadata machines are installed worldwide, Oracle said, and the goal in the current fiscal year is to triple that number. Oracle estimated that its first quarter revenue would rise 10 to 13 percent, which falls within analysts’ expectations. Adjusted income is expected to be 45 to 48 cents a share, also in line with the average estimate of 46 cents by analysts.SAN FRANCISCO — Oracle, long a shining star in the technology sector, posted disappointing results in its hardware segment on Thursday, leaving investors nervous about its ability to digest its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/technology/25oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle Posts a 78% Increase in Quarterly Profit<date>Published: March 24, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Oracle, the business software maker, reported yet another quarter of strong gains on Thursday, as corporate spending on its software accelerated in a more robust economy.The fiscal third-quarter results extend Oracle’s winning streak of growth and potentially signals a more friendly environment for other big technology companies after the recent recession and subsequent slow comeback. “You can’t separate Oracle’s results from the overall environment,” said Kevin Buttigieg, an analyst with Collins Stewart. “The demand for tech spending remains very strong.” Oracle is among the first major technology companies to report earnings after Japan’s earthquake and tsunami two weeks ago. Although the earthquake came after its quarter ended Feb. 28, it was a major topic of discussion during Oracle’s conference call with analysts on Thursday. Wall Street is trying to gauge the effect of the disaster on companies that do business there. Less than 5 percent of Oracle’s revenue comes from Japan, however. Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s co-president, cautioned that it remained early, but that “we don’t expect a material impact” from the earthquake on sales in the current quarter. She does not believe there would be any problems getting supplies, unlike other companies that rely on factories that have been damaged or are dealing with rolling blackouts. “Good news in general,” Ms. Catz said. Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, who is normally on the company’s quarterly conference call was absent this time because he was serving on a jury. Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., is considered by Wall Street to be a bellwether for technology spending by large corporations. Unlike some of its peers, Oracle has emerged from the economic downturn in relatively good health and is trying to take market share from its rivals like I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. Oracle reported gains in its main business of selling and maintaining corporate software. New software license sales, a good indicator of future revenue from maintenance fees, were up 29 percent, to $2.2 billion. Software license updates and product support sales grew 13 percent, to $3.7 billion. Anyone looking for a complex explanation for the increased sales would be disappointed. Ms. Catz explained that Oracle landed new customers and enticed existing customers to buy more. Oracle used the economic downturn to expand beyond software into selling computer servers through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems last year. Hardware sales in the quarter were $1 billion, but there is no comparable year-ago number because the acquisition was completed in the middle of the quarter. Sun’s server business was in decline when Oracle bought it. Oracle has started selling those servers loaded with its database software. The initiative, Exadata, is an important focus for Oracle, which hopes it will win customers from its competitors. Revenue from the previous quarter for Exadata, and its close cousin, Exalogic, were up 50 percent, the company said. Oracle said income for its overall business rose 78 percent to $2.12 billion, or 41 cents a share, from $1.19 billion, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said revenue climbed 37 percent, to $8.76 billion from $6.4 billion. Excluding one-time items, profit was 54 cents a share, above the 50 cents expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Sales also topped the forecast for $8.67 billion. Oracle predicted continued growth. Revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to rise 9 percent to 13 percent, while net profit is expected to be 56 cents to 60 cents a share. Oracle’s shares rose 2.32 percent, to close at $32.14 in regular trading on Thursday. In after-hours trading, shares were more than 3 percent.SAN FRANCISCO — Oracle, the business software maker, reported yet another quarter of strong gains on Thursday, as corporate spending on its software accelerated in a more robust economy.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/oracles-ellison-on-jury-duty/?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle's Ellison on Jury Duty<date>March 24, 2011, 5:57 pm</date><text>More chief executives seem to be spending time in the courtroom.

Catz, Oracle’s co-president, described the good quarterly results in a call with analysts as “broad based” across the company’s businesses and countries in which it operates. “We had another excellent quarter on top of a truly amazing Q1,” she said. Yun Kim, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company, said that Oracle’s earnings signaled that technology spending by big companies had picked up despite the challenging economy. Accenture, a technology consulting company, also reported strong growth on Wednesday. “This is very healthy news for the overall I.T. spending environment,” Mr. Kim said. “The pace of new initiatives is accelerating.” Oracle reported that net income in the quarter ended Nov. 30 rose to $1.9 billion, or 37 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter of $1.45 billion, or 29 cents a share. The company said revenue climbed to $8.6 billion from $5.9 billion. The adjusted income of 51 cents was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 46 cents on an adjusted basis and revenue of $8.34 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. Oracle further impressed investors by issuing guidance for the third quarter that was also above analyst expectations. Profit excluding certain expenses is expected to be 48 cents to 50 cents a share, above the 47 cents that analysts predicted. The better-than-expected results and guidance sent Oracle’s shares up more than 4 percent in after-hours trading to $31.53. Though near a 10-year high, they had closed down 22 cents in regular trading at $30.27. Oracle’s primary business of selling and maintaining corporate database software performed particularly well. New software license sales, a driver of future revenue derived from maintenance fees, were up 21 percent to $2 billion. Software license updates and product support sales grew 12 percent to $3.6 billion. Oracle expanded into the hardware market with the $7.3 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January. Hardware sales totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, or 20 percent of Oracle’s overall revenue. Investors will continue to watch closely to see if Sun’s server business, which had been in decline, will revive under Oracle. Oracle is pushing a strategy to sell servers that come loaded with its database software. Exadata, as the product is called, puts Oracle in direct competition with I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive, said on Thursday that he expected Exadata to be “a turbo charger to our overall database licensing business.” Mr. Ellison, in typically pugnacious style, dismissed Oracle’s rivals, calling H.P.’s servers “slow and expensive” while adding that “our technology is getting faster and more reliable and more secure at a higher rate than our competitors’ technologies.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/24oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle Wins Copyright Case With SAP, and $1.3 Billion Damages<date>Published: November 23, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — A clash of technology titans and two of the most powerful executives in Silicon Valley ended on Tuesday with a $1.3 billion federal jury award against SAP for stealing software from Oracle to try to woo away customers.The award, the largest ever for copyright infringement, comes as big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Motorola, have increasingly resorted to the courts to resolve patent and intellectual property disputes instead of quietly working out a deal. Rarely, however, do the lawsuits go to court or attract the attention this dispute did. “This is pretty dramatic,” said Robert P. Merges, a technology law professor at University of California, Berkeley. He said it sent a loud message to companies to pay attention to any signs of copyright infringement. “It’s a game-ending home run type of result. It will tell people ‘Hey, we need to be careful.’ ” The case, tried in United States District Court in Oakland, Calif., had been closely watched in Silicon Valley not only for the amount of money involved but also for the personalities and companies behind the disputes. On one side was Lawrence J. Ellison, the pugnacious chief executive of Oracle and the third-richest man in America, and on the other side were the executives of SAP, who had admitted making illicit copies of Oracle’s software and manuals while insisting that the theft really didn’t cause much damage. The dispute was not over the deed, but over how big the damages were. Mr. Ellison, known as one of the best salesmen in Silicon Valley, told the jury that Oracle was owed billions. SAP countered that he was exaggerating and damages were no more than $41 million. The eight-person jury settled on damages closer to Mr. Ellison’s number. Oracle meant to use the public case as an attempt to also sully SAP, its top rival. But it also used the occasion to embarrass another rival, Hewlett-Packard. H.P. had hired Léo Apotheker, SAP’s former chief executive, as its chief executive in September. Mr. Ellison said in public statements that Mr. Apotheker oversaw the vast copyright infringement plan while heading SAP. Hewlett-Packard was not involved in the matter, but Mr. Ellison’s hiring of H.P.’s former chief executive, Mark V. Hurd, to serve as Oracle’s co-president also added frisson to the rivalry. Mr. Apotheker did not testify at the trial because Oracle’s lawyers were unable to find him to serve him with a subpoena. Mr. Apotheker said Monday in a conference call with securities analysts that he had been traveling around the world visiting H.P. facilities. Saswato Das, a spokesman for SAP, said in a statement: “We are, of course, disappointed by this verdict and will pursue all available options, including post-trial motions and appeal if necessary. This will unfortunately be a prolonged process and we continue to hope that the matter can be resolved appropriately without more years of litigation.” Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s co-president, said, “Right before the trial began, SAP admitted its guilt and liability; then the trial made it clear that SAP’s most senior executives were aware of the illegal activity from the very beginning.” Roland Vogl, executive director of the program in law, science and technology at Stanford University, said that while there are lots of copyright disputes, sparring companies often settle before going in front of a jury, often settling in pretrial motions. “Only a very, very small number of cases get litigated to the very end,” he said. That these companies did not probably had a lot to do with the longtime animus between them, he said. “Those two companies have notoriously been feuding over so many years.” During the three-week trial, the two sides argued over how much Oracle would have charged SAP to legally license the software and other items it stole. Oracle claimed in the suit, filed in 2007, that a license would have been worth as much as $2 billion over the life time of the software. SAP, which apologized for the infringement during the trial, said that the damages were closer to $40 million because it had persuaded only a few hundred of Oracle’s customers to defect. Oracle’s lawyers cited $1.6 billion in damages in closing arguments Monday. E-mail shown in court highlighted that SAP executives ignored warnings of copyright infringement. E-mail from Oracle executives highlighted their aggressive business tactics and a disdain for some of their own customers, one of which an executive referred to with an expletive. SAP’s copyright infringement took place at its TomorrowNow subsidiary, which handled technical support for software running in the data centers of large corporations. The subsidiary, now closed, illicitly copied a large library of Oracle’s software and customer manuals. Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst at Nucleus Research, said that the amount Oracle was awarded in the case may seem like a bonanza to most people. But to Oracle, the award will not substantially change its fortunes. Still, she said that it created a major victory for Oracle in terms of image. “This is about making SAP pay with publicity — publicity that’s likely to give Oracle a one-up in the sales cycle for years to come,” Ms. Wettemann said. “Customers are going to be asking, ‘Do you buy from a thought leader or from someone who steal ideas?’ ”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/technology/09oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle-SAP Trial Focuses on Licensing Fees<date>Published: November 8, 2010</date><text>OAKLAND, Calif. — Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, added star power but no fireworks to a copyright infringement trial pitting his company against its rival SAP.He instead testified on Monday in Federal District Court about the unglamorous issue of licensing fees, a central point in the legal battle over how much SAP should pay in damages for stealing Oracle’s software. SAP has already conceded liability. Court watchers had hoped that the outspoken chief executive would enliven the proceedings with comments about SAP or Hewlett-Packard, the Oracle rival now run by a former SAP executive. Oracle is seeking $2 billion in damages against SAP, which has acknowledged that its former subsidiary, TomorrowNow, made illicit copies of Oracle’s software and manuals. But SAP argues that Oracle is exaggerating the potential harm and that it should pay only $40 million. Mr. Ellison’s testimony was the high point so far in what is one of the most closely watched legal battles in Silicon Valley. The interest is not so much about the details of the case, given SAP’s admissions of guilt, but rather the spectacle of public bickering among technology industry titans. Mr. Ellison, known as a fierce adversary, has used the case to attack Léo Apotheker, SAP’s former chief executive and now chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. He has said in public statements that Mr. Apotheker oversaw a vast copyright infringement plan. But Mr. Apotheker’s name was not mentioned during Mr. Ellison’s testimony on Monday. Oracle has tried to serve Mr. Apotheker with a subpoena to appear in court, but its lawyers have been unable to find him. In a statement last week, Oracle said that Mr. Apotheker was apparently staying away from H.P.’s headquarters to avoid being served. H.P. has responded that Oracle had the opportunity to ask Mr. Apotheker any question it wanted during an earlier deposition. Mr. Ellison said in court that Oracle would have charged SAP around $4 billion to license the software. He explained that the price tag would be that high because it would open the door for SAP to poach up to 30 percent of the customers Oracle got through several major acquisitions. “If they could get that software for nothing, we’d have a hard time paying 100,000 employees,” Mr. Ellison said Monday in response to a question from David Boies, the prominent lawyer from the firm Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner who is representing Oracle. Mr. Ellison seemed at ease during his testimony before Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton and an eight-person jury. He sometimes disputed the assertions of the opposing lawyer, Gregory Lanier, of the law firm Jones Day, who tried to hammer the message that the damages should be lower than Oracle contends. He repeatedly asked Mr. Ellison to point to any e-mails or other internal documents showing that Oracle had ever feared that it would lose a large number of customers to SAP. “I do not write those kinds of things down,” Mr. Ellison responded. In the end, Oracle lost 358 customers, or 2 percent to 3 percent. Some of those customers, SAP has argued, would have left anyway. Mr. Lanier also showed e-mails in which Oracle executives wrote of seeing few defections to TomorrowNow, which SAP acquired in 2005. Mr. Ellison replied that he was very concerned about the potential threat from TomorrowNow and that he did not necessarily agree with early observations by other Oracle executives. In any case, Mr. Ellison said that no one at Oracle had been aware that TomorrowNow’s employees were stealing Oracle’s intellectual property until later. If he had discovered it earlier, he said, he and his colleagues would have considered the risk far greater.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/opinion/07pubed.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Compounding a Conflict of Interest<date>Published: November 6, 2010</date><text>AS hard as it sometimes is to write a story, it can be much harder to un-write one that should never have been published.Joe Nocera’s column Oct. 9 on the new Hewlett-Packard chief executive, Léo Apotheker, was such a story, and The Times’s subsequent efforts to fix it and stand accountable fell short. The situation was doubly difficult for The Times because the Nocera piece so effectively delivered on the twin aims of such columns in the news pages: delivering news and amping it up with a distinctive point of view. The column contended that the H.P. board’s decision to name Mr. Apotheker, the former C.E.O. of the German software giant SAP, was a major mistake because he had been somehow involved in the “wholesale theft” of proprietary software code from Oracle while at SAP. This misappropriation became the subject of a lawsuit brought by Oracle against SAP, a three-year-old case that has already established SAP’s liability and is now in the damages stage at trial. Mr. Nocera detailed how a unit of SAP, TomorrowNow, systematically downloaded Oracle’s software and then sought to lure Oracle customers to SAP. Mr. Apotheker wasn’t yet C.E.O. but headed its sales and marketing arm. Noting that Mr. Apotheker’s job description did not include overseeing TomorrowNow, Mr. Nocera wrote, “He may not have been involved in this brazen theft of intellectual property, but it defies belief to say he didn’t know about it.” And the column argued that Mr. Apotheker did not act swiftly enough to end TomorrowNow’s practice when he became C.E.O., making him a poor choice to head H.P., whose chief executive, Mark Hurd, had just left in the wake of alleged ethical lapses. Nocera wrote, “for a company that professes to be concerned with ethics — so concerned that it had to get rid of Mr. Hurd, with his piddling expense account problems — it is astonishing that it would find Mr. Apotheker’s lapses acceptable.” In short, the column was a hard-hitting blend of reporting and opinion that left H.P. bleeding on the mat. Here’s the flaw: It turns out Mr. Nocera’s fiancée is the director of communications for the law firm representing Oracle in the damages phase of the case, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner. Oracle’s case is well-served by casting Mr. Apotheker’s actions at SAP in a bad light. H.P. notified The Times three days after the column ran that it had learned there might be a “close personal relationship,” and that if so, “this would present a serious conflict of interest.” Times editors were learning this for the first time from H.P., but Mr. Nocera said he learned it on the day of publication, right after his fiancée read the column and told him that her law firm was in the middle of the SAP-Oracle suit. He had not realized the firm was involved, he said. In an e-mail message, Mr. Nocera told me his fiancée had only recently returned to work after a leave from the law firm and had not mentioned the firm’s role in the Oracle suit to him: “the only thing she knew about my column was that I was going back at the H.P. board again.” When Times editors learned of the conflict, they quickly and appropriately posted an Editors’ Note disclosing this unfortunate sequence and concluding, “To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Mr. Nocera would not have written about the case if he had known of the law firm’s involvement.” Publishing an Editors’ Note is probably the closest The Times could come to un-writing the Nocera column. But around 2:30 on the afternoon of Oct. 12 — before his editors knew about the problem and before the note went online later that day — Mr. Nocera raised the column’s profile even higher by discussing it on CNBC’s “Street Signs” program hosted by Erin Burnett. After CNBC saw the Editors’ Note in The Times, it too followed with an on-air notice of the problem the next day. Looking back, Mr. Nocera expressed chagrin, saying the CNBC appearance was “stupid.” “If you look at the tape of my appearance, you’ll see how uncomfortable I was,” he said. “Almost from the moment Erin opened her mouth I knew I had made a mistake.” What he should have done, Mr. Nocera said, was alert his editors right away on Oct. 9 when he learned of the conflict, “instead of wishing it away.” The sequence of events doesn’t end there. On Oct. 23, The Times’s Ashlee Vance wrote a Bits blog post on the SAP-Oracle case, noting that SAP had asked the judge to restrain the parties’ comments to the media. The blog post said, “A recent column in The New York Times figured heavily in SAP’s request.” The blog post went on to say that SAP’s attorneys “suggest that Oracle representatives may have influenced this column, since Mr. Nocera’s fiancée works as a publicist for the law firm representing Oracle.” Nowhere in the post did it mention the Editors’ Note in which The Times acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest. Damon Darlin, editor of the blog post, said the post contained a link to the Nocera column. “The column wasn’t what the post was about,” he said. “But anyone who wanted to take a side trip and read the column would immediately see the note on the top and the bottom of the column. We weren’t hiding anything.” I believe Joe Nocera when he says he didn’t know his fiancée was working for Oracle’s lawyer. But his decision to go on CNBC was a mistake, and as a result, the story took on another life. Then a week and a half later, The Times missed a chance in the Bits blog to cite the Editors’ Note. There is a significant difference, in my mind, between saying The Times acknowledges the conflict and saying, as the blog post did, that SAP’s lawyers cited the conflict. The Times not only needs to be aboveboard, it needs to appear aboveboard when problems of this magnitude emerge. So, yes, it is very hard to un-write a story. But, in this case, The Times and its columnist could have done more to be accountable for the problem and, if not un-write the story, stop it in its tracks. A reasonable approach now would be to re-report the story — as a straight news account, not as a news-page column — and let the new story stand as a foundation for future Times coverage of the Oracle suit and Mr. Apotheker’s role in it.  My column last Sunday on The Times’s “War Logs” coverage misstated A. M. Rosenthal’s title. At the time of the Pentagon Papers case, he was managing editor of The Times, not executive editor.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/oracle-and-sap-reach-a-partial-settlement-but-their-trial-continues/?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle and SAP Reach a Partial Settlement, But Trial Continues<date>November 3, 2010, 7:52 pm</date><text>SAP has agreed to pay $120 million to settle part of a lawsuit brought by Oracle over copyright infringement, according to a source familiar with the matter. But the two companies will continue their battle in Federal District Court in Oakland, Calif., over the remainder of the case, which has transfixed Silicon Valley with personal attacks and the public airing of unflattering internal documents. Meanwhile, one of the biggest mysteries of the trial is whether Léo Apotheker, SAP’s former chief executive, will testify in person. Mr. Apotheker is now Hewlett-Packard’s chief executive. The answer, at least for now, appears to be no. Oracle’s lawyers have been unable to serve Mr. Apotheker with the necessary paperwork. Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, has accused Mr. Apotheker of dodging the trial by staying overseas. In a statement on Wednesday, Oracle said: “Hewlett-Packard has refused to accept service of a subpoena requiring Mr. Apotheker to testify about his role in SAP’s illegal conduct. Mr. Apotheker started work for H.P. on Monday, but it now appears that the H.P. board of directors has decided to keep him away from H.P.’s headquarters and outside the court’s jurisdiction. We will continue to try to serve him.” As part of the proposed agreement, Oracle would no longer seek punitive damages from SAP for its admitted theft of Oracle software, according to the source, who could not speak on the record because the settlement agreement is sealed. However, Oracle would still be able to seek actual damages for what it has described as SAP’s vast copyright infringement scheme. The settlement, which was submitted on Monday and sealed the next day, must be approved by Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton. Oracle declined to comment. Saswato Das, a spokesman for SAP, would say only that “Yesterday, at Oracle’s request, the court sealed the order, and therefore we are not permitted to discuss it.‬” Opening arguments in the trial began on Tuesday. At issue is how much SAP should pay in damages after admitting that employees of its subsidiary, TomorrowNow, routinely copied Oracle software and manuals without paying Oracle. Oracle is seeking $2 billion in damages while SAP argues that it should pay around $40 million. It has set aside a $160 million to cover the costs.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EEDA1339F930A35752C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=oraclecorporation">DEALBOOK; Oracle to Pay $1 Billion To Buy Art Technology<date>Published: November 3, 2010</date><text>Six weeks ago, Oracle's chief executive, Larry Ellison, said that his deal-happy company planned to set its sights on software makers that cater to specific industries. It found one on Tuesday. Oracle's impending $1 billion acquisition of the e-commerce software provider Art Technology Group, which was announced Tuesday, fits Mr. Ellison's description perfectly: Art Technology makes software for retailers to peddle their wares online. Its customers include Best Buy, CVS, Macy's and OfficeMax, among others. The acquisition follows several previous deals by Oracle to buy software makers that cater to merchants. Most notably, Oracle bested its rival SAPin a bidding war in 2005 to buy Retek, which makes business management software for retailers. The Art Technology acquisition is somewhat large as far as Oracle's acquisitions are concerned - while Oracle spent $7.4 billion to acquire Sun Microsystems in a deal that finally won approval in January and is no stranger to multibillion-dollar deals, not many of the software companies it has acquired have cost $1 billion or more - but it largely fits the pattern of what Mr. Ellison, pictured, has set out as the type of company Oracle wants to acquire. Mr. Ellison said at Oracle's annual meeting in September that it intended to buy software companies that catered to specific sectors or types of businesses, which he said would set it apart from competitors like SAP. ''We want to play in every important industry,'' Mr. Ellison said, according to Bloomberg News. Mr. Ellison said he did not have an interest in acquiring services companies - which is the approach that other information-technology companies like I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard are increasingly adopting. Rather, he wanted companies whose value lied in their intellectual property - be they software developers or chip makers, another category in which he said Oracle intended to make acquisitions. For years, Oracle has been extraordinarily aggressive in buying other companies, having struck more than 60 deals over the last five years. And more are certainly coming: one of Oracle's co-presidents, Charles E. Phillips Jr., said in July that Oracle could double its spending on acquisitions over the next five years. (The company quickly walked back his comments, saying it has no set acquisition budget, and Mr. Phillips has since left Oracle.) For those interested in a deal-by-deal accounting of how Oracle built its empire, the company provides a comprehensive ''acquisition catalog'' on its Web site. - Thomas Kaplan This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/technology/03oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle and SAP Trial Over Copyright Damages Opens<date>Published: November 2, 2010</date><text>OAKLAND, Calif. — The dispute between the software giants Oracle and SAP, in one of the most closely watched court cases in Silicon Valley history, is not over whether SAP engaged in a copyright infringement scheme, but over how much damage was done to Oracle.SAP has already admitted that it infringed on Oracle’s copyrights and has conceded liability. At issue in a jury trial that began on Tuesday in Federal District Court is how much money SAP will pay in damages. Oracle has argued for $2 billion, and SAP has countered that tens of millions of dollars would be enough. It has set aside $160 million to cover the cost. For most people in the technology industry, though, the trial is a forum for Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s outspoken chief executive, to go after Léo Apotheker, SAP’s former chief executive and now chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. H.P. had been a close partner of Oracle’s, but in recent months the companies have become rivals. In the weeks before the trial, Mr. Ellison publicly castigated Mr. Apotheker for overseeing the infringement. He also criticized H.P. for hiring Mr. Apotheker, who succeeded Mark V. Hurd. Mr. Hurd was hired by Oracle as co-president after he resigned from H.P. over an ethics question. The opening arguments in the trial, which is expected to last four weeks, highlighted the cutthroat business tactics of competitors in the business software industry. Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and organization at University of California, Berkeley, said that Mr. Ellison was using the trial to sully the image of his rivals. She likened his attacks to a negative campaign advertisement, calling them nasty but memorable in the minds of potential customers. “He’s killing two birds with one stone,” Ms. Pozner said. Geoffrey Howard, a Bingham McCutchen lawyer representing Oracle, told Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton, an eight-person jury and a packed courtroom that SAP executives had been well aware of the theft carried out against his client, and that, in fact, they had encouraged it. He painted a picture of a company so fearful of Oracle’s growing power that it chose to purloin its software in an effort to steal its customers. “The scope is vast,” Mr. Howard said. He also quoted from a 2005 e-mail written by Mr. Apotheker that said, “We need to inflict some pain on Oracle.” SAP’s lawyer, Robert A. Mittelstaedt of Jones Day, was contrite about the copyright infringement, telling the jury that SAP admits “that it did something wrong.” But he minimized its scope by saying that other than some lost profits and lost customers, Oracle suffered little damage. “They want a windfall,” Mr. Mittelstaedt said. “They want a bonanza that is all out of proportion to the harm.” The theft stems from SAP’s acquisition in 2005 of TomorrowNow, a company that provided technical support to some of Oracle’s customers. TomorrowNow routinely downloaded copies of Oracle’s software and maintenance manuals onto its computers and distributed some of those copies to clients — all without paying Oracle. One of the biggest questions about the trial is whether Mr. Apotheker will testify in person. Oracle’s lawyer was vague on the matter, leaving the door open to his appearing in a video deposition. Mr. Ellison has suggested that Mr. Apotheker, who started work at H.P. on Monday, is trying to dodge an appearance by staying outside the country. H.P. declined to comment on Mr. Apotheker’s whereabouts. Ray Lane, H.P.’s chairman, defended Mr. Apotheker’s integrity in a statement last week. He emphasized that Mr. Apotheker had known little about the infringement, and he called Mr. Ellison’s criticism merely an effort to harass Mr. Apotheker and “interfere with his duties.” At the trial, each side produced e-mails and internal documents that shed an unflattering light on the other. Oracle’s lawyer showed an e-mail in which an SAP executive had warned Shai Agassi, then SAP’s president, of the potential copyright liability of acquiring TomorrowNow. John Ritchie, a TomorrowNow employee, offered another blow in a video deposition by saying that his superior had ignored his concerns about copyright infringement and went so far as to tell him never to write anything down. SAP’s lawyer countered with e-mails in which Juan Jones, an Oracle employee, had referred to Toyota, an Oracle customer, with an expletive and boasted of refusing it a lower price on software. The lawyer said the contents had showed that Oracle’s poor service led to some customer defections and that SAP should not be held liable for those. Indeed, Oracle claimed that SAP had been trying to steal thousands of customers it provided support to, pointing to an internal SAP presentation. But SAP responded that despite its rosy projections, the company lured only 358 of Oracle’s 9,000 or 10,000 support business customers, and that many of them would have left anyway.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/oracle-sap-testimony-nears-hp-c-e-o-in-spotlight/?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle-SAP Trial Gets Under Way<date>November 2, 2010, 3:05 am</date><text>A Silicon Valley legal drama that has enmeshed three of the world’s most powerful technology companies kicks into high gear on Tuesday as Oracle lays out its case for seeking some $2 billion in damages from SAP, Reuters reports. Attorneys from Oracle and SAP spent nearly seven hours on Monday selecting jurors and setting procedural rules for the five-week trial. They are due to present opening arguments on Tuesday. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and chief executive, has waited two and a half years to bring SAP to court on accusations that SAP’s TomorrowNow subsidiary stole Oracle software and resold the technology at bargain-basement prices — which SAP has admitted. At issue is not whether SAP is at fault. SAP has admitted to wrongdoing, accepted liability and shut down TomorrowNow. The two sides are fighting over the damages SAP will have to pay, anywhere from tens of millions to billions of dollars.

As the economy stabilizes, companies are also more likely to spend on share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions, Moody’s said on Tuesday. Nonfinancial companies are sitting on $943 billion of cash and short-term investments, as of the middle of the year, compared with $775 billion at the end of 2008, Reuters said, citing Moody’s. This would be enough to cover a year’s worth of capital spending and dividends and still have $121 billion left over, it said. Only 20 companies hold a large portion of corporate cash balances, with $346 billion on their balance sheets, or 37 percent of the total, Moody’s said. Cisco Systems has the largest cash balance, at $39.86 billion, while Microsoft is second with $36.79 billion, Moody’s said. Google has the third-largest balance with $30.06 billion, followed by Oracle with $23.64 billion and Ford Motor at $21.89 billion.

Phillips Jr., the former co-president of Oracle, all of about six weeks to find a new job. On Monday, Mr. Phillips, who stepped down from his Oracle post last month, will show up as the new chief executive of Infor, a business software maker based in Atlanta. The company's claim to fame, if you can call it that, is owning the largest business software franchise no one has ever heard of. Infor sells about $2 billion worth of software per year, mostly to midsized companies. ''This is a rare opportunity to be the chief executive of an applications company with real scale,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''I am thrilled to be doing this.'' A vigorous game of executive musical chairs has been taking place in the business software market. The same day that Mr. Phillips left Oracle, the company tapped Mark V. Hurd, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, to fill the role vacated by Mr. Phillips. H.P. then named Leo Apotheker, the former head of SAP, as its new chief executive. Since its founding in 2002, Infor has tried to go after smaller customers neglected by the likes of SAP, Oracle and I.B.M. It built up its business selling software for the manufacturing and financial services sectors and then filled out its portfolio through 70 acquisitions. Today, Infor sells a wide range of products like customer relationship management, expense management, work force management and supply chain management software. ''A lot of our competitors talk about going after the midmarket - some with varying degrees of success,'' said Jim Schaper, Infor's former chief executive who will stay on as chairman. ''We were actually built to serve the midmarket.'' As for Oracle, SAP and other big players' aspirations for the midmarket, Mr. Phillips said: ''That has been a desire for decades. It's just very hard to do.'' Mr. Phillips joins a very long list of former top Oracle executives who have left only to compete with the company and its chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison. ''I have spoken to Larry,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''He is quite proud to produce another C.E.O. in the industry.'' Infor plans to release a new product platform in January and the presence of Mr. Phillips is sure to draw added attention to these wares. Mr. Phillips will continue to have the company headquartered in Atlanta - the same city where he went to high school. ''I have a lot of connections down there,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''To me, that was a big plus.'' Infor appears to be on track to file for an initial public offering or certainly to be acquired by the likes of Oracle, SAP and I.B.M. -- which seem to gobble up every middleware maker in sight. ''One of the challenges of any company that makes over 70 acquisitions is just getting the back office prepared to be a public filer,'' Mr. Schaper said. ''All of that is behind us now. The markets will determine if this is an I.P.O. candidate and when.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Charles E.

Rather than buy or lease the equipment necessary to run the event, organizers rented the required computer capacity from a data center run by Singapore Telecommunications. The Games were a showcase for cloud computing in Asia: software, data storage, networking and even computing equipment on tap — as much as a customer desired for only as long as needed. “In past Olympic games, they had to buy these servers,” said Bill Chang, an executive vice president at Singapore Telecommunications, “and then after the Games all this equipment would be fire-sold away or given away.” Mr. Chang said that by using cloud services, customers like the organizers of the Youth Olympic Games could save 60 percent to 80 percent of the cost of purchasing the equipment themselves. The research firm IDC estimates that the market for cloud computing in Asia outside Japan will grow to about $1.3 billion this year and will continue expanding at a rate of about 40 percent a year until 2014. That figure is just a splash in the estimated $68.3 billion that cloud computing will bring in globally in 2010, according to the research firm Gartner. And for every case of avid adoption, as in Singapore, there are other countries where acceptance is hindered by regulations, concerns about data security and poor Internet connections. “What will drive adoption is broadband penetration,” said Emilio Umeoka, president of Microsoft’s Asian operations in Singapore. “If you don’t have the pipe, you can’t get onto the cloud.” For potential customers, the savings from cloud computing are enticing. Like equipment leasing before it, cloud computing turns what once was a big-ticket capital expenditure into an operating expense for companies — one that can be tuned up or down, depending on business conditions. “The savings comes in infrastructure,” Mr. Umeoka said. “Your company would have less services, less people to manage the servers, less people to manage bugs or patches.” What is giving Asian customers pause, though, is the same concern being voiced elsewhere: that a company’s precious financial and customer data could be lost, stolen or even rendered temporarily inaccessible through no fault of its own. To many, the threat posed by hackers, possible government interference and even power failures justifies keeping their data housed on their own premises, in their own countries. As a result, cloud computing in Asia is taking off faster among small, more cost-sensitive start-ups than among larger companies. China’s big state-owned businesses, for example, tend not to trust third-party providers with their data. “The propensity to outsource in China is the lowest in the region,” said Philip Carter, a research director at IDC in Singapore. “It comes back time and time again in surveys to control and risk mitigation. They want to keep control of I.T. assets.” Adoption of cloud computing in China is also held back by regulation. Beijing, which also blocks Facebook, prohibits companies from storing their data offshore, meaning they can use data centers only inside China. As a result, IDC estimated, only about 4 percent of companies in China were using cloud-based services last year, compared with 16 percent in Singapore. But with about 40 million small and medium-size companies, the Chinese market holds enormous appeal for the providers of cloud computing services. NEC of Japan estimates the nascent Chinese market will grow 30 percent a year to reach around $2.3 billion by 2012. “The Chinese customers are more receptive to the whole way of doing business online,” said Enwei Xie, Microsoft’s general manager for software development business in China. “They’re sort of familiar with this whole host model.” As is typical in China, local companies like Kingdee and Ufida so far have dominated the market, crowding out international firms like NEC, SAP of Germany or Oracle of the United States. Poor bandwidth access, however, is keeping China from becoming a cloud hub. That limitation also applies to India, and followers of the industry say it is unlikely such services will be outsourced to either country anytime soon. And cloud computing providers are flocking to Hong Kong and Singapore. Even India’s Tata Communications is opening a data center in Singapore to offer cross-border cloud services. IDC estimates that 24 percent of all companies in Asia will use some form of cloud computing this year, up from 11 percent in 2009. Technically, Singapore is not the ideal location for data centers. Land is expensive and temperatures are high, meaning it costs more to keep servers cool. But cutting-edge telecommunications infrastructure, a pool of technology experts and generous government incentives more than compensate, executives said. Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have also picked Singapore as the center of their own regional cloud computing initiatives. “We didn’t set up a lab in Singapore because we wanted to do cloud computing,” said Christopher Whitney, managing director of a new lab Hewlett-Packard opened in the city-state in February, “but because we wanted to access its infrastructure and talent.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403EFD7153CF93AA35753C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=oraclecorporation">TALKING BUSINESS; A Double Standard At H.P.<date>Published: October 9, 2010</date><text>And so it came to pass that on the 55th day -- 55 days, that is, after firing its chief executive, Mark V.

His name is Léo Apotheker, a suave European -- how many American C.E.O.'s have an accent aigu in their name? -- who had spent most of his career at SAP, the giant German maker of business software. SAP has one primary competitor: Oracle, the very same company that hired Mr. Hurd barely a month after H.P. let him go, in a move clearly intended not only to bolster Oracle but to humiliate H.P. Oracle and H.P. had once been the closest of partners, with the latter selling the industrial-strength hardware that ran Oracle's industrial-strength software. But that partnership appears to be dissolving. Earlier this year, Oracle completed its purchase of Sun Microsystems, a move that meant that it would now be trying to sell its own hardware, instead of encouraging customers to buy H.P. computers. What's more, Larry Ellison, Oracle's flamboyant founder, had taken to sending e-mail to reporters mocking the ineptitude of the H.P. board. Is it possible that the hiring of Mr. Apotheker was motivated by the board's desire to strike back at Oracle? And that, with Mr. Apotheker on board, H.P. would try to encroach on Oracle's software stronghold just as Oracle was moving into H.P.'s hardware arena? There are analysts who are convinced that was the case. H.P., of course, was adamant that nothing could be further from the truth. ''Hiring him had nothing to do with fighting Oracle,'' said Ray Lane, the former Oracle (!) president who is set to become H.P.'s chairman next month. ''The board chose Léo because he was the best available athlete.'' There were other things about the appointment that seemed a bit odd. For instance, at the point at which the H.P. board hired him, Mr. Apotheker was unemployed. You see, his tenure at SAP had ended abruptly in February, when the company's executive board (as boards are called in Germany) declined to renew his contract. After being named co-C.E.O. in April 2008, he had just become sole C.E.O. in 2009 -- meaning that he had been flying solo for just seven months when he was shown the door. Maybe, as his defenders insisted, he was simply an unfortunate victim of the global recession. ''He got a raw deal,'' said Mr. Lane. But maybe, as I heard from others, his own missteps had contributed to his downfall. He had tried to raise prices aggressively for servicing SAP's complex software, which had resulted in a customer revolt. A critical new initiative, called Business ByDesign, had flopped. And he had managed to alienate the SAP work force. ''My communication towards you was not always optimal,'' he was quoted as saying in a memo SAP issued to its employees when he left. While I found some people who defended Mr. Apotheker's management style --''He's a tireless worker who gives everyone a second chance,'' said Andre Boisvert, a former top software executive -- I found just as many people who thought that Mr. Apotheker was likely to further traumatize the already demoralized H.P. staff. ''If you wanted to find someone who represented the diametrical opposite of the H.P. way, it is Léo,'' said Jason Maynard, a veteran technology analyst with Wells Fargo Securities. ''He is tough as nails and chews glass for breakfast.'' Still, having written two unflattering columns recently about the H.P. board, I was inclined to take a pass on Mr. Apotheker's hiring. But then I learned something about him that caused me to shake my head in disbelief. Next month, Oracle and SAP are scheduled to go to trial in a case involving the wholesale theft of Oracle's intellectual property by an SAP division. SAP has acknowledged its guilt; the only issue being litigated is the size of the damages. (Oracle is asking for $2 billion; SAP says it should have to pay only ''tens of millions'' of dollars.)

It takes your breath away, really: the same board that viewed Mr. Hurd’s minor expense account shenanigans as intolerable has chosen as its new C.E.O. someone involved — however tangentially — with the most serious business crime you can commit. If it were anybody besides the H.P. directors, the situation would be unbelievable. With these guys, though, it’s all too believable. • No company, not even H.P., is as obsessed with Oracle as SAP. And with good reason. Over the last half-dozen years, Oracle has made serious inroads into the German company’s core business of enterprise software, primarily by acquiring other software companies. In the mid-2000s, for instance, Oracle bought PeopleSoft, J. D. Edwards and Retek, all companies that compete with SAP in one niche or another. In fact, SAP had tried to buy Retek itself but had been outbid by Oracle. It wanted revenge.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/arts/design/24antiques.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Costumes From Serge Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes<date>Published: September 23, 2010</date><text> The ballet impresario Serge Diaghilev hired boldface names like Picasso, Matisse, Georges Braque and Coco Chanel to design his costumes. While traveling to several continents with the Ballets Russes, Diaghilev was mercurial and demanding, and his tastes in fabric patterns ranged from Russian folk art to Rococo curlicues and Art Deco sunbursts. The dancers’ outfits ended up stitched with tinsel and mica, trimmed in lace and fur and puffed out around metal and wicker frames. The company disbanded right after his death in 1929, and a few of his colleagues and fans stored away chunks of the costume collection until the 1960s. Sotheby’s in London then dispersed it in a series of sales. Diaghilev’s paperwork was also broken up over the years. “It was all very scattered,” said Jane Pritchard, a curator of “Diaghilev and the Golden Age of the Ballets Russes, 1909-1929,” which opens on Saturday at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The museum has reassembled about 60 outfits, many of them purchased decades ago at Sotheby’s auctions. The curators had to decide which ones would be strong enough to exhibit, and conservators have repaired rips and sweat damage, straightened bent flaps and reinforced shoulders for draping on mannequins. “It’s like the costumes had to audition for us, to see if they’d get in,” Ms. Pritchard said. Vintage footage of dancers streams in the galleries, and two stage drapes displayed measure up to 45 feet long: one shows a pair of Picasso semi-nudes on the run, and on the other, the Russian-born artist Natalia Goncharova laid out a tableau of gilded onion domes. The museum has also brought out ballerinas’ makeup tubes, castanets and satiny shoes, as well as paperwork that survived the Ballets Russes archival diaspora. The museum owns receipts for wigs and restaurant meals, and a 1924 contract letter from the dancer Vera Savina, one of at least two women who enraged Diaghilev by marrying one of his bisexual ex-boyfriends. The exhibition catalog discusses Diaghilev’s messy personal life and his professional “constant search for novelty” and need for cash. He sometimes resorted to a kind of elite pimping. To wrangle donations from Lord Rothermere, a newspaper magnate, Diaghilev threw parties while “fostering Rothermere’s close relationship with the dancer Alice Nikitina,” the historian Sarah Sonner writes in the catalog. Diaghilev invested some of his profits in costumes that turned out to be impractical. Chanel’s loose-fitting knit swimsuits were “potentially dangerous,” writes the dance historian Sarah Woodcock; a male dancer would have trouble keeping “a firm grip on his partner in the complex throws and catches.” Hoop skirts cut dancers’ shins and left them tottering during spins, and arched headdresses “slipped and were then impossible to adjust,” she writes. As the ballet company traipsed through 19 countries, from Monaco to Uruguay, she adds, “Excess baggage costs were a major drain.” Several other Ballets Russes studies have come out in the last few months. In addition to a gossipy Diaghilev biography from Oxford University Press by Sjeng Scheijen (an adviser to this show), the historian Mary E. Davis’s “Ballets Russes Style: Diaghilev’s Dancers and Paris Fashion” (Reaktion Books/University of Chicago Press) traces the costumes’ influence, from Paul Poiret’s 1910s harem pants and togas to Karl Lagerfeld’s 2009 collection with Russian models wearing Cossack boots. The Antique Collectors’ Club and Hatje Cantz have both released monographs about Goncharova, one of Diaghilev’s favorite designers. An architect’s daughter from a village south of Moscow, she helped invent a style of furiously crisscrossing lines called Rayism. In 1915 Diaghilev lured her to Paris, and then the Russian Revolution marooned her in the West. She based her Ballets Russes designs on flamenco dancers’ ruffles, Byzantine art and Russian Orthodox priestly robes and icons. The museum, in addition to hanging Goncharova’s huge stage backdrop, is showing her sketches of flowered peasant outfits, her costumes embroidered with sea creatures and a Cubist caricature of Diaghilev she drew. She abstracted his image into what looks like just an ear, a rotund belly and a sternly outstretched arm. BEHIND THE SCENES The buying and selling habits of Victorian collectors and dealers are now being exposed online. The Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art have sent about 1,500 pre-1920s auction catalogs for scanning through Jstor, a nonprofit digital archiving organization, and 100,000 searchable pages are now posted at a beta Web site, auctioncatalogs.jstor.org. Although the pages are rarely illustrated, they reveal the history of auctioneers’ hyperbole and collectors’ obsessiveness. Christie’s described consignors with phrases like “a Connoisseur Who has spared no Expense,” and a portrait for sale would be listed as “a Female sitting, overpowered with sleep and heat of a sultry Summer evening.” In 1804 Sotheby’s broke up a bankrupt merchant’s museum of oddities, and a single lot contained “Liquid Bitumen or Naptha, Alluminous Schistos, Iron Ores, Gallena, Bitumen in Fluor, Sulphat of Lime, Antimony, Stalactites and Various.” In the margins of the pages, saleroom observers occasionally scribbled prices, identified buyers and gave critiques of the art. “Sometimes it says, ‘Bad painting,’ or, ‘No way this is by Rembrandt,’ ” said Deborah Kempe, the Frick library’s chief of collections management. Jstor is now deciding how to expand the scanning scope and link to museum and library Web sites, and possibly the recent databases of auction houses. “We’ve pitched this to them as a product that could benefit them as well,” said Barbara Chin, an associate director at Jstor. FULLY FURNISHED Actors played servants and aristocrats, serving as tour guides, for three decades at Astors’ Beechwood, the Astor family’s stuccoed 1850s house on the Newport, R.I., oceanfront. This year the museum was sold for about $10 million and is being turned back into a private home. Skinner Inc. in Boston will auction part of its contents on Oct. 2. The house was full of “interesting Newport-ese furniture” in styles like Louis XVI and Empire, said Stuart Whitehurst, a vice president at Skinner. Estimates range from $100 for a set of filigree fireplace tools to $40,000 for a naval battle painting that Caroline and William Astor bought as newlyweds in the 1850s. Astor monograms are emblazoned on clear and ruby wine glasses ($500 to $1,500 a set) and a set of 13 oak dining chairs ($3,000 to $4,000). Rhode Island newspapers have reported, based on real estate records, that the new owner is Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle Corporation. His office and a lawyer and an accountant who worked on the transaction all declined to comment. Beechwood’s acting troupe has been renamed the Marley Bridges Theater Company and performs murder mysteries and holiday scenes at historic houses in the region. Its 2,000 handmade costumes represent characters “from the maids to the cooks to the footmen to the butlers,” said Patrick Grimes, the group’s artistic director.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/technology/22oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle Growth Plans Worry Rivals and Customers<date>Published: September 21, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Each year, Oracle’s presence looms over this city for a week, during the company’s Open World customer conference. About 41,000 people arrived this week to discuss business software in fine detail and talk over beers. Stretches of downtown streets closed and gave way to makeshift tents housing coffee stands, bars, Lego play areas and candy buffets.But Oracle’s annual takeover of San Francisco pales against its larger ambitions — to supply just about all the technology, software and hardware, that businesses might need. This sweeping agenda has rattled the nerves of customers, who fear that Oracle has its own best interests, not theirs, at heart. The worry is that instead of saving money, customers will end up paying more over the long term, and that Oracle, already known for its aggressive tactics, will use its strong position in software to gain even more leverage over a larger array of products. Companies have long used Oracle’s software to keep track of their most prized information. For Oracle, this resulted in sales of $26.8 billion last year and hints of an annual revenue goal of $100 billion. Over the last five years, Oracle has acquired a staggering 66 companies, most of which were software makers that provided expertise in niche areas. This year, it bought Sun Microsystems, a hardware maker, signaling its intention to dominate the data centers of businesses by controlling more of their technology purchases. It is a prospect that its traditional partners and, more important, its customers, find unnerving. “It’s freaking terrifying for some people,” said Jason Carey, a database software developer for a credit services company. Maureen Miller, who oversees technology infrastructure work for the National Science Foundation, put it this way: “We are becoming an all-Oracle shop, but not by choice. They bought every company we deal with. And we don’t tend to want to put all of our eggs in one basket.” Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, argued that the company’s new strategy would benefit customers. “If you want to go faster and you want a system that is more reliable, you have to be willing to spend less,” he said in his opening pitch at this week’s event, while extolling the virtues of linking hardware and software. But customers are skeptical, and pushing back. Oracle built its business by dominating the database market, providing the central repositories of crucial information that businesses must maintain and use to complete transactions. This has given it an unrivaled position of power when dealing with customers. Capitalizing on such an edge, Oracle’s sales representatives have earned a fearsome reputation as hard-line negotiators determined to squeeze customers. But through its acquisition spree, Oracle moved well beyond the database and into business software, buying up the important products that companies use to keep track of their technology infrastructure, employees, sales, inventory and customers. With Sun, Oracle has found a way to sell customers hardware bundled with all that software in a fashion similar to that of its main database rival, I.B.M. Oracle executives say they can build better, faster, cheaper products this way by engineering complete systems rather than requiring customers to cobble together the parts. It is akin to the Apple model of limiting choice and controlling the crucial pieces in a computer, as opposed to the PC model, where the Windows software from Microsoft can run on hundreds of different machines. Later this year, Oracle also plans to give select customers access to a product suite called Fusion. This arrives after five years of work and will unite many of the products Oracle has acquired into a single software platform — one that will combine functions found in rival products from companies like SAP, I.B.M., Microsoft and Salesforce.com. But customers are objecting to Oracle’s moves. For example, some of Sun’s largest former customers consist of the large Wall Street players, and they pushed back this year when Oracle moved to limit their choices around the Sun technology. Oracle ultimately gave in to their pleas, reaffirming deals that would let Hewlett-Packard and Dell offer prized Sun software on their hardware. “Customers will always gripe about giving too much control to any one company,” said Israel Hernandez, director of software research at Barclays Capital. Like it or not, many of the largest technology companies — H.P., I.B.M., Cisco Systems and Oracle — have made their data center conquest plans clear. Oracle now competes directly with its partners H.P. and Dell, as does Cisco, the networking specialist, through its move into computer servers. Meanwhile, H.P., once one of Cisco’s closest allies, has begun a major assault in the networking arena. “We will see more concentration because that’s where the marketing is going,” Mr. Hernandez said. At least Oracle has the courtesy to assuage customer’s nerves for one week through its Open World largess.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/technology/21hewlett.html?ref=oraclecorporation">H.P. and Hurd, Its Former Chief, Settle Lawsuit<date>Published: September 20, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — A fierce and public feud between Oracle and Hewlett-Packard, two of the world’s largest technology companies, has ended after all of two weeks.On Monday, the companies announced a settlement to a dispute that centered on Oracle’s hiring of Mark V. Hurd, the former chief executive of H.P., as a president. H.P. sued Mr. Hurd this month, claiming he would violate agreements to protect H.P.’s secrets by taking on such a high-level role at Oracle. The parties declined to reveal details about the settlement but said Mr. Hurd would protect H.P.’s confidential information. However, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, H.P. said it had modified its separation agreement with Mr. Hurd. He effectively waived about half the compensation owed him. Mr. Hurd agreed to give up his rights to the 330,177 performance-based restricted stock units granted to him on Jan. 17, 2008, and to the 15,853 time-based restricted stock units granted on Dec. 11, 2009. Although most legal analysts said H.P. had had little chance of winning its case, the lawsuit immediately strained the business relationship between the two companies. Oracle and H.P. have a long history of selling technology together. About 40 percent of Oracle’s business software runs on computing systems sold by H.P., and the companies have 140,000 customers in common. After the lawsuit was filed — 19 hours after Oracle hired Mr. Hurd — Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, warned that H.P.’s actions threatened to derail the companies’ longstanding partnership. The companies took pains on Monday to say that the business relationship was again on firm footing. “H.P. and Oracle have been important partners for more than 20 years and are committed to working together to provide exceptional products and service to our customers,” Cathie A. Lesjak, the chief financial officer and interim chief executive at H.P., said in a statement. “We look forward to collaborating with Oracle in the future.” Mr. Ellison said in his statement, “Oracle and H.P. will continue to build and expand a partnership that has already lasted for over 25 years.” “The partnership is clearly very important here,” said David M. Hilal, senior managing director at FBR Capital Markets. “It’s undoubtedly an effort to kiss and make up.” Mr. Hilal said Mr. Hurd would probably be prohibited from making decisions at Oracle that would allow him to use confidential information from H.P., like its acquisition plans. The relationship between the two companies began to fray after Mr. Hurd resigned from H.P. last month. In an e-mail to The New York Times, Mr. Ellison, a close friend of Mr. Hurd’s, lambasted H.P.’s board for the way it had handled the departure. Mr. Hurd left H.P. after the board investigated his relationship with a marketing contractor and found that her name had been left off expense report items and that Mr. Hurd had violated the company’s code of conduct. “In losing Mark Hurd, the H.P. board failed to act in the best interest of H.P.’s employees, shareholders, customers and partners,” Mr. Ellison wrote. This month, Oracle hired Mr. Hurd to succeed Charles E. Phillips Jr. as a president at the company. While the legal matter has been resolved, Oracle and H.P. will continue to have a more tense business relationship than in the past. Oracle’s acquisition this year of Sun Microsystems thrust it into the computer hardware business, one of H.P.’s strong suits. At the Oracle Open World customer event here this week, Oracle executives talked at length about their plans to conquer the hardware market. Mr. Ellison, in particular, made an impassioned pitch on Sunday evening, just minutes after Ann M. Livermore, an H.P. executive vice president in charge of enterprise computing, delivered a similar message to the audience. Oracle executives have voiced their interest in acquiring more hardware companies, and H.P. remains on the prowl, making some recent big-ticket purchases. H.P. has made three major acquisitions since Mr. Hurd left the company: 3Par, a computer storage company, for $2.35 billion; ArcSight, a computer security company, for $1.5 billion; and Stratavia, a privately held database and application automation company, for an undisclosed amount. H.P. also remains in the hunt for a new chief executive.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/technology/20cloud.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Cloud Computing Hits Snag in Europe<date>Published: September 19, 2010</date><text>BERLIN — In the world of ideas, cloud computing has the potential to revolutionize the way people work.By bundling the processing power of thousands of computer servers, a company, for example, could allow two employees from different countries who speak different languages to communicate directly by phone, using voice recognition software to process what is being said and translation programs to interpret it into another language. The result, ideally, would be a seamless conversation, without struggle and without the limitations of speaking a foreign language. “We’re not quite there yet, but it’s coming,” Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, a promoter of the technology, said at a gathering of cellphone industry executives after evoking the image at a convention in Barcelona in February. Such cloud-based breakthroughs face a formidable obstacle in Europe, however: strict privacy laws that place rigid limits on the movement of information beyond the borders of the 27-country European Union. European governments fear that personal information could fall prey to aggressive marketers and cybercriminals once it leaves the jurisdictions of individual members, a concern that may protect consumers but one that hinders the free flow of data essential to cloud computing “There are restrictions on cloud computing in Europe,” said Bob Lindsay, privacy director in Europe for Hewlett-Packard, which makes servers and other equipment for cloud data centers. “This isn’t killing the business, but it is slowing its evolution, compared with what is taking place in the United States.” Cloud computing, which allows companies to tap enormous computing power via the Internet without having to invest in the infrastructure themselves, has grown rapidly in the United States under a legal system that permits the sale and transfer of many forms of private data. For its clients, the lure of cloud computing is the savings made possible by cutting in-house corporate information technology departments and hardware and software purchases. According to the research firm Gartner, global sales of cloud services will rise 17 percent this year, to $68.3 billion from $58.6 billion in 2009. About half of what Gartner defines to be cloud services are, in fact, the computing power involved in the display and tracking of Internet ads. The rest is sales of computing services, mostly to large businesses. Global sales of cloud services are poised nearly to double by 2012, to $102.1 billion, Gartner estimates. But Europe is expected to remain a relatively modest user of cloud services, accounting for only $18 billion this year, or about 26 percent of the global total. By 2012, Gartner estimates, Europe’s proportion of global cloud sales will rise to 29 percent, even though the bloc’s economy is larger than that of the United States. Facing legal obstacles in Europe, the U.S. businesses with the greatest stake in cloud computing — primarily Microsoft, Google, H.P. and Oracle — are lobbying lawmakers to loosen restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Alternatively, some are developing new methods to make cloud computing work within Europe’s complicated legal landscape. At the H.P. Labs in Bristol, England, researchers are devising ways to encrypt data before it is sent into a cloud computing center and then decrypt it after it leaves the cloud, thus addressing the privacy concerns of many European governments. Another solution being studied is to give individuals the ability in advance to set the degree of privacy control on each part of their personal information in the cloud by digitally tagging bits of the data. Under this model, a person could make an e-mail address available to marketers, while shielding a phone number and street address from unwanted solicitations. In that aim, H.P. plans to begin testing new software that complies with European privacy laws this year. Called H.P. Privacy Advisor, the software will handle the transfer of data between H.P. offices within Europe as well as to those outside of the Union. “The benefits and impact of the cloud are so great, and the legislative and technical issues are what they are at the moment,” said Siani Pearson, one of H.P.’s lead researchers on cloud computing technologies at its laboratory in Bristol. “But we can make sure that the benefits of the cloud come even within the existing framework.” In Europe, the legal definition of what constitutes personal data is much broader than it is in the United States, extending to information like names, addresses and phone numbers in phone books. Another obstacle is the European Data Privacy Directive, the main body of European law governing international data transfers, which generally prohibits the movement of E.U. data outside the external borders of the European Union. The European Commission has approved only a handful of other countries to provide cloud computing services — the United States, Argentina and Canada. Israel and Andorra have applied for approval to be designated as computing centers.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/technology/17oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Net Income Rose 20% in Quarter for Oracle<date>Published: September 16, 2010</date><text>Fresh off a radical overhaul of its executive suite, Oracle told investors on Thursday that its house remained in order.Oracle posted better-than-expected results for its first quarter on the back of strong sales of new software products and higher maintenance and support revenue. Wall Street analysts praised the company for turning in such results for a quarter that closed at the end of August, traditionally one of the slowest selling periods. Oracle’s performance also provided a bright spot for the business computing sector, which has produced a mixed bag of results in recent weeks. “Obviously, we are extremely pleased with our first-quarter results,” said Safra A. Catz, a president of Oracle, speaking to analysts. Oracle reported net income of $1.4 billion, or 27 cents a share, up 20 percent from net income of $1.12 billion, or 22 cents a share, reported a year earlier. Excluding charges, Oracle earned 42 cents a share, 5 cents above the 37 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Revenue for Oracle, a maker of database software, rose 48 percent, to $7.5 billion for the quarter, up from $5.05 billion from a year earlier. Analysts had predicted revenue of $7.27 billion. Ms. Catz predicted that Oracle’s revenue for the second quarter would rise 42 to 47 percent over the period last year, when the company posted sales of $5.9 billion. Early this month, Oracle hired Hewlett-Packard’s former chief executive, Mark V. Hurd, as a president to work alongside Ms. Catz. Just as Mr. Hurd arrived, Charles E. Phillips Jr. resigned as a director and a president. The hiring of Mr. Hurd, who resigned from H.P. last month, has complicated the relationship between Oracle and H.P., its longtime partner. H.P. has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Hurd, saying he will be unable to perform his job at Oracle without disclosing privileged information about H.P. Mr. Hurd spoke to analysts for the first time since joining Oracle, complimenting the company’s performance. “I don’t believe there is any other company in the industry better positioned than Oracle,” Mr. Hurd said. The legal squabble underscores the changing relationships taking place as the world’s largest technology companies begin to step on each other’s toes. Historically, Oracle stuck to selling database and business software that would run on hardware from its various partners, including H.P. and Dell. But when Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems early this year, the company marched into the hardware market, selling computer servers and storage systems that compete directly with H.P., Dell, I.B.M. and others. Similarly, Cisco Systems, a networking specialist, has started selling computer servers and virtualization software, while H.P. has built up a large networking business to compete with Cisco. Never one to back down from a confrontation, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, threatened that H.P.’s lawsuit against Mr. Hurd could wreck the companies’ relationship. Meanwhile, H.P. remains a major sponsor for Oracle’s customer conference in San Francisco next week and one of its top executives is scheduled to speak at the event. Outside of this turmoil, Oracle continues to follow a multiyear strategy of acquiring business software makers large and small. The company hopes to become a one-stop shop of sorts, offering basic products needed to run a businesses as well as products tailored for specific markets like financial services, retailing and manufacturing. Oracle tends to purchase companies with loyal customers who pay regular maintenance fees for upgrades and other services. In so doing, it has built a fairly predictable revenue stream. The pace at which Oracle has acquired once independent software makers has alarmed some customers who fear the company is gaining too much control over their data centers and operations. During its first quarter, Oracle reported that new licenses to its products rose 25 percent, to $1.29 billion. Its maintenance and support revenue rose 12 percent, to $3.45 billion. Oracle posted about $1 billion in hardware sales as well. Mr. Ellison vowed to unveil a host of new products at Oracle’s event next week, including systems that create tight links between hardware and software. “We think that will make customers’ lives much easier,” he said. Shares of Oracle fell 1.5 percent during Thursday’s trading, to $25.36. After the release of its financial report, Oracle’s shares rose 4.3 percent, to $26.45, in after-hours trading.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/hurd-to-comment-on-oracle-move/?ref=oraclecorporation">Hurd to Comment on Oracle Move?<date>September 15, 2010, 5:39 am</date><text>The chief executive of Oracle, Larry Ellison, is expected to present his new co-president, the former C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard, Mark V.

Mr. Ellison, who hired Mr. Hurd after Mr. Hurd left H.P. under a cloud of scandal last month, could also detail what his old friend is expected to do at Oracle, as the company integrates its acquisition of hardware-maker Sun Microsystems, Reuters reported. Mr. Hurd himself also will get the first chance to talk directly to Oracle investors, despite H.P.’s attempts to block his move on the grounds that he will spill its trade secrets. “The odds are pretty good that Hurd will make some kind of comment on the call,” Richard Williams, an analyst at New Jersey-based Cross Research, who thinks the move for Hurd was a boost for Oracle, told Reuters.

Hurd, ousted Hewlett-Packard chief executive, and the resulting Silicon Valley fireworks — is entertainment. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Bill McDermott, co-chief executive of SAP, an Oracle rival, says his company is “staying true to its core” in software. But to Bill McDermott, the Oracle tempest — Mr. Hurd in, co-president Charles Phillips departs, H.P. sues — is opportunity knocking. Mr. McDermott is co-chief executive of SAP, an Oracle rival in both business applications and database software. “This is net-positive for us,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. The potential benefit to SAP, Mr. McDermott explains, is that Oracle’s executive-suite shuffling serves to underline the different paths the two companies are taking. In Mr. Hurd, Oracle is bringing in a top-shelf executive who knows computer hardware, both from his years at H.P. and at NCR before that. That strategic and operational know-how is crucial to Oracle, since it acquired Sun Microsystems earlier this year. Mr. McDermott called the Sun purchase “Oracle’s wild move into hardware.” By contrast, he said, SAP is “staying true to its core” in software. Still, SAP did make a big acquisition of its own in May, buying Sybase, a maker of databases and software for transporting cellphone data, for $5.25 billion. That move came a few months after Mr. McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, were named co-chief executives, in a shakeup of SAP’s top management. The software-only strategy, Mr. McDemott said, insures that SAP’s major corporate partners, which are also hardware makers, like I.B.M. and H.P., remain allies. “For Oracle, they are enemies now,” he said. SAP, according to Mr. McDermott, will focus primarily on three product lines. The first is business applications, its mainstay business of supplying the software companies use to manage their finances, customer accounts, manufacturing and procurement. The second is business intelligence software, which companies use to mine data for insights that can increase sales and cut costs. Its Business Objects subsidiary, acquired in 2007 for $6.78 billion, is a leader in business intelligence software. The third, Mr. McDermott says, is mobile applications for business. Sybase software is already widely used in transporting messages to and from smartphones, and SAP plans to invest heavily in the mobile business. The idea, he said, is to link workers with mobile devices — like smartphones and Apple iPads (SAP has already deployed 2,000 to its workers) — to all the back-end business operations software SAP makes. SAP will be demonstrating 15 such real-time business applications at an industry conference next week. And, Mr. McDermott said, SAP will also be releasing software tools for third-party developers to make their own SAP mobile applications. “What Apple has done in the consumer space, we’ll do in business applications,” he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/technology/08hewlett.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Hewlett-Packard Sues Hurd After Move to Oracle<date>Published: September 7, 2010</date><text>Hewlett-Packard’s tumultuous breakup with its former chief executive Mark V. Hurd may soon warrant its own reality TV show.The latest installment arrived on Tuesday, as H.P. filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara against Mr. Hurd. The suit accused Mr. Hurd of violating his severance agreement to protect H.P.’s confidential information by taking a job as co-president of Oracle, an H.P. rival and partner. H.P. filed its complaint less than a day after Mr. Hurd joined Oracle and gained a seat on the board. “In his new positions, Hurd will be in a situation in which he cannot perform his duties for Oracle without necessarily using and disclosing H.P.’s trade secrets and confidential information to others,” H.P. said in its lawsuit. Representatives of Mr. Hurd declined to comment. But Oracle had some well chosen words. “By filing this vindictive lawsuit against Oracle and Mark Hurd, the H.P. board is acting with utter disregard for that partnership, our joint customers, and their own shareholders and employees,” Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, said in a statement. “The H.P. board is making it virtually impossible for Oracle and H.P. to continue to cooperate and work together in the I.T. marketplace.” Historically, H.P. and Oracle have been among the closest partners in Silicon Valley. H.P. sells billions of dollars a year of servers that run Oracle’s database software. Lawyers said that California law did not appear to favor H.P. in the case against Mr. Hurd. He does not have a noncompete agreement with H.P., the company said, and in any event, California shies away from noncompete agreements. And so H.P. is left with pursuing trade secret disclosure claims against him. “H.P. is taking the position that there is going to be the inevitable disclosure of secrets by virtue of the position that Mark Hurd has at Oracle,” said Larry C. Drapkin, a partner at Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp, who handles trade secret cases. “The difficulty here is that California has not embraced the so-called inevitable disclosure doctrine,” he said, meaning that the state courts would be hesitant to rule on whether Mr. Hurd was likely to disclose trade secrets. Mr. Drapkin said that H.P. might be using the lawsuit to send a signal to Mr. Hurd, saying it was watching him closely. Mr. Hurd resigned from H.P. a month ago, after the company’s board grew concerned about his relationship with Jodie Fisher, a marketing contractor who had worked at events with important customers. Ms. Fisher, a 50-year-old former actress in racy films who also posed for Playboy when she was in college, accused Mr. Hurd of sexual harassment in a complaint sent to H.P. The company’s investigation into the complaint revealed no evidence of sexual harassment but raised questions about Mr. Hurd’s judgment, according to H.P. Mr. Hurd authorized large payments to Ms. Fisher, who had limited marketing experience, and her name was omitted from expense report filings covering meals the two had together. Relations among Mr. Hurd, H.P. and Oracle have declined rapidly. In the weeks after his resignation, Mr. Hurd and H.P. have engaged in a feud over the situation through proxies. Mr. Ellison joined in the dispute early on, offering his support for Mr. Hurd and criticism of H.P.’s board last month in an e-mail message to The New York Times. Mr. Ellison chided H.P.’s board for making “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.” On Monday, Mr. Hurd joined Safra A. Catz as a co-president of Oracle, while Charles E. Phillips Jr. resigned as co-president and a member of Oracle’s board. Oracle recently acquired Sun Microsystems, a longtime rival to H.P. in the hardware market, setting the stage for a more complicated relationship. Mr. Hurd’s hiring has just upped the ante, industry experts said. “Clearly, Larry Ellison has his eyes on some of H.P.’s business now,” said William W. George, a professor of management practices at the Harvard Business School. “This often happens in high-tech as companies look to expand their horizons.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/business/08views.html?ref=oraclecorporation">By Hiring Hurd, Oracle Gets Better View of Its Rival H.P.<date>Published: September 7, 2010</date><text>Lawrence Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, has begun another phase of his battle with Silicon Valley. Mr. Ellison, an admirer of Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese general credited with writing “The Art of War,” mocked the board of his rival Hewlett-Packard when it forced out Mark Hurd as chief executive last month. By now hiring Mr. Hurd, Mr. Ellison has backed up his words. He not only gains a well-regarded operations guru, he follows Sun’s dictum: “Know your enemy.”Mr. Hurd should slot in nicely as a lieutenant. He will serve as co-president alongside Safra Catz, an Oracle veteran who will continue to manage legal affairs, finance and acquisitions. Sales, marketing and client support will be Mr. Hurd’s bailiwick. Mr. Ellison will still chart the ship’s course. This division of power would seem to invite executive infighting, but should nevertheless work for Oracle. It has been in place for years already, as Mr. Hurd will fill the role of the departing Charles Phillips. Mr. Ellison is sometimes bored by day-to-day operations and prefers to focus on the broad technology landscape. Moreover, the persistent critique of Mr. Hurd is that he lacks strategic vision. His new position should allow his operational strengths to shine. The former H.P. boss is perhaps best known for cost-cutting after acquisitions. Before he was pushed out at H.P., he increased operating margins from 4 percent in 2005 to about 9 percent in the year ending October 2009. Investors like the prospects, and sent Oracle shares up almost 6 percent on Tuesday. Oracle is also a serial acquirer, making some 60 acquisitions over the last five years, according to Thomson Reuters. That’s about 20 more than H.P. made over the same period. Moreover, Oracle is still digesting the purchase of Sun Microsystems. Mr. Hurd’s experience running NCR and H.P. — two companies that produce both software and hardware — should enable him to make contributions right away. Mr. Hurd’s past may be his most valuable attribute as the new lawsuit filed by H.P. over his new job attests. Oracle and H.P. are now in heated competition in areas from business software to servers. Inside knowledge of H.P., even assuming Mr. Hurd shares no concrete confidential information, could prove invaluable to Oracle. Mr. Ellison is showing himself a shrewd disciple of the art of war. American Barclays? Robert Diamond’s promotion to chief executive of Barclays is no surprise. Mr. Diamond, the driving force behind Barclays Capital, the British lender’s investment-banking arm, was a candidate for the top job in 2004. And Barclays Capital’s rise since then — it contributed over 80 percent of the group’s pretax profit in the first half of 2010 — made him a shoo-in. The bigger question is what the decision means for Barclays’s future structure. The British banking commission, due to report next year, is examining whether to demand that lenders separate their retail and wholesale arms. Superficially, Mr. Diamond’s promotion doesn’t change things. He has promised to continue the universal banking strategy set by his predecessor, John Varley. He will return to London from Barclays Capital’s base in New York, where he moved after the acquisition of the United States operations of Lehman Brothers. The bank’s stated aspiration to limit Barclays Capital’s profit to a third of the group total has yet to be abandoned. But putting Mr. Diamond, a high-earning American, in charge could change how Barclays reacts to demands for structural change. Even if the commission stops short of splitting investment banks from retail lenders, Mr. Diamond’s trans-Atlantic perspective and association with Barclays’s top money-making unit might make him less inclined to compromise. The United States might even look like a more hospitable home. The regulatory shake-up has stopped short of enforcing a retail investment banking split, and it has not made much progress with a balance sheet tax, in marked contrast to Britain, where Barclays could be liable for several hundred million pounds a year. So it’s not impossible that Mr. Diamond could one day make a shareholder-friendly argument that Barclays would be better off based in the United States. Such a move might require Barclays to spin off its British retail banking arm, but that is something Mr. Diamond might be more willing to contemplate than his predecessor was. It’s also something for the British banking commission to think about as it deliberates in coming months.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/technology/07oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Mark Hurd Joins Oracle as Co-President<date>Published: September 6, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — In naming Mark V. Hurd, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, as Oracle’s new co-president, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive and largest shareholder, has put his money where his controversial mouth is.Late on Monday, Oracle announced that Mr. Hurd had joined the company as a president and a director. Mr. Hurd resigned from H.P. one month ago, after an investigation by the board into a personal relationship with a contractor turned up questionable expense reports. Mr. Ellison, a personal friend of Mr. Hurd’s, criticized H.P.’s board last month in an e-mail message to The New York Times, saying it was “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.” Now, Oracle intends to capitalize on H.P.’s mistake, Mr. Ellison said. “Mark did a brilliant job at H.P., and I expect he’ll do even better at Oracle,” Mr. Ellison said in the statement. “There is no executive in the I.T. world with more relevant experience than Mark.” Oracle already had a crowded management suite, with Charles E. Phillips Jr. and Safra A. Catz serving as co-presidents under Mr. Ellison. Mr. Phillips, however, has resigned and given up his seat on the board, making room for Mr. Hurd. In his statement, Mr. Ellison said that Mr. Phillips had asked to leave the company in December. “We will miss his talent and leadership, but I respect his decision,” Mr. Ellison said. This year, Mr. Phillips acknowledged having an affair after a woman he had been seeing put up a Web site and billboards detailing his extramarital relationship. Oracle’s decision to hire Mr. Hurd presents Silicon Valley with a true soap opera, filled with fierce business dealings and saucy relationships. H.P. has long been one of Oracle’s largest partners in the business computing market. H.P. sells the computer servers and storage systems that customers use to run Oracle’s database software. But Oracle has just acquired Sun Microsystems, one of H.P.’s longtime rivals in the hardware market. Mr. Hurd will bring his expertise running the largest computer hardware business on the planet to Oracle, where he may be able to revive the fortunes of Sun’s products at H.P.’s expense. Oracle has, in particular, used Sun’s technology to build a new line of data warehousing systems that can sort through huge volumes of information like sales trends, pricing and inventory levels. Before joining H.P. as its chief executive in 2005, Mr. Hurd was chief executive of NCR, which had the leading data warehousing technology. Mr. Hurd also oversaw a number of large acquisitions at H.P., so he should feel right at home at Oracle, one of the most active buyers of companies in the technology industry. “As Oracle continues to grow we need people experienced in operating a $100 billion business,” Ms. Catz said in a statement. Oracle’s main database rival is I.B.M., which, like H.P., sells more than $100 billion in equipment and services a year. Mr. Hurd arrived in Silicon Valley five years ago, seeking to prove himself as a chief executive on the biggest stage. He succeeded in that respect by pushing H.P. past I.B.M. as the largest technology company and turning in some of the most consistent financial results in the industry. But Mr. Hurd’s time at the top came crashing down after H.P.’s board began investigating sexual harassment claims presented by Jodie Fisher, a former contractor. The company discovered that Mr. Hurd authorized paying Ms. Fisher, a 50-year-old former actress in sexually charged films who had also posed for Playboy in college, to attend gatherings with H.P.’s top customers. H.P. found no evidence of sexual harassment, but said Mr. Hurd had tried to conceal a personal relationship with Ms. Fisher by removing her name from his expenses for meals. Mr. Hurd settled with Ms. Fisher for an undisclosed sum and fought H.P.’s decision to make the sexual harassment claims public. The senior ranks of Oracle, run by Mr. Ellison since he founded it 30 years ago, are anything but stable. Well-regarded executives like Ray Lane, now a managing partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, and Marc Benioff, now the chief executive of Salesforce.com, have left high-ranking positions at Oracle. Their departures were often portrayed as a response to Mr. Ellison’s well-entrenched position as chief executive and his personality. Ms. Catz will continue to oversee Oracle’s finance, legal and merger and acquisition operations, while Mr. Ellison will oversee engineering. Mr. Hurd will manage sales, marketing and software support. In a statement, Mr. Hurd said he looked forward to tackling Oracle’s rivals: “I’m excited to be a part of the most innovative technology team in the I.T. industry.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/business/06hurd.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Mark Hurd, Former H.P. Chief, May Move to Oracle<date>Published: September 5, 2010</date><text>Mark V. Hurd, who was forced to resign as Hewlett-Packard’s top executive last month after an investigation into a sexual harassment charge found that he had manipulated his expenses, is in talks with Oracle about a top executive position there, according to a person briefed on the matter.Mr. Hurd, who is close to Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s founder and chief executive, was not expected to replace him, though it was uncertain what any role at Oracle might be. Mr. Hurd and Oracle are close to reaching an agreement, but no deal has been completed, said the person briefed on the talks, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were supposed to remain confidential. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Hurd declined to comment. For Mr. Hurd, 53, landing a top role at Oracle would be a quick rebound after his tumultuous exit from H.P. in early August. Mr. Hurd was forced out by the board after he settled charges of sexual harassment brought by Jodie Fisher, a 50-year-old actress who worked as a marketing consultant for the company. Both Mr. Hurd and Ms. Fisher denied having a sexual relationship, and an H.P. investigation failed to find any evidence of sexual misconduct by Mr. Hurd. But the company has said that Mr. Hurd’s resignation was a result of a break in trust caused by his falsifying expense reports possibly to conceal the relationship. Shortly after Mr. Hurd was forced out, Mr. Ellison made an unusual and passionate defense of him. In an e-mail to The New York Times, Mr. Ellison called the H.P. board’s action “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.” The talks between Mr. Hurd and Oracle were first reported on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. Oracle, which Mr. Ellison founded 30 years ago, is the world’s largest database software maker; Mr. Ellison has been its only chief executive. For years, the company has been a close partner with H.P., which sells computing systems and services to corporations. But since Oracle’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems, in a deal that closed early this year, Oracle and H.P. have become competitors in the market for computer hardware. The purchase of Sun caught a number of Oracle’s investors off guard, since the company had avoided the hardware market in the past. At H.P., Mr. Hurd helped steer mammoth computer server, storage and services businesses. Such expertise could come in handy as Oracle continues to try to digest Sun. In particular, Mr. Hurd built a reputation as a cost-cutting whiz and could apply those skills to bringing the Sun business in line. Sun also has a number of large campuses and an extensive research and development operation. At H.P., Mr. Hurd pared back such expenses. While running the company, Mr. Hurd passed on trying to acquire Sun, leaving Oracle and I.B.M. to bid for it. Mr. Ellison remains heavily involved in Oracle, but the day-to-day operations are largely overseen by two presidents, Safra A. Catz and Charles E. Phillips Jr. It was unclear how Mr. Hurd would fit into the existing, crowded triumvirate. Mr. Hurd took over the top job at H.P. in 2005, succeeding Carly Fiorina, who had been unable to increase profitability after the company’s $19 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002. His tenure was widely seen as a success. Mr. Hurd brought tight fiscal discipline to the computer giant and turned it into one of the most reliable performers in the technology sector. During his tenure, H.P. surpassed I.B.M. as the No. 1 technology company, as revenue increased to $115 billion a year, from $80 billion.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/technology/30oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle Takes Open-Source Software Fight to Google<date>Published: August 29, 2010</date><text>Free open-source software began with high-technology tinkerers and researchers. Sharing code and ideas was their priority, not profits. In the tech industry, they were sometimes compared to socialists and communists.Those days are long gone. Some of the communal idealism remains, but as open-source software is used more by big technology companies including I.B.M., Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, Google and Apple — even Microsoft — it has also become a weapon in corporate warfare. An unusually public salvo came this month, when Oracle sued Google, accusing it of copyright and patent infringement. Oracle claims that Google’s Android operating system for smartphones and other mobile devices is illegally using ideas and code from Java, a set of software tools initially developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Oracle bought Sun in January, Google denies the charges against Android, which is also open-source software, saying that it built the operating system and its own Java tools without using Sun’s intellectual property. Google instead sees the suit as a move by Oracle to re-establish corporate control of Java, something that Sun’s executives were reluctant to do. “This action is not against Android per se but against any Java development not sanctioned by Oracle,” said Kent Walker, general counsel of Google. “The lawsuit is trying to put the genie back in the bottle.” With open-source software, programmers can view the underlying source code and make modifications and fix bugs, as long as they abide by certain rules. Open-source programs are typically distributed free. An estimated three-quarters of all open-source software is chugging away in service of the profit-seeking corporate world. It is used, in the form of the Linux operating system or the Apache Web server, to run data centers that power the Web. Every company deploys open source differently as a tool to cut costs or as a weapon to gain an advantage over rivals. The corporate battles are fought with software programmers who contribute to open-source programs, in the marketplace with sales campaigns and in standards bodies that govern open-source projects. The Oracle-Google clash is the exceptional case that ended up in court. Their confrontation, according to Douglas Lea, a computer scientist at the State University of New York at Oswego, is a new front in what he calls “the open-source proxy wars,” in which big companies use open source to gain an upper hand in the commercial marketplace. “It’s not so much good companies and bad companies in this kind of situation,” said Mr. Lea, a member of the executive committee of the Java Community Process, a group that defines Java features and standards. “These companies compete viciously and have different interests. And in this case, you have two corporations that champion different forms of open source.” The roots of the Oracle suit go back well before Oracle acquired Sun. After Sun made Java open source in 2006 to broaden its adoption, its strategy was to let developers and companies freely use the Java technology deployed in data centers. Google was a major participant in contributing features and shaping standards for this so-called big Java in the Java Community Process, where Sun (now Oracle) retains the status of first among equals. But Sun decided it would make money in the fast-growing field of cellphones with a set of software tools tailored for that market, called Java Micro Edition. This “small Java” is free for most developers, but Sun negotiates commercial licenses for big companies that want to make their own products. Licensees include Nokia, Research In Motion, Motorola, LG, Samsung, Vodafone and T-Mobile. These licenses are individually negotiated, typically involve payments of tens of millions of dollars a year, and allow companies to modify code and not make those changes public, said a lawyer involved in rounds of these negotiations, who asked not to be named because the contracts were private. Google took a different course in the cellphone business. In 2007, it founded the Open Handset Alliance and was joined by several cellphone makers and telecommunications companies. Its Android software is open source, under a different licensing model, and outside Oracle’s control. “The dispute between Oracle and Google is really about control — Google’s ability to control the evolution of the Android technology,” said John Rizzo, vice president for technology strategy for the Aplix Corporation, which makes Java-based software tools. Aplix is a member of both the Open Handset Alliance and the Java Community Process. Still, Google and Sun held talks over the last three years about reaching an agreement, but they made little progress. Sun prepared the basis of the lawsuit that Oracle eventually filed, and identified the seven patents that Oracle accuses Google of infringing, said a former Sun manager, who asked not to be identified because of the suit. Sun eventually chose not to sue Google, the former Sun manager said, because it decided a patent lawsuit would undercut the company’s open-source efforts under Jonathan Schwartz, Sun’s chief executive who resigned in February after the Oracle acquisition. In 2005, Sun released an open-source version of its Solaris operating system, which is used in data centers. Software patents are controversial, especially among open-source developers. If Sun filed a patent suit, the former manager said, Mr. Schwartz feared the move would alienate many open-source enthusiasts and potential customers, from Silicon Valley start-ups to governments around the world that are pursuing open-source initiatives. The legal preparations were led by Noreen Krall, Sun’s former chief intellectual property counsel. Ms. Krall joined Apple this year as its senior director for intellectual property law and litigation. In March, Apple sued the cellphone maker HTC, saying its Android-based phone infringed on patents for Apple’s iPhone. Google was not sued, but Google issued a statement saying “we stand behind” the Android operating system and its industry partners. With its purchase of Sun, “Oracle acquired a lawsuit it could bring,” said Eben Moglen, a law professor at Columbia who advises on free and open-source software projects. And Oracle’s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, Professor Moglen added, is “taking advantage of this asset at a time when others are interested in fighting Android.” Mr. Ellison is a close friend of Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. Oracle is mainly a traditional commercial software company, making its money selling software licenses. Oracle supports Linux, but as a way to reduce the total hardware and software costs to customers using its database software, the company’s profit-making jewel. Oracle is pulling back from OpenSolaris. For its part, Google is not in the traditional software business. Its model mimics broadcast television — its services (including software) are free, and it makes money on advertising. The noncombatants — open-source developers — are hoping for an armistice between Oracle and Google, or at least a swift resolution to remove the uncertainty. “It’s really hard to predict the consequences of big companies being nasty to each other,” said Mr. Lea, the university computer scientist.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/technology/10hewlett.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle Chief Faults H.P. Board for Forcing Hurd’s Resignation<date>Published: August 9, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, denounced Hewlett-Packard’s directors on Monday for forcing the resignation of the H.P. chief executive, Mark V. Hurd, who is a friend of Mr. Ellison’s. Mr. Hurd stepped down Friday after a sexual harassment inquiry found that he had filed inaccurate expense reports. In an impassioned e-mail sent to The New York Times, Mr. Ellison chided H.P.’s board for what he said was a grave mistake. “The H.P. board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “That decision nearly destroyed Apple and would have if Steve hadn’t come back and saved them.” Oracle, the world’s largest database software maker, has been a close partner of H.P., which sells large computing systems to corporations. Since its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, completed early this year, Oracle has become a major rival to H.P. in the computing hardware market. Mr. Ellison and Mr. Hurd, meanwhile, have been close personal friends. Both are avid tennis players, and Mr. Hurd often plays at Mr. Ellison’s house in Silicon Valley. Mr. Ellison’s attack on the H.P. board focused on questions of corporate governance. “In losing Mark Hurd, the H.P. board failed to act in the best interest of H.P.’s employees, shareholders, customers and partners,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “The H.P. board admits that it fully investigated the sexual harassment claims against Mark and found them to be utterly false.” Earlier this year, Oracle’s president, Charles Phillips, admitted to an eight-year relationship with a woman other than his wife. Mr. Phillips continues in the job. A prominent executive in Silicon Valley, Mr. Ellison has long dealt with executives at H.P. and some of its directors, although he is not on the board. By his account, a debate erupted among H.P. directors over whether the company needed to disclose the sexual harassment claim. According to Mr. Ellison, the board was split 6 to 4 in preliminary discussions over the disclosure issue, and later decided to make the decision unanimous. He declined to comment on the source of his information. An H.P. spokesman declined on Monday to address whether a vote on disclosure had taken place, saying only that the vote seeking Mr. Hurd’s resignation was unanimous. A person with direct knowledge of negotiations between Mr. Hurd and the board of H.P. has said that the disclosure issue stood as the main point of contention in the period leading up to Mr. Hurd’s ouster last week. Once the board decided to go ahead with the disclosure, this person said, the relationship with Mr. Hurd turned more antagonistic and the parties agreed on the resignation as the way to move forward. APCO, a public relations firm advising H.P.’s board, told directors that H.P. would face a public relations firestorm if the accusations of sexual harassment were made public, this person said. People close to Mr. Hurd said that he had failed to understand why the board needed to disclose the investigation after the inquiry found the claim baseless. The H.P. investigation failed to turn up evidence of sexual misconduct by Mr. Hurd, and both he and Jodie Fisher, a 50-year-old actress whom H.P. had hired to work at marketing events, have denied having a romantic relationship. Ms. Fisher has since settled the matter with Mr. Hurd for an undisclosed sum. H.P. has said that Mr. Hurd’s resignation was the result of a break in trust caused by his falsifying expense reports to conceal the relationship.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/technology/30oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Justice Joins Suit Accusing Oracle of Fraud<date>Published: July 29, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — The Justice Department has joined a whistle-blower in accusing Oracle, the business software giant, of defrauding the federal government by overcharging for software. In a civil suit filed in federal court on Thursday, the Justice Department said that Oracle had failed to give the government the same discounts on software that it provided to commercial customers. A contract in place with Oracle from 1998 to 2006 required that Oracle notify the government of fluctuations in the price of its products and to match discounts made to commercial clients, according to the complaint. The software in question was valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, the Justice Department said. “We take seriously allegations that a government contractor has dealt dishonestly with the United States,” Tony West, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil division, said in a statement. Oracle declined to comment, a spokeswoman said. Paul Frascella, a former Oracle employee, acted as a whistle-blower in May 2007 by lodging his own complaint against Oracle on similar grounds. In April, the government provided notice that it would look into the matter. Now it has joined Mr. Frascella’s complaint. Oracle’s internal communications, printed in the government’s 44-page complaint, show Oracle employees haggling about the structure of certain software deals and how discounts they give to commercial customers might affect policies tied to government contracts. According to the complaint, Oracle sold $1.08 billion of software under the contract in question to a wide range of government agencies, including the Defense, Education and Justice Departments and the military. Over the years, Oracle has built a reputation as a hard-line negotiator with customers. “Its reputation is that it charges too much,” said Jonathan Eunice, a technology analyst at Illuminata. “But that’s mostly true of all the big software sellers.” Oracle remains the dominant player in the market for database software used to store critical information. It also competes in the broader market for business software, primarily against I.B.M., Microsoft and SAP. Many customers have complained to Oracle and SAP in recent years about the high fees charged for maintenance contracts lasting a number of years. “Increasingly, people feel like they have already bought the software and its capabilities and yet they have to continue shelling out a significant amount of money,” Mr. Eunice said. The charges against Oracle were filed under the False Claims Act. The government could receive up to three times the damages it incurred and will pursue the case through the civil division and the United States attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/technology/19iht-eusoftwar19.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Technology Rivals Lobby to Break Microsoft’s Hold<date>Published: July 18, 2010</date><text>BERLIN — A European plan to advise governments on software purchases has set off a lobbying battle this summer between the U.S. software giant Microsoft and its rivals Google, I.B.M., Red Hat and Oracle over a set of guidelines that could redefine the competitive landscape for proprietary and open-source software. The focus is a document called the European Interoperability Framework, a recommendation by the European Commission that national, provincial and local governments in the 27-nation European Union will consult when buying software. Open-source software advocates including Google, International Business Machine, Oracle and Red Hat, through a lobbying group, are pushing for a strong endorsement of open-source platforms in the document. The outcome of the debate has the potential to erode Microsoft’s significant public-sector market lead in Europe by encouraging governments to buy open-source software, which currently runs a tiny fraction of government systems. More broadly, the guidelines may influence whether more software in Europe and elsewhere becomes interoperable through the promotion of open standards, or whether it remains a patchwork of private, competing systems that requires a large organization to choose a supplier and stick with it. The commission is planning to release its recommendation by the end of this year. European governments will spend $15.7 billion on software this year, 19 percent of all software that is purchased on the Continent, according to International Data Corp. “Europe has the opportunity to become a world leader on this issue,” said Tom Rabon, an executive vice president for corporate affairs at Red Hat, which is based in North Carolina. The company sells open-source software to businesses and governments, including the city of Rotterdam, the Italian Justice Ministry and the French Education Ministry. “If they don’t take this opportunity, then Europe will become a follower,” he said. Microsoft, which was required to license the confidential interoperability codes for its server software to competitors after losing a 10-year European antitrust suit, is opposing a blanket endorsement of open-source software in the E.U. document, saying it would limit choice because it could discourage public-sector clients from buying proprietary software. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, still makes at least half of its revenue from its proprietary Windows operating system for computers and servers and from its Office desktop application suite, according to its most recent financial report. “Interoperability is a big issue. It is something that could potentially unseat the status quo,” said Jan Duffy, a research director at International Data in London. “It is fair to say that a majority of the countries in Europe are beginning to explore open-source alternatives in the public sector as they look to potential cost savings.” John Vassallo, a Microsoft vice president for E.U. legal and corporate affairs in Brussels, said Microsoft had taken significant steps after its European antitrust settlement to incorporate open-source products in its lineup. It has licensed thousands of pages of protocols for its server software, set up joint interoperability labs with two competitors, Sun and Novell, and started projects like Simple Cloud API, a joint effort with I.B.M. to develop common ways of storing documents and files in cloud computing. “We are clearly in favor of a mix and having the choice of any software, open or mixed, whatever suits governments,” Mr. Vassallo said. “It’s not putting a particular preference in front of the buyers that will solve the issue of working across borders. It is the opposite, having more choice — then more technical solutions and innovation will be available.” Google, I.B.M. and Oracle, which in January bought the open-source software pioneer Sun Microsystems, are the main supporters of Open Forum Europe, a group based in Brussels that has been lobbying for an explicit endorsement of open-source software. Graham Taylor, the Open Forum Europe chief executive, says more than 90 percent of European governments end up buying proprietary software products because of inertia, lack of knowledge about open-source alternatives or the fear of switching to a new supplier. Lobbying by Microsoft and other European companies that make proprietary software, like Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent, has also been formidable, Mr. Taylor said. Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent sell proprietary software to governments to, among other things, help run their internal agency telecommunication systems. About 50 companies, groups and individuals submitted comments to the commission on both sides of the issue. “We are up against a very big, powerful lobby,” Mr. Taylor said. “The makers of proprietary software are protecting the standards that are already in existence. They are also, of course, trying to preserve their market positions.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7D61E31F936A35754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=oraclecorporation">BITS; So Much For Sun Chips<date>Published: July 5, 2010</date><text>It's tales like these that really make me miss Sun Microsystems. Before being swallowed by Oracle, Sun had plotted its most daring chip project to date. The company intended to take on Intel by building its own variant of Intel's chips for servers. The Sun chip would have been a no-frills, low-power version of Intel's products aimed at companies like Facebook, Yahoo and Google that need thousands of servers to display Web pages. I've long heard rumors of such a product, but a pair of people with knowledge of Sun's plans recently confirmed its existence during interviews. Oracle, according to these people who are not authorized to speak publicly, has no plans to produce this x86 Intel chip clone. Sun's future UltraSPARC chip met the same fate at Oracle even though it was once regarded as one of Sun's most important projects. Oracle declined to comment on the Sun chip. Sun stood out because it so often oscillated between lovable bravado and insanity. It's hard to think of another big-time technology shop that would be willing to rumble with Intel in the x86 chip market. For one, it costs a ton of money to design chips. Second, just about every company that has tried to carve out an x86 niche has failed. (The most spectacular flameout being Transmeta, which went after laptops with a low-power chip.) And then, even if you succeed in getting a good product out, your reward is a constant war against Intel. Sun, according to the people with inside information, thought it could give Intel a run in one of the fastest growing parts of the server market. It bought the assets of a start-up called Montalvo Systems, which had worked on low-power clones of Intel's chips. In addition, Sun hired some top talent away from Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's main rival. Ultimately, Sun hoped to create a low-power x86 chip that would save big Web companies money and energy. SeaMicro, a start-up that just came out of stealth mode, has done something similar by building servers around Intel's low-power Atom chip and then adding its own networking special sauce to create a specialized Web server. In addition, Dell has been using laptop chips from Via in its servers aimed at big Web houses. So why would Sun bother doing something custom when these off-the-shelf options exist? Well, it goes back to that bravado/insanity mix. Sure, it would be insanely hard and most likely a losing cause to make an x86 chip, but Sun hated being controlled by Intel or any other supplier. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/i-b-m-s-bet-on-smart-plumbing-for-businesses/?ref=oraclecorporation">I.B.M.'s Bet on 'Smart Plumbing' for Businesses<date>May 24, 2010, 5:43 pm</date><text>Earlier this month, I.B.M. executives told investors that the company planned to double its spending on acquisitions over the next five years, to $20 billion. The company made its first move on Monday, saying it had agreed to purchase Sterling Commerce, a unit of AT&amp;T, for $1.4 billion in cash. Sterling Commerce makes specialized software that handles the automated exchange of documents and transactions among companies. In the Internet bubble days of 2000, Sterling was seen as a hot business-to-business property, when it was expected that B2B dealings would shift to online commercial marketplaces, much like stock exchanges. (SBC, which acquired AT&amp;T’s name as well as the company in 2005, paid $3.9 billion for Sterling in 2000.) The vision today is different, but I.B.M. is betting that online transactions among businesses will be a big deal. Such transactions with suppliers and partners are projected to triple by 2013, Craig Hayman, general manager of I.B.M.’s Websphere software business, said in an interview. Sterling essentially makes smart plumbing technology for businesses. And I.B.M.’s acquisition strategy seems to be focused mainly around software companies that add to that capability. I.B.M.’s larger software purchases over the last couple of years — like Cognos, Ilog and SPSS — have been focused on business intelligence and analytics. Sterling Commerce adds back-end ballast to that portfolio of clever software. “We want to deliver business insight to the interactions flowing over a company’s network of business partners,” Mr. Hayman said. There is no indication that I.B.M.’s buying spree will take it up the software stack toward business applications — standardized software for finance, procurement, manufacturing and other tasks — to compete head-on with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft in that market. I.B.M. pulled back from the business applications market in the 1990s, when many of its offerings were tailored for its mainframe technology. Instead, I.B.M. greatly expanded its services business. I.B.M., Mr. Hayman said, focuses not on applications, but “software frameworks.” That software foundation is also a platform for I.B.M.’s services business. The line between software and services is increasingly blurred, and I.B.M. has many thousands of software developers these days in its big services group. I.B.M.’s consulting and services business supplies expertise and technology tailored for specific industries. And expertise that is made repeatable and reusable is embodied in code — software, that is.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/sun-ceo-still-sunny-after-drubbing-from-larry-ellison/?ref=oraclecorporation">Sun's Chief Still Sunny After Drubbing From Ellison<date>May 14, 2010, 6:11 pm</date><text>Jonathan Schwartz, Sun’s former chief executive, thinks Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, is just swell. Or as Mr. Schwartz put it in an e-mail message to me, “Larry Ellison is a completely flawless, lovely man.” That’s high, almost believable praise coming from a man just ripped to shreds in the press by Mr. Ellison. Earlier this week, Reuters published an article in which Mr. Ellison firmly stated that mismanagement and “madness” wrecked Sun. Some of his choice barbs included: “Their management made some very bad decisions that damaged their business and allowed us to buy them for a bargain price.” And this one: “The underlying engineering teams are so good, but the direction they got was so astonishingly bad that even they couldn’t succeed. Really great blogs do not take the place of great microprocessors. Great blogs do not replace great software. Lots and lots of blogs does not replace lots and lots of sales.” Mr. Schwartz gained notoriety as the first Fortune 500 chief executive to fire up a blog, and Sun subsequently went blog wild with thousands of employees detailing their lives and technology. While most of Mr. Ellison’s comments seemed directed at Mr. Schwartz, others were aimed at Sun’s entire management suite, meaning that Mr. Ellison was taking swipes at Scott McNealy, Sun’s co-founder and chairman as well. Mr. McNealy and Mr. Ellison have long been portrayed as close friends in the media, although Mr. McNealy did not stay on at Oracle after its acquisition of Sun, as Mr. Ellison suggested would happen. Mr. McNealy has rebuffed requests to talk about the Oracle deal. People on the front line of the acquisition have told me that Mr. Ellison, Mr. Schwartz and Mr. McNealy failed to find anything resembling common ground. Mr. McNealy was displeased with Mr. Schwartz’s decision to open source all of Sun’s software, while Mr. Schwartz was displeased with Mr. McNealy’s fondness for some of Sun’s older, underperforming technology like its Sparc chips. As I understand it, Mr. Ellison was displeased with just about everything.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/technology/13sap.html?ref=oraclecorporation">SAP to Buy Sybase, Ally in Software<date>Published: May 12, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — SAP’s top executives, who have recently talked about making bolder and more decisive moves, did just that on Wednesday by agreeing to buy a fellow business software maker, Sybase, for $5.25 billion.The acquisition puts SAP into the database software market, where its products will overlap with those of its longtime rival, Oracle, more than ever. As such, the deal heats up competition to gather, store and analyze the huge amounts of sales, customer and employee data being produced by modern companies. Executives of SAP and Sybase said they intended to focus on creating new types of number processing software that rely on Sybase’s strengths in transporting data to and from the smartphones of customers. “This will literally connect the shop floor to the corner office,” said Bill McDermott, the co-chief executive of SAP, during a conference call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the deal. Under the terms of the deal, SAP plans to pay $65 a share for Sybase through a tender offer, a 56 percent premium to Tuesday’s closing price of $41.57. A report by Bloomberg News on Wednesday about the merger talks sent Sybase shares up 35 percent, to $56.14. SAP will also assume Sybase’s debt of $400 million. Sybase, based in Dublin, Calif., will operate as a stand-alone unit within SAP under its current management. Assuming a majority of Sybase shareholders tender their shares to SAP, the deal is expected to close in the third quarter. SAP, based in Walldorf, Germany, will finance the deal with cash on hand and a 2.75 billion euro ($3.5 billion) loan arranged by Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank. SAP’s traditional strengths revolve around selling often complex business software that helps companies deal with their day-to-day computing jobs like payroll, inventory tracking and sales. Oracle has been invading SAP’s turf with its own products and by acquiring smaller companies at a furious clip. I.B.M. and Microsoft are also rivals. All of these SAP competitors sell the database products that are needed to connect with the business applications, leaving SAP in the position of partnering with its foes — a situation that may change by acquiring Sybase and its database business. Noel Yuhanna, an analyst at Forrester Research, chided SAP for not acquiring the database technology sooner because Oracle has been able to offer customers a more complete, tightly linked collection of software. “SAP is feeling the impact of that,” Mr. Yuhanna said. SAP’s flagship software does not currently work with Sybase’s database. Mr. Yuhanna expects it to take at least six months to rectify this situation and about a year before customers would start buying a combined product from SAP. An Oracle spokeswoman said the company declined to comment on the deal. Sybase trails Oracle, I.B.M. and Microsoft by a significant margin in the database market, according the research firm Gartner. Sybase closed out last year with 3 percent of the market, compared with 43 percent for Oracle, 24 percent for I.B.M. and 19 percent for Microsoft. But Mr. McDermott and other executives argued that the combined company has a chance to shake up both the business software and database segments. SAP has spent years working on a new type of data-handling technology that it claims will run jobs much faster than standard databases. The idea would be to create a fresh breed of business software that blends software from SAP and Sybase and uses this technology as its underpinning. While Sybase trails its larger competitors, John S. Chen, the chief executive of Sybase, highlighted the company’s strength in dealing with investment banking customers, stock exchanges and insurers. Last year, Sybase sold about $800 million worth of database software and increased its software licenses 22 percent during the recession. Sybase’s chief value may be the prominent position it has carved out in the mobile business software market. A flagging company when Mr. Chen stepped in to run it in 1998, Sybase now handles the short message (S.M.S.) traffic for close to four billion mobile phones and links the message systems of the phone companies, Mr. Chen said during a recent interview. Executives from SAP and Sybase have already started talking about creating more involved mobile applications that will give remote workers access to floods of information. Yvonne Genovese, an analyst at Gartner, described this mobile technology as “a big deal.” Large companies already started to push their standard business software out to mobile phones, and now they are trying to do more with the data that returns from the devices. In February, SAP tapped Mr. McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe as its co-chief executives. Léo Apotheker, the previous chief executive, resigned as the company struggled through the recession.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/oracle-c-e-o-sets-up-prearranged-trading-plan/?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle C.E.O. Sets Up Prearranged Trading Plan<date>April 27, 2010, 4:38 am</date><text>Oracle said Monday that Larry Ellison, its chief executive, set up a prearranged plan to sell up to 50 million shares — or about 4 percent of his stake in the company — over 10 months, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Ellison, ranked in March as the world’s sixth-wealthiest person by Forbes magazine, would have 1.127 billion outstanding shares, or a 22.3 percent stake, in Oracle if he sold all 50 million shares under the plan. The plan was made in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. That rule allows executives to set up plans to sell shares at specified dates in the future to avoid charges of insider trading if they want to sell stock at a time when they may have meaningful insider information.

A handful of start-up companies founded by Facebook alumni are attracting attention and generating a good amount of buzz within venture circles, where competition is fierce to get a stake in the Web’s next hit product. For example, Quora, a Q&amp;A start-up founded by a group of former Facebook employees, including the social networking firm’s former chief technology officer, Adam D’Angelo, announced Monday that it had nabbed $11 million in a first round of funding from Benchmark Capital. Other Facebook-related start-ups that have attracted V.C.’s include Asana, whose founders include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. The company raised $9 million in December from Benchmark Capital and Andreessen-Horowitz. Meanwhile, Cloudera, which features former Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Oracle veterans on its management team, raised $11 million from Greylock Partners and Accel Partners in two separate rounds of funding last year, Reuters said. The proliferation of start-ups with Facebook veterans, and the investor interest in them, follows a time-tested Silicon Valley pattern in which tech superstars from Google to Fairchild Semiconductor have spawned innovative start-up companies, Nick Sturiale, a general partner at JAFCO Ventures, told Reuters. “Any entrepreneur spinning out of Facebook is going to get attention.

Still, Oracle’s profit edged Wall Street’s estimates, and its revenue from new software licenses moved higher for the second consecutive quarter, a sign that some big companies are steadily increasing their spending on technology projects. New customers are crucial for Oracle, one of the world’s top makers of database software, because they often lock into contracts for technical support that feed Oracle’s growth for years. Oracle gets more than half its revenue from those contracts. Oracle said after the market closed Thursday that its net income was $1.2 billion, or 23 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 28. That compares with $1.3 billion, or 26 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 17 percent to $6.4 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 38 cents a share. On that basis, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Oracle to earn 37 cents a share, on $6.3 billion in revenue. The latest numbers include about a month of contributions from Sun Microsystems, the struggling server and software maker that Oracle bought for $7.4 billion. The deal was completed in January after months of wrangling in Europe over whether the deal would violate antitrust laws. Oracle’s revenue from new software licenses rose 10 percent, excluding Sun. The company had predicted it would rise as much as 9 percent. The September to November quarter, which Oracle reported in December, was the first time in a year that figure rose.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/15/sports/15cup.html?ref=oraclecorporation">BMW Oracle Wins the America’s Cup<date>Published: February 14, 2010</date><text>VALENCIA, Spain (AP)  Still bundled against the cold in his white foul-weather gear, the software tycoon Larry Ellison hoisted the America’s Cup high in the air, then planted a kiss on it, the oldest trophy in international sports.

After sitting out the first race because of a weight limit, Ellison, 65, was onboard his trimaran Sunday as the high-tech BMW Oracle, with a gigantic wing for a sail, sped ahead of the two-time defending champion, Alinghi of Switzerland, to complete the two-race sweep. “I am so proud of this team, I am so proud to be part of this team, and I am especially proud to bring the America’s Cup, once again, after a long absence, back to the United States of America,” said Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle Corporation. Russell Coutts, the chief executive of BMW Oracle, popped the cork on a magnum of Champagne and sprayed Ellison, as well as the tactician John Kostecki and the skipper-helmsman Jimmy Spithill of Australia. Blue and silver confetti blew across the stage and fireworks went off across Port America’s Cup, a festive ending to a tumultuous two-and-a-half-year period that dragged the 159-year-old event to one of its lowest points. Ellison and his rival Ernesto Bertarelli had been locked in court since July 2007, and for a while it seemed as if the result of this race was going to be contested off the water. Alinghi raised a red protest flag on its giant catamaran late on the first leg of the triangle course during the second race, leaving observers wondering what it was about because there was no communication from the boats. The Swiss dropped the protest after the race, confirming Ellison’s win. Bertarelli was not at the ceremony when the ornate America’s Cup was handed over by the Societe Nautique de Genève to San Francisco’s Golden Gate Yacht Club. Bertarelli, a biotech tycoon, became the first European to win the America’s Cup in 2003 with a victory over Team New Zealand, and retained it against New Zealand in 2007 before the legal fight with Ellison. “They had a strategy, they got a little help from the legal system in New York, and that always makes it difficult for us Europeans and gave them advantages,” Bertarelli said. “They were faster, good on them.” The America’s Cup has been away from the United States for 15 years, the longest drought since the schooner America won the Cup by beating a fleet of British ships around the Isle of Wight in 1851. Dennis Conner lost it in 1995 to Team New Zealand and Coutts, now a four-time America’s Cup winner. Ellison and Kostecki were the only Americans on BMW Oracle’s crew for the clincher. The massive trimaran was steered by Spithill, who, at 30, was sailing in his fourth America’s Cup. Ellison’s fortune made the victory possible, but the true star was his monster black-and-white trimaran and its radical 223-foot wing sail, which powered the craft at three times the speed of the wind, sending its windward and middle hulls flying well above the water. One of the lasting images of this America’s Cup will be that of Spithill, using technology seemingly straight out of “Star Wars,” calmly steering from his airborne helm. The American trimaran took a 28-second lead rounding the first mark Sunday and powered toward the horizon while sailing across the wind on the second leg. The final margin for two of the fastest, most technologically advanced sailboats ever built was 5 minutes 25 seconds. “It’s just such an awesome tool for racing,” Spithill said. Ellison’s victory ended one of the most bitter chapters in the America’s Cup. He and Bertarelli fought over their interpretations of the 1887 Deed of Gift, which governs the America’s Cup.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Alberto Saiz/Associated Press BMW Oracle's USA-17 has a 223-foot rigid wing that is made mostly of carbon fiber. Team Alinghi, the defending champion, had no plans to sail its catamaran after spending seven hours on the water Monday waiting for a starting signal that never came. BMW Oracle, the challenger, prepared for a training run in its trimaran  with the team owner, the Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison, on board  but scrapped it early in the afternoon because of strong wind offshore. In a way, BMW Oracle’s USA-17 is sailing even when it is at the dock at the team’s boatyard in Valencia’s busy commercial port. Unlike Alinghi 5’s more conventional mast system, in which the sails are furled and stowed at the end of the day, USA-17’s 223-foot rigid wing stays up around the clock. “We like to leave it vertical,” said Tim Smyth, a co-manager of BMW Oracle’s construction team. “It’s the safest place for it.” The wing is made almost entirely of carbon fiber, but it is a little more robust than one might think. “It’s like a large egg,” Smyth said. “It’s fragile, but its shell will support itself.” When the boat is tied up, the wing acts something like a giant weather vane, always facing into the breeze. But a too-strong wind can create problems, particularly if a race day is near. If the wind is forecast to be more than 25 knots, or about 29 miles per hour, Smyth said that the team preferred to take the wing down, a process that takes about two hours and involves roughly two dozen people. “But the problem as race day approaches is, can we get it back in?” he said. That problem did not crop up Tuesday, with the wind at the boatyard well under the limits. But a big question was if the wind offshore would cooperate Wednesday to allow the best-of-three series to finally begin. Another concern was choppiness  race officials can postpone a race if swells are higher than one meter, or a little more than three feet. On Monday, the planned first race was called off four hours after it was scheduled to start because of inconsistent breezes on the course. Under the Deed of Gift, the 19th-century legal document that governs much of this, the 33rd edition of the Cup, there must be a day off after every scheduled racing day, even if that day’s race is called off. The Deed of Gift also sets the size of the course  20 miles upwind and 20 miles back for the first race and for the third, if necessary. Given the variability of the winter wind in the western Mediterranean, it is difficult to forecast whether the breezes will be consistent enough along such a long course to allow the race to take place. The usual America’s Cup course is much shorter, but then again, the usual America’s Cup match is a best-of-seven or a best-of-nine series involving single-hull yachts, not mega-multihulls. But since 2007, legal battles between BMW Oracle and Team Alinghi, owned by the Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, led to this match being governed by the Deed of Gift. Both teams’ meteorologists were working to forecast the wind for Wednesday, to help their sailors decide how to set up their boats. But Chris Bedford, the chief meteorologist for BMW Oracle, had other tasks as well. “We’re not just forecasting for the two or three or four hours that the race is going to take place, but also forecasting for the other 20 hours the wing is standing upright,” he said. The wing was installed Sunday morning, after being taken down for maintenance work. Smyth said that raising the wing, which weighs about 7,700 pounds, was a delicate operation involving workers on the dock and on the yacht. A wing-handling checklist posted at the boatyard has 18 items on it, and a blueprint details the positions and responsibilities of the crew. “It’s a finely orchestrated maneuver,” Smyth said. At one point when the wing is partly erect, a crewman walks up it to attach rigging. The crew will take the wing down if the forecast is for 25 knots or more, but the limit for actually doing so  or for putting it up  is about 15 knots. That is if the wing is lined up so that its leading edge is facing the wind. Installing the wing if the wind is on the trailing edge  which has nine adjustable flaps  is much more problematic. “If the wind’s coming from the trailing edge, it’s dodgy,” Smyth said. “We don‘t really want to explore that.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on February 10, 2010, on page B16 of the New York edition.VALENCIA, Spain  With 19th-century rules forcing the America’s Cup to wait a day for another shot at beginning the match, both teams kept their boats tied up Tuesday.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times Rodney Adkins, senior vice president for systems and technology at I.B.M., which is ahead in developing customized systems. Suppliers are offering customers assembled bundles of hardware and software to make it easier and less expensive for customers to cope with the Internet-era surge in data  an information flood coming from internal databases, but also from Web-based collaboration and smartphone applications, sensors that monitor electrical use, environmental contamination and food shipments, even biological and genetic research. The shift to packaging hardware and software together is behind the recent big deals and partnerships in the technology industry: Oracle’s purchase of Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion, an alliance between Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft announced last month, and a similar partnership between Cisco Systems and EMC. But computer scientists at universities and technology companies say that simply putting the hardware and software building blocks together more efficiently for customers is not enough. “The huge challenge is to take all this data and generate useful knowledge from it,” said Kunle Olukotun, a computer scientist at Stanford. “It’s an enormous opportunity in science and business, but it also presents a massive computing problem.” The path to intelligently mining the explosion of data, Mr. Olukotun said, involves new approaches to breaking down computing tasks into subtasks that can be processed simultaneously  a concept known as parallel computing  and new system designs optimized for specific kinds of work. Designing computer systems around the work to be done is a departure from the dominant approach of general-purpose design, in which machines are built to be capable of handling all kinds of chores and are then programmed to do specific tasks. Several companies are beginning to bring workload-optimized systems design into the mainstream of corporate and government computing. The promise, analysts say, is to not only open the door to exploiting the data flood for competitive advantage, but also to reduce energy costs and help automate the management and administration of computer systems  a labor-intensive expense that is rising four times faster than the cost of hardware. I.B.M., according to industry analysts, is at the forefront of the effort to develop more customized systems. And on Monday, the company is making the first of a series of announcements this year that embody the new approach. I.B.M. is introducing a line of big computer servers using its Power 7 32-core microprocessors. They are priced at $190,000, typically run Unix or Linux, and are aimed at industries like finance and utilities, as well as scientific researchers. Next month, I.B.M. plans to unveil far less costly server systems based on industry-standard microprocessors made by Intel. Those machines, which typically run Unix or Microsoft Windows, will be used for Web collaboration, e-mail and other applications. “These are not simply hardware products, but the result of years of work and investment at every level from the silicon up through the software,” said Rodney C. Adkins, I.B.M.’s senior vice president for systems and technology. “And the real challenge is to optimize it all, not just the hardware.” The early deployment of so-called smart utility grids points to the challenges of handling ever-vaster amounts of data. Smart electric meters can measure room temperatures and energy use hourly or at 15-minute intervals instead of the old pattern of utility service workers reading electro-mechanical meters every month or two. The goal of smart grids, which governments are starting to heavily subsidize, is to give households and businesses timely information so they can change their electricity consumption habits to reduce energy use and pollution, and save money. That involves not only collecting the data, but also analyzing and presenting it to consumers in ways that are easily understood  typically a personalized Web site graphically showing household electricity consumption and pricing. EMeter, a maker of smart-grid software in San Mateo, Calif., said that using I.B.M.’s workload-tuned P-7 systems should more than double its capacity to manage smart meters, bringing it up to 50 million. In one eMeter project, the utilities in Ontario are going to install 4.5 million smart meters by 2011. Before, meters were read once every month or two. Under the digital system, readings will be made hourly, a hundredfold increase in the data generated. “If you can’t continually measure energy use down to the granular level in homes and businesses, the smart grid doesn’t work,” said Scott Smith, director of technical solutions at eMeter. “You need a tremendous amount of computing power to do that at scale.” Computer scientists, biologists and researchers from Rice University and the Texas Medical Center have been working with I.B.M. scientists to fine-tune P-7 systems for cancer research. Genetic and protein-folding simulations require vast amounts of specialized high-speed processing and computer memory, said Kamran Khan, vice provost for information technology at Rice. I.B.M., he said, dispatched three Ph.D. biologists to work with the cancer researchers. “They really understand computational biology,” Mr. Khan said. The more bespoke approach to computer-systems design does increase the risk that customers are locked into one or two powerful companies. Indeed, the reason data-center customers long preferred the building-block approach to hardware and software was that it guaranteed competition among suppliers. But the tradeoff has been that customers had to put the hardware and software together themselves, even as computing complexity and data-handling demands surged. Many companies, it seems, are willing to accept less competition among suppliers for the convenience and cost savings from prepackaged systems. “It’s a balancing act,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst at IDC. “It does take away some choice, but also makes things a lot simpler. And that, after all, is the model that Apple used so successfully in consumer technology.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on February 8, 2010, on page B4 of the New York edition.In data-center computing, the big trend today is to move from building blocks to bundles. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times Rodney Adkins, senior vice president for systems and technology at I.B.M., which is ahead in developing customized systems. Suppliers are offering customers assembled bundles of hardware and software to make it easier and less expensive for customers to cope with the Internet-era surge in data  an information flood coming from internal databases, but also from Web-based collaboration and smartphone applications, sensors that monitor electrical use, environmental contamination and food shipments, even biological and genetic research. The shift to packaging hardware and software together is behind the recent big deals and partnerships in the technology industry: Oracle’s purchase of Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion, an alliance between Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft announced last month, and a similar partnership between Cisco Systems and EMC.

Late Wednesday night, Mr. Schwartz used Twitter to publish a haiku about his exit from Oracle, which just completed its purchase of Sun last week. “Financial crisis/Stalled too many customers/CEO no more,” Mr. Schwartz wrote. Mr. Schwartz has been fond of using the Internet as a soapbox. At Sun, he became the first chief executive of a major company to put up his own blog. Mr. Schwartz also pushed the Securities and Exchange Commission to put blogs on equal footing with press releases and filings when it comes to disclosing critical business matters to investors. Mr. Schwartz replaced Sun’s co-founder, Scott McNealy, as chief executive in 2006, inheriting a company that had been suffering from declining sales ever since the dot-com bust. One of the most dramatic moves made during Mr. Schwartz’s tenure as chief executive was Sun’s decision to release the vast majority of its top software products under open-source licenses. The company hoped that broad developer interest in its software products would help attract new customers and translate into sales of other products like computer servers and storage systems. However, Sun struggled to post consistent results and its sales continued to decline. The recession only exacerbated matters, as Sun depended on sales to many of the financial companies that were pummeled by the downturn. I.B.M. moved to acquire Sun, only to have negotiations stall, opening the door for Oracle. Oracle’s chief executive, Larry Ellison, is not especially fond of Mr. Schwartz. In an interview last week, Mr. Ellison said he fully expected Mr. Schwartz to resign rather than play a role in the combined company. As for what’s next, Mr. Schwartz said in an e-mail: “In the short run, I’m planning to spend some long overdue time with my family. Longer run, with a few million businesses and a few billion consumers on the Web, rumor has it there are some interesting opportunities to be had.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E7DF1F38F932A35751C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=oraclecorporation">BITS; Oracle to Support Sun Web Projects<date>Published: February 1, 2010</date><text>Oracle expects that through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, it has a way to sell a full spectrum of hardware and software to business customers. That's the big picture. Digging in more deeply, it looks as if some of Sun's more quixotic projects will live on at Oracle. For one, Oracle plans to keep putting support behind OpenOffice, a free open-source productivity suite that competes with Office from Microsoft, Oracle's longtime nemesis. Most notable, Oracle will introduce an online version called Oracle Cloud Office, said Edward Screven, the chief corporate architect at Oracle. For years, Sun has paid its own engineers to improve OpenOffice and has helped support the broader efforts of the open-source developers who build the software. Sun would take the OpenOffice code and stick the company's own StarOffice label on the software. When a new version of OpenOffice arrives, millions of people rush to download it. Still, the software has failed to make even a noticeable dent in Microsoft's empire. More often than not, OpenOffice is running on Linux computers, of which there are relatively few. Mr. Screven also pointed to another one of Sun's neglected children during his speech at Oracle's Silicon Valley headquarters -- the SunRay. The SunRay falls into the thin client category of products. It's an appliance -- without a main chip, internal storage, fans or really much of anything -- that talks to servers in a data center, which handle the computing done by traditional PCs. Scott McNealy, a Sun founder and its chairman, has been one of the SunRay's biggest backers, saying the product makes perfect sense for government bodies, universities and companies running large support centers. But despite his encouragement, the device has failed to ship in meaningful volumes. ASHLEE VANCE COMMENTThe Oracle Network Computer lives again. . . .

However, as The Associated Press reported, the news comes as no real surprise. Mr. Ellison told financial analysts he’s trying to buy the team but, he said, ”unfortunately you can’t have a hostile takeover of a basketball team.” The line got laughs because of Mr. Ellison’s aggressive acquisition tactics. His business software maker is known to be a serial acquirer and won a hostile takeover fight in 2005 for rival PeopleSoft. ”I’ve been hearing this for years,” the Warriors’ president, Robert Rowell, told The Associated Press. ”At some point in time, the media speculation will become a reality. But right now, there’s not much to this.” Mr. Ellison was responding to a question from a member of the audience during a conference to discuss Oracle’s plans for its latest acquisition, struggling computer server maker Sun Microsystems. With the deal, Oracle, having spent the last nine months fighting rivals and regulators in order to own Sun Microsystems, has now pushed itself into the middle of the scrum of technology heavyweights all jostling for the same corporate customers. When told of Mr. Ellison’s remarks about the Warriors Wednesday, team ambassador and former star Al Attles said with a smile: ”Oh, really? Very interesting.” Earlier this month, Mr. Ellison sat courtside to watch the Warriors play LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the building boasting his company’s name. Mr. Ellison has expressed interest in buying an N.B.A. franchise and there’s talk he could be the owner-in-waiting if current majority owner, Chris Cohan, eventually decides to sell. While Mr. Cohan has given no indication he plans to put the franchise up for sale any time soon, there’s thinking that he would certainly listen if an incredible offer was made down the road. At the Cavs-Warriors game, one fan toward the rear of the lower level held a sign reading, ”Dear Larry Ellison, please buy this team. Thanks, the Warriors fans.” Go to Article from The Associated Press via The New York Times »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/business/global/22oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Oracle’s Acquisition of Sun Wins Approval of Europeans<date>Published: January 21, 2010</date><text>The European Commission said Thursday that it had approved Oracle’s $7.4 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems after concluding that it would not significantly affect competition in the European Union.

Oracle and Sun shares both rose in extended trading. Oracle, which is based in Redwood Shores, Calif., said it earned $1.46 billion, or 29 cents a share, versus $1.30 billion, or 25 cents a share, a year ago, The Associated Press reported. Oracle’s results for its fiscal second quarter showed that corporations were becoming less reluctant to spend on technology projects, representing a thawing of frozen budgets that other large companies like Intel, Microsoft and EMC have said will accelerate in the new year. Oracle has spent $35 billion over the past five years acquiring 60 companies, mainly in an effort to expand the kinds of software it offers and better compete with the German company SAP. But Oracle is taking a different approach with Sun Microsystems, the world’s fourth largest maker of computer servers. If the deal is allowed, Oracle would become a hardware company for the first time, which will pressure its profit margins and ratchet up the tension with I.B.M., an Oracle partner that also sells servers and database software. European regulators have until Jan. 27 to decide whether to approve the deal or block it. The Department of Justice has approved the deal, but its European counterparts have expressed fears about how Oracle will handle a competing database product from Sun’s open-source MySQL division. This week, though, they appeared to soften their tone after hearing new promises from Oracle about its plans to keep supporting MySQL. Oracle said in a statement on Thursday that the company now expected European regulators to “unconditionally” approve the Sun acquisition in January. In addition, Oracle’s chief executive, Larry Ellison, described some of his plans for Sun, including his intention to “avoid” the business of low-end servers and instead focus on the high-performance market. Oracle said revenue from new software licenses should be down 1 percent to up 9 percent in the current quarter. Meanwhile, revenue is expected to rise 3 percent to 6 percent — translating to a total of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion — as profit ticks up to 36 cents to 38 cents a share, excluding one-time items, figures that were in line with expectations. Oracle’s stock jumped 76 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $23.60 in extended trading. It had closed the regular session down 24 cents at $22.88. Sun’s stock rose 6 cents to $9.35 in extended trading, moving closer to the $9.50 a share that Oracle would pay to acquire the company.

The European Commission said it was “optimistic” that the deal between the two California companies would no longer pose a threat to the European market for database software. Last month, the commission threatened to block the deal. The turnabout came after Oracle, the world’s largest vendor of database programs, agreed to preserve the viability of MySQL, a free, widely used open-source database application that it would acquire in the deal for Sun. The European competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said Oracle had made significant commitments to support MySQL, which has been downloaded more than 100 million times over the last decade. Ms. Kroes said Oracle, after it acquired Sun, would extend MySQL’s existing commercial licenses for up to five years. Oracle would also make binding guarantees to companies and individuals that already use MySQL that Oracle would not pursue intellectual property claims. In addition, Oracle would spend more than $72 million over the next three years in research and development to improve and refine MySQL, which Oracle said was more money than Sun had been spending on developing the program. In a statement, Ms. Kroes added that she believed the commission’s review would have “a satisfactory outcome.” Not everyone was persuaded that the concessions were sufficient. Florian Müller, an open-source programmer in Starnberg, Germany, called them “a good starting point.” “The real question is whether Oracle is going to continue to develop MySQL in a meaningful way that responds to market needs,” he said. “They have in my opinion an inherent conflict of interest in not innovating a product that would detract from their commercial databases.” Sun acquired MySQL, then based in Uppsala, Sweden, in 2008 for $1 billion. In April, Oracle announced its intention to acquire Sun pending regulatory approval. American regulators quickly cleared the deal, but on Nov. 10 Ms. Kroes issued the commission’s objections. Since then, Oracle and commission investigators have been meeting to work out a compromise that would avoid a lengthy legal process. An antitrust lawyer in Brussels who is not involved in the case, Denis Waelbroeck, said Ms. Kroes’s statements suggested that European objections to an Oracle-Sun takeover might be receding. However, Mr. Waelbroeck, a lawyer at Ashurst, cautioned that nothing was certain until a settlement was announced. He pointed to the last-minute, back-and-forth negotiations in another competition review involving Microsoft’s Web browser. In that case, Ms. Kroes this year said she was optimistic of averting a legal dispute after Microsoft agreed to give Europeans the right to download competing browsers via Windows. After her statement, several software rivals objected to Microsoft’s offer, causing more negotiation and, so far, no settlement. Ms. Kroes will step down in early 2010 as Europe’s competition commissioner to take up her new post as its telecommunications commissioner. In recent statements in Brussels, she has expressed an interest in settling outstanding competition cases before she leaves the post.

In a statement, Ms. Kroes added that she believed the commission’s review would have “a satisfactory outcome.” Not everyone was persuaded that the concessions were sufficient. Florian Müller, an open-source programmer in Starnberg, Germany, called them “a good starting point.” “The real question is whether Oracle is going to continue to develop MySQL in a meaningful way that responds to market needs,” he said. “They have in my opinion an inherent conflict of interest in not innovating a product that would detract from their commercial databases.” Sun acquired MySQL, then based in Uppsala, Sweden, in 2008 for $1 billion. In April, Oracle announced its intention to acquire Sun pending regulatory approval. American regulators quickly cleared the deal, but on Nov. 10 Ms. Kroes issued the commission’s objections. Since then, Oracle and commission investigators have been meeting to work out a compromise that would avoid a lengthy legal process. An antitrust lawyer in Brussels who is not involved in the case, Denis Waelbroeck, said Ms. Kroes’s statements suggested that European objections to an Oracle-Sun takeover might be receding. However, Mr. Waelbroeck, a lawyer at Ashurst, cautioned that nothing was certain until a settlement was announced. He pointed to the last-minute, back-and-forth negotiations in another competition review involving Microsoft’s Web browser. In that case, Ms. Kroes this year said she was optimistic of averting a legal dispute after Microsoft agreed to give Europeans the right to download competing browsers via Windows. After her statement, several software rivals objected to Microsoft’s offer, causing more negotiation and, so far, no settlement. Ms. Kroes will step down in early 2010 as Europe’s competition commissioner to take up her new post as its telecommunications commissioner. In recent statements in Brussels, she has expressed an interest in settling outstanding competition cases before she leaves the post.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/technology/business-computing/30open.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Open Source as a Model for Business Is Elusive<date>Published: November 29, 2009</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO  In many ways, MySQL embodies the ideals of the populist software movement known as open source, in which a program’s creator releases it to the world free of charge, and legions of volunteers contribute improvements that are also freely shared.

Related New Snag for Oracle in Sun Deal (September 4, 2009) The start-up company came out of nowhere, building a database application beloved by vibrant, young Internet companies. Logging in from homes scattered around the globe, its workers seemed more a part of a virtual commune than a corporate monolith, and they relished taking on proprietary software giants like Microsoft. But like most open-source companies, MySQL’s sales, tied to support deals, never matched the astronomical number of downloads for its product, about 60,000 a day. In January 2008, the founders decided to sell the company for $1 billion to Sun Microsystems. And this year, Sun agreed to sell itself to Oracle, which makes database software aimed at larger companies and tougher jobs, for $7.4 billion. Now, disagreement over the value of MySQL  both as a stand-alone entity and as part of a big company  lies at the heart of a bitter public battle between Oracle and the European Union over the Sun acquisition. The fight illuminates a larger truth about open-source companies: their societal and strategic importance far exceeds their financial value as operating businesses. European regulators view MySQL as sort of a database of the people, a low-cost alternative to Oracle’s costly proprietary products. The regulators worry that Oracle may stop improving MySQL in favor of protecting its core traditional products, and customers will lose an important option in the database market. “In the current economic context, all companies are looking for cost-effective I.T. solutions, and systems based on open-source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions,” said the European Commission’s competition chief, Neelie Kroes, in a recent statement. “The commission has to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available.” Oracle, meanwhile, insists that it will continue to develop MySQL and other Sun technologies. Oracle’s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, contends that MySQL serves a different part of the database market than Oracle’s main products do  an assessment supported by many analysts. One main incentive for Oracle to keep improving MySQL is that the program serves as a bulwark against Microsoft’s SQL Server database, which challenges Oracle’s products on the low end. “The commission’s statement of objections reveals a profound misunderstanding of both database competition and open source dynamics,” Oracle said in a statement. To Ms. Kroes’s point, there is an open-source alternative, and usually a pretty good one, to just about every major commercial software product. In the last decade, these open-source wares have put tremendous pricing pressure on their proprietary rivals. Governments and corporations have welcomed this competition. Whether open-source firms are practical as long-term businesses, however, is a much murkier question. The best-known open-source company is Red Hat, which produces a variant of the Linux operating system for server computers. Like most of its peers, Red Hat offers a free version of its base product and relies on selling support services and extra tools for revenue. In its last fiscal year, which ended in March, the company’s revenue rose 25 percent to $653 million, and it reported net income of $79 million. But Red Hat is a rare case. “There’s only one company making real money out of open source, and that’s Red Hat,” said Simon Crosby, the chief technology officer at Citrix Systems, which acquired the open-source software maker XenSource for $500 million in 2007. “Everyone else is in trouble.” The enduring appeal of open-source software revolves more around its disruptive nature than blockbuster sales. As long as there has been software, there have been some people eager to share and improve it for the common good. The rise of the Internet made such sharing easier than ever, enabling people the world over to work together on projects outside the confines of a formal corporate structure. Open-source software has thrived and played a prominent role in the building of the Internet’s infrastructure. Many companies rely on Linux-based computers and Apache Web server software to display their Web pages. Similarly, the Mozilla Firefox Web browser has emerged as the most formidable competitor to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The grass-roots nature of open source has led advocates to view the projects as a populist foil to proprietary software, where a company keeps the inner workings of its applications secret. But in the last decade, open-source software has become more of a corporate affair than a people’s revolution. In some cases, dominant technology companies have used open-source projects as pawns. Google, for example, has needled Microsoft by providing financial support to the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, which oversees of the development of Firefox. I.B.M. has been a major backer of Linux, helping to raise it as a competitor to Microsoft’s Windows and other proprietary operating systems. Many of the top open-source developers are anything but volunteers tinkering in their spare time. Companies like I.B.M., Google, Oracle and Intel pay these developers top salaries to work on open-source projects and further the companies’ strategic objectives. In the last three years, there have been five big acquisitions in which a major technology company bought an up-and-coming open-source company for many times its annual revenue. Sun, for example, bought MySQL for about 10 times its revenue, while Citrix bought XenSource for more than 150 times its revenue, according to people familiar with the companies’ sales. Most recently, VMware, the leading maker of virtualization software, brought SpringSource for $420 million, or about 20 times its annual sales. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on November 30, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.SAN FRANCISCO  In many ways, MySQL embodies the ideals of the populist software movement known as open source, in which a program’s creator releases it to the world free of charge, and legions of volunteers contribute improvements that are also freely shared.

Takes More Time to Review Oracle-Sun Deal<date>November 20, 2009, 11:30 am</date><text>European Union regulators said Friday that they have extended until Jan. 27 a deadline to wrap up their antitrust review of Oracle‘s planned $7.4 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems, The Associated Press reported. The European Commission said Oracle had asked for more time ”in order to have the opportunity to further develop its arguments in response to the Commission’s concerns.” The E.U. executive gave them an extra six working days. Regulators sent a formal charge sheet to Oracle this month laying out competition problems with the deal, saying Oracle’s purchase of open-source database software MySQL could eliminate a crucial rival and raise prices. The E.U. can block the takeover — which has already been approved by the United States — or demand changes to eliminate competition concerns. Officials complained that Oracle had not tried to offer any solutions — possibly selling off MySQL, which Oracle says it doesn’t want to do. Oracle has criticized the E.U. for not understanding the database market or open-source dynamics well enough. MySQL is popular among Web-based companies and regulators say it will increasingly pose a threat to Oracle’s market-leading database software as it adds features and attracts more customers. Sun paid $1 billion for it last year. The E.U. objection ratchets up tension about the fate of the deal, which Sun badly needs to go through. It lost $120 million in the quarter ended Sept. 27 and is rapidly shedding market share to rivals like IBM and Hewlett-Packard.

Related U.S. and Europe Disagree on Sun-Oracle Deal (November 10, 2009) Enlarge This Image François Lenoir/Reuters Neelie Kroes, the European Union's competition commissioner, has been against Oracle's efforts to buy Sun Microsystems. The verbal salvos heated up this week after the European Union issued formal objections on Monday to a bid by Oracle, the giant software maker, to buy Sun for $7.4 billion. Oracle immediately pilloried the objections, saying they were based on “a profound misunderstanding” of the software market. On Tuesday, the European Union struck back, with a spokesman for the union’s competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, dismissing Oracle’s criticism as “facile and superficial.” At one level, the sharp exchanges fit a familiar pattern in antitrust disputes between Brussels and American technology companies, including Microsoft and Intel. The Americans tend to portray the European authorities as technically clueless bureaucrats, while the Europeans cast the big American businesses as arrogant bullies. But the Oracle case also reflects very different views of open-source software by antitrust officials in the United States and Europe. The European regulators want Oracle to sell off a unit of Sun that manages the most popular open-source database program, MySQL. Like all open-source products, MySQL code is distributed free, and the company tries to make money by charging corporate customers for technical support and extra features. The European antitrust officials fear that Oracle, the largest maker of proprietary database software, will have little incentive to sustain and invest in MySQL, a potential rival. The United States Justice Department does not share the European concerns. After the Brussels decision on Monday, the American antitrust regulators made an unusual statement, saying that it had concluded there was a “large community of developers and users of Sun’s open-source database” who would likely keep maintaining and improving MySQL regardless of Oracle’s future decisions about the product. Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the trans-Atlantic “megawar” over open-source software was not surprising. “It makes sense that the Europeans come to the defense of open-source companies because the big proprietary companies are nearly all American,” he said. (The exception is SAP, the large German maker of business management software.) European governments have long viewed open-source software as a potential tool of economic development and independence. The vision was laid out nine years ago in a report by a technology advisory group to the European Commission. Open-source software, the report concluded, presented “a great opportunity” for the region that could perhaps “change the rules in the information technology industry,” wresting the lead in software from the United States and reducing Europe’s reliance on imports. Several European countries have policies that encourage government agencies and municipalities to consider open-source software like MySQL and Linux, an alternative to the Windows operating system from Microsoft. The wider economic role of open-source software, legal experts say, appears to have figured into the thinking of Europe’s antitrust regulators. “There is a greater sensitivity to the importance of open-source software in Europe,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. “They value the competition from open-source software  and the need to support that competition  more than in the United States.” Dennis Oswell, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Oswell &amp; Vahida in Brussels, said the move against Oracle also reflected a greater willingness by European regulators to move against potential threats to competition before there is evidence of harm. “The Europeans are keen to police markets prospectively  even lightning-quick ones like technology  to ensure effective competition in the future,” Mr. Oswell said. By contrast, he said, American regulators “see low prices and competitive markets today and say, ‘O.K., let’s not worry too much about what might or might not happen tomorrow.’ ” The review of the Oracle-Sun deal proceeded on different timetables in the United States and Europe, though the investigators did make some joint calls on Sun and Oracle customers as part of their inquiries. After the acquisition plan was announced in April, the investigation by both sets of regulators focused mainly on Java, a widely used programming language and Internet technology created by Sun, according to a person close to Oracle, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the company. By August, the person said, the focus of Europe’s investigation had switched to MySQL, which took Oracle somewhat by surprise. The European authorities asked Oracle to divest MySQL, and Oracle resisted. Ms. Kroes first publicly raised concerns about MySQL in September  two weeks after the Justice Department’s antitrust division had approved the Oracle-Sun deal. She said at the time that nurturing open-source software was vital when the world was emerging from an economic slump. Ms. Kroes met last month with Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s president, but made no progress. Oracle’s stance was that MySQL and Oracle database products rarely competed head on. MySQL is a fast, lightweight database, used mainly in software applications for the Web. Oracle’s database, by contrast, is a heavier program intended for running more mainstream corporate applications like sales management. “Europe is absolutely right that there is a competition problem in enterprise and database software markets, but MySQL doesn’t actually compete with Oracle,” said Roger Burkhardt, chief executive of Ingres, an open-source database company that does compete directly with Oracle in the corporate market. MySQL, the person close to Oracle said, is more naturally a competitor to Microsoft’s database software, SQL Server. And Oracle has every reason to keep investing in MySQL to challenge Microsoft, the person said. A public hearing in the Oracle case is scheduled in Brussels for Nov. 25. The European Union’s ruling is due on Jan. 19. The European setback is a new and uncomfortable experience for Oracle and its chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison. His company has had two previous deals cleared in Europe without conditions: Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2004, and its purchase of Siebel Systems a year later. Both were makers of proprietary business software. Steve Lohr contributed reporting from New York.

By confronting Oracle, E.U. regulators risk ushering in a new era of trans-Atlantic tensions over antitrust law. Yet letting Oracle off the hook would smack of weakness after Neelie Kroes, the E.U.’s outgoing competition commissioner, spent the past weeks trying to goad some of Oracle’s top executives into making concessions. The dilemma has prompted speculation that the best outcome for Ms. Kroes would be for Oracle to drop its interest in buying Sun, relieving the regulators of the need to make a choice. “Neither path Ms. Kroes faces is a pretty one, and yet this is the decision she might end up being remembered by,” said Spyros Pappas of the law firm Pappas &amp; Associates in Brussels. “Probably the best escape for her would be for Oracle to cancel the deal.” Mr. Pappas has in the past represented Microsoft, an Oracle rival, but is not currently representing any companies involved in the case. E.U. regulators warned in September that the combination could squelch the growth of a popular and free corporate database program called MySQL, owned by Sun. Ms. Kroes then met last month with Safra A. Catz, the Oracle president, but failed to find a way forward. Oracle has declined to make any formal commitments regarding MySQL, according to a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity. Ms. Kroes’s spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said Tuesday that the commission still had “some concerns specifically about the database market,” and he reiterated that Oracle had failed to come forward with concessions last month. A decision to bring formal charges is especially sensitive because the U.S. Justice Department has already approved the merger. Regulators in the United States questioned Oracle’s market power in some areas of its business but raised fewer concerns than the Europeans about open-source database software. There is no formal date by which Ms. Kroes must send the charges. But lawyers said she would need to make up her mind this month, and probably in coming days, to give Oracle enough time to defend itself before making a final decision on whether to clear or block the deal on Jan. 19. While backing down risks a loss of credibility for Ms. Kroes, continuing to oppose the case could leave her open to charges of exacerbating unemployment. Meanwhile, Sun has announced layoffs, and the company’s stock price has fallen off because of the delays in the case. Björn Schotte, head of marketing at Mayflower, a German software developer, said a prosperous company like Oracle, with its team of developers supporting MySQL, could foster the spread of open-source software at a time when Sun was suffering. But Mr. Schotte, who has contributed evidence to E.U. regulators examining the deal but is not a formal participant in the case, said the greater danger was that “Oracle kills MySQL.” He insisted that the commission should require Oracle sell the database as a condition for a merger.

A decision to bring formal charges is especially sensitive because the U.S. Justice Department has already approved the merger. Regulators in the United States questioned Oracle’s market power in some areas of its business but raised fewer concerns than the Europeans about open-source database software. There is no formal date by which Ms. Kroes must send the charges. But lawyers said she would need to make up her mind this month, and probably in coming days, to give Oracle enough time to defend itself before making a final decision on whether to clear or block the deal on Jan. 19. While backing down risks a loss of credibility for Ms. Kroes, continuing to oppose the case could leave her open to charges of exacerbating unemployment. Meanwhile, Sun has announced layoffs, and the company’s stock price has fallen off because of the delays in the case. Björn Schotte, head of marketing at Mayflower, a German software developer, said a prosperous company like Oracle, with its team of developers supporting MySQL, could foster the spread of open-source software at a time when Sun was suffering. But Mr. Schotte, who has contributed evidence to E.U. regulators examining the deal but is not a formal participant in the case, said the greater danger was that “Oracle kills MySQL.” He insisted that the commission should require Oracle sell the database as a condition for a merger.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E5D91F3EF932A15753C1A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=oraclecorporation">Sun to Cut 10% Of Its Workers<date>Published: October 21, 2009</date><text>Sun Microsystems, waiting for European regulators to approve its acquisition by the Oracle Corporation, plans to cut as many as 3,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of the work force, to pare expenses over the next 12 months. The cuts will occur around the world, Sun said Tuesday in a regulatory filing. Sun is losing about $100 million a month, Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, said in September. Sun expects to incur $75 million to $125 million in costs, mostly for severance expenses, according to the filing. European approval is among the final hurdles in the $7.4 billion acquisition announced in April. Regulators said they were taking a deeper look at the deal because of doubts about competition in the database market. The more time the European Commission takes, the more Sun loses, Mr. Ellison told people at a tech industry event last month in San Jose, Calif. The delay is ''not good for anyone,'' he said then. In August, Sun reported a fourth-quarter loss of $147 million and said sales dropped 31 percent to $2.63 billion.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/technology/companies/17oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Profit Rises at Oracle, but Sales Decline<date>Published: September 16, 2009</date><text>The Oracle Corporation’s profit rose 4 percent in the latest quarter, matching Wall Street’s forecasts, despite a drop in sales that revealed that businesses are still being tight-fisted about buying new software. The sales figure was short of analysts’ expectations, and Oracle’s shares fell in after-hours trading. The company’s results, reported after the market closed Wednesday, reflect a familiar pattern that has emerged for Oracle during the recession. Oracle’s sales of new software licenses fell 17 percent to $1 billion, while revenue from software updates and technical support contracts climbed 6 percent to $3.1 billion. While many businesses are still reluctant to pay for new software, existing Oracle customers usually pay the company to do the follow-up work on software they have already bought, which is why the numbers sometimes go in different directions. The rise in support work helped lift Oracle’s net income for the quarter to $1.12 billion, or 22 cents a share. That compared with $1.08 billion, or 21 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding one-time items, profit was 30 cents a share, matching the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Sales fell 5 percent to $5.05 billion, short of expectations for $5.25 billion. Guidance for the September-November quarter, Oracle’s fiscal second quarter, were in line with analysts’ projections. Oracle expects profit of 35 to 36 cents a share, excluding one-time items. Analysts predicted 36 cents a share, on average. Revenue is expected to be flat to up 3 percent over last year, which translates to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.77 billion. Analysts expected $5.72 billion. Oracle sees revenue from new software licenses coming in flat to down 10 percent over last year. Oracle is the world’s top seller of database software, which companies use to archive and retrieve data like payroll or customer information. Oracle is also a major player in the ”middleware” market, which refers to software that allows computing applications to talk to each other. The company, run by Lawrence Ellison, is trying to branch out by buying the struggling computer server maker Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion, a deal that would thrust Oracle into the hardware market, a new area for the company. The deal is being held up by European Union antitrust regulators, who are worried about Oracle’s plans for Sun’s MySQL open-source database, which is popular among Web companies and competes against Oracle’s proprietary database. The underlying programming code for open-source software is distributed free on the Internet; companies make money off it by selling support contracts for products built from that code. There is still uncertainty about how the transaction will play out, but Oracle is moving ahead with plans for Oracle-Sun products.

Regulators in the United States questioned Oracle’s market power in some areas of its business but raised fewer concerns than the Europeans about open-source software. The European Commission’s assertiveness has conflicted in the past with the Justice Department’s judgment. It has objected to mergers of American companies on several occasions, but in 2003, it outright rejected the merger of General Electric and Honeywell after the American authorities approved it. Mario Monti, competition commissioner at the time, said that G.E. would become too dominant in markets for aircraft engines. In recent years, Mr. Monti and Neelie Kroes, the current European Union competition commissioner, have found themselves at odds with some of their American counterparts over whether to force Microsoft to change its Windows operating system. American and European antitrust officials, legal experts say, agree far more often than they differ, other than in a handful of cases. “But there are somewhat different sensitivities,” noted Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. “Even after the change in administrations in Washington, the American level of concern about postmerger price increases tends to be less than in Europe. And European antitrust officials are more protective of consumers and more confident of the beneficial consequences of intervention.” Samuel R. Miller, a partner at Sidley Austin in San Francisco who acted as special trial counsel for the Justice Department’s first antitrust case against Microsoft, said, “This action reflects a continued pattern of aggressive antitrust enforcement regardless of whether the companies are based in Europe, the U.S. or Asia.” Oracle has tussled with European Union regulators in the past over its ambitions but has overcome initial opposition. In 2004, the commission approved Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft without conditions after subjecting the deal to the kind of in-depth inquiry now under way over its purchase of Sun. The Justice Department had opposed that merger, but lost in a legal battle with Oracle. The following year the European commission also approved Oracle’s acquisition of Siebel Systems, again without conditions. In announcing the decision Thursday, Ms. Kroes warned that the acquisition could hamper development of an important software product owned by Sun, which specializes in computer hardware. The product, MySQL, is the most widely used corporate database software in the world, and it competes with software produced by Oracle. Ms. Kroes said preserving access to open-source software was vital when much of the world, including Europe, might just be emerging from a deep slump. “In the current economic context, all companies are looking for cost-effective IT solutions and systems based on open-source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions,” Ms. Kroes said. She said a longer investigation was needed “to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available.” Oracle had no comment on the action. The commission has at least three months, or until Jan. 19, to decide whether to clear the deal or issue an order blocking it. European and American antitrust authorities have sought to narrow their differences in recent years in an effort to avoid disputes that have marred trans-Atlantic relations this decade. Antitrust experts said the decision to investigate the effects on open-source software of Oracle’s acquisition of Sun showed that differences persisted between American and European regulators. “Europeans still have a lot more concerns than Americans about companies using strong or dominant positions to create bottlenecks for competitors in the information and technology sectors,” said Peter Alexiadis, a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher who is based in Brussels. “Any whiff of dominance over different platforms used to deliver information raises particular concerns,” he said. “This may in part explain why Europeans, who are used to multiple business traditions, might be less inclined to view Oracle’s traditional strengths in databases as not posing competitive concerns.” Mr. Alexiadis also noted that a German company, SAP, was an example of a European software company that fiercely competes with Oracle on a number of relevant markets affected by the deal. In the beginning, writers of open-source software did not see it as a source of profit. More recently, companies with open-source operations have begun making large amounts of money on those products by providing support services to go along with them. That bundle of software and service is still often priced at a discount to software sold by companies like Oracle. A major concern cited by European investigators was what would happen to MySQL once Oracle took it over. They expressed concern that Oracle would have an incentive to stymie the development of MySQL as a way of improving the sales of its competing database products. Some experts said the concerns of Ms. Kroes were probably unfounded. Bo Lykkegaard, an analyst with IDC in Copenhagen, said Oracle had bought Sun for a variety of reasons and that MySQL was not among Oracle’s priorities. Even so, Mr. Lykkegaard said that Oracle, by keeping MySQL’s open-source status, would be able to develop parts of its business by reaching out to small companies or departments within large companies that were seeking value-priced software for running operations that were not necessarily “mission critical.” Another issue that may have led the Europeans to take more time with the case is the way that Oracle has handled regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Oracle notified European Union regulators of its deal in late July, more than two months after it informed American officials. European merger watchdogs can take a dim view if companies spread out their notifications between jurisdictions over long periods of time, and they have said in the past that such tactics might be aimed at pressuring the Europeans to give the green light to takeovers already approved in the United States.

Related Tibco Shares Rise After Report Says SAP Mulling Bid (August 10, 2009) Mr. Apotheker, the chief executive of the German software giant SAP, has watched his leading rival, Oracle, go on a buying spree, snapping up more than 50 companies in the last four years. And Oracle’s latest megadeal, the planned $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems, will thrust the software maker into the computer hardware business. Giants like Oracle and I.B.M. have been on a relentless mission to persuade companies to buy as much of their computer infrastructure as possible from one place. It is a strategy that has them encroaching on the turf of specialists like SAP. Many in the technology industry say businesses would prefer to deal with fewer vendors. But Mr. Apotheker does not agree. “I have never, ever heard a customer expressing the faintest wish for having everything delivered out of one hand,” he said in an interview. “Someone is probably trying to imagine wishes that they would like to hear.” It is not clear, however, that SAP has a firm grip on what customers really want, either. The company has fallen well behind rivals in efforts to offer a “cloud computing” product, in which customers essentially rent applications and use them online instead of buying the software and maintaining it on their own machines. SAP also got an earful from customers when it tried to raise prices in the midst of the recession, and it had to temper its stance. The battle, which played out in the news media, left a normally focused SAP looking clumsy and stubborn, said China Martens, who covers SAP for the 451 Group, an independent technology research firm. “That would have never happened in the past,” she said. Mr. Apotheker, a sharp-tongued manager who took the helm of SAP in May, has the challenge of trying to buff his company’s tarnished image. SAP is still the leader in the market for business applications. In 2007, SAP led with 10 percent of the $88 billion market, well ahead of Oracle’s 6.6 percent. In crucial segments, like enterprise resource planning, SAP had 22 percent of the market, or almost twice Oracle’s 12 percent. And the numbers should hold relatively constant for 2008, according to IDC, which is still working on its tally. Still, the worldwide recession forced Mr. Apotheker to lay off employees for the first time in SAP’s history. Revenue from software sales tumbled 37 percent for the first six months of 2009, compared with the previous year. And a stock worth nearly $60 (priced as an American depositary receipt) lost half its value during the downturn and has yet to fully recover. “The real question is whether SAP can put something on top of what we already expect it to do in its core business,” said Knut Woller, an analyst at UniCredit in Munich. Instead of the big acquisitions beloved by Oracle, Mr. Apotheker said, SAP will focus on smaller deals and in-house development. The company also plans a 2010 release of its much-delayed effort in cloud computing, called Business ByDesign. Mr. Apotheker argues that SAP’s software-only strategy positions it as a more neutral player than Oracle and I.B.M., which sell software, services and hardware. Indeed, consolidation has its downside, said Karl Liebstückel, the head of DSAG, an association of German SAP customers. “It would be desirable enough to get all these services in one place,” he said. “The negative side is that the big companies get a certain pricing power.” However, some industry players say SAP may eventually be forced to merge with another company as the consolidation trend creates closer ties between software and hardware. “If Oracle can really make a fast, full package for customers, it will put SAP at a disadvantage,” said Seth Ravin, the chief executive of Rimini Street, a start-up in Las Vegas that services SAP software. “I think it will be harder and harder for SAP to remain independent.” Though SAP entertained an acquisition overture from Microsoft six years ago, Mr. Apotheker is having none of it today. “It is in the best interests of our customers, shareholders, our employees and all of our stakeholders for SAP to remain a strong, growing, profitable independent software company,” he said. He added that the board supports him fully. The founders of SAP, who include the company’s chairman, Hasso Plattner, own a 28.7 percent stake, which is large enough to block a hostile deal. Mr. Apotheker is a German citizen, born in Aachen, but his French-inflected English hints at a more cosmopolitan upbringing. The son of two Jews who escaped the Holocaust, Mr. Apotheker grew up in Antwerp, Belgium, and speaks French with his immediate family and Hebrew with his Israeli relatives. Within SAP, he earned his stripes by beginning to turn around the company’s foundering American operations in 2002. Slowly, he stopped a staff hemorrhage and increased the focus on Internet-based products, while also running SAP’s global sales and marketing. A top agenda item now is to finally release Business ByDesign, SAP’s attempt to expand its market to smaller companies through the cloud computing model. SAP has been late to the field, allowing companies like Salesforce.com and NetSuite to carve out significant positions. “They have bungled the whole cloud computing trend,” said Patrick Walravens, co-director of technology research at JMP Securities. “It has been one mistake after another.” SAP is also retooling its workhorse, the SAP Business Suite 7, so customers can buy only the pieces of its software that they need. Mr. Apotheker disputes the notion that SAP is acquisition-shy, and he points to its purchase of Highdeal, a French designer of billing technology for the telecommunications industry, as a case in point. And in 2007, SAP spent $6.8 billion to buy Business Objects, a French creator of software in the red-hot business intelligence field  one of the largest software acquisitions in recent years. But Mr. Apotheker says SAP prefers to develop products in-house. “We focus on engineering our stuff to the best extent humanly possible,” he said. Carter Dougherty reported from Walldorf, Germany, and Ashlee Vance from San Francisco.

Indeed, consolidation has its downside, said Karl Liebstückel, the head of DSAG, an association of German SAP customers. “It would be desirable enough to get all these services in one place,” he said. “The negative side is that the big companies get a certain pricing power.” However, some industry players say SAP may eventually be forced to merge with another company as the consolidation trend creates closer ties between software and hardware. “If Oracle can really make a fast, full package for customers, it will put SAP at a disadvantage,” said Seth Ravin, the chief executive of Rimini Street, a start-up in Las Vegas that services SAP software. “I think it will be harder and harder for SAP to remain independent.” Though SAP entertained an acquisition overture from Microsoft six years ago, Mr. Apotheker is having none of it today. “It is in the best interests of our customers, shareholders, our employees and all of our stakeholders for SAP to remain a strong, growing, profitable independent software company,” he said. He added that the board supports him fully. The founders of SAP, who include the company’s chairman, Hasso Plattner, own a 28.7 percent stake, which is large enough to block a hostile deal. Mr. Apotheker is a German citizen, born in Aachen, but his French-inflected English hints at a more cosmopolitan upbringing. The son of two Jews who escaped the Holocaust, Mr. Apotheker grew up in Antwerp, Belgium, and speaks French with his immediate family and Hebrew with his Israeli relatives. Within SAP, he earned his stripes by beginning to turn around the company’s foundering American operations in 2002. Slowly, he stopped a staff hemorrhage and increased the focus on Internet-based products, while also running SAP’s global sales and marketing. A top agenda item now is to finally release Business ByDesign, SAP’s attempt to expand its market to smaller companies through the cloud computing model. SAP has been late to the field, allowing companies like Salesforce.com and NetSuite to carve out significant positions. “They have bungled the whole cloud computing trend,” said Patrick Walravens, co-director of technology research at JMP Securities. “It has been one mistake after another.” SAP is also retooling its workhorse, the SAP Business Suite 7, so customers can buy only the pieces of its software that they need. Mr. Apotheker disputes the notion that SAP is acquisition-shy, and he points to its purchase of Highdeal, a French designer of billing technology for the telecommunications industry, as a case in point. And in 2007, SAP spent $6.8 billion to buy Business Objects, a French creator of software in the red-hot business intelligence field  one of the largest software acquisitions in recent years. But Mr. Apotheker says SAP prefers to develop products in-house. “We focus on engineering our stuff to the best extent humanly possible,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Sun Microsystems Inc. On Tuesday, Sun reported its largest drop in third-quarter sales since 2002. The sales falloff underscores the challenges that Oracle will take on when it acquires Sun for $7.4 billion and becomes one of the major players in the market for server computers. Sun’s woes are the result of long-term strategic problems, recession-choked corporate spending and doubts surrounding the future of its products. “The deceleration in the business was pronounced,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at the investment research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. For the quarter that ended March 29, Sun posted a net loss of $201 million, or 27 cents a share. That’s a sharp downturn from the loss of $34 million, or 4 cents a share, it reported the same period last year. Revenue at the company, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., tumbled to $2.6 billion, down 20 percent from $3.27 billion a year ago. The last similar third-quarter decline occurred in 2002, when revenue fell 24 percent, as the former dot-com darling reeled from reduced Internet infrastructure spending. Excluding charges for restructuring and other items, Sun missed the consensus analyst forecast for its net income by 5 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Sun’s revenue also fell well below the consensus forecast of $2.86 billion. Breaking from past practice, Sun canceled its planned conference call with investors and securities analysts to discuss the results. Oracle’s decision to buy Sun caught those watching the technology infrastructure market by surprise. Traditionally, Oracle has sold databases and business application software, partnering with hardware makers like Sun, Hewlett-Packard and Dell. With Sun, Oracle would move into direct competition with its partners, selling Sun’s server and storage hardware. Oracle would also gain Sun’s software assets, like its Solaris operating system and Java programming language. Oracle has yet to comment in detail on its new role as a hardware maker. Sun’s sales may have been affected by the uncertainty over its future. In March. I.B.M.’s negotiations to buy Sun became public. Ultimately, Sun’s board rejected I.B.M.’s offer. “Customer uncertainty presents a significant pressure point on their revenue going forward,” Mr. Sacconaghi said. While Sun cut research and development and administrative costs during the quarter, its revenue fell at a quicker clip. This disparity again highlighted concerns about Sun’s cost structure, which has been characterized as bloated for years. Analysts expect Oracle to cut up to 10,000 jobs after acquiring Sun and its 30,000-plus work force. If the acquisition closes as planned this summer, Sun may have issued its last financial report as an independent company, marking an unceremonious end to one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent companies. Shares of Sun were flat during Tuesday’s trading, closing at $9.16 a share, and were little changed after hours.

They prefer to buy a complete, customized machine from one supplier. Corporate customers increasingly want the same thing: a one-stop shop for hardware, software and services. And the largest technology companies are deploying their huge cash hoards to make acquisitions to bolster their ability to be that single provider. That trend drove Oracle, a leader in business software, to announce Monday that it was spending $7.4 billion to buy an ailing Sun Microsystems and get into the computer hardware business. Oracle beat out rival I.B.M., which considered buying Sun to enhance its own software offerings but ended serious acquisition talks about two weeks ago. ''Oracle will be the only company that can engineer an integrated system -- applications to disk -- where all the pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it themselves,'' Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, said Monday. The drive to consolidate has made life difficult for independent companies like Sun, and the fall of such an industry stalwart highlights the mounting pressure on smaller firms in the computer, storage and software industries to find buyers. Even larger companies like EMC and Dell could be vulnerable, industry observers say. ''I believe that we are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning consolidation game,'' said William T. Coleman III, a former Sun executive and co-founder of BEA Systems, who is now chief of the software start-up Cassatt. ''It's not over by any stretch of the imagination, and there are drastic things that still have to happen.'' Five years ago, Oracle bought PeopleSoft for more than $10 billion, igniting a furious rush to scoop up other business software makers. Oracle alone has since bought more than 40 other companies, spending close to $15 billion for BEA and Siebel Systems alone. Many of the companies purchased by Oracle had carved out a niche for themselves during the Internet build-out, providing unique functions that assisted a rapid infrastructure expansion. In the years after the dot-com bust, however, customers grew weary of visits from hordes of software salesmen peddling isolated wares. A simpler model evolved, in which a handful of companies like Oracle, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard bought dozens of smaller players and then competed to sell most of the software needed to run a modern business. ''The core just keeps getting denser and denser,'' said Randall N. Spratt, the chief information officer at McKesson, one of the nation's largest health care companies. ''We welcome large-scale players at the core.'' While software companies led the last round of consolidation, the hardware industry now appears poised for its own reshaping. ''I think we're at an inflection point,'' said Patricia C. Sueltz, a former I.B.M. and Sun executive, who runs the start-up LogLogic. For example, Rackable Systems, a smaller server computer maker, announced plans this month to buy Silicon Graphics for $25 million. Like Sun, Silicon Graphics started in 1982, and had been one of the fastest-growing businesses in America during its heyday, selling billions of dollars of computers a year. As the computer business has matured, companies that handcraft products for top performance face a harsh reality: Standard equipment can now handle most business tasks, and what matters most to customers now is large scale -- and the low prices that come with it. Over the last decade, H.P. has driven much of the consolidation through a series of large acquisitions. It bought Compaq Computer in 2001, which affected both the PC and server markets as other companies fought to expand and match H.P.'s reach. For example, the Chinese computer maker Lenovo bought I.B.M.'s PC business, and Acer, based in Taiwan, acquired Gateway, which had already acquired eMachines.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/technology/companies/21sun.html?ref=oraclecorporation">In Sun, Oracle Sees a Software Gem<date>Published: April 20, 2009</date><text>In its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Oracle sees a technology company that is a software gem, skillful in computer design and ripe for cost-cutting.

The big database software company’s agreement Monday to buy Sun for $7.4 billion, analysts say, also promises to make Oracle a more formidable competitor in the lucrative market for corporate computing, especially against I.B.M., Sun’s previous suitor. The Oracle-Sun deal came little more than two weeks after I.B.M. ended its talks with Sun. The Sun board balked after I.B.M. lowered its offer to $9.40 a share from $10. The Oracle bid, at $9.50 a share, will have a net cost to Oracle of $5.6 billion, after accounting for the value of Sun’s cash and debt. Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, said in a conference call Monday morning that Sun’s Java programming language and its Solaris operating system were the main attractions. He said Java, the language used in most computer science schools and a technology used daily by millions of software developers, was “the single most important software asset we have ever acquired.” More of Oracle’s corporate database software runs on Solaris, a version of Unix, than on any other operating system. In the last few years, however, Oracle has moved to make Hewlett-Packard and Dell stronger allies, as Sun’s business has declined. With Sun, Oracle will more directly compete against I.B.M., H.P. and other giants selling products and services used in corporate data centers by big corporations. The move by Oracle is part of the trend of the largest technology companies to assemble more offerings  hardware, software and services  for corporate customers, often through acquisitions, as I.B.M., H.P., Cisco and Oracle have all done in recent years. “Oracle is transforming itself into a soup-to-nuts information technology vendor,” said Gordon Haff, an analyst at Illuminata, a technology industry research firm. Among industry rivals, the Oracle-Sun deal, analysts say, has the greatest potential impact on I.B.M. and H.P. “This deal promises to revitalize a systems competitor that I.B.M. and H.P. were writing off as dead,” Mr. Haff said. Oracle can offer a more complete set of corporate software, from Sun’s operating system and programming tools to Oracle’s database and business applications to automate operations like finance and customer relations management. The combined company, according to Oracle and Sun executives, will be able tweak and integrate its software to reduce costs and bugs, and to tighten security. Sun’s computer designers, they said, can tailor hardware to the combined company’s software, promising further gains in efficiency. Executives from the two companies pointed repeatedly to the benefits of this “systems” approach, combining software and hardware. Yet while Sun makes most of its revenue from selling computers, Oracle executives emphasized that they did not regard Sun as a hardware company, which suggests factory ownership and large capital investments. Safra Catz, Oracle’s president, called Sun a “modern technology company” that “outsources nearly all the manufacturing, assembly and servicing of its hardware.” Yet Sun has struggled, and corporate and government customers have expressed doubts about its future, eroding its business. Under Oracle’s wing, analysts say, Sun suddenly looks much stronger. George Weiss, an analyst at Gartner, said an Oracle-Sun combination “really amounts to another axis to I.B.M. in offering both hardware and software. This could open up significant new opportunities for both Oracle and Sun in a lot of corporate accounts, especially the teetering Sun accounts.” The Oracle-Sun deal also promises to subtly alter the competitive fault lines in an industry where the biggest companies compete in some businesses and cooperate in others. Sun is expected to be smaller and leaner under Oracle. “We will be able to run Sun at substantially higher margins,” Ms. Catz said. She estimated that Sun’s operations would generate an additional $1.5 billion a year in operating profit, and add 15 cents a share to Oracle’s profit in the first year. Under Oracle, she said, the Sun businesses would be able to achieve operating efficiencies “far in excess of what Sun has done to date.” The Oracle and Sun executives made no comment about coming job cuts at Sun, and they took no questions during the conference call. But industry analysts estimated that Oracle’s cost savings from Sun operations suggest job cuts of up to 10,000 workers from Sun’s payroll of more than 30,000. Sun shares closed at $9.15, up 37 percent from their closing price of $6.69 on Friday. Ashlee Vance contributed reporting.

It has achieved this by making it easier and cheaper than ever to analyze and access the unprecedented volumes of data churned out by the Internet. By mapping information spread across thousands of cheap computers and by creating an easier means for writing analytical queries, engineers no longer have to solve a grand computer science challenge every time they want to dig into data. Instead, they simply ask a question. “It’s a breakthrough,” said Mark Seager, head of advanced computing at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “I think this type of technology will solve a whole new class of problems and open new services.” Three top engineers from Google, Yahoo and Facebook, along with a former executive from Oracle, are betting it will. They announced a start-up Monday called Cloudera, based in Burlingame, Calif., that will try to bring Hadoop’s capabilities to industries as far afield as genomics, retailing and finance. The core concepts behind the software were nurtured at Google. By 2003, Google found it increasingly difficult to ingest and index the entire Internet on a regular basis. Adding to these woes, Google lacked a relatively easy to use means of analyzing its vast stores of information to figure out the quality of search results and how people behaved across its numerous online services. To address those issues, a pair of Google engineers invented a technology called MapReduce that, when paired with the intricate file management technology the company uses to index and catalog the Web, solved the problem. The MapReduce technology makes it possible to break large sets of data into little chunks, spread that information across thousands of computers, ask the computers questions and receive cohesive answers. Google rewrote its entire search index system to take advantage of MapReduce’s ability to analyze all of this information and its ability to keep complex jobs working even when lots of computers die. MapReduce represented a couple of breakthroughs. The technology has allowed Google’s search software to run faster on cheaper, less-reliable computers, which means lower capital costs. In addition, it makes manipulating the data Google collects so much easier that more engineers can hunt for secrets about how people use the company’s technology instead of worrying about keeping computers up and running. “It’s a really big hammer,” said Christophe Bisciglia, 28, a former Google engineer and a founder of Cloudera. “When you have a really big hammer, everything becomes a nail.” The technology opened the possibility of asking a question about Google’s data  like what did all the people search for before they searched for BMW  and it began ascertaining more and more about the relationships between groups of Web sites, pictures and documents. In short, Google got smarter. The MapReduce technology helps do grunt work, too. For example, it grabs huge quantities of images  like satellite photos  from many sources and assembles that information into one picture. The result is improved versions of products like Google Maps and Google Earth. Google has kept the inner workings of MapReduce and related file management software a secret, but it did publish papers on some of the underlying techniques. That bit of information was enough for Doug Cutting, who had been working as a software consultant, to create his own version of the technology, called Hadoop. (The name came from his son’s plush toy elephant, which has since been banished to a sock drawer.) People at Yahoo had read the same papers as Mr. Cutting, and thought they needed to even the playing field with their search and advertising competitor. So Yahoo hired Mr. Cutting and set to work. “The thinking was if we had a big team of guys, we could really make this rock,” Mr. Cutting said. “Within six months, Hadoop was a critical part of Yahoo and within a year or two it became supercritical.” A Hadoop-powered analysis also determines what 300 million people a month see. Yahoo tracks peoples’ behavior to gauge what types of stories and other content they like and tries to alter its homepage accordingly. Similar software tries to match ads with certain types of stories. And the better the ad, the more Yahoo can charge for it. Yahoo is estimated to have spent tens of millions of dollars developing Hadoop, which remains open-source software that anyone can use or modify. It then began to spread through Silicon Valley and tech companies beyond. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on March 17, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.BURLINGAME, Calif.  In the span of just a couple of years, Hadoop, a free software program named after a toy elephant, has taken over some of the world’s biggest Web sites.

In addition, it makes manipulating the data Google collects so much easier that more engineers can hunt for secrets about how people use the company’s technology instead of worrying about keeping computers up and running. “It’s a really big hammer,” said Christophe Bisciglia, 28, a former Google engineer and a founder of Cloudera. “When you have a really big hammer, everything becomes a nail.” The technology opened the possibility of asking a question about Google’s data  like what did all the people search for before they searched for BMW  and it began ascertaining more and more about the relationships between groups of Web sites, pictures and documents. In short, Google got smarter. The MapReduce technology helps do grunt work, too. For example, it grabs huge quantities of images  like satellite photos  from many sources and assembles that information into one picture. The result is improved versions of products like Google Maps and Google Earth. Google has kept the inner workings of MapReduce and related file management software a secret, but it did publish papers on some of the underlying techniques. That bit of information was enough for Doug Cutting, who had been working as a software consultant, to create his own version of the technology, called Hadoop. (The name came from his son’s plush toy elephant, which has since been banished to a sock drawer.) People at Yahoo had read the same papers as Mr. Cutting, and thought they needed to even the playing field with their search and advertising competitor. So Yahoo hired Mr. Cutting and set to work. “The thinking was if we had a big team of guys, we could really make this rock,” Mr. Cutting said. “Within six months, Hadoop was a critical part of Yahoo and within a year or two it became supercritical.” A Hadoop-powered analysis also determines what 300 million people a month see. Yahoo tracks peoples’ behavior to gauge what types of stories and other content they like and tries to alter its homepage accordingly. Similar software tries to match ads with certain types of stories. And the better the ad, the more Yahoo can charge for it. Yahoo is estimated to have spent tens of millions of dollars developing Hadoop, which remains open-source software that anyone can use or modify. It then began to spread through Silicon Valley and tech companies beyond. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/sports/othersports/07sailing.html?ref=oraclecorporation">In Inaugural Race, a Respite From Legal Acrimony<date>Published: February 6, 2009</date><text>AUCKLAND, New Zealand  For a sport in need of reassuring scenes, the familiar water views provided by New Zealand’s “City of Sails” seem like the ideal tonic. Just being here is a flashback to better times for the America’s Cup and the global economy. Here, as before, are the ocean currents and sea breeze generating whitecaps on the Hauraki Gulf, with a fair-sized spectator fleet afloat. Here, as before, are the sailors and their public generating plenty of nocturnal energy in the watering holes and culinary hot spots of the Viaduct Basin. For the many who have had their fill of litigation, there is even the weird and wondrous sight of the antagonists, BMW Oracle Racing and Alinghi, sharing the same space on the racing and barbecue circuits. Weirder yet, they are sharing the same America’s Cup yachts in this inaugural Louis Vuitton Pacific Series. The trouble is, with the Cup in its 19th month of legal limbo and more oral arguments scheduled for Tuesday in the New York State Court of Appeals, it feels rather like a mirage. “Look, Larry and Ernesto are going to court next week, and all the fun and games down here, and the happiness and shared beers, et cetera, is not going to change that fact,” said Grant Dalton, the managing director of Emirates Team New Zealand. For now, Larry Ellison, the billionaire owner of BMW Oracle, is in Auckland and sailing with his team. Ernesto Bertarelli, the billionaire owner of Alinghi, is not expected to arrive until this weekend, if at all. Neither Ellison nor Bertarelli played a definitive role in the Pacific Series. Organized in just four months, it is the brainchild of Dalton and Bruno Troublé, a silver-haired Frenchman and former skipper who has long represented Louis Vuitton’s stake in the gilded lily of the America’s Cup. Like Yves Carcelle, chairman and chief executive at Louis Vuitton, Troublé was frustrated at being relegated to the role of mere sponsor at the 2007 America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain. In previous editions, Vuitton had been the organizational and financial impetus behind the challenger series. But for 2007, Bertarelli, whose team held the Cup, restructured the regatta to bring the challenger series and America’s Cup match under the same management. “We were just signing checks last time,” he said. Dalton, whose team depends on public good will and, to a degree, public financing, was eager to re-energize the base. “We haven’t lost the Kiwi public, but they don’t know what’s going on,” he said. To cut costs and promote close racing, the matches in Auckland are being conducted with similar, evenly matched pairs of yachts, an important change from the design differences that typically define Cup competition. Team New Zealand supplied its pair of boats from the last Cup. BMW Oracle then offered its pair, which Salvatore Sarno, the South African shipping magnate who owns Team Shosholoza, arranged to transport from Spain to New Zealand at a preferential rate. Economic forces whittled an initial pool of 17 serious candidates down to 10 teams, including Alinghi, which agreed to compete after Team New Zealand dropped its lawsuits against the Swiss team, Société Nautique de Genève, in New York. BMW Oracle, however, did not follow suit, continuing to dispute the legal right of a new Spanish yacht club, Club Náutico Español de Vela, to be Alinghi’s challenger of record for the next Cup. Whatever bonhomie is in evidence here between the teams’ sailors is not yet being reflected by the teams’ lawyers. “Obviously, this isn’t the ideal situation we’re in, and it’s just good to get some racing going again,” said Russell Coutts, the BMW Oracle skipper. “The court case, that’s coming up soon, and so it’s going to get a result one way or the other, so I think that will be a good thing. Obviously, if we win, we want to negotiate a multi-challenger event.” Bertarelli has disputed that, accusing Ellison and Coutts of trying to find a backdoor approach to racing for the Cup instead of going through the rigors of a true challenger series before facing the defender. If BMW Oracle wins in court and negotiations with Alinghi break down again, there is still a chance the two teams will contest the Cup in a one-on-one match later this year in huge multi-hulls. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on February 7, 2009, on page D2 of the New York edition.AUCKLAND, New Zealand  For a sport in need of reassuring scenes, the familiar water views provided by New Zealand’s “City of Sails” seem like the ideal tonic.

The business software company reported that net income declined 1 percent, to $1.3 billion, or 25 cents a share, during its second quarter, which ended Nov. 30, while earnings remained flat at 25 cents a share. Oracle said that revenue rose 6 percent, to $5.6 billion, from the quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of the strengthening dollar, revenue grew 12 percent. Company executives also said the stronger dollar shaved 4 cents a share from its net income for the period. “We feel extremely good about our results,” said Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s president. She said the company was able to meet its growth targets on a constant currency basis. The dollar gained 15 percent against the euro during the second quarter, as the economic crisis expanded, the company said. Approximately half of Oracle’s sales are from outside the United States. Although the strong dollar took a toll on Oracle’s earnings during the second quarter, investors had braced for worse news that did not come. Many on Wall Street had been expecting far worse news, including the possibility that Oracle would announce a round of firings to cut costs. Instead, the company told investors that it saw healthy demand during the quarter and that customers continued to place new orders and renew old ones. “Given the environment and given the currency fluctuations, these are pretty solid results,” said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. “Clearly they were able to control costs.” Analysts were expecting net income equivalent to 25 cents a share, but had expected revenue would reach $5.86 billion. Shares of Oracle fell 13 cents, to close at $16.61. They rose to $17.15 in after-hours trading. Sales of new software licenses, which are seen as a bellwether of corporate demand, declined 3 percent, to $1.6 billion. But without the impact of fluctuating current rates, new software license revenue would have grown 5 percent. Oracle had been hoping to increase its new software license sales by 2 to 12 percent during the second quarter. Oracle generated $7.6 billion in free cash flow in the last 12 months, up 15 percent over the same period the previous 12 months, the company said. Oracle forecast an 8 to 11 percent increase from its revenue of $5.35 billion in the third quarter of last year.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Monica M. Davey/European Pressphoto Agency Safra A. Catz, Oracles president, and Lawrence J. Ellison, its chief, said results from its recent quarter were fine. Related Times Topics: Oracle Corporation “It is a real nothing special quarter,” Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s president, said. The business software maker closed large deals at usual rates during August, Ms. Catz said. Given the concerns in a week in which financial giants tumbled, Oracle provided some reassurance. “Our exposure to banking customers is in the low-single digits,” Ms. Catz said. “Our exposure to U.S. banks is even lower.” She said Oracle had assessed the amount of business it did with some of the troubled companies on Wall Street and did not think their issues had any material impact on sales. Shares of Oracle rose 65 cents, to $18.75. They rose $1.15, or 6.1 percent, in after-hours trading. Oracle reported net income for its first fiscal quarter, which ended Aug. 31, of $1.1 billion, or 21 cents a share, up 28 percent from $840 million a year ago. The results topped predictions by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The company said revenue grew 18 percent to $5.3 billion from the year-ago quarter. Oracle’s new software license revenue  a crucial metric linked to the company’s health  rose 14 percent, to $1.2 billion, below the midrange of its forecast. “I think the expectations were for a lot worse, and I think this is respectable,” said Brent Thill, a securities analyst at Citigroup. Some of Oracle’s resilience cited by both analysts and company officials stemmed from its recurring license stream and numerous acquisitions. “The results underscore our belief that the company is successful at cross-selling into recently acquired companies’ accounts and benefits from an expanded product footprint,” said Adam Holt, a software industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. Despite management’s confidence, Oracle started to show that changes in the economy might affect future sales. “The dollar has strengthened enormously,” Ms. Catz said. Oracle, which does extensive business overseas, has benefited from a weak dollar that makes overseas sales more competitive. It expects that benefit to vanish in the coming quarter. Revenue is expected to increase 12 percent to 15 percent, assuming exchange rates stay where they are, Ms. Catz said. Oracle reported revenue of $5.3 billion in last year’s second quarter. Oracle also expects new software license sales to grow 5 percent to 15 percent. New license revenue jumped 38 percent in the same quarter last year. While Oracle’s flagship database software sold well, its business applications sales declined for the first time since the first quarter in fiscal 2005, said Mr. Thill of Citigroup. “The quarter was good, but it wasn’t great,” Mr. Thill said. “The applications business is clearly showing some signs of weakness.” Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, said that the company’s acquisitions helped it gain share for middleware, a layer of business software that communicates between databases and various software systems. Oracle closed its $8.5 billion purchase of BEA, one of the leading middleware players, in April. “We either passed I.B.M. or we are about to pass I.B.M. in the middleware business,” Mr. Ellison said.

But in the ensuing year, despite her popularity with employees and on Wall Street, her relationship with her directors, and especially VMware’s chairman, Joseph M. Tucci, grew increasingly chilly. On July 7, she found out just how cold it had become. After Ms. Greene made a special presentation to VMware’s board, Mr. Tucci, who heads VMware’s parent company, EMC, pulled her aside, according to people familiar with the events, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal company decisions. Inviting Mendel Rosenblum, Ms. Greene’s husband and the co-founder of VMware, into the room, Mr. Tucci told Ms. Greene she was fired, effective immediately. And he said the board wanted Mr. Rosenblum, VMware’s chief scientist, to take her seat on the board. Mr. Rosenblum declined the offer. When Ms. Greene’s firing was announced to investors the next morning, VMware’s shares plunged 24 percent, and the high-flying company was thrown into a tailspin from which it has yet to recover. In the wake of Ms. Greene’s departure, three other key executives loyal to her have left, including Mr. Rosenblum, who announced his resignation and return to Stanford as a full-time professor in a companywide message on Monday night. Competitors like Microsoft, Citrix Systems and Oracle are readying fresh assaults on VMware’s dominant position in the market for virtualization software, which allows businesses to use their computer servers more efficiently by running more programs on them. And VMware’s new chief executive, Paul Maritz, once a top executive at Microsoft, is fighting to articulate how VMware can evolve from a darling upstart to a mature player capable of maintaining its growth while facing off against some of the world’s technology heavyweights. Ms. Greene and EMC officials declined to comment on the circumstances of her departure. But in a telephone interview Sunday from Ghana, Mr. Maritz said, “Any time you have a company in transition, you have challenges." At 10 years old, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based VMware is the leading maker of virtualization software, which has become increasingly attractive to business customers because it allows them to run multiple copies of a program on a computer, saving hardware and energy costs. VMware managed to double its revenue almost every year throughout the company’s early history. It became a true standout in a broader business software market characterized by slowing growth. EMC, a major player in storage software, acquired VMware in 2004 for $635 million. In August of 2007, EMC looked to capitalize on VMware’s status and rising fortunes via an initial public offering. Priced at $29, shares of VMware took off immediately and hit a high of more than $124 on Oct. 31. They closed at $34.91 Monday. Ms. Greene, who is fond of windsurfing, designed offshore oil rigs early in her career and came to epitomize VMware’s engineering-focused culture. Although she was feared by some employees for her direct, confrontational style, many found her passion for technology endearing and inspirational. However, the relationship between Ms. Greene and Mr. Tucci was always rocky. She believed Mr. Tucci did not understand VMware business or her contributions, and he viewed her as too demanding. Their spat became more public when Ms. Greene complained about a meager stock options grant made ahead of the I.P.O. in a 2007 Fortune interview. In recent quarters, as VMware failed to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations, their relationship deteriorated further. Ms. Greene was fired just ahead of VMware’s second-quarter earnings announcement, in which it reported 54 percent year-over-year growth on revenue of $456 million but a more modest long-term forecast for the year. “The issue has not been necessarily absolute growth,” said Adam Holt, a software industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. “It has been the growth relative to expectations and the rate of change of that growth." Mr. Maritz, who was a top executive at EMC just before being appointed to VMware, is charged with keeping VMware’s product line vibrant while improving growth and repairing relationships with investors. As the company prepared to court customers and partners at its annual VMworld conference in Las Vegas next week, Mr. Maritz has yet to formalize a specific strategy to accomplish those goals. Just two months into the job, it is still too early to take on any “seismic moves,” he said. Mr. Maritz’s challenge has been made more difficult by the recent executive departures. Last week, VMware disclosed that Richard Sarwal, the executive vice president in charge of research and development, had resigned and returned to work at Oracle, which is also developing virtualization software. Mr. Sarwal spent less than a year at VMware, after being hired by Ms. Greene as part of an eight-month search to fill the crucial research role. In addition, Paul Chan, the vice president of product development at VMware, quietly resigned in August, saying he will leave in October after more than seven years at the company leading product introductions. Meanwhile, VMware is facing the most serious competition in its history. Microsoft is holding an event this week for customers and partners to promote the release of its own brand of virtualization software, which is included with the Windows Server 2008 operating system. Red Hat, which makes operating systems based on Linux, just purchased Qumranet, a maker of virtualization software that runs on servers and desktop computers. Sun and Citrix are also set to reveal new versions of their competing products. Mr. Maritz acknowledged that the executive departures have been difficult. For a software company dependent on its intellectual property, “having the best and brightest minds is critical.” Mr. Sarwal’s departure was especially painful, but Mr. Maritz said he hoped to work with Oracle rather than compete with it. Some observers contend that an overhaul of VMware’s management could prove beneficial. “I would have liked for there to have been a smoother transition,” said Sushil Wagle, an analyst at J.&amp; W. Seligman who follows EMC. “But the old founders are very entrepreneurial and driven in that way. You need to think differently when a company gets as big as VMware.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on September 9, 2008, on page C3 of the New York edition.In the summer of 2007, Diane Greene was lauded as a business hero for leading VMware, a maker of business software, to the hottest stock debut since Google.

Just two months into the job, it is still too early to take on any “seismic moves,” he said. Mr. Maritz’s challenge has been made more difficult by the recent executive departures. Last week, VMware disclosed that Richard Sarwal, the executive vice president in charge of research and development, had resigned and returned to work at Oracle, which is also developing virtualization software. Mr. Sarwal spent less than a year at VMware, after being hired by Ms. Greene as part of an eight-month search to fill the crucial research role. In addition, Paul Chan, the vice president of product development at VMware, quietly resigned in August, saying he will leave in October after more than seven years at the company leading product introductions. Meanwhile, VMware is facing the most serious competition in its history. Microsoft is holding an event this week for customers and partners to promote the release of its own brand of virtualization software, which is included with the Windows Server 2008 operating system. Red Hat, which makes operating systems based on Linux, just purchased Qumranet, a maker of virtualization software that runs on servers and desktop computers. Sun and Citrix are also set to reveal new versions of their competing products. Mr. Maritz acknowledged that the executive departures have been difficult. For a software company dependent on its intellectual property, “having the best and brightest minds is critical.” Mr. Sarwal’s departure was especially painful, but Mr. Maritz said he hoped to work with Oracle rather than compete with it. Some observers contend that an overhaul of VMware’s management could prove beneficial. “I would have liked for there to have been a smoother transition,” said Sushil Wagle, an analyst at J.&amp; W. Seligman who follows EMC. “But the old founders are very entrepreneurial and driven in that way. You need to think differently when a company gets as big as VMware.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E4D71639F936A1575BC0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=oraclecorporation">Shift at the Top Emphasizes SAP's Bottom Line<date>Published: August 25, 2008</date><text>WALLDORF, Germany -- Henning Kagermann wants you to know that he is more than just a software geek. Mr. Kagermann, the longtime chief executive of SAP, the giant maker of complex computer applications for business, is in the middle of a slow transition in which he will yield the top job entirely to Léo Apotheker, now the co-chief executive, in March. Mr. Apotheker rose through the ranks of the SAP sales force, a notably different career path than Mr. Kagermann, a former physics professor who made his name as a developer. The handover has fed an irresistible narrative in financial markets: the software egghead who shoveled cash into new projects is yielding to the uncompromising money maker. It is also a story that Mr. Kagermann dismisses with an unprintable word and a terse reminder that he can do more than write code. ''People forget that I was head of sales for a few years,'' Mr. Kagermann said in an interview. ''I was not always the tech guy.'' There is some truth to the tale, to be sure, but the reasons run deeper than a mere change of chief executives. The company is indeed shifting toward more of a focus on the bottom line, and less on the multibillion-dollar investments in technology that helped make it the market leader in the lucrative field of business software. The goal, it seems clear, is for SAP to show that it can not just produce sophisticated software that companies depend on to run their businesses but also do as well as its American archrival, Oracle, in satisfying the demands of investors. Oracle achieved a pretax profit margin of about 35 percent last year, well ahead of the 26.7 percent operating margin that SAP managed in 2007. That is one reason SAP's stock price has languished in spite of years of sales growth. ''The only reason SAP is focused on that number is because Oracle is focused on that number,'' said Joshua Greenbaum, analyst at Enterprise Applications Consulting in Berkeley, Calif. ''They are efficient, and get great margins. There is flat-out envy on SAP's part.'' SAP can take heart that it controls a larger market share than Oracle, according to Albert Pang, an analyst with IDC, a Boston-based technology consulting firm. In 2007, SAP had about 10 percent of the $88 billion market in revenue for business software, while Oracle lagged with 6.6 percent. In subsets of the market -- like enterprise resource planning, which tries to oversee many basic operations -- SAP laid claim to 22 percent, almost twice Oracle's 12 percent. But, analysts said, investors have seized on the question of margins and SAP has fed the story unabashedly. Speaking to a technology conference in Las Vegas in February, Mr. Kagermann seemed to suggest SAP would achieve a 35 percent operating margin quickly, an utterance that sent its stock up sharply, surprising SAP officials. So in May, executives seized on the subject at Sapphire, SAP's annual analyst conference, and people who attended recall Mr. Apotheker giving a full-throated endorsement to the goal of higher margins. Knut Woller, a software analyst at UniCredit in Munich, said having a numbers-oriented executive at the top has electrified SAP watchers eager for a trimmer company. ''Apotheker will make it more about sales, simply by virtue of the reason that SAP has to compete,'' he said. Mr. Kagermann has also left his successor a good amount of wiggle room, analysts said. By promising to reach a margin of 35 percent ''in the medium term,'' he is saying it could take as few as three years, or as many as six, while still dangling a juicy target in front of analysts. ''There is no fundamental reason not to achieve it,'' Mr. Kagermann said. The man who transitioned from professor of theoretical physics in the picturesque city of Heidelberg to market-moving executive no doubt has more cunning in him than many would guess. With his swoosh of wavy gray hair and narrow, rimless eyeglasses, Mr. Kagermann, 61, conveys the impression of a mad scientist, though his genial, informal manner makes him approachable. Whether talking profit margins or the future of software development, he rocks back and forth in his chair, often blinking furiously, as if to convey the point that no thought worth having should be pondered lightly. His music tastes include heavy metal, especially groups like Threshold, a English band that displays a talent for brainy lyrics that stimulate the mind even as it punishes eardrums.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/technology/26oracle.html?ref=oraclecorporation">Strong Sales of Software Lift Oracle’s Net Income<date>Published: June 26, 2008</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO  Oracle sounded a warning bell that growth was likely to slow in the first quarter as the company absorbed its latest major acquisition, BEA Systems. Oracle, the second-largest independent software company after Microsoft, did however ease investors’ concerns about weaker corporate sales by reporting that net income in its fourth quarter, which ended May 31, rose 27 percent, to $2.04 billion or 39 cents a share on strong software sales. The company said that revenue climbed 24 percent to $7.2 billion, from $5.8 billion in the quarter a year ago. Sales of new software licenses rose 27 percent to $3.1 billion, from $2.5 billion. Oracle’s growth improved in the United States, with new license sales rising 22 percent. “These strong results indicate that Oracle’s hard-charging sales culture and diversified product lineup are paying off, even in challenging economic times,” said Andy Miedler, an analyst with Edward Jones. Analysts had not expected Oracle to do as well as it did. Shares of Oracle fell 78 cents, or more than 3 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the report was released. Earlier in the day, its shares rose 32 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $22.55. Investors were reacting to the company predicting that because it had strong growth in the first quarter a year ago, by comparison, growth in the current quarter may look weak. Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s chief financial officer and co-president, told investors in a conference call Wednesday that she expected software license growth in the current quarter of only 10 to 20 percent, but that over all she was “confident about Oracle’s prospects.” She said that in last year’s first quarter, new license growth jumped 35 percent. “We are aware of the broader economic environment in which we operate, and we can’t predict the economy from one quarter to the next,” Ms. Catz said. Total revenue should rise 18 percent to 20 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier, Ms. Catz said. Oracle expects first-quarter earnings of 26 cents to 27 cents a share, before one-time items, Ms. Catz said. Charles E. Phillips, co-president of Oracle, said the company was taking market share from its competitors, particularly SAP, the big German software maker and Oracle’s chief rival. “This is the third consecutive year we’ve taken applications market share from SAP,” he said. During the fourth quarter, the company closed its $8.5 billion acquisition of BEA Systems, a move that expands Oracle’s software offerings and makes Oracle one of the largest publishers of corporate software known as middleware, one of the industry’s fastest growing segments. Middleware programs operate between a company’s database system and its payroll, inventory and other business management systems that use the data. Oracle has spent $35 billion buying rivals during the last four years in an effort to broaden the range of industries it can sell to. The strategy has been largely successful as corporate buyers increasingly look to buy multiple components from the same vendor. statement More Articles in Technology »SAN FRANCISCO  Oracle sounded a warning bell that growth was likely to slow in the first quarter as the company absorbed its latest major acquisition, BEA Systems.

A big purchase was, as Mr. Ellison put it, “a confession that there’s a failure to innovate.” That is until Mr. Ellison decided about four years ago to go Rambo on this high-tech province of button-downs and khakis with a hostile $10.3 billion bid for PeopleSoft. At first, the bid was considered barbaric. Everyone said Mr. Ellison was bound to fail. After all, as they love to say here, a technology company’s most valuable assets  its engineers  walk out the door every evening. And with a hostile bidder circling, PeopleSoft’s engineers were bound to run. Only they didn’t. I had sought out Mr. Ellison, in part, because if there’s one person responsible for the current run of hostile takeovers in Silicon Valley  Microsoft’s $44.6 billion bid for Yahoo and Electronic Arts’ $2 billion offer for Take-Two Interactive  it may be him. He not only made it acceptable to pursue hostile deals, he proved they could work  more than once. He just sealed a hostile $8.5 billion acquisition of rival BEA Systems in January. And before executives at Microsoft and E.A. ever went hostile, they spent countless hours studying Mr. Ellison’s successes, debating whether a public bid would destroy the prizes they so coveted. Never known for modesty, Mr. Ellison suggested, “They are copying us.” He added, “Others would be foolish not to try.” Nevertheless, a pervasive and illogical fear of consolidation is still very much alive here. Over egg-white omelets at Buck’s in Woodside or Vietnamese at Tamarine in Palo Alto, conversation invariably turns to Yahoo or Take-Two. Yahoo is “under attack from Darth Vader” one venture capitalist told me. “It’s a game developer’s nightmare,” a banker said of E.A.’s bid for Take-Two. The act of merging has always been an emotionally tortured process for corporate America. But at most Fortune 500 companies  where hired hands, not founders, run the business  economics usually wins out over hearts and minds (except in the airline industry recently, where Northwest’s pilot’s union has so far managed to hijack a deal with Delta). But in Silicon Valley, unlike elsewhere in the country, even some of the biggest companies like Yahoo are “are still run by founders who are unwilling to sell for emotional reasons,” Mr. Ellison said, perhaps taking a swipe at Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s chief executive and co-founder, who has been frantically searching for an alternative to Microsoft’s bid. “Sometimes,” he said, “they have a hard time separating their emotions from what’s best for shareholders.” Mr. Ellison even allowed that he would have a hard time selling his own business. “I’m very emotionally involved,” he said. Mr. Ellison, whose distaste for Microsoft is legendary, hinted that he’s actually rooting for his longtime nemesis over his neighbor, Yahoo. “I’ve certainly watched Bill for years,” he said, referring to Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman and co-founder. “MSN is modestly successful. It would be a formidable portal combined with Yahoo.” So far, neither Microsoft nor Electronic Arts has yet to become overtly hostile by starting a proxy contest, still hoping that by handling their targets with care they can win them over. But Mr. Ellison suggested that kid gloves aren’t necessary. “What makes you think that engineers are happier, for example, working at PeopleSoft rather than at Oracle?” he asked. “Who says it’s unfriendly?” The people who are most likely to scream and moan about an acquisition are the marketing people and salespeople  who, by the way, are the most dispensable, he said. Granted, Mr. Ellison may not deserve all the credit  or blame  for the recent outbreak of hostility in the Valley. Some here say Mr. Ellison bought PeopleSoft for its long-term service contracts with big corporations, rather than for its ability to innovate. So if the engineers left, it didn’t matter. PeopleSoft had a defensible business model, at least in the short term. Whatever the case, Silicon Valley needs to wake up to the fact it is soon going to be a consolidating place, if it isn’t already. As Mr. Ellison said, “Our industry is maturing.” Like child stars, many of its companies have to grow up fast  not act like spoiled kids. The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook More Articles in Business »MENLO PARK, Calif.  “It’s crazy to say you will only grow through innovation,” Larry Ellison, the hard-charging chief executive of Oracle, was telling me last week. “It’s bizarre that there’s a stigma to buying something rather than building it yourself.” Here in Silicon Valley, where entrepreneurialism is a religion, people have long taken a dim view of acquisitions. A big purchase was, as Mr. Ellison put it, “a confession that there’s a failure to innovate.” That is until Mr. Ellison decided about four years ago to go Rambo on this high-tech province of button-downs and khakis with a hostile $10.3 billion bid for PeopleSoft. At first, the bid was considered barbaric. Everyone said Mr. Ellison was bound to fail. After all, as they love to say here, a technology company’s most valuable assets  its engineers  walk out the door every evening. And with a hostile bidder circling, PeopleSoft’s engineers were bound to run. Only they didn’t. I had sought out Mr. Ellison, in part, because if there’s one person responsible for the current run of hostile takeovers in Silicon Valley  Microsoft’s $44.6 billion bid for Yahoo and Electronic Arts’ $2 billion offer for Take-Two Interactive  it may be him. He not only made it acceptable to pursue hostile deals, he proved they could work  more than once. He just sealed a hostile $8.5 billion acquisition of rival BEA Systems in January. And before executives at Microsoft and E.A. ever went hostile, they spent countless hours studying Mr. Ellison’s successes, debating whether a public bid would destroy the prizes they so coveted. Never known for modesty, Mr. Ellison suggested, “They are copying us.” He added, “Others would be foolish not to try.” Nevertheless, a pervasive and illogical fear of consolidation is still very much alive here. Over egg-white omelets at Buck’s in Woodside or Vietnamese at Tamarine in Palo Alto, conversation invariably turns to Yahoo or Take-Two. Yahoo is “under attack from Darth Vader” one venture capitalist told me. “It’s a game developer’s nightmare,” a banker said of E.A.’s bid for Take-Two. The act of merging has always been an emotionally tortured process for corporate America. But at most Fortune 500 companies  where hired hands, not founders, run the business  economics usually wins out over hearts and minds (except in the airline industry recently, where Northwest’s pilot’s union has so far managed to hijack a deal with Delta). But in Silicon Valley, unlike elsewhere in the country, even some of the biggest companies like Yahoo are “are still run by founders who are unwilling to sell for emotional reasons,” Mr. Ellison said, perhaps taking a swipe at Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s chief executive and co-founder, who has been frantically searching for an alternative to Microsoft’s bid. “Sometimes,” he said, “they have a hard time separating their emotions from what’s best for shareholders.” Mr. Ellison even allowed that he would have a hard time selling his own business. “I’m very emotionally involved,” he said. Mr. Ellison, whose distaste for Microsoft is legendary, hinted that he’s actually rooting for his longtime nemesis over his neighbor, Yahoo. “I’ve certainly watched Bill for years,” he said, referring to Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman and co-founder. “MSN is modestly successful. It would be a formidable portal combined with Yahoo.” So far, neither Microsoft nor Electronic Arts has yet to become overtly hostile by starting a proxy contest, still hoping that by handling their targets with care they can win them over. But Mr. Ellison suggested that kid gloves aren’t necessary. “What makes you think that engineers are happier, for example, working at PeopleSoft rather than at Oracle?” he asked. “Who says it’s unfriendly?” The people who are most likely to scream and moan about an acquisition are the marketing people and salespeople  who, by the way, are the most dispensable, he said. Granted, Mr. Ellison may not deserve all the credit  or blame  for the recent outbreak of hostility in the Valley. Some here say Mr. Ellison bought PeopleSoft for its long-term service contracts with big corporations, rather than for its ability to innovate. So if the engineers left, it didn’t matter. PeopleSoft had a defensible business model, at least in the short term. Whatever the case, Silicon Valley needs to wake up to the fact it is soon going to be a consolidating place, if it isn’t already.

Skip to next paragraph David Paul Morris/Getty Images Lawrence J. Ellison is chief executive of Oracle, which has made acquisitions that dovetail with its core business. Last month, it reached a deal to buy BEA Systems for $8.5 billion. Related Times Topics: Microsoft-Yahoo Deal Having exhausted its best ideas on how to deal with Google, Microsoft is now working its way down the list to dubious ones  like pursuing a hostile bid for Yahoo. Michael A. Cusumano, who has written several books about the software industry and about Microsoft, is not impressed with Microsoft’s rationale for its Yahoo offer. He said the bid seemed to be a pursuit of “an old-style Internet asset, in decline, and at a premium.” Determined to match Google in search and online advertising, Microsoft has managed to overlook a plain-vanilla strategy, the oldest one in the book: build on its own strengths. What it does best is to sell software to corporations, for all sorts of applications, visible and not so visible, at a handsome profit. If Microsoft thinks this is the right time to try a major acquisition on a scale it has never tried before, it should not pursue Yahoo. Rather, it should acquire another major player in business software, merging Microsoft’s strength with that of another. This is more likely to produce a happier outcome than yoking two ailing businesses, Yahoo’s and its own online offerings, and hoping for a miracle. For an illustration of how Microsoft could select targets more judiciously, Mr. Cusumano, who is a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pointed to the Oracle Corporation’s strategic acquisitions and its prudent use of capital to “roll up firms with similar products and customers to its own.” With impressive regularity  13 strategic acquisitions in 2005, another 13 in 2006 and 11 in 2007  Oracle has picked up key products and customers while avoiding an “oops” slip, venturing too far away from its core business, or paying too much. At no point along the way has it acted in a fit of desperation. Last month, Oracle pulled in another major prize, BEA Systems, a leading software company, for about $8.5 billion. You’ve probably never heard of BEA: it’s doubly obscure, producing the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that large companies use to build behind-the-scenes software systems for their entire business, or “enterprise software.” Both Oracle and BEA are based in Silicon Valley, but their side of the street is not lit by klieg lights and does not get the same attention as the Googles and Yahoos. And, to be honest, it’s not much fun hanging out on the enterprise side of the software business. BEA says its software helps organizations “ensure that business processes are optimally defined, managed, executed and monitored.” Unless you’re playing Business Jargon Bingo, it’s hard to sit still and remain attentive. You have to admire Oracle’s ability to remain focused on the business that serves business and to not be distracted by the buzz of the Web crowd gathered across the street. Microsoft does business software well. Approximately half its revenue comes from business customers for its e-mail infrastructure, database systems, developer tools, Office productivity applications and other mainstays. It has also assembled, through acquisitions, a fledgling line of enterprise software that it calls Microsoft Dynamics. Microsoft would like Dynamics to be viewed as competing head to head with the No. 2 name in enterprise software, Oracle, or the No. 1, SAP of Germany. For the moment, however, Microsoft Dynamics’ parity with those big names is nothing more than wishful aspiration. Professor Cusumano has a suggestion: Rather than acquire Yahoo, Microsoft should pursue SAP. It’s not an outlandish idea. The two companies held merger talks in late 2003, and perhaps since then, too. Microsoft is in an enviable position: it is a nearly universal presence in corporate data centers, and large enterprise customers are arguably the best customers a software company can have. Clients pay very dear prices for the complex, semicustomized software that runs their business. And once they’ve got their systems running  a process that can take years to complete  they aren’t inclined to change vendors lightly. A few dozen well-paying Fortune 500 customers may actually be more valuable than tens of millions of Web e-mail “customers” who pay nothing for the service and whose attention is not highly valued by online advertisers. Today, SAP’s market capitalization is about $59 billion, and a sizable premium to get a deal done would send its price well north of that. Microsoft cannot put both SAP and Yahoo in its shopping cart, deals that together might run well over $120 billion. Microsoft must pick one or the other. Suppose that Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, were the head of Microsoft and was doing the shopping. Which deal would he choose? Past experience suggests that it would not be Yahoo. That acquisition would bring little but duplication headaches  and no large enterprise customers. It’s amusing to note that the most Larry-like choice, Microsoft’s acquiring of SAP and leaving it alone as an autonomous division to avoid a cross-cultural integration fiasco, is the course that would be most discomfiting to Oracle. Frank Scavo, president of Computer Economics, an information technology research firm, in Irvine, Calif., said that “a Microsoft-SAP combination would be Oracle’s worst nightmare.” Google would not be happy with a conjoined Microsoft and SAP, either. It has made a pro forma expression of its own opposition to a Microsoft-Yahoo merger, but we can speculate that it may be cheering that deal on. Working in Google’s favor are the hostile nature of Microsoft’s bid, the colossal potential for integration problems, and organizational paralysis in, and exodus of talent from, Yahoo. But were Microsoft to turn and head in SAP’s direction, Google would have reason for concern. Whatever strengthens Microsoft is bound to influence, later if not sooner, its continuing competition with Google. For its own part, Google is keen to expand its foothold inside large companies. Last year, it acquired Postini, whose software filters corporate e-mail. Google has not done so well with corporate customers on its own, however. Google Apps has conspicuously failed to win adoption quickly. If Microsoft is to rededicate its attention to its most valuable assets, business customers, a prerequisite is dropping its ill-advised bid for Yahoo. And to find the best acquisition strategy, ask, “What would Larry do?” If Microsoft tries to fight Google with wobbly legs, scared witless, it will lose.

Skip to next paragraph Related Dealbook: Was BEA Smarter Than We Thought? The deal, announced on Wednesday morning, makes Oracle the undisputed leader in the market for what is known as middleware: business software that operates between a company’s database system and its payroll, human resources and inventory systems that use the data. “For Oracle, this deal is a very big step toward completing our vision of becoming a strategic enterprise software of choice for our customers,” Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, said in a conference call. “It reflects the exceptional strategic stake between our two companies in terms of our complementary product strategies, geographic strengths and industry strengths.” The deal, valued at $8.5 billion, or $19.38 a share, is a significant step back from the BEA board’s position in November that it would not accept an offer below $21 a share. Mr. Ellison told analysts then that Oracle had decided to pursue other takeover targets, although BEA executives expressed doubt that he was moving on. Oracle’s offer represents a 24 percent premium over Tuesday’s closing share price of $15.58. The deal, expected to close by October, was valued at $7.2 billion, not counting the $1.3 billion in cash that BEA has on hand. Oracle executives said the acquisition would increase its adjusted earnings by at least 1 to 2 cents a share in the first full year. BEA’s stock rose more than 18 percent Wednesday, or $2.88, to close at $18.46; Oracle advanced 61 cents, to $21.92. BEA, based in San Jose, Calif., was facing considerable pressure from Carl C. Icahn, its largest shareholder. In insisting that BEA find a buyer, he has said that it is difficult for a small independent company to thrive amid the rapid consolidation of the business software industry. Mr. Icahn began buying BEA shares last summer and today owns 13 percent of the company. In its most recent quarter, BEA generated sales of $384.4 million, compared with Oracle’s sales of $5.3 billion in its recent quarter. Alfred Chuang, BEA’s chairman and chief executive, said the board spent several months reviewing options. "This transaction is the culmination of that diligent and thoughtful process,” Mr. Chuang said in a statement, “and we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders.” Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., has spent more than $30 billion buying competitors over the last three years, including PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and Hyperion Solutions. Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research, commented: “Oracle’s strategy is to provide a complete enterprise solution, and customers want one source. This is a good deal for Oracle because it gets a lot of good technology and good people, and a firm anchorage in China.” Mr. Icahn took some credit for the deal, which came months after he filed a lawsuit against BEA to force it to the bargaining table. "This transaction is an excellent example of the great results that can be achieved for all constituencies when the shareholder activist is able to work cooperatively with management," Mr. Icahn said in a statement.
