In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • On Wednesday evening, Volkswagen announced details of its refreshed CC sedan, which is scheduled to have its debut at the Los Angeles auto show this month. The exterior changes are limited to the front end, which resembles that of the 2012 Passat, and the rear, which is more squared than its predecessor, minimizing the CC’s four-door-coupe effect. The car will go on sale in the United States in the spring as a 2013 model. Pricing will be announced closer to its sale date. (Volkswagen) • Daniel F. Akerson, the General Motors chairman, told CNBC on Thursday that despite having only sold roughly 5,000 of its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrids after forecasting 2011 sales of 10,000 units, the automaker would not change its 2012 targets of building 45,000 Volts for sale in the United States, with an additional 15,000 manufactured for export as the Opel Ampera. “We’re starting to hit the pace,” Mr. Akerson said. (CNBC, via The Detroit News) • Despite losing $65.1 million in the third quarter, Tesla Motors outperformed the expectations of analysts. Investors in Tesla, the electric-vehicle manufacturer, were also heartened by news that it would supply what it called a “full powertrain” to Daimler, a stakeholder in Tesla, for use in the German conglomerate’s Mercedes-Benz line. Tesla has previously supplied Daimler with batteries for prototype A-Class and Smart Fortwo models. (Bloomberg) • Having already shown a two-door version of its Fiesta ST concept at the Frankfurt auto show in September, Ford intends to bring a four-door version to the Los Angeles auto show. The concept, which the automaker said would indicate “the direction of a high-performance Fiesta,” is equipped with a 1.6-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine generating 180 horsepower, 60 more than the standard model. Ford currently markets a rally kit, first shown at the 2010 SEMA Show, that increases the standard Fiesta’s horsepower to 168. (Ford)</text></article>

But consumers are testing the brand’s vehicles far beyond the vicinity of any dealership. According to Ford, over 250 million copies of racing, simulation and adventure games that include the manufacturer’s products have been sold since the automaker first got in the game with the Sega Rally driving simulator of 1995. Need for Speed: The Run, a game developed by Electronic Arts and scheduled for release on Nov. 15, is expected to offer contemporary Ford products, including the Shelby Super Snake, Police Interceptor, Ford GT and Mustang GT in its digital garage. Focus ST, Ford GT and Shelby GT 500 models are available to gamers who play Forza Motorsport 4 on the Microsoft Xbox 360. Ford is by no means the only automaker hoping to create a customer relationship through a game console. With more than 1,000 cars in the virtual garage of Sony’s Gran Turismo 5 and nearly 500 on hand in Forza 4, nearly all automakers have licensing arrangements that place their vehicles in racing-simulation games. A number of vehicles appear in more than one game franchise, but brands can also be exclusive to one publisher’s products. Electronic Arts, for example, has an arrangement with Porsche by which the automaker’s cars appear only in the Need for Speed series. Honda is extremely well represented on racing simulators, with 120 different models in Gran Turismo 5 and about 30 in Forza Motorsport 4. Those numbers, cited in an e-mail by Chris Naughton, a Honda spokesman, included vehicles no longer in production as well as many not sold in the United States. “Product placement in these games helps us reach a key demographic (males age 15-35),” Mr. Naughton wrote. “They want us in these games.” Gene Reamer, senior manager for trademark licensing at General Motors, said in a telephone interview that G.M. products were featured in the three most popular driving games: Forza 4, Need for Speed and Gran Turismo 5. He also noted that the Corvette ZR1 was pictured on the packaging of a special version of GT5 for Sony’s portable game console, the PSP. “You can’t buy your way into those games, “ Mr. Reamer said. “You either have the cars they’re looking for or you don’t.” Ford says that video game exposure is an effective marketing tool. Citing research sponsored by Electronic Arts, the automaker said that control-study participants who were exposed to Ford products in video games came away with a 36 percent increase in brand rating, a 28 percent increase in purchase consideration and a 39 percent increase in the frequency with which the Ford brand was recommended to others. How those numbers might translate to showroom sales is unclear, but an increase in purchase consideration should create some sales if the product shines in the dealer showroom. Brand rating is a measure of image, and a positive image is the foundation on which sales are built. While Ford is the only automaker contacted that cited research numbers regarding the marketing effectiveness of video game exposure, Mr. Reamer of G.M. agreed that brand exposure through video games was effective. “We know that we’re making an impact with buyers, particularly first-time buyers,” he said. “It’s a great way to compare our vehicles to the competition.”</text></article>

The little 500 was something of a spoiler in the Hottest Sport-Compact category of the annual SEMA Awards. LAS VEGAS — What were the year’s best cars for customizing and accessorizing? According to the Specialty Equipment Market Association, whose annual trade show opened here Tuesday, they were the Chevrolet Camaro, the Fiat 500, the Ford F-Series pickup and the Jeep Wrangler. Each was bestowed the SEMA Award for the “hottest” vehicle in the car, sport-compact, truck and 4×4/S.U.V. classes. Each of SEMA’s 2,000 exhibitors this year was given a vote “based on the vehicles they showcase in their booths,” said Chris Kersting, SEMA’s president and chief executive. “With each booth vehicle representing one vote, the most prominent models in each category are the winners.” Based on that method, the triumph by the Fiat 500, a relative newcomer to the North American market, ranks as something of an upset. Import tuners and customizers have in the past seized on vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers. This year, however, the presence of Japanese vehicles that had been customized or accessorized, as well as the number of aftermarket parts available for them, seemed diminished. Camaros, Ford trucks and Jeeps, meanwhile, maintained their perennial favored status among SEMA exhibitors.</text></article>

Ford began taking orders for its Focus Electric on Tuesday, pricing the purely electric hatchback at $39,995, inclusive of a $795 destination charge. While not as closely watched by the industry as the pricing announcements of the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf, two plug-in vehicles that went on sale in a staggered rollout last year, Tuesday’s announcement indicated where Ford imagined its first mass-produced E.V. should sit in the marketplace. Before accounting for federal incentives of up to $7,500, the Ford hatchback would be priced $3,900 more than the base-model 2012 Leaf SV, which had a price increase in July. The Volt, meanwhile, had its price reduced from $41,000 to $39,995 in June. The Focus Electric is equipped with a 92-kilowatt electric motor, roughly equivalent to 123 horsepower. Its 23 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack is liquid-cooled, whereas the pack used on the Leaf is air-cooled. Ford has not officially stated the hatchback’s estimated range, saying only that it would be comparable to that of competitors. Its top speed is said by Ford to be 84 miles per hour. Though it will not be compatible with D.C. fast chargers, the Focus will be able to replenish its battery using an optional 240-volt charger in “just over three hours,” the automaker said. Ford unveiled the Focus Electric at near-simultaneous press conferences in New York and Las Vegas in January. Consistent with the rollout strategy of the Volt, Ford intends to begin deliveries next year in New York, New Jersey and California, with other markets to follow.</text></article>

GLENVIEW, Ill. — Lee Roy Hartung may have lacked focus as a collector, but one rule always guided him. “Never sell anything,” said Marjorie Cox, 72, Mr. Hartung’s partner, who made the difficult decision to sell off his lifelong stash of cars, motorcycles, license plates and other memorabilia after Mr. Hartung, 86, died in May. A fixture of this suburban community since 1949, Mr. Hartung dealt in scrap metal, sold used cars and maintained a hauling business that aided his hobby. After a garage fire destroyed an antique bicycle collection, Mr. Hartung in 1972 built a 10,000-square-foot barn on his four-acre property and spent the next several decades stuffing it with treasures like an aluminum-bodied Edwards R-26 Special Sport Roadster — a custom racecar that won best in show at the inaugural Pebble Beach Concours d’Élégance, in 1950. “When he built this, a friend said, ‘You’ll never fill it,’” said Ms. Cox, during a tour of the barn. Its owner obviously had no problem meeting the challenge. Mr. Hartung operated the space as a museum by appointment only. In it, he stored about 80 cars, 40 motorcycles, 100 bicycles and thousands of pieces of automobilia. He had what experts called one of the most complete collections of license plates in the United States, and he had a soft spot for the Model A Ford, evinced by the handful that gradually sank into the soggy soil floor of the barn. Walking down the aisles, past tables filled with old engine parts, gas cans, car cologne bottles, trophies, typewriters, uniforms, political buttons, tin toys and other artifacts, Ms. Cox described how the museum appeared before Auctions America by RM, a division of RM Auctions, began sifting through the scene six weeks ago in preparation for the sale, scheduled for Nov. 3-5. “Toward the end, you could say he was a hoarder,” said Ms. Cox. “He got these shelves and put them on the hoods of all the cars. You couldn’t get in the cars.” Thousands of vintage license plates, lining the space like wallpaper, used to hang down from the wooden rafters. Arranged in 1,700 lots, the entire collection is expected to bring an estimated $4 million to $6 million. “This is the most varied, eclectic, random collection that we’ve done,” said Ian Kelleher, the auction manager, who added that Mr. Hartung gathered locally. “If there was anything of value 10 miles away, there’s a good chance it ended up here,” he said. The red Edwards R-26 roadster, likely the most valuable item for sale, is estimated to be worth from $200,000 to $300,000. Years ago, the body was fitted on a new chassis and repainted. Its Ford V-8-60 engine was swapped out for that of a Jaguar XK-120. Its canvas top sags, but the car is mostly original and unrestored. “It is an ideal collector car in that sense that you can get it cleaned up and then take it to Pebble,” said Mr. Kelleher. “Then, a couple of years later, restore it and take it back.” Also up for grabs is a 1949 Veritas, built by BMW and wearing custom coachwork by Spohn. Valued at $150,000 to $250,000, its tall, thin tailfins echo General Motors’ LeSabre concept car of 1951. Mr. Hartung’s daily driver was a 1931 Model A Ford Roadster, which is offered here in running condition, and he was a motorcycle enthusiast. One of his prizes is an unrestored 1913 Flying Merkel, estimated to be worth $150,000 to $200,000. Ms. Cox, who met Mr. Hartung through a local collector-car club decades ago, said that his health began to fail during an effort to tidy up the property, which neighbors had complained was an eyesore. “We started to clean up, and he got hurt,” said Ms. Cox, who conceded that the cleanup effort had been futile from the beginning. “We’d be doing it for 50 years,” she said.</text></article>

Among the featured complete vehicles at the Specialty Equipment Manufacturers Association Show in Las Vegas will be the Icon 4×4 Bronco, featured in Sunday’s Automobiles section. Here, Jerry Garrett explains how this thoroughly modern $159,000 retromobile came to be. Check in with Wheels on Tuesday, the first day of SEMA, for coverage from the convention center floor. VAN NUYS, Calif. — In the 1956 movie “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” beings from outer space replace people with reasonable facsimiles. The imposters are given away only by their perfection; the replicas lack the idiosyncrasies that make humans unique. This cult classic, remade in 1978, came to mind as Jonathan Ward of Icon 4×4 explained the birthing process of new Icon replicas of the 1966 Ford Bronco, a renowned 4×4 that was also somewhat reviled for its many foibles. “We’re looking for donor cars,” Mr. Ward said, conjuring images of space invaders combing junkyards for Bronco carcasses. “We only need the VIN number. Nothing else.” What Mr. Ward is building is an all-new, 21st-century Bronco in the image of, and within the dimensions of, the original. The price is a little more outsize than its inspiration: $159,000 and up. It would not be difficult to improve the 1966 Bronco, which changed very little through the 1977 model year. This was a vehicle, made up of Mustang and F-100 pickup parts, that was consumed by corrosion almost from the moment it left the dealership. Oil usually leaked from every orifice of its straight-six and V-8 engine offerings. And the rattles, squeaks and shudders from its poorly reinforced body were almost enough to cause its operator hearing loss. Naturally, a certain rugged, rough-hewn segment of the buying public loved them; nearly a quarter million Broncos were sold during the span of the first generation’s production run. Enthusiast clubs have kept many on the road since then, although most have vanished into junkyards or have become piles of rust. In those early Broncos, the VIN was conveniently attached to body panels, not the frame, making replacement of the entire vehicle relatively easy. Another reason for possessing the bodies of first-generation Broncos is that the reborn Bronco can be built to ‘60s-era emission and safety standards, which were virtually nonexistent. That said, the Icon Bronco uses a modern, emissions-compliant Ford Coyote V-8 and is equipped with sturdy lap and shoulder belts at all seating positions. Mr. Ward said that Icon’s goal in re-envisioning the Bronco was to revisit, in a respectful way, the design heritage of a classic 4×4 and interpret it in a modern way. The company has also had notable success doing the same sorts of things with old Toyota Land Cruisers and Jeep CJs. In reimagining the Bronco, Mr. Ward’s team created a surprisingly sophisticated, modern vehicle from the silhouette of what was originally a very crude piece of workmanship. Interior panels, originally left open to the exterior body panels, are now enclosed with storage compartments and sound-deadening materials. Wheel wells that were open traps for water, mud, road salt and other corrosive materials are now panel-covered. Brakes, lighting, suspension structures, wheels and chassis pieces that were originally quite primitive have been upgraded with sturdy, beefy, modern materials and components. The Icon Bronco’s Coyote V-8 is the same 5-liter 412-horsepower crate engine that can be purchased from Ford’s high-performance catalog; it is fitting somehow, given the original Bronco’s reliance on Mustang parts, that the Icon would use the same V-8 found on a 2012 Mustang GT. The original Bronco weighed close to 3,600 pounds, about what the Icon Bronco tips the scales at, despite the feeling that this modern one feels substantial enough to have been carved from a single block of granite.</text></article>

The deficiencies of the Sebring convertible, for instance, were so encompassing that its upgrades included a new name. Say hello to the 200 convertible.The previous car was washed up in a perfect storm of unloved exterior design, cheap and unappealing interior appointments and unsatisfactory performance. For the new model, which made its debut this spring as a 2011 model, Chrysler addressed each of those issues and made improvements. There is plenty left to do, however, before the 200 convertible becomes a desirable choice in the showroom rather than a just-acceptable short-term choice at the rental counter. Perhaps the most appealing feature of the Sebring, which had devolved into a dour package that even a rental fleet manager would be hard-pressed to love, was that it was possible to make some of it disappear by putting the top down. The drivetrain, the interior, the styling — even the name — it all had to go. The 200 isn’t all new, but it looks as if it were. Most of the illusion is pulled off by extensive restyling of the front end. The 200 convertible rides on a carryover chassis — with the doors, quarter panels and retracting top carried over as well — but the basic building blocks seem the least of this car’s problems. It handles reasonably well, with a more rigid feel when the top is up. I had ample opportunity to test the suspension’s capabilities because, in an effort to keep the power up, I found myself driving the test car deeper and faster into corners than I normally might. I gave credit to the suspension for handling the extra loads, but the engine compartment is due for some finger-pointing. The 200 Limited, which I tested, comes with Chrysler’s Pentastar V-6. This new 3.6-liter engine has already received the sort of praise and awards — it made Ward’s list of 10 Best Engines, closely watched in the industry — that the previous, less powerful, less efficient V-6 never did. But in this car, the engine seemed overburdened by the two tons of mass it must push along. This seems a paradox, as the Pentastar is also available in much heavier models like the Dodge Durango, where it performs adequately. In other vehicles, the V-6 is rated at 292 horsepower. In the 200, because of different exhaust plumbing, the output is 283. But the Mustang convertible’s V-6 is more potent, at 306 horsepower, and the Ford weighs 400 pounds less. The standard engine in the base convertible, called the 200 Touring, is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that makes 100 less horsepower (and somehow gets a lower city mileage rating than the V-6). I did not test the Touring and cannot imagine how its engine could convey such a heavy car. The V-6 is fine at cruising speeds, but it feels challenged when loaded with people and luggage, tackling hills or passing at highway speeds. The 6-speed automatic seemed to have no idea what the engine was telling it to do; with the cruise control on, it seemed to sense a constant need to downshift into a lower gear just to keep the speed up. Nor did I ever achieve the rated fuel economy. (The E.P.A. pegs it at 19 m.p.g. in town and 29 on the highway; my mileage was in the low 20s on the open road.) But the service-station breaks provided welcome relief from the flat, hard, unsupportive leather seats; even the seat heaters seemed harsh. The driving position would be improved considerably if the steering wheel, which tilts, could also be adjusted toward or away from the driver. With the front seats in a comfortable position, the rear passengers had their legs cut off at the knees. The listed 33-plus inches of rear “legroom” seems a generous measure. In my test car, the retaining bracket for the driver’s side sun visor broke. Other than the flapping of the unsecured visor, the cabin was generally quiet for a convertible. The hardtop is well insulated. 1 2 Next Page »AS Chrysler has tried to rescue its aged product lineup from the ravages of cost-cutting, bankruptcy and general neglect, some models have needed more radical surgery than others.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/automobiles/sema-customs-tuned-to-the-times.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">SEMA: Customs Tuned to the Times<date>Published: October 28, 2011</date><text>LAS VEGASON the prowl for the next big thing in the automotive aftermarket, about 100,000 commercial buyers, shop owners and industry executives will descend on the convention center here for the annual Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show, set for Nov. 1-5. While doing their best to ignore the temptations of Las Vegas, they will be angling for a glimpse of the near future, trying to divine the trends that will define their businesses in the coming year. Some, then, are sure to scratch their heads when they discover, among a brigade of customized 2012 Ford Motor Company models in the automaker’s huge display area, what appears to be a 1960s Bronco, a welterweight utility vehicle largely forgotten and long out of production. This Bronco, built by Icon 4x4 of Van Nuys Calif., is not a restoration project, and it is far more than a faithful replica. Icon, which produces modern re-creations of classic S.U.V.’s like the Toyota FJ-series Land Cruiser and Jeep CJ, will introduce its five-star remake of the Nixon-era Bronco here, ideally suited to well-heeled buyers with an obsessive devotion to detail. The SEMA show, as it is known, has long reveled in Detroit’s muscular past, usually with an excess of exuberance. But the character of the event, originally geared to the racing and customizer markets, has evolved to serve as a showcase for design projects by automakers. Vendors’ exhibits, some 2,000 in all, are still spread across a sole-trying amount of floor — more than three million square feet of display space to be walked — but it is no longer the sparkly, bodacious affair of the boom years. The show’s provocatively dressed ladies are a memory, and an industry once growing at kudzu speed on the popularity of chest-high wheels, license-plate televisions and under-vehicle disco lighting seems to have deflated with the housing bubble. So Icon’s brilliantly executed and lavishly equipped Bronco doppelgänger — its $159,000 price is a clue to its credentials — does not drip with chrome. The truck is sharp, but does not broadcast its (or its owner’s) richness. It takes a second look to absorb its extraordinary craftsmanship. The Icon Bronco is powered by a 412-horsepower version of Ford’s latest 5-liter V-8, with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, disc brakes and a state-of-the-art suspension system. Every panel has been precisely re-engineered in higher-quality corrosion-resistant materials. Icon’s owner, Jonathan Ward, said that his goal in re-envisioning the Bronco was to revisit, in a respectful way, the design heritage of a classic 4x4 with the benefit of a modern chassis. The idea for doing the Bronco came from Mr. Ward’s past association with Jim Farley, a Ford group vice president. Mr. Farley was previously at Toyota, where the men worked on Icon’s FJ Land Cruiser project. The Bronco project eventually involved Camilo Pardo, designer of the revived Ford GT, and Nike, the athletic equipment maker. Mr. Ward’s professional relationships at Nike led to invaluable 3-D design and parts-rendering support. “We use a lot of materials from modern architecture, aircraft and aerospace applications,” Mr. Ward said. He pointed to the tempered-glass side windows, which he said were from skyscrapers; Bell &amp; Ross instruments; and LearJet sun visors as examples. The Icon Bronco uses a sound-deadening headliner material found in Aston Martins. The attraction of resurrecting sturdy-looking vehicles from the past may partly reflect today’s dire economics, and may have spawned a trend that goes a step further. An extreme expression of the low-bling ethic can be seen in the so-called derelict cars that have started to appear alongside the spotless six-figure hot rods. The derelicts, raw and as-found on the outside but entirely modern under the skin, also acknowledge the growing fervor over “barn find” classics, a branch of the shabby-chic mindset that satisfies a yearning for authenticity and originality. And to be sure, there’s a ruboff of the rat-rod movement expressed here as well. Icon’s first derelict project was a Frankenstein that sutured the nose of a 1952 De Soto to the rear of a same-year Chrysler Town &amp; Country station wagon. That car’s ratty, rust-encrusted exterior was preserved while its innards were replaced with 21st-century components from Chrysler’s Mopar Performance parts catalog, including a modern Hemi V-8. This year, Mr. Ward is bringing a faded green 1952 Chevrolet business coupe for display. Is a trend developing? “Derelicts? Well, Apolo Anton Ohno, the Olympic speedskater and dancer, will unveil his No Regrets ’60s Caddy here,” said Peter MacGillivray, a SEMA vice president. The re-creations and derelicts reveal a level of detail that goes into many SEMA project cars. Acres of customs and hot rods will be on view. “We will have 1,500 vehicles on display this year,” Mr. MacGillivray said. “It’s the hottest ticket in Vegas,” he added, stressing that the show was not open to the public. Ford’s display will also house seven Focus models with cosmetic makeovers by outside companies as well as hopped-up Fiestas, Explorers and F-Series pickups. General Motors will emphasize the opportunities to personalize its new Sonic subcompact with projects that feature its Z-spec performance equipment. A pair of customized Cruze compacts will also be displayed. The Chrysler Group promises 30 modified vehicles, representing all of the company’s brands, in its exhibit Hyundai will unveil a 450-horsepower, heavily customized version of its Genesis coupe. One of its more entertaining features is a $35,000 Harman International audio system. Toyota’s Lexus division will introduce its 2013 GS 350 sedan with the F Sport package, and the company’s display area will include a handful of other models modified by custom shops.LAS VEGAS</text></article>

Niskanen, a Blunt Libertarian Economist, Dies at 78<date>Published: October 28, 2011</date><text>William A. Niskanen, an economist who was dismissed by the Ford Motor Company after bluntly opposing the company’s embrace of trade protection, and who later served as a member of President Ronald Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers, died on Wednesday in Washington. He was 78.His death, of a stroke, was announced by the Cato Institute, the libertarian research organization, where he had been chairman for 23 years before stepping down in 2008. Mr. Niskanen (pronounced nis-CAN-en) had a long career as an economist, both in and out of government. He taught at the University of California at both Berkeley and Los Angeles, worked as a defense analyst at the RAND Corporation and held prominent positions at the Office of Management and Budget, where he was assistant director, and at the Defense Department, where he was the director of special studies for the secretary of defense. Mr. Niskanen, who stood 6-foot-4, was rarely one to tailor his message to his audience. A few years after joining Ford in 1975 and becoming its chief economist, he was critical of the company when it ended its longtime commitment to free trade and pushed for restrictions on Japanese imports. Mr. Niskanen contended that the real challenge to the domestic auto industry came not from Japan, but from the inability of American carmakers to cater to the public’s desire for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. He also thought it inappropriate for corporations to ask Washington for breaks. “A common commitment to refrain from special favors,” he wrote in a memo at the time, “serves the same economic function as a common commitment to refrain from stealing.” His criticism did not sit well with Ford and it fired him. In 1984, while at the Council of Economic Advisers, he caused a stir when, in a speech before a group called Women in Government Relations, he suggested that one reason men were often paid more than women in comparable jobs was because women interrupted their careers to raise children. Walter F. Mondale, then the Democratic presidential nominee, leapt on the comments and said they reflected the Reagan administration’s attitude toward women. A White House spokesman said Mr. Niskanen had expressed his own views, not those of the administration. William Arthur Niskanen was born on March 13, 1933, in Bend, Ore., and earned a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Milton Friedman, the free-marketeer and Nobel laureate. Mr. Niskanen, who lived in Washington, is survived by his wife, Kathryn Washburn, and three daughters; Lia Niskanen of Brooklyn, Pamela Niskanen of West Winfield, N.Y., and Jaime Brunetti of Berkeley, Calif. Mr. Niskanen’s essays are collected in “Bureaucracy and Public Economics” and “Reflections of a Political Economist: Selected Articles on Government Policies and Political Processes.” He also wrote a memoir, “Reaganonomics: An Insider’s Account of the Policies and the People,” an occasionally critical look at his time at the White House. In it, he called Donald Regan, a Treasury secretary and chief of staff under Reagan, “a tower of jelly.” He praised Mr. Reagan for vision and charisma, but lamented that as president he had been unable to curtail federal spending. “In the end,” Mr. Niskanen wrote, “there was no Reagan revolution.”William A.

Help Protect a Turnaround<date>Published: October 27, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — After bankruptcies, bailouts and a decade of downsizing, America’s three large automakers wanted to ensure that expensive new labor contracts would not undermine their fragile turnarounds.With the ratification of the last of their new four-year agreements with the United Automobile Workers union on Wednesday, the Detroit car companies have successfully held the line on costs and further closed the competitive gap with their foreign rivals. It was one of the cheapest set of contracts ever negotiated by the companies, analysts said. Historically, new union contracts have meant annual increases in labor costs in this country of 5 percent or more. But the 2011 talks resulted in a much more manageable increase of about 1 percent a year. “I think both the union and the company came to a good place, common ground,” Daniel F. Akerson, General Motors’ chief executive, said in an interview. “Both of us can say we did well for our constituencies.” It took three months of intense negotiations, which culminated in more opposition than normal by union members at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. But in the end, Detroit won favorable contracts that not only keep costs down, but also allow the companies to increase production and employment in their United States factories. By avoiding wage increases for their longtime workers, the automakers have minimized the longer-term, structural cost increases that had characterized its contracts with the U.A.W. for years. The companies did reward workers with healthy signing bonuses, better profit-sharing formulas, and pay increases for the growing ranks of entry-level workers. In addition, all three companies pledged to add thousands of new jobs over the life of the contracts. Yet the overall low cost of the agreements reflected the tenuous nature of the industry’s comeback. “You can’t discount the fact that these companies are shadows of their former selves,” said Kristin Dziczek, a labor analyst with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. “The industry is smaller and leaner than at any time in many years.” G.M., Ford and Chrysler employed more than 300,000 hourly workers in the United States in 2001. That figure has dwindled to 112,000, and a small but growing fraction of those jobs are entry-level positions. By reducing jobs and factories to better match their market shares, the Detroit companies have drastically reduced the level of industry sales at which they can break even. Now as they add new products, they can also begin the hiring of thousands of new, less expensive lower-tier workers. The combination of less costly workers and steadily growing sales should produce higher profits over the course of the contracts. Mr. Akerson, who joined G.M. after its bankruptcy in 2009, expressed confidence that his company could cover the modest increase in costs with better productivity and more profitable vehicles in its lineup. “I think it is well within our capacity to, in terms of productivity gains and our ability to raise prices,” he said. “The contract maintained our break-even point, which was critical.” Several factors contributed to the positive outcome, including new leadership at G.M. and Chrysler and a new president, Bob King, at the union. From the start of negotiations, there was an emphasis on compromise rather than confrontation, and little expectation that the automakers would increase wages for veteran workers. Instead, Mr. King concentrated on getting sizable cash bonuses for workers now and a bigger share of corporate profits for them in the future. The union also treated each company differently, based on its current financial condition. Ford, which did not need a government bailout, was pressed to hand out the largest signing bonuses, $6,000 a worker. G.M. agreed to pay $5,000 and Chrysler consented to $3,500, although only half of that will be paid this year. Mr. King and other union leaders had a tough time persuading some union members to support the disparity in bonuses. While workers at G.M. and Ford approved their new deals by votes of about 2 to 1, only 55 percent of Chrysler employees voted in favor of their new contract. Workers were predictably split on whether the new agreements were fair. “Is everybody happy with it? No,” Mr. King said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. “I’m not happy either. We know the struggles our members are going through.” Mr. King said it was important, however, that the new contracts did not wipe out the competitive gains the companies had achieved through restructuring. Analysts estimated that the three automakers were able to shrink the gap between what Detroit paid its workers and the compensation of nonunion employees at plants operated by foreign automakers in the United States. The American companies now pay workers $57 to $50 an hour, when the cost of pensions and health care coverage is included. Ford, which has the fewest entry-level employees, is at the high end of the range, while Chrysler’s costs are the lowest. By comparison, labor costs at the foreign-owned plants are still below $50 an hour on average. “But the gap has closed considerably,” Ms. Dziczek said. “It used to be close to $30 an hour, and now it’s less than $10.” The new contracts also symbolically moved the industry past its darkest chapter, when G.M. and Chrysler were forced to seek federal aid to survive. At Ford, the negotiations were crucial to re-establishing parity with G.M., which emerged from bankruptcy with far less debt than its crosstown rival. “We worked out something with the U.A.W. that did not disadvantage us to G.M.,” said John Fleming, Ford’s head of global manufacturing. “We always knew we’d have to pay our workers a little bit more to ratify it.”DETROIT — After bankruptcies, bailouts and a decade of downsizing, America’s three large automakers wanted to ensure that expensive new labor contracts would not undermine their fragile turnarounds.</text></article>

Chrysler workers will receive smaller bonuses than workers at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, both of which are more profitable and further along on their turnaround plans. Chrysler workers will get $3,500 signing bonuses, but only half of that sum will be paid upon ratification. The rest is due when the company is more financially stable in 2012. By comparison, next month Ford workers will get their full $6,000 signing bonuses and G.M. employees will receive their entire $5,000 payments. “It’s not everything our members deserve, but we did the best we could in these uncertain times,” said General Holiefield, the U.A.W.’s chief negotiator with Chrysler. The voting at Chrysler was closer than at Ford or G.M. On Wednesday, union leaders had to decide whether the overall agreement could be ratified even though a majority of the company’s skilled-trades employees had voted against it. Only 44 percent of the skilled-trades workers, which total about 5,000 electricians and other specialized employees, approved the deal. But the union said their opposition was based on its overall economic terms, and not any provisions specifically related to their jobs. If those employees had voted against the contract because of changes to skilled-trade work rules, those issues might have been subject to arbitration. “These reasons were predominantly economic and not unique to skilled trades members,” the union said in a statement. “Accordingly, the International Executive Board declared the agreements ratified.” The U.A.W.’s president, Bob King, said that overall economic terms apply to all Chrysler workers, and the skilled-trades vote could not outweigh the votes of production workers. “We went along with the majority,” Mr. King said in a conference call with reporters. “Fifty-five percent said they wanted the agreement ratified, so that’s what we did.” The ratification at Chrysler concludes labor talks that were considered critical to Detroit’s future competitiveness. The negotiations were the first since G.M. and Chrysler received federal aid and went through bankruptcy in 2009. The margins of victory at G.M. and Ford were larger than at Chrysler, which Mr. King attributed to concerns over bonuses. “The money was a big, big issue, especially because they saw their sisters and brothers at G.M. and Ford got as lot more,” Mr. King said of the relatively close Chrysler voting.DETROIT — The last of the major automaker labor contracts was ratified on Wednesday when officials of the United Automobile Workers union announced that employees at Chrysler had approved a four-year agreement.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/business/ford-posts-10th-straight-quarterly-profit.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Ford Motor Reports 10th Profitable Quarter, and May Restart Dividend<date>Published: October 26, 2011</date><text>DEARBORN, Mich. — The Ford Motor Company on Wednesday said profit fell 2 percent in the third quarter, to $1.65 billion.It was the 10th consecutive profitable quarter for Ford, which last week secured a new labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union and said it was close to restoring a dividend to shareholders. Nearly all of the profit — $1.6 billion, the same as a year ago — came from North America, while losses in Europe increased 56 percent, to $306 million. “We delivered solid results for the third quarter despite an uncertain business environment by continuing to serve our customers around the world with best-in-class vehicles,” Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a statement. The overall profit is equal to 41 cents a share and brings the carmaker’s total earnings for 2011 to $6.6 billion, 4 percent more than the first nine months of 2010. Ford earned $1.69 billion, or 43 cents a share, in the third quarter of 2010. Revenue increased 14 percent to $33.1 billion. The company earned a third-quarter pretax operating profit of $1.94 billion, or 46 cents a share, $111 million less than a year ago. That figure, which excludes special items related to job cuts, the end of the Mercury brand and dealer-related actions, is slightly above the consensus analyst forecast of 44 cents a share. Operating profit was reduced by a $350 million noncash charge related to commodity hedges after prices declined significantly at the end of September, Ford said. It projected that structural and commodity costs for all of 2011 would be $3.8 billion higher than 2010, less than its initial forecast of $4 billion. Ford said it reduced its automotive debt by $1.3 billion in the quarter to $12.7 billion. It reported positive automotive cash flow of $400 million, but automotive gross cash declined by $1.2 billion to $20.8 billion. Its chief financial officer, Lewis W. K. Booth, said the company was on track to surpass its 2010 full-year operating profit of $8.3 billion, even though its automotive operating margins would be slightly lower. Its operations have earned $7.7 billion so far in 2011. “The core of the business is very strong,” Mr. Booth told reporters at Ford’s headquarters. “We’re doing all this while we’re investing for the future.” Ford workers on Oct. 19 ratified a new four-year deal with the United Automobile Workers that the company said would increase its labor costs by less than 1 percent annually. Most of the company’s 41,000 U.A.W. members will get bonuses of $6,000 and profit-sharing checks of about $3,750 this month. The new contract prompted Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch Ratings to upgrade Ford’s credit rating two notches, to BB-plus, which is one level below investment grade. Moody’s is considering a similar upgrade. With the labor issue settled, analysts now say they expect Ford to resume paying a dividend to shareholders as soon as 2012. The company suspended its quarterly dividend in 2006. Mr. Booth said Ford would restore its dividend “as soon as we think our balance sheet will stand it,” but he declined to give a specific timeframe. Brian A. Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, predicted in a note to clients this week that Ford would announce a dividend early next year and pay 36 cents for 2012, increasing to 55 cents in 2015. “The key debate around Ford continues to be the sustainability of — or potential for improvement in — Ford North America pretax profits, especially in light of tailwinds from pricing and what may turn out to be lower than previously guided headwinds from commodities and structural costs,” Mr. Johnson wrote. Shares of Ford fell 4.5 percent to close at $11.74 on Wednesday.DEARBORN, Mich. — The Ford Motor Company on Wednesday said profit fell 2 percent in the third quarter, to $1.65 billion.</text></article>

The brand’s PowerShift transmission was cited by Consumer Reports on Tuesday as a reason for the automaker’s decline in the magazine’s annual reliability survey. The transmission has been criticized for being slow to respond in city driving and for displaying a lethargy that suggested the engine would stall. It behaves better at highway speeds. “It is quite a challenge to deliver something that is very, very fuel efficient and yet feels just like a conventional automatic, and there are some balances and some tradeoffs that we make,” said Greg Burgess, a Ford engineer, in The Times’s review of the Focus, which made note of the transmission’s shortcomings. In a technical service bulletin dated Sept. 13, the automaker informed dealers that some 2012 Focuses “may exhibit various automatic transmission and engine driveability concerns.” It went on to instruct the dealers how to reprogram the power train control module for “smoother accelerations, reduced hesitation, better low-speed driveability and improved shift scheduling.” That bulletin addressed models built before Aug. 12. Richard Truett, a Ford spokesman, wrote in an e-mail that Ford had made the change to all new Focus models starting on that date, and that the alterations would not change the car’s Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy ratings. Another bulletin dated Sept. 2 advised dealers to reprogram the module on the 2011 Fiesta if consumers complained about “hesitation when accelerating from a low speed after coast down, harsh or late 1-2 upshift, harsh shifting during low-speed tip-in or tip-out maneuvers and/or engine r.p.m. flare when coasting to a stop.” Consumer Reports also noted complaints from owners relating to the MyFord Touch control system. During the last year, Ford has issued several technical service bulletins to solve problems ranging from calling the wrong phone number to “intermittent touch screen inoperable conditions.”</text></article>

GOTHENBURG, Sweden — Between Sweden’s two main carmakers, as I reported in The Times on Tuesday, Saab Automobile has hit hard times, while Volvo Cars appears to be going great guns. On Oct. 20, Volvo reported strong third-quarter sales growth in all of its main markets — North America, Sweden, Britain and China — and said it expected to post a full-year operating profit. Volvo attributed its reported loss for the quarter to adverse currency movements, but said that it remained profitable for the year through September. “Our business is progressing as planned despite the economic turmoil,” Stefan Jacoby, the brand’s new chief executive, said last week in an interview. “Our order book is filled, and in our core markets we don’t see any decline.” Some of Volvo’s success is attributable to the power of its brand identity, with its strong associations with vehicle safety, and also to the fact that it was handed over more or less smoothly last year by the Ford Motor Company to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owner of China’s largest private automaker. Volvo was on the auction block even before the financial crisis hit, and the sale allowed the company to get on with its business. Per-Erik Mohlin, a senior Volvo executive for several years in the 1990s before the Ford takeover, said that he was “very optimistic” about the brand’s future. “If you have a good brand and a good product, you will sell car. It’s as simple as that. And they do,” he said. Analysts and industry executives noted that Li Shufu, the Geely chairman, has so far maintained the hands-off attitude that he promised when he paid $1.8 billion for Volvo. Mr. Jacoby, hired by Mr. Li from Volkswagen, said that Volvo was being run as “a standalone company” for the first time, rendering it nimbler than at any other time in the company’s history. Even during its years under the truck manufacturer Volvo A.B., he said, the carmaker played second fiddle. At Volvo headquarters here, little would suggest that the company’s sole shareholder was Chinese. The board of directors is international, and Geely has moved very carefully, leaving most of the brand’s management in place. Aside from looking into collaboration on sourcing in China and on electric cars, Volvo and the Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings are being run as completely separate companies under their parent’s corporate umbrella, Mr. Jacoby said. That separation does not indicate, however, a reluctance on Geely’s part to leverage Volvo in the world’s largest emerging car market. Volvo is building an assembly plant in Chengdu and developing a factory site in Daqing, though it has not announced plans for that facility. Mr. Jacoby said that the company was also considering an engine plant in China to supply its production there. The Swedish-Chinese deal is, to a certain extent, an experiment, Mr. Jacoby said, one that “could maybe be a model for the future of a deal by a major Chinese investment into a Western enterprise.” Mr. Jacoby said he took the job after talking with Mr. Li and realizing that the two men agreed on the steps required to strengthen the brand. Volvo officials, meanwhile, talk of a “Jacoby effect” stemming from a difference in management style between their new boss and the rigidly hierarchical, American-style administration under Ford. Officials here readily acknowledged that Ford kept Volvo afloat during some difficult years, and because of the long cycle of product development, they noted that Volvo would continue to share most vehicle architecture with Ford for several years more. Volvo’s Skovde engine plant also provides Ford with 2-liter diesel engines. Mr. Jacoby said that only in 2014 would Volvo bring out its first completely post-Ford vehicle, the next-generation XC90 crossover S.U.V. As to the question of how Volvo, which wants to produce 800,000 cars a year in 2020 — up from fewer than 400,000 in 2010 — would compete in an industry where the giants increasingly are building millions of vehicles a year on just a few platforms, Mr. Jacoby said that Volvo “won’t be in the top league, but we’ll be large enough to compete.” Martin Sköld, a scholar at the Stockholm School of Economics who studies the auto industry, said that Mr. Jacoby’s long tenure near the top of Volkswagen, where he became acquainted with the American and Asian markets and saw firsthand how a successful multibrand strategy worked, had positioned him well for the top job at Volvo. Mr. Sköld and Anders Trapp, an auto industry analyst at SEB in Stockholm, both said that Volvo could thrive under Geely, though they cautioned that the ultimate success of the deal may hinge on how much Geely spends on Volvo. “They’ve got potential, but we don’t know exactly how much the Chinese owners are going to put into the company,” Mr. Trapp said. “If Volvo continues to get funding for a few more years, and they invest in technology and quality new models, then I think they can be a success.” Such a strategy may be a sticking point, as Mr. Jacoby insists that Volvo would fund all of its investments, in China and elsewhere, with its own resources.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/business/global/the-divergent-fortunes-of-saab-and-volvo.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">The Divergent Fortunes of Saab and Volvo<date>Published: October 24, 2011</date><text>TROLLHATTAN, Sweden — On a gloomy, rainy afternoon, Rafael Hernandez strained through his exercise routine, preparing for the day that he would return to work at the local Saab auto plant.“We’ll be back at work soon, and I want to be ready,” said Mr. Hernandez. He is a door adjuster in the body shop, and now works out six days a week. The Saab factory here has not produced any cars since April, when creditors stopped providing operating cash and left Mr. Hernandez and more than 3,000 of his co-workers with little to do but wait. Most of them remain defiantly devoted to the company despite the long odds against its survival. “I love Saab. I drive a Saab 9-3,” said Mr. Hernandez, a 10-year employee and a native of Cuba, insisting that a reporter follow him outside to see his car. “I’m confident that it will work out.” The Saab facility in this city of 40,000 people is silent, save for workers who drop by once a week to perform light maintenance or cleaning to stay busy. Just 62 miles to the south, in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second-largest city, the contrast is stark. There, Volvo is operating two shifts, churning out 54 cars an hour from early morning until midnight. Stefan Jacoby, Volvo’s new chief executive, talks confidently of plans to raise output to 800,000 cars a year by 2020, more than double last year’s total. That the outlook for the Swedish carmakers could be so different is partly testimony to diverging histories under former American owners — General Motors for Saab, Ford Motor for Volvo. It also reflects their ensuing fortunes: Volvo found a deep-pocketed rescuer and Saab did not. The Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, the largest private carmaker in China, paid Ford $1.8 billion last year for Volvo. Saab ended up in the hands of an underfinanced Dutch entrepreneur, Victor R. Muller, the owner of a tiny maker of sports cars called Spyker. For Mr. Muller, 52, who had never managed a large company before, it was a daring move. G.M., eager to wash its hands of Saab as it prepared for bankruptcy, accepted $74 million in cash and $326 million in preferred shares for the company in January 2010. G.M., which continues to make cars under the Saab name in Mexico, has since written off the value of those shares. If Mr. Muller was going to turn Saab around, he needed to win over loyal customers, who loved the company’s aerospace heritage and technological leadership, and a style they regularly describe as quirky and different. G.M., over the two decades that it ran the company, had made cars based on Opel, Subaru and even giant sport utility vehicle platforms. Martin Skold, who studies the auto industry at the Stockholm School of Economics, said G.M. never figured out how to integrate Saab, ultimately investing little in the brand while raiding it for technology like turbo engines and front-wheel drive. Per-Erik Mohlin, a former president of Volvo, puts it more bluntly. “G.M. had no idea what to do with Saab,” he said. “I don’t think they had a clue what to do with a premium brand.” James R. Cain, a spokesman for G.M., said the company “has always viewed Saab as a unique and iconic brand, and we hope they are able to work their way through their difficulties.” Jeff Platt, a blogger in New York at a site called SaabsUnited, said that Mr. Muller was going to restore at Saab “what G.M. had distilled out of them.” But Saab was too small to succeed as a mass-market company in an industry dominated by giants, and it lacked the niche products that allow a company like Porsche to prosper. Its lineup consisted of two aging models, and there was no cash to roll out new vehicles. In March, suppliers began cutting off credit. The Trollhattan factory sputtered for a bit, closing completely in June. Today, even the cars in the Saab Museum are pledged to creditors. Among Saab employees, the message is unrelentingly — almost religiously — upbeat. Anette Hellgren, president of the Unionen white-collar local union in Trollhattan, said that when she met colleagues, “I tell them, ‘I still believe in the company.’ ” “It’s essential that we don’t put our heads in the sand,” she said, “that we keep going to work, going out, going to parties.” Many outsiders see little reason for hope. 1 2 Next Page »TROLLHATTAN, Sweden — On a gloomy, rainy afternoon, Rafael Hernandez strained through his exercise routine, preparing for the day that he would return to work at the local Saab auto plant.</text></article>

Consumer ReportsThe survey appears in the December issue of Consumer Reports, which goes on sale Nov. 1. Taking the top nine spots in the magazine’s Annual Auto Reliability Survey, released on Tuesday afternoon, were Toyota’s youth-oriented Scion brand, which led the pack, followed by Lexus, Acura, Mazda, Honda, Toyota, Infiniti, Subaru and Nissan. Of the 91 Japanese models for which Consumer Reports had sufficient data, 96 percent received ratings of Average or Much Better than Average in predicted reliability. Ford, meanwhile, dropped 10 spots from last year, from its 10th place ranking to No. 20 out of 28 brands. The annual survey is based on data from 1.3 million 2002-11 model-year vehicles leased or owned by Consumer Reports subscribers. The gathered survey data is used by the publication to track the reliability of vehicles up to 10 years old and to forecast the predicted reliability of 2012 models. To determine predicted reliability, the magazine takes the average of the overall reliability scores for the last three model years. Based on the result, vehicles are then rated on a scale of Much Better Than Average, Better Than Average, Average, Worse Than Average and Much Worse Than Average. In recent years, Ford has performed well, ranking as the top American automaker in the 2010 survey. This year, however, three new models pulled it down, as the Explorer, Fiesta and Focus all received below average predicted-reliability ratings. The survey is also the second this year to indicate that Ford’s MyFord Touch infotainment system is hurting the brand’s standing. In the 2011 J.D. Power &amp; Associates Initial Quality Study, Ford fell from fifth place last year to 23rd, largely because of consumer complaints about the system. Another factor that contributed to Ford’s poor showing was the new PowerShift dual-clutch automatic gearbox fitted to the Fiesta and Focus. Consumer Reports describes it an “automated-manual transmission” because it combines the efficiency of a manual design with the driving ease of an automatic. Though the survey merely asked respondents to indicate whether they experienced a serious problem that required a visit to the dealer — and not to describe the particular problem in detail — Consumer Reports auto testers found that the transmission stumbled at low speeds and in stop-and-go traffic. “Especially at lower speeds in parking-lot areas, it’s a very jerky transmission,” David Champion, the senior director of the publication’s auto test center, said in a telephone interview. “It was very difficult to get a smooth drive-away.” While Ford stumbled, brands in the Chrysler Group surged. Jeep moved up seven spots to No. 13, displacing Ford as the most reliable domestic brand. Chrysler and Dodge moved up 12 and 3 spots, respectively, in the rankings. General Motors, meanwhile, experienced mixed results. Three vehicles with good predicted reliability last year dropped to below average and were no longer recommended. They are the Buick LaCrosse sedan, the all-wheel drive version of the Buick Enclave crossover and the Cadillac SRX crossover S.U.V. A bright spot for G.M. was the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, which received a predicted reliability rating of Much Better Than Average. There is, however, an asterisk. The sample size was just a few over the minimum threshold of 100 cars, and most of the owners had their cars for only a few months. Regarded as a whole, Detroit models still had a reliability problem, the editors said. Of the 97 domestic models and versions for which Consumer Reports had sufficient data, just 64 percent rated Average or Much Better Than Average, compared with 96 percent for Japanese models. European brands had a mixed record, with an overall predicted reliability just slightly below that of domestic models. Porsche dropped 25 places and went from being the second-best-rated brand last year to being the second-worst, which Consumer Reports attributed to only having data for two models. One of those models, the redesigned Cayenne S.U.V., “had a terrible debut year,” said the authors, without elaboration. The survey results are available to subscribers at the Consumer Reports Web site. For nonsubscribers, the site will post the rankings and information about best and worst models later Tuesday afternoon. The survey appears in the December issue of the magazine, which goes on sale Nov. 1.</text></article>

While automakers once famously, or perhaps infamously, destroyed concept cars after they outlived their usefulness for auto show displays, some manufacturers, recognizing the appeal of old iron, have begun revisiting past glories. The Ford Motor Company restored Edsel Ford’s 1934 Model 40 Special Speedster in time for the Pebble Beach Concours d’Élégance in August, and General Motors recently honored its 1938 Buick Y-Job concept with a full makeover. Add to these a group of volunteer workers at G.M. Holden, the Australian subsidiary of G.M., who recently completed restoration work on the 1969 Holden Hurricane, a concept car that was, by any measure, well ahead of its time. The Hurricane undergoing restoration at Holden’s design studios in Melbourne. The Hurricane is a special concept car in that it is much more than a styling exercise, incorporating a considerable number of innovative features that, with the benefit of hindsight, appear rather prescient. The car is equipped with automatic air-conditioning and a guidance system that provides directions by detecting magnets embedded in the road. A camera mounted in the rear bumper transmits rear-view video to a monitor in the center console. Safety features include a foam-lined fuel tank, an integral roll bar and a fire warning system. The midengine rear-drive sports car has a fiberglass body with a canopy that lifts to admit a driver and passenger. Standing less than 40 inches high, the Hurricane is driven from a semi-reclining position. A sleek and powerful-looking automobile, the Holden features a sloping nose, pronouncedly arched front wheel wells and a truncated rear deck that suggest modern Corvette styling. The car is powered by a 253-cubic-inch Holden V-8, a precursor of the automaker’s production V-8, which followed soon after the car’s initial showing at the 1969 Melbourne auto show. G.M., in a news release on Wednesday, described the engine’s 262-horsepower output as “towering” and its four-barrel carburetor as an “advanced design component.” They are odd descriptors, given that many earlier G.M. engines produced more power per cubic inch and more overall power; the automaker’s 327-cubic-inch V-8 of 1964, for example, generated 375 horsepower, and G.M. used four-barrel carburetors as early as 1952. Kate Lonsdale, a Holden spokeswoman, elaborated in an e-mail that the descriptors were appropriate in light of what was, and wasn’t, available on the Australian market of 1969. For that time, the engine’s output was considerable, and a four-barrel carburetor had never appeared on a Holden until that point, she said. Inarguable, though, was the achievement that the Hurricane represented. The plaudits are duly shared now by Rick Martin, Holden’s former chief studio engineer, and his volunteer team, who spent five years restoring the car. Ms. Lonsdale said that the concept remained in Holden’s possession after its auto-show appearances, and was then loaned out to dealers. A partial restoration was carried out in the mid-’80s, and in later years, Holden apprentices attempted some restoration work. The car was on loan to the Echuca National Holden Motor Museum from 1992 to 2005 and was also exhibited at the Powerhouse science and design museum in Sydney during that period. The current restoration was undertaken in 2006. The Hurricane will appear during the Motorclassica concours and car show at the Melbourne Royal Exhibition Building from Oct. 21 to 23.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/business/ford-workers-ratify-contract.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Ford Workers Ratify Contract<date>Published: October 19, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — Workers at the Ford Motor Company showed that they were clearly not happy with the four-year labor agreement their union negotiated, but in the end they approved it rather than jeopardize hefty bonuses and thousands of new jobs in an uncertain economy.Early on, the deal appeared in danger of being rejected, after several large plants turned it down. But the tide turned sharply as leaders of the United Automobile Workers stepped up efforts to sell the deal’s benefits and warned that other options — possibly a strike or lockout — almost certainly would be worse. The U.A.W. said Wednesday that the contract had passed, with 63 percent voting “yes” and 37 percent voting “no.” As a result, most workers will get $6,000 signing bonuses on Nov. 4, followed shortly by profit-sharing checks averaging $3,750. “The members walked right to the very edge of a cliff, and they looked over and decided to take a step back,” said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “It’s pretty hard nowadays for a worker to risk not getting a signing bonus and have to explain that to a spouse.” Having a new contract in place clears a formidable hurdle for Ford and allows it to start reducing its hourly labor rate by hiring thousands of new workers at lower wages. Some of the jobs they fill will be new, while others will replace veteran workers cajoled into retirement by buyouts of as much as $100,000. By adding shifts at its busiest plants, Ford will have fewer full-wage workers earning expensive overtime pay. Consequently, the deal carries a minimal price for Ford, even as the company prepares to pay about $400 million in extra checks next month. The company said Thursday that its labor costs would increase by less than 1 percent annually. It pegged the cost at $270 million this year, $60 million next year and $80 million a year from 2013 through 2015. A presentation to analysts and reporters on Thursday said the more efficient use of its plants “represents a substantial profit opportunity.” Ford executives said they expect entry-level workers to account for at least 8 percent of the work force by the end of the contract. All of the workers at two Ford component plants in Michigan now can be entry-level, they said. Mark Fields, Ford’s president of the Americas, said the deal makes the company more competitive and more flexible. “Over all, this contract is really another great example of working with our stakeholders, in this case our employees, to deliver profitable growth for all,” Mr. Fields said. Analysts said the contract’s approval cleared the path for Ford to resume paying dividends to shareholders and to regain its investment grade credit rating. The rating companies Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Services said recently that they might upgrade Ford to one notch below investment grade if the contract were ratified. Ford’s chief financial officer, Lewis W.K. Booth, said the company now has “an opportunity going forward to think about a dividend, but we’re a little bit away from talking about that publicly.” He said executives could decide to reinstate a dividend — last paid in 2006 — even before the company returns to investment-grade status.Ford is the second of the three automakers to win approval of a new contract. General Motors workers ratified their deal last month by a ratio of nearly two to one. Labor specialists predicted less opposition at Chrysler, which reached a tentative agreement with the union last week, because of its shakier financial position. At two Chrysler plants in Kokomo, Ind., 55 percent of workers who voted on Tuesday supported the contract, which provides smaller bonuses than the Ford and G.M. pacts “Is it as good as we want? No,” said Jerry Price, the vice president of U.A.W. Local 685 in Kokomo, the first large group to vote, “but it gives us a chance to live another day.” Ford workers, too, seemed to increasingly sense, as voting progressed, that this was not the best time to take a stand. After workers at two plants in Chicago and one in Wayne, Mich., voted against the deal, it received overwhelming support from large locals in Dearborn, Mich.; Louisville, Ky.; and Kansas City, Mo. On the union’s official Facebook page dedicated to negotiations with Ford, the tone shifted from anger about the lack of a raise and other omissions to fear about the consequences of rejecting the contract, even if few professed to like it. (On Wednesday, most workers were asking how soon their bonuses would arrive.) “Our leadership went in the plant and made sure we answered as many questions as we could so they were making an informed decision,” said Jeff Wright, the president of U.A.W. Local 249 in Kansas City. More than 90 percent of voters there supported the deal on Sunday after Jimmy Settles, the U.A.W. vice president in charge of negotiations with Ford, flew in and met with workers. Ford plans to add about 1,600 workers in Kansas City and spend $1.1 billion to upgrade the plant. Over all, Ford committed to invest $6.2 billion in its American plants and add 12,000 hourly jobs by 2015, including 5,750 that it had not previously announced. “As the nation’s economy remains stalled and uncertain and its employment rate stagnates, we were able to win an agreement with Ford that will bring auto manufacturing jobs back to the United States from China, Mexico and Japan,” the U.A.W.’s president, Bob King, said in a statement. “The American auto industry is on its way back.”DETROIT — Workers at the Ford Motor Company showed that they were clearly not happy with the four-year labor agreement their union negotiated, but in the end they approved it rather than jeopardize hefty bonuses and thousands of new jobs in an uncertain economy.</text></article>

In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • At Philadelphia’s Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum on Wednesday night, a tribute dinner was held to honor Craig Breedlove, the first man to set official land speed records in excess of 400, 500 and 600 miles per hour on land. Mr. Breedlove built his first land-speed car, the Spirit of America, in his father’s garage in the early ’60s and ran it at the Bonneville Salt Flats, using a surplus United States Air Force Sabre jet engine for propulsion. (Simeone Foundation) • With supply lines cut by floods in neighboring regions, Ford and Mazda have extended a work stoppage at their jointly operated production plant in Thailand through Oct. 24, Automotive News reports. The plant has been closed since Tuesday because of the high water levels in Ayutthaya province, where many suppliers were located. None of the vehicles produced at the plant, which include the new-generation Ford Ranger pickup truck as well as subcompact Mazda models, are exported to North America. (Automotive News) • On Wednesday, a group of Northeast states that also included the nation’s capital, announced the formation of a regional network intended to accelerate the rollout of electric-vehicle infrastructure and the adoption of vehicles with low greenhouse-gas emissions. The group, the Northeast Electric Vehicle Network, received a $1 million Energy Department grant to create uniform guidelines that would ease the permitting process for charger installations from state to state. The network was convened by the Transportation and Climate Initiative (T.C.I.), a consortium of state transportation and energy agencies administered through the Georgetown Climate Center at Georgetown University. (T.C.I.) • Porsche announced Wednesday its intention to expand its plant in Leipzig, Germany, where the Cayenne S.U.V. and Panamera sedan are produced, to accommodate the brand’s smaller S.U.V., known unofficially as the Cajun. Production begins in late 2013. The announcement did not address if Porsche might also build the smaller S.U.V. in China, where Mattias Mueller, the chief executive, said in January that the brand was having difficulty keeping pace with consumer demand. (Porsche) • The team from Tokai University in Japan won the World Solar Challenge on Thursday. As reported Monday by Wheels, the entire race field was halted for more than 24 hours during competition because of wildfires in the vicinity of the race route, through the Australian Outback. The team from the University of Michigan, hampered by a wheel-cover break, finished third, behind the Dutch team from the Delft University of Technology. (Reuters) This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 20, 2011 An earlier version of this post stated that the Spirit of America driven by Craig Breedlove was fitted with an engine from a Phantom jet. As commenter Bob G noted, later confirmed by a spokesman for the Simeone Foundation, the vehicle was powered by a surplus engine from a Sabre jet. The text has been corrected.</text></article>

U.A.W. Local 862 in Louisville, Ky., said its members at two plants voted 53.3 percent in favor of the four-year agreement. The Louisville plants build pickups and sport-utility vehicles and employ 5,397 workers. Ford’s 40,600 American hourly workers were to conclude voting Tuesday. Michele Martin, a spokesman for the union, did not immediately answer a voice message and an e-mail seeking comment. U.A.W. members at Ford shifted from voting 53 percent against the contract last Friday to 63.2 percent in favor as of Tuesday morning. Ford is offering 12,000 new jobs, $6.2 billion in factory upgrades and bonus and profit-sharing payments per worker this year that total as much as $10,000. A lack of a wage increase was responsible for much of the initial opposition. “People are saying there is room for improvement, but they’ll vote in favor of this contract because it means jobs,” said Jerome Williams, president of U.A.W. Local 2000, which represents 1,880 workers voting today at Ford’s Ohio van plant. “A few people are saying we gave up monetary concessions and other things that they’d like to see come back, and rightfully so. But the economic situation isn’t the best right now.” The U.A.W. negotiated contracts for 113,000 workers for the first time since General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. G.M. workers endorsed a new deal last month and workers at Chrysler begin voting this week. Only workers at Ford, which avoided Chapter 11, could strike in these contract talks because G.M. and Chrysler employees agreed not to walk out as part of their government-backed rescues.

Forza 4 Makes Realism Customizable<date>October 19, 2011, 6:00 am</date><text>In a Web advertisement for Forza Motorsport 4, the new racing simulator for the Xbox 360, we hear Jeremy Clarkson say that car enthusiasts “are an endangered species.” Mr. Clarkson, the host of the BBC‘s “Top Gear” show, laments that lovers of speed and performance are being trapped in practical cars and commuter slogs. That, he says, is why a racing simulator like Forza provides sanctuary. After two weeks of playing the game, it’s hard for me to argue the point. As I wrote in my introductory review, Forza 4 is now the best simulator on the market. The heart of this game, of course, lies in the racing. There are 22 tracks, including the Nürburgring in Germany, depicted in startling detail, and more than 100 variations of those tracks. A gamer’s garage can include something as plebeian as the 3-cylinder Ford Ka or as rarefied as the 12-cylinder Aston Martin One-77. But where the fourth installment in the Forza franchise really deviates from previous versions, as well as its competitors, is in each car’s handling. Forza cars handle more realistically because the performance of the tires is more precise. Ask your tires to adjust to a few inputs at once, like braking while turning, and they may give up and start sliding. (Thankfully, Forza brought back the rewind feature, which allows you to go back in the race and retry your botched turn.) The computer-controlled competitors are also prone to slip up, a keen feature for easily bruised egos. These automated opponents aren’t “on rails,” as they are in other games where the cars are always centered on the driving line. Every once in a while in Forza, you may see a hard-charging car in your rear-view mirror suddenly lose traction, granting you some breathing room. The Rivals play mode is also a nice addition. This is an online mode in which you can challenge a friend or stranger to different events, including hot laps or a round of “Top Gear Bowling,” in which each competitor tries to knock down as many bowling pins as possible in one lap around the “Top Gear” test track. It may sound like a cast-off feature from Super Mario Kart, but it’s a fun time-waster, and defeating an opponent earns credits redeemable for new cars or upgrades to the car you drive. The upgrade shop in the game is extensive. You can change any aspect of the car, including turning a front-wheel-drive model to all-wheel or rear-wheel drive. You can add forced induction to an engine or perform an entire engine swap. This does not differ markedly from the upgrade shop in Forza 3, but there are more options for more cars in 4. The modularity of Forza 4 allows you, in essence, to build your dream car. Scratch that — your dream garage. Put a supercharger on a Prius? Why not? That’s a lot of freedom for one video game. It may not offer the open road, but it sure can feel as if it does.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/business/uaw-vote-on-contract-at-ford-near-close.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Ford-U.A.W. Pact Appears Headed for Ratification<date>Published: October 16, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — After facing strong opposition early on, a proposed contract at Ford with the United Automobile Workers union appeared nearly certain to be ratified after receiving a wave of support over the weekend.As of Sunday evening, 62 percent of votes cast were in favor of the four-year deal, a reversal from Friday morning, when just 49 percent supported it. With only a handful of plants yet to weigh in on the contract, it was passing by a margin of 5,800 votes, according to an update released through the union’s official Facebook page dedicated to negotiations with Ford. The lack of a wage increase was responsible for many of the “no” votes among workers at Ford, the only one of the Detroit carmakers that did not file for bankruptcy protection in 2009 or accept a federal bailout. Wages have been frozen since 2003. General Motors and Chrysler workers gave up their right to strike under the terms of the government loans those companies received. Unless workers at the remaining plants reject the deal in overwhelming numbers, the proposed contract will win approval on Tuesday, when voting is scheduled to finish. That would end the only possibility of a strike during this year’s round of labor negotiations in Detroit and allow union leaders to turn their attention to building support for a less-generous contract with Chrysler. “It’s not over till the last vote, but approval looks likely at this point,” Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California, Berkeley, said Sunday. “The early locals voted their anger, and the later locals voted based on what their alternatives would be.” Mr. Shaiken said he also expected the Chrysler agreement to pass, because the terms of that company’s 2009 bankruptcy mean a rejection could lead to the contract’s being settled in binding arbitration, a process seen as less favorable to workers. About 65 percent of G.M. workers voted to ratify their new contract last month. The biggest U.A.W. chapter at Ford, Local 600 in Dearborn, Mich., favored the deal by 62 percent to 38 percent. The local represents 14 percent of Ford’s 41,000 workers, and its resistance to concessions that Ford sought in 2009 helped assure their defeat. Also on Sunday, 90 percent of voters at a plant in Kansas City, Mo., supported the contract. Those results, on top of overwhelming support for the deal from workers in St. Paul, and three other Michigan plants since Friday, overcame opposition at three large plants that were among the first to vote last week. The intensity of Ford workers’ opinions toward the contract has been apparent in that at least 80 percent of workers have voted at most of the locals where results were released. In contrast, many of the large G.M. locals reported turnout of less than 50 percent. Chrysler workers will begin voting this week on a separate deal that follows a similar framework as the Ford deal but provides smaller bonuses, among other differences. Voting there is expected to conclude Oct. 26. The Ford contract, which calls for creating 5,750 jobs that the company had not previously announced, is the most financially generous of the three deals. It calls for signing bonuses of $6,000 for most workers this year and bonuses in later years totaling at least $6,000. G.M. workers get $5,000 immediately and at least $3,000 more in subsequent years. Chrysler, meanwhile, agreed to pay only $1,750 upon ratification; its workers would get another $1,750 when the company meets certain financial targets and additional bonuses based on vehicle quality and other factors. All three companies agreed to increase their pay scale for entry-level workers by several dollars an hour, but workers hired before 2007 will not receive raises. Union officials at Ford plants began preparing for a strike after the early voting was unexpectedly negative last week. They warned workers that Ford could refuse to return to the bargaining table if the deal was turned down, leading to a potentially lengthy walkout or lockout.DETROIT — After facing strong opposition early on, a proposed contract at Ford with the United Automobile Workers union appeared nearly certain to be ratified after receiving a wave of support over the weekend.</text></article>

Yet with federal mileage standards rising to 50 miles per gallon and above in coming years, the pressure to do better is only increasing. That is why reducing friction inside engines is becoming crucial. “We have to hit every system on the engine that slides or rotates,” said Mike Anderson, General Motors’ global chief engineer and program manager for 4-cylinder engines. “We have to go after all of these interfaces.” Friction reduction is proving to be an effective pursuit in the struggle to improve engine efficiency, complementing innovations like direct fuel injection, variable valve timing, turbocharging and cylinder-shutdown systems. In recent years, all have contributed to the development of engines that produce more power from less fuel. Internal-combustion engines are by nature high-friction devices. A multitude of mechanical parts turn or rub in metal-to-metal contact, separated only by a thin oil film. Friction nibbles away at engine power, producing heat that is lost to the atmosphere. Limiting those losses is a goal of every automaker, with huge efforts directed toward tiny returns. For instance, the 3.5-liter V-6 engine of the 2011 Honda Odyssey benefits from a suite of advances that improves the minivan’s E.P.A. highway rating to 28 m.p.g. from 25 for the previous version. Among the improvements were measures that cut engine friction by 4 percent, good for 0.15 m.p.g. — a small but worthwhile gain, said Paul DeHart, senior powertrain engineer for the Odyssey. Of all the power-robbing parts in an engine, Mr. DeHart said, the piston assembly was the source of the most significant losses. As the piston moves in the cylinder bore, the piston rings press against the cylinder wall, providing a seal for combustion gases and keeping lubricating oil from being burned. All the while, the piston’s sides, or skirts, slide against the cylinder wall. Considerable progress is being made in reducing the friction losses resulting from piston movement. Mercedes-Benz, for example, has developed a slippery cylinder-coating technology it calls Nanoslide, first used in 2006 on the 6.3-liter AMG V-8. In the Nanoslide coating process, the cylinder walls are sprayed with an ultrathin layer — 4 to 6 one-thousandths of an inch — of a molten iron-carbon alloy. A special finishing process puts a smooth surface on this extremely hard coating, at the same time opening tiny pockets in the metal that retain oil for lubrication. In the diesel V-6 engine of the ML350 BlueTec model, Mercedes says, Nanoslide has reduced fuel consumption by 3 percent. Other automakers have taken different approaches to producing cylinder surfaces that are as smooth and wear-resistant as possible. For example, Honda has developed a technique it calls plateau honing for the cylinder walls of its engines. Rather than a standard single-step machining process with a honing tool — an abrasive that smoothes the cylinder to the required finish — plateau honing uses two stages of grinding to produce a surface that is ultrasmooth yet leaves a pattern of very fine grooves to hold oil. Even that may soon be outdated. The director of advanced powertrains at Chrysler, Chris Cowland, said in a telephone interview that his group was developing a technology that used a laser to burn a honing pattern into cylinders. But the best cylinder-finishing practices are wasted if the bores are subsequently pulled out of round when bolts are tightened during engine assembly or by the expansion of the metal at running temperatures. Powertrain engineers emphasize the importance of designing an engine block that will not exhibit cylinder distortion when in use. Mr. Anderson, the G.M. engineer, said that when designing the engine block for the company’s new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, engineers did extensive computer modeling of the block’s structure. The modeling included simulations of the conditions that could cause cylinder distortion. 1 2 Next Page »Detroit</text></article>

The bulletins, known as T.S.B.’s, are not recalls; they are information provided by manufacturers to dealers’ service departments. Unless otherwise noted, automakers do not offer payment assistance for the repairs beyond normal warranty coverage. Alldata.com sells a more comprehensive version of the bulletins to consumers. Here are a few recent examples: ACURA An extended warranty on the rear catalytic converter is available for some 2007 MDX crossovers. In T.S.B. 11-018 issued on Aug. 17, Acura said the warranty would be extended to 10 years or 120,000 miles, from eight years or 80,000 miles. In T.S.B. 11-017 issued on the same date, Acura said reprogramming the electronic control module should prevent further problems with the converters. AUDI Some models with 3- and 3.2-liter V-6 engines may experience problems with the accessory drive belt or its guide. In T.S.B. 131106 issued on Aug. 22, Audi said some 2011 S4, S5 Cabriolet, A6 and Q5 models might have a guide that was out of line, causing damage to the belt. Audi will do a free inspection of vehicles it suspects of having the problem and replace the guide and the belt as needed. BMW Some 2011 X3 models may need a new rear window. In T.S.B. B512911 issued on Sept. 1, BMW said the rear window defroster might fail because of a chemical reaction between the heating conductors and the foil to which they are attached. Replacing the window with a revised model should stop the problems. DODGE The outer tie-rod ends on some Ram 1500 trucks may be eligible for free replacement. In T.S.B. L04 issued on Aug. 30, the Chrysler Group said some 2009-10 models shipped to cold-weather states might allow water into the outer tie-rod ends, causing a rattling or clunking when driving. Replacing the outer tie-rod ends should stop the noises. FORD Some 2012 Focus models may need a new steering gear. In T.S.B. 11-9-8 issued on Sept. 20, Ford said some drivers had noticed a tendency for the steering to wander above 45 m.p.h. Replacing the steering gear should straighten things out. GENERAL MOTORS Some midsize G.M. sedans may qualify for an extended warranty on the catalytic converter. In T.S.B. 10134A issued on Aug. 24, G. M. said the affected cars were 2006-7 Chevrolet Malibus with the 2.2-liter 4-cylinder engine and those with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with a 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as the 2006-8 Pontiac G6 and the 2008 Saturn Aura. The cars may have a deteriorating catalytic converter, causing the engine light to illuminate. The warranty will be extended to 10 years or 120,000 miles from eight years or 80,000 miles. HONDA An extended warranty on the power steering pump is being offered for some Odyssey minivans. In T.S.B. 11-039 issued on Sept. 2, Honda said some 2005-10 models might be hard to steer at low speeds. The warranty is extended to seven years or 100,000 miles from the original powertrain coverage of five years or 60,000 miles. MAZDA Some CX-7 and CX-9 crossovers may leak oil from the rear differential seal. In T.S.B. 0300411 issued on Sept. 21, Mazda said the issue with 2007-11 models might be a differential breather that was placed too low and became clogged by snow or water. A new differential with a raised breather covered by the breather boot should stop the leak. NISSAN A leak from the oil cooler may be a problem on some Nissans. In T.S.B. NTB11015A issued on Sept. 6, Nissan said the leak from the upper end of the oil cooler might occur in 2007-12 Altimas and Sentras and 2008-12 Rogues with 4-cylinder engines. Removing the cooler and replacing the gaskets should fix the problem. SCION AND TOYOTA Several models with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine may be using too much oil. In T.S.B.’s SB002411 and SB009411 issued on Aug. 11, the companies said the problem was traced to the piston assembly. Replacing the pistons and rings should solve the problem. Affected models are the 2007-9 Scion tCs and the 2008-9 Scion xB as well as these Toyotas: 2006-8 RAV4, 2007-8 Solara, 2007-9 Camry, 2007-11 Camry Hybrid, 2009 Corolla and 2009 Matrix. VOLKSWAGEN The company says it may have a remedy for diesels that won’t start in cold weather. In T.S.B. 2111-06 issued on Sept. 6, Volkswagen said some 2009-11 Jettas and 2010-11 Golfs, all with the 2-liter TDI engine, might not start if left in temperatures below freezing. Moisture from the air intake may condense in the intercooler. VW recommends adding a cold weather intercooler kit.SCIONS and Toyotas needing new pistons and rings and Ford Focuses with steering issues are among the vehicles covered in the latest technical service bulletins.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/business/half-of-votes-counted-ford-labor-contract-leans-into-yes-territory.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Half of Votes Counted, Ford Labor Contract Leans Into ‘Yes’ Territory<date>Published: October 14, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — The ratification outlook for a proposed four-year labor agreement between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union improved on Friday, but opposition at several large plants that have yet to finish voting could still be enough to sink the deal.As of late Friday morning, the contract was supported by 50.8 percent of voters so far, the union said on a Facebook page dedicated to its negotiations with Ford. It said 6,271 “yes” votes had been counted, compared with 6,085 “no” votes. And as of Saturday morning, support had grown to 56 percent, with 8,577 “yes” votes compared with 6,710 “no” votes. Until then, the “no” votes had been leading after workers at three large plants — one in Wayne, Mich., and two in Chicago — rejected the deal, largely over complaints that most workers would not receive wage increases. The swing into positive territory happened when 79 percent of workers at a plant in Flat Rock, Mich., voted in favor of the contract, according to the Web site of Local 3000 there; that is the largest margin of approval reported publicly so far. The Flat Rock plant, which makes the Ford Mustang and a Mazda sedan as part of a joint venture, is in line to begin building the Ford Fusion midsize sedan if the contract passes, saving it from layoffs or possible closing after Mazda ends production there next year. Voting is scheduled to finish Tuesday. The outcome largely hinges on how many of the more than 10,000 workers at U.A.W. locals in Dearborn, Mich., and Louisville, Ky., support the contract in the coming days. If the deal fails, negotiators could return to the bargaining table under an indefinite extension of the old contract, the union could call a strike, or Ford could lock out the workers. Union leaders across the country have begun assembling strike committees and distributing information about strike pay and procedures. At the same time, many have stepped up efforts to win support for the deal, warning workers that rejecting the agreement could result in a worse outcome. “With the way the economy is and the way labor’s been under attack, I think to vote it down expecting to get more – I don’t think that’s realistic,” said Keith Brown, the president of Local 245 in Dearborn, Mich. In 2009, Ford workers turned down concessions that the company sought to the four-year contract it signed in 2007. Mr. Brown said he hoped that workers would realize that turning down an entirely new contract could have more negative consequences than voting against modifications to an existing contract. Ford is the only American auto company that the U.A.W. can strike against during this round of contract talks, but both the company and the union have said they wanted to maintain a civil relationship. If the Ford contract passes, workers would get bonuses of $6,000, or $5,000 if they were hired less than a year ago. They also would receive a $3,752 advance on next year’s profit-sharing checks in November and $1,500 annually from 2012 through 2015. The total of the bonuses is at least 50 percent more than G.M. and Chrysler agreed to pay their workers. G.M. workers have already ratified their new contract, and voting at Chrysler, which reached a tentative deal Wednesday, is to begin soon.DETROIT — The ratification outlook for a proposed four-year labor agreement between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union improved on Friday, but opposition at several large plants that have yet to finish voting could still be enough to sink the deal.</text></article>

In the last couple of days, 63 percent of workers at two big assembly plants in Michigan and Illinois voted against the deal even though it promised larger bonuses and more new jobs than contracts negotiated with General Motors and Chrysler. Workers have indicated that they are most upset that the contract keeps wages frozen for those on the traditional pay scale, particularly in light of bonuses given to top Ford executives as the company, the country’s second-largest automaker, has rebounded from the recession. Many are also upset that people hired in the last few years will continue to be paid much lower wages, though the second-tier pay scale was increased by several dollars an hour in the new contract. “I’m fairly confident that Ford can afford to pay us more,” said Gary Walkowicz, an opponent of the deal who works at a Ford plant near the company’s headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. “We’ll be talking about more than 10 years without a raise by the end of this contract.” The surprising early showing against the contract prompted the U.A.W. to alert union locals to begin preparations for a strike as soon as next week if the tentative agreement failed to pass. Voting will continue through Tuesday. “This will be our next course of action if the tentative national agreement is rejected,” Keith W. Brown, president of U.A.W. Local 245 in Dearborn wrote in a blog posted Thursday. Mr. Brown, who represents workers in Ford’s research and engineering departments, added that he was “still hopeful that we will not need to strike.” Some workers opposing the deal say union leaders are merely raising the possibility of a strike to scare more of its members into ratifying the deal. And some labor experts said the big payouts to Ford’s senior management — its executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., and chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, each received $26 million in compensation last year — might be stirring up a protest vote at the first plants to cast ballots. Postings on the union’s Facebook pages have criticized the paychecks of “greedy” executives and empathized with the protests on Wall Street about compensation in the financial services industry. “There’s no question the executive salaries played into this,” said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “It sets the wrong tone and invites comparison to the issues on Wall Street.” The U.A.W.’s president, Bob King, and his aides were pushing hard for workers in other large plants to support the contract and counteract the negative vote received thus far. In previous contracts, union members have occasionally rejected agreements early in the process, only to have the last voting factories support the deal overwhelmingly. A big swing factor could be the voting that concludes this weekend at Local 600 in Michigan, which represents about 6,000 workers at Ford’s Rouge assembly complex. “The early votes tend to reflect anger over what’s not in the contract,” said Mr. Shaiken. “The later votes tend to reflect a more realistic view that this is the agreement they are going to get.” Ford is the only American auto company that the U.A.W. can strike during this round of contract talks, but both the company and the union have indicated little interest in a showdown. Beyond a strike, if the ratification should fall short, the two sides could hold further talks, or Ford could impose a lockout on the union workers. 1 2 Next Page »DETROIT — Voting by Ford’s unionized workers on a new contract has been unexpectedly negative, signaling a rejection of its hold-the-line pay provisions and raising at least the possibility that Detroit’s fragile labor peace could be disrupted by a strike.</text></article>

The Soul stands out as the only cool one — a trucklike car with a pugnacious appearance whose offbeat, almost cartoonish character appeals to young drivers. The Soul wears the so-called tiger mouth grille that the former Audi design chief Peter Schreyer made into the signature Kia face. But its personality is very different from other Kias, with their flowing lines. The Soul’s rear cargo area is like a backpack, said Tom Kearns, Kia’s American design studio chief. With its upright, square hatch and devil’s-horn taillights, it suggests youthful mischief. Designers are increasingly turning out small cars with quirky characters to woo young drivers. This year’s quirkiest new vehicle may be the Nissan Juke crossover, whose hood-mounted headlights and haunchlike rear fenders make it resemble an aggressive bullfrog. “It was inspired by rally cars,” said the Juke’s chief designer, Alfonso Albaisa. The body lends a sense of ruggedness and security. The Juke appears to have two sets of headlights, which is as disconcerting as two sets of eyes in a cartoon character. This, Mr. Albaisa said, echoes the look of rally cars with extra headlights. “Young buyers know rally cars from television and video games,” he said. The Juke also has a high beltline; full rear fenders, or hips; and a high stance. The Juke’s lower front fascia, a row of air intakes, is sculptured to look tough, suggesting a huge set of brass knuckles. Such strikingly individualized small cars contrast with the reliable but unadventurous economy models of the past, like the Toyota Corolla, a world sales leader for generations. Now Scion offers the tiny but friendly iQ, and Chevrolet is rolling out the Sonic (whose name even sounds like a video game character). Ford has replaced its bland small cars of the past with the Fiesta and Focus: sportier, more sculptured models introduced in Europe, where small cars are given more design attention. “Personality is becoming a factor in differentiation and marketing,” said Joel Piaskowski, Ford’s design director for North America. He is known for his work at Hyundai and then Mercedes-Benz before he joined Ford last year. “Small cars have to have character,” he said. “For years, there were lots of small cars that were bland, but people bought them because they were reliable, got you from Point A to Point B and retained resale value. But people have moved away from that. “The price of entry to the market is good design as well as quality,” Mr. Piaskowski said. Beyond that, he says, vehicles with personality are more likely to succeed. “People want something with more character that reflects their own personality and lifestyle.” Economic constraints and the demographics of an urbanizing population are increasing the popularity of smaller models and the need for manufacturers to sell more of them. Some industry analysts say they believe that many buyers today are buying models one size smaller than in boom times — a compact instead of a standard sedan, or a subcompact instead of a compact. Ford, for instance, expects small cars to make up 55 percent of its sales by 2020. Manufacturers must sell more small cars to meet higher fleet economy regulations. (From 2012 to 2016, average mileage benchmarks are set to rise from 33.8 miles per gallon to 39.5 m.p.g.) But the carmakers also want to sell those smaller cars at higher prices, so they are making them more attractive. “Premium small” cars, as the auto executives call them, offer more features and better materials. Designers of models like the Mini Cooper and the Volkswagen Beetle have channeled the personalities of predecessor vehicles to attract current drivers. The Mini’s appeal has been kept alive with the introduction of new models and a constant variety of graphic and interior option packages that let buyers customize the cars. Other makers are following that strategy. For Volkswagen’s newest version of the Beetle, by contrast, abundant pop personality has been tempered with practicality. The bulbous New Beetle has been flattened and lengthened. The old car was a model of the collective memory of the original. As in memory, the good things were exaggerated, the bad things omitted. Now, the trunk has grown and the rear seat passengers have more room. Fiat, returning to America as an owner of Chrysler, designed its 500 coupe and convertible to stir memories also — but less specific ones, of Italian culture, Vespas, Olivettis and Audrey Hepburn. Roberto Giolito, designer of the concept that became the new 500, said that he sought to render the essence, not details, of the classic 500. “It had a double bubble body shape,” he said. “We took that theme.” The result is as personable as Luigi, the 500 in the Pixar film “Cars.” Fiat is calling its dealerships “studios” and has equipped them with espresso machines. In case anyone doubts that its car is a fashion item, Fiat offers a Gucci edition, with green/red/green stripe and Gucci-patterned seat upholstery. Will Prada, Versace or Missoni versions follow? The Scion iQ, Toyota’s smallest car, is about the size of a Smart Fortwo but fits four people — just barely. It is arriving in the United States this fall. Like the Smart, which starred in films from Woody Allen’s “Scoop” to “The Da Vinci Code,” the car looks cuter observed in action than when being driven. But the iQ has a rich twin. The Aston Martin Cygnet is a £31,000 ($48,000) version of the iQ, done up with a wood and leather interior worthy of an Aston Martin Volante. At roughly three times the price of the iQ, it is not yet set for United States import but is being offered as what the company has described as a dinghy to match the yachts of Aston Martin sports cars.

It will change not just how we drive, but the economics of the car business. “Five percent of cars are connected today,” said Glenn Lurie, president of AT&amp;T’s Emerging Devices business. He was speaking of new vehicles, not all cars on the road. “Three to five years from now, 100 percent will be connected. You’ll see diagnostics, calls when the airbag goes off, real-time traffic reports, entertainment in the back seat.” The CTIA Show Dispatches from the wireless industry’s fall event. Mr. Lurie was at CTIA, a wireless industry gathering in San Diego. On Tuesday, General Motors’s Cadillac unit showed off a luxury car platform, called Cue, which will appear in three car models in 2012. In addition to the safety monitoring features, the version shown in the Cadillac XTS featured an 8-inch touch screen that displayed maps, climate controls, weather and text messaging, among other things. It was possible to plug a smartphone in the car in order to have the messages read aloud. Ford has shown a similar entertainment system, as well as monitoring and information systems for its electric cars, so drivers can find the nearest charging station. AT&amp;T works with Ford, as well as BMW and Nissan, and talks with lots of other manufacturers. What he sees as much as anything is an explosion of business models that will go with the connected cars. Should the devices cost more up front, or be discounted in exchange for service plans, the way cellphones are? How about engine diagnostics that tell you when to bring the car in, and can even schedule a visit during a down time for the service center, fetching a better price? Should phones and cars work together, through AT&amp;T, to make real-time maps of traffic conditions? “We have 100 million probes out there” in the form of consumers using mobile phones on the network, Mr. Lurie said. “There will be all kinds of models – put it in the price, give it away for the first year, sell it by the month.” The effect on the car business, he said, will be “a watershed.” Cars are not the only vehicles getting connected. AT&amp;T’s business solutions group has worked with manufacturers of tractors to enable wireless monitoring of engine data, and with crane makers, to measure use and inform people when goods are loaded. Sometimes the company makes money by shipping the data, sometimes it works as a consultant, figuring out what part of the business should get networked. Many of these projects have been multimillion-dollar ventures, years in the planning. Mr. Lurie thinks that the next step may be more grassroots, as smaller companies figure out how to repurpose existing devices, like the iPod, to work in new environments. “What will be more innovative than people realize is the accessories business,” he said. “What kind of cradle does the device fit into in the home, or the office or the car?” The tablet may spend part of its day as a picture frame on an office desk, he said, and later be hooked into the screens of an online multiplayer game. “Apple and Samsung will do things,” he said, “but so will innovative third parties.”</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/debating-a-labor-contract-on-facebook/?ref=fordmotorcompany">Debating a Labor Contract on Facebook<date>October 13, 2011, 8:12 pm</date><text>A screen shot of a U.A.W. Facebook page. DETROIT — As Ford’s 41,000 hourly workers weigh the merits of their proposed four-year contract in plants and union halls across the United States this week, their debates have spilled onto Facebook, providing a glimpse into which issues are influencing their votes most. For the first time, the United Automobile Workers union has been using social media to communicate with its members during the contract talks in Detroit, and the most intense back-and-forth has occurred in the last few days, as ratification voting got under way at Ford. Some bemoaned the lack of a wage increase while Ford’s two top executives got bonuses totaling about $100 million. Others criticized the continuation of a two-tier wage scale. Even those who said they supported the deal acknowledged being unhappy with many portions of it. Some suggested the deal would be much better received if it covered just two years instead of four, so the terms could be revisited sooner. One of the union staff members who administer the “U.A.W. Ford Department” page and worked closely with the bargaining team during talks, conceded that the agreement was less than ideal but argued that circumstances did not allow for anything better. “In 2015 we will do better,” the post said. “This is not the last agreement we will ever settle and hopefully our economy, our image, and our ability to bargain with a bigger stick will be better in the future. But this is not the time to wage this war.” As it became apparent that more workers were voting “no,” talk turned to the possibility of a strike as soon as next week. A man who identified himself as working in the body shop of Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, said the mood had become “somber and quiet” there. A few workers noted that Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, was an executive at Boeing during a 69-day strike in 1995, saying that the deal that workers at that company eventually approved was worse than the one they rejected to begin the walkout. A Ford worker in Louisville expressed concern that any gains made by a strike against Ford would be overshadowed by wages lost while on the picket lines. The U.A.W. pays its members $200 a week for strike duty, roughly one-fifth of full wages. The U.A.W. had posted updates to Facebook on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings indicating that early voting was around 50-50.</text></article>

All through the baseball playoffs, Mike Tanier will provide the Bats blog with daily updates on less-than-important developments from around the league. His Phillies homerism is no longer an issue. Nothing Matters and So What If It Did: Depth does not matter in the postseason. Tigers catcher Alex Aliva is playing on a bad knee. His backup, designated hitter Victor Martinez, strained an oblique muscle last night. Third catcher Omir Santos, who had 22 at bats this season, may be needed sometime: if not this afternoon, then Thursday, or if this series extends to six or seven games. Delmon Young was scratched with a neck injury Tuesday night. Ryan Raburn, a utility man who played seven different positions in 2011, replaced him in left field. Magglio Ordonez is long gone, and the Tigers have gotten used to life with Don Kelly, Andy Dirks, and Brandon Inge sharing right field and third base in various combinations. The “depth does not matter” assertion is a great baseball truism, meaning that it is false. Ask the 2010 Giants, or any of the teams that they beat by using all 25 players in a variety of perplexing ways. Often, there is a qualifier placed upon the “depth” wisdom: it’s pitching depth that doesn’t matter. New York Times writer Arthur Daley said so after the Giants beat the Indians in the 1954 World Series: “In a short series – and no one suspected this one would be as short as it was – pitching depth doesn’t carry the same weight it does over the regular season.” The gang at Baseball Prospectus agrees. “In a short series … the bottom ten roster spots don’t do you as much good,” wrote Joe Sheehan while breaking down the 2008 playoffs, quoting Bill James (“In a short series, depth don’t count.”) to dissuade any potential dissenters. When our stat-minded colleagues and 1950s sports writing forebearers are in agreement, there is something very, very wrong. Pitching depth does not matter, except when it does. The Rangers needed 8 1/3 innings from their bullpen on Monday. They got 4 1/3 quality innings from Scott Feldman, a journeyman “Quadruple A” type who appeared in 11 major league games in 2011. When the 11th inning arrived, the Rangers had Mike Adams, a veteran set-up man with a 2.11 career E.R.A., on the mound to work his way out of a jam. The Tigers were forced to turn to Ryan Perry, a 24-year-old with a 4.07 career ERA. Guess who won the game. Short series come down to front line pitching, except that the Cardinals got a great effort from Game 4 starter Edwin Jackson to beat the pitching-laden Phillies, and the Tigers got a huge boost from Max Scherzer, whose last name is German for “pitch Verlander on three days’ rest.” Short series come down to your eight primary position players, unless some of them are injured, as is usually the case in October. We really need to amend the “depth doesn’t matter” rule a tiny bit. In a short series, depth doesn’t matter. Unless your team has a slugging all-purpose catcher-first baseman-designated hitter like Martinez or Mike Napoli. They matter. So do multi-use super subs like Matt Rayburn or Skip Schumaker. They matter. So do fourth starters, because most teams do not throw their ace on short rest until the end of the World Series anymore. Fourth starters matter. Middle relievers also matter, and because a rain delay may mess up your rotation and force you to play four straight games, having a swingman like Feldman is a good idea. So who does that leave? The fifth starter, assuming he is not the swingman who eats four innings of an 11- inning game for you. The mop-up reliever, though he may be called upon in extra innings. The back-of-the-bench utility guy, unless he also plays left field and can fill in for Matt Holliday, scoring three runs in the N.L.D.S., like Allen Craig. Craig matters. Everyone else, the guys who never play, doesn’t matter. But then, do they ever? Understanding Tigers Fans: Now that Tigers will be around until at least Thursday night, we should take a moment to celebrate their fans, or at least get to know them. Georgea Kovanis of the Detroit Free Press wrote an excellent primer on the Tigers fan experience for those of us who get most of our impressions of Detroit from Lions fans with bags over their heads and from Eminem albums. Much of the article is a reminder that every city’s sports fans are unique in exactly the same way (wow, Michigan folks like to tailgate and watch games at bars, just like we do), but there is plenty of local color and flavor as well. A few notes on the piece: 1.Iron Mike Scrap Metal Services not only flew a banner over Comerica Park last week, but they also have a website filled with pricing information on everything from copper to “Scrap Insulated Light Wire 50% Recovery.” Some of the prices update continuously. At this writing, the price for scrap aluminum is … well, I’ll be. Excuse me while I go rip the siding off my neighbor’s house. It will just take a moment. The scrap metal industry is important to builders and contractors, helping them dispose of materials and recoup costs. It just does not seem like the kind of business that is best advertised on a banner flyover. Are Tigers games attended by thousands of contractors who are suddenly undecided about what to do with all of that scrap insulated light wire? “Hey, look, Matt: there is a $2 beer special at a bar nearby. We should go there after the game.” “You are right, Mitch, and then we can finally get rid of all of that non-ferrous scrap metal we have lying around.” 2. “Coneys” have nothing to do with Coney Island, though they are hot dogs. Here is a definitive-looking explanation of the coney. Vegans beware: the link may contain ground-up beef hearts. 3. P.E.T.A. ranked Comerica Park as the third most vegetarian friendly ballpark in America. A quick trip to the P.E.T.A. archives revealed the full list. First Place: AT&amp;T Park, San Francisco. That makes sense. They love their health food out in California. You can apparently get “noodles with ginger, sesame, and veggies” at the park, possibly prepared by Pablo Sandoval in a panda costume. Second Place: Citizens Bank Park, Philadelphia. Wait, hold on, back up. Really? “Southwest black-bean burgers, mock-steak sandwiches, breaded faux-chicken sandwiches, and tangy hummus with pita chips. Don’t forget the closer: the vegan rice krispie treat.” Thanks to that “closer” remark, I will now forever associate Ryan Madson with a vegan rice krispie treat. Thanks, P.E.T.A. 4. Giving someone directions that include the phrase “next to the Ford” is not helpful in any city, though it is probably worse in Michigan, where there are still members of the Ford family around who resent being used as landmarks. If you need to meet someone in a crowded venue, it is best to pick some unique, rarely visited location, like “next to the vendor who sells vegan rice krispie treats.”</text></article>

Fast-Charging<date>October 12, 2011, 6:00 am</date><text>Courtesy of FordThe prototype positions two ports below the main port to facilitate D.C. fast-charging. Daimler announced Tuesday that it would show a prototype combination plug and port design intended for use on plug-in hybrids and purely electric vehicles. The system, a joint effort with Audi, BMW, Porsche and Volkswagen, will be on view at a technology conference in Baden-Baden, Germany, on Wednesday and Thursday. The announcement is the most explicit indication yet from German automakers that they favor the design standard coordinated by SAE International, an organization of scientists and vehicle engineers, over one developed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and in wide use in Asia, known as Chademo. SAE International collaborated with Ford and General Motors to develop the rounded, one-size-fits-all J1772 plug used by nearly all plug-in vehicles in the United States, and worked with them again on the combo-plug prototype being shown in Germany. As reported by The Times in August, and echoed by Jack Pokrzywa, manager of ground vehicle standards for SAE, in a telephone interview, the organization was working on an enhanced version of its J1772 plug that would accommodate 480-volt D.C. fast-charging, a method capable of restoring an 80 percent charge to a Nissan Leaf in about 30 minutes. The design on display in Germany adds two contact pins that engage when the car is plugged into a fast-charging unit. SAE standards are voluntary, but Mr. Pokrzywa noted that many of the world’s automakers have worked with the organization on developing the combined protocol. He added that in the next few months SAE would begin testing the prototype combo charging system in production vehicles. If the testing is successfully concluded, a final standard could be published by the organization in the first quarter of 2012. Tom Saxton, a board member of the E.V. advocacy group Plug In America and the owner of a Nissan Leaf, said in an interview that he was concerned that SAE’s proposed combo plug “may be awkward and uncomfortable to use.” He mentioned a smaller and lighter combined charging connector recently developed by Tesla Motors that also supported D.C. fast-charging.</text></article>

Just four years ago, when the United Auto Workers settled on contracts with the Big Three, the rank-and-file learned the details by crowding into union halls for meetings that were often chaotic and confusing. Many workers complained that they had not seen the fine print until the deals had been ratified.But like so much in the American auto industry, the old rules of bargaining no longer apply. In recent weeks, the U.A.W.’s Web site crashed in the hours after new contracts were unveiled with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company because so many workers were downloading them. And how did many workers learn about the deals? Through Facebook pages and Twitter feeds kept up to date, often late into the night, by union staff members stationed in the halls outside the bargaining rooms. For the first time, the union also worked with each company to set up secure Web sites that allowed workers to receive e-mail updates. “We may have gotten a lot more done in the past, and things would have gone smoother provided we had tools like this,” said General Holiefield, the U.A.W. vice president in charge of negotiations with Chrysler, who explained his approach to the talks in a four-minute video posted on YouTube and Facebook last week. “I couldn’t see going forward without using these.” Talks with Chrysler have not concluded, though plant leaders from across the country have been summoned to Detroit for a meeting on Monday, signaling that discussions are in the final stages. Some labor specialists say the wave of social networking this year has provided a bigger window than before into the negotiating process in Detroit, even though the talks still occur in private. Not only is communication more instant and accurate, but it has been extended to people previously left on the sidelines, including retirees. “There is unprecedented openness about this process,” said Kristin Dziczek, labor analyst for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. “You’re not getting the blow-by-blow, but they’re being much more open and transparent in communicating with their members and with the public, who, quite frankly, made a major investment in saving these companies.” Through Facebook, autoworkers at plants in Kansas City, Mo., or Kokomo, Ind., have been able to voice concerns and ask questions directly to the bargaining teams, something they could not do in past years. Facebook helped workers at a Chrysler factory in Dundee, Mich., gather support before voting last month to join the national contract; they had previously been covered by a separate agreement that provided less job security. While the U.A.W. worked to repair its Web site last week, it posted a summary of the Ford contract on Facebook, and received more than 500 comments in response. Since ratification meetings started, the moderators of the U.A.W.’s page for Ford workers have been busy answering requests to clarify sections of the contract language, sometimes responding within minutes. In several instances, the union used Facebook to rebut rumors being disseminated on plant floors or in the news media, rather than allowing them to spread unchallenged. Shortly after a Detroit television station reported that workers would get a signing bonus of $7,500, a message posted on Facebook from Jimmy Settles, the union’s vice president in charge of Ford negotiations, described the report as inaccurate and “designed to intentionally create false expectations.” The finished deal included a bonus of $6,000 for most workers, some of whom had begun posting on Facebook that they would vote against any contract with a bonus of less than $15,000. “It allowed us to get to the membership quickly,” Mr. Settles said in an interview. “The one thing we always had to combat was the expectations of our members. Historically, we didn’t have the apparatus to get that information out.” The Chrysler team reacted similarly last week to quell speculation that the talks were headed to arbitration. Chrysler workers agreed in 2009, as part of the company’s government-aided bankruptcy, to give up their right to strike and that any impasse would be sent to binding arbitration, a result that both parties have said they want to avoid. Art Reyes, the president of U.A.W. Local 651 in Flint, Mich., said Facebook had gone a long way toward “demystifying” the complex negotiations. 1 2 Next Page »DETROIT — For generations, labor negotiations here have been the stuff of closed doors and tight lips.

After a year of happy rumbling in a 1930 Model A Ford, Jonathan Klinger knew that his return to automotive modernity would be an adjustment. He never cheated in his pledge to stick for a year with the Ford, except for the occasional business trip when he rented a car. On the first such occasion, last March at Jacksonville International Airport, he rented a 4-cylinder Chevrolet Malibu, whose performance he found overwhelming. “That was the first time I’d been on the Interstate in quite some time and was in a car that is not normally thought of as a powerhouse,” Mr. Klinger said in an interview. “Yet it felt to me like I was driving an F1 car. If anything, my experience might make me appreciate newer cars, although they lack the character and personality that old cars have.” Such brushes with modernity did not subtract from his attachment to the Model A Tudor sedan, bought last summer for $11,000, and in which he logged 16,000 miles since last fall. The blue car, with big running boards, smallish side windows and straw-yellow wheels has definitely grown on Mr. Klinger, who stored his 1993 Honda Accord and 1999 Ford Explorer before embarking on his attempt. The idea for the yearlong endeavor, which officially ends Thursday, came about nearly two years ago during a discussion with his boss. “I just thought that these cars need to be on the road, not just in museums and garages,” said Mr. Klinger, the public relations manager for Hagerty, a company based in Traverse City, Mich., that specializes in insuring collectors’ cars. Mr. Klinger, who recently turned 30, always favored older cars, he said. He restored a 1919 Model T Ford pickup that came to him in parts and owns a 1941 Ford Super DeLuxe and a 1964 Buick Electra 225. His blog, 365daysofa.com, averaged 20,000 monthly hits, he said, far exceeding expectations. “It was a neat combination of people telling stories, sharing memories or giving technical advice,” he said. “It turned into this whole community of people enjoying this nostalgic throwback.” His posts candidly related the adventure’s highs and lows, including the one time he was 700 miles late lubricating distributor parts, which resulted in screeching noises, and when his “ah-hoogah” horn sounded like a “sick goose,” a condition that was remedied with a simple adjustment. He also recalled the day when a right rear tire was momentarily stuck during a snowstorm that dumped 18 inches, and the two occasions when he called a tow truck after the Model A fell victim to electrical gremlins, which were promptly worked out. Hagerty InsuranceMr. Klinger said the Model A tracked well in snow. “Old cars do require more maintenance than newer cars, but there’s a saying that if you take care of it, it’ll take care of you,” he said. “You start neglecting it, it’ll let you know.” Consequently, when he changed the oil every 1,000 miles, he also greased everything and performed a general inspection of critical systems, like the brakes. Over time, Mr. Klinger added new steering-wheel king pins, an anti-drag kit, an exhaust heater manifold and a new glass shifter knob, and repaired broken rear shock mounts. Because the original engine, a 4-cyinder water-cooled power plant that made 40 horsepower, developed a cracked block, Mr. Klinger somewhat grudgingly replaced it with a short-block engine, cannibalizing parts from the old unit, like the water pump, when needed. “I wanted to finish with all the original equipment, but what can you do,” he said. A Mitchell overdrive was recently added as well, improving speed and fuel economy and adding another gear between two and three. “A lot of people asked me why I waited until the end,” he said. “Well, I wanted the car to be representative of what it would be like to drive it new 81 years ago, when overdrive wasn’t around.” Aside from the 18-inch blizzard, Mr. Klinger said the weather did not significantly affect the Model A, which was slow to stop but tracked well in snow. The car immediately started one morning after a night in subzero temperatures. “Most cars before 1955 had one-half the electrical voltage of today’s 12-volt systems,” he noted. “Because 12 volts crank up faster, people think I’ve converted. But I’ve proven that what I have is doable.” Indeed, there were times during the summer when a slightly overwarmed engine would cause Mr. Klinger to reduce his high cruising speed of about 50 miles per hour to avoid radiator boil-overs. “The car never got that hot, but I sure did — no A.C. So, I wore a lot of T-shirts and carried plenty of water,” he said. Mr. Klinger took a few long trips in the Model A, including a 270-mile trek in January from Traverse City to Detroit for the auto show there, returning the car to its birthplace. He also drove to Ludington, Mich., and crossed Lake Michigan on the venerable S.S. Badger steam ferry to Manitowac, Wisc. Mr. Klinger’s admittedly emotional last-trip hurrah began on Oct. 2, as he set off for the 800-mile ride to Hershey, Penn., and its vaunted car show and auctions. He turned 30 during the events and was fêted during the festivities. “Other than about 10 miles I took all back roads, just really the way a road trip should be done in an old car,” he said, adding that he eschewed fast-food restaurants en route for mom-and-pop lunch counters. “The car performed flawlessly, not even a hiccup,” he said of the drive. “Of course, when it rains, the windshield is flat and I just have this little wiper, which I affectionately call a swiper, since it just kind of schmears the rain around. But the whole trip was so much fun.” Pangs of guilt and wistfulness visited him while loading the car into a trailer for its Michigan return; he was scheduled to fly back. Mr. Klinger expects to discontinue blogging, but plans to drive the car until “the first salted roads.” “This time last year, the weekend before I would start, I’d driven to a pal’s wedding in my Ford Explorer, cruise and climate set, listening to XM Radio and wondering what I’d gotten myself into,” he said. “And now, I’d do it all over again. In a heartbeat.”</text></article>

The Vertrek is expected to inform the styling of the next Escape. In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • Ford announced this week that a V-6 engine would not be offered on its redesigned Escape compact S.U.V., which is scheduled to have its debut at the Los Angeles auto show in November. The Escape will be available with three 4-cylinder power plants: a 1.6-liter EcoBoost that the automaker expects to deliver better highway fuel economy than the current Escape Hybrid, which is rated at 31 miles per gallon; a 2-liter EcoBoost; and a 2.5-liter Ti-VTC. Output levels for the Escape engines were not revealed. (Ford) • The Louisiana Superdome, the home of the New Orleans Saints that functioned as an ad-hoc shelter for thousands of city residents during Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, is now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. The automaker secured exclusive naming rights at the covered stadium for 10 years at an undisclosed cost. The deal also is the first of its kind for Mercedes-Benz in the United States. (The New York Times) • Silver is no longer the most popular exterior color among car buyers in North America. White, which reigned for many years before silver’s surge, registered as the most popular color in a study by PPG Industries, a manufacturer of automotive paint based in Troy, Mich. The company based its findings on purchase histories of 2011 model-year vehicles. Globally, white also displaced silver. (The Detroit Free Press) • Mazda 3 sedans fitted with the Japanese automaker’s Skyactiv suite of efficiency-boosting features will be priced from $18,450, and the hatchback from $18,950, excluding an undisclosed delivery charge. The 3, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Mazda’s sales in North America, received a light redesign of its front fascia for 2012 and is still available with the base 2-liter, 148-horsepower engine. The Skyactiv-G model produces 155 horsepower while delivering an E.P.A.-certified 40 miles per gallon in highway driving. (Mazda)</text></article>

General Motors and RelayRides, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service that allows private car owners to rent their vehicles, announced a partnership and possible investment this week. Under an exclusive two-year agreement, RelayRides users will be able to unlock G.M. vehicles that are registered with the car-sharing service and subscribed to OnStar, the automaker’s communication service, with a mobile phone app. For OnStar subscribers who sign up for RelayRides, the mobile access would take the place of aftermarket hardware installed by the start-up, saving RelayRides about $500 per vehicle, according to Andre Haddad, the company’s chief executive. In essence, cars will be coming off the line equipped for car sharing. G.M., meanwhile, is poised to put more skin in the game. G.M. Ventures, the company’s venture capital arm, is in advanced discussions with RelayRides to make a “small” equity investment within the next few weeks or months, said the G.M. vice chairman, Stephen Girsky, in a telephone interview this week. The RelayRides partnership is expected to be introduced in Northern California in 2012 and expand nationally by year’s end. The companies plan to demo the mobile app for the next several months at events, beginning this weekend in San Francisco. In addition to generating revenue for G.M., the relationship could help the automaker reach new customers, said Mr. Girsky. He described RelayRides rentals as “hassle-free test drives,” affording G.M. access to the start-up’s 3,000 registered borrowers. The opportunity is especially appealing in the Golden State. “In California, they have a relatively large presence, and we have a relatively small presence,” Mr. Girsky added. Vehicles from G.M. brands accounted for about 4 or 5 percent of the vehicles registered in RelayRides, Mr. Girsky said, which was comparable to the automaker’s share of the San Francisco vehicle market at large. “A handful” of RelayRides vehicles have OnStar activated, he said. “Certainly there’s internal debate about whether this is going to work or not,” Mr. Girsky said. But car sharing, perhaps paradoxically, plays into the automaker’s product plan. Associating G.M. technology with a start-up that appeals to urban dwellers and college students could help the automaker “stay relevant to young people,” Mr. Girsky said. Bob Tiderington, manager of new business initiatives at G.M., added that peer-to-peer car sharing could be a “disruptive marketing tactic.” “Frankly, we’ve got nothing to lose,” he said. OnStar is not the only system looking to leverage its communication technology for car sharing. In late August, Zipcar and Ford Motor Company announced a deal to roll out 1,000 Ford vehicles in the car-sharing provider’s university campus fleets over the next two years. Each of the Ford Focus models in that group will be equipped with the automaker’s Sync system. According to a Zipcar spokesperson, however, Zipcar has no plans at this point to use Sync or an aftermarket OnStar system in place of its own gear. Mr. Haddad, who joined the start-up just two weeks ago, said that partnering with G.M. would allow the company to “reach critical mass much faster than we would have on our own.” The company takes a 35-percent cut of each rental, but it makes no money if the cars are not being lent out. Eliminating the need to install proprietary hardware for OnStar-equipped vehicles lowers operating costs; RelayRides can simply write software that communicates with OnStar. RelayRides and G.M. declined to provide details, but Mr. Haddad said the two companies have agreed to split revenue by transaction. The more activity generated through OnStar, the more OnStar would benefit. As Mr. Girsky put it, “RelayRides talks to the vehicle, G.M. gets paid.” Sam Zaid, co-founder and chief executive of Getaround, a RelayRides competitor, said that the growing amount of computing power in cars in general, and electric vehicles in particular, presented a “natural fit” for car sharing. Getaround has patented an easily installed kit for keyless vehicle access. Mr. Zaid said the company was interested in incorporating that technology into factory-built vehicles, as well as potentially seeking access to automakers’ telematics systems for the purpose of peer-to-peer car sharing. He cautioned, however, that with 250 million cars on streets, the computing piece that facilitates car sharing “will not be one size fits all.”</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/business/ford-reaches-contract-deal-with-uaw.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Auto Workers Strike Deal With Ford to Raise Wages and Add New Jobs<date>Published: October 4, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — After winning promises of thousands of new jobs and bonuses for active workers at the Ford Motor Company, the United Automobile Workers union now turns to Chrysler to wrap up its epic contract talks with Detroit’s major automakers.The U.A.W. and Ford on Tuesday announced a tentative agreement on a four-year contract that substantially mirrors the deal struck last month at G.M. The union’s president, Bob King, said he anticipated reaching a settlement soon with Chrysler, the smallest and least profitable of the Detroit car companies. “We want to go in and finish the job at Chrysler very quickly,” Mr. King said at a news conference here on Tuesday to announce details of the Ford pact. About 41,000 union workers at Ford will vote over the next two weeks on whether to approve the agreement, which calls for the company to create 5,750 entry-level jobs in the United States over the four years of the contract. Those jobs are in addition to 6,250 positions that Ford previously said it would add over the next two years. Besides increasing jobs and investment in its facilities in the United States, Ford also agreed to raise the hourly wages of entry-level employees to $19 by the end of the contract, from about $15 now. Longtime auto workers, who earn about $28 an hour, did not get any increase in base wages. Instead, Ford agreed to give workers with at least one year on the job a $6,000 bonus for signing the new contract as well as annual $1,500 payments beginning next year and through 2015. The bonuses are higher than those agreed to by G.M., which is still in the early stages of its comeback from a government bailout and bankruptcy protection in 2009. Analysts said Ford had to sweeten its payments to workers because the company has posted better financial results than its crosstown rivals and rewarded its top executives with bonuses and stock options. Ford agreed to pay the first six months of 2011 profit-sharing for workers — about $3,700 a worker — in November, and the balance next year. Usually, the automakers make profit-sharing payments after the calendar year. John Fleming, Ford’s head of global manufacturing and labor affairs, said Tuesday that the contract was meant to reward workers and improve the company’s cost structure. “We really believe that it’s fair to our employees and recognizes the contribution that they’ve made to the success of the Ford Motor Company,” Mr. Fleming said at a briefing. “But we’re also pleased that it will continue to improve our competitiveness directly here in the United States.” Ford said it would invest an additional $4.8 billion in its United States plants beyond previously announced capital expenditures. Several factories received guarantees of new products in the contract, including an Ohio assembly plant that will build medium-duty trucks that had been slated for production in Mexico. “Our membership not only wanted good wages, they wanted to make sure they had security in their jobs,” said Jimmy Settles, the U.A.W.’s chief negotiator with Ford. Ford officials declined to say whether the contract directly matched what G.M. achieved in terms of holding the line on labor costs. G.M. executives have said their deal will add about 1 percent to labor costs annually over the life of the contract. Mr. King said he believed the Ford deal followed the pattern set by G.M. “The overall costs are very comparable,” he said. The success of the Detroit labor talks is seen as significant because of the industry’s gradual comeback in the face of strong economic headwinds. The union tried to extract bonuses and new jobs without creating additional costs, said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “This is a good contract in very bad times, and that’s an unusual achievement,” Mr. Shaiken said. “It makes the companies more competitive and allows the workers to share in the success.” Mr. King expressed confidence that Ford workers would approve the deal. G.M. employees ratified their agreement last week by almost two to one. The negotiations may be trickier at Chrysler, which has taken longer than G.M. to turn around after its own federal bailout and trip through bankruptcy. Now controlled by the Italian automaker Fiat, Chrysler is still struggling to achieve solid profitability. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of both companies, has said Chrysler could not afford contracts as rich as those at G.M. and Ford. “The contract at Chrysler will not be identical to Ford’s deal,” Mr. Shaiken said. “But it is likely to be the same framework tailored to fit Chrysler.” The union and Chrysler have agreed to extend their current contract until Oct. 19. Mr. King played down the possibility that the U.A.W. or Chrysler would have to seek arbitration to reach an agreement. “Sergio doesn’t want to turn it over to a third party to decide, and I don’t want to turn it over to a third party,” Mr. King said. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 4, 2011 An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that $2.4 billion of the $6.2 billion investments that Ford would make had already been announced.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/business/car-sales-jumped-in-september.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">U.S. Vehicle Sales Soared Nearly 10% in September, Despite Economic Gloom<date>Published: October 3, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — Auto sales defied a downcast economy in September, climbing 9.9 percent to their highest level in five months as new models arrived at dealerships and inventory shortages eased.All three of the Detroit automakers reported gains, led by a 27.2 percent year-over-year increase for Chrysler, which outsold Toyota for the fourth time this year. Toyota and Honda again trailed the rest of the industry, even though September was the first month since the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan that all of their plants were running at full capacity. Toyota’s sales dropped 17.5 percent, and Honda’s were down 8 percent. In contrast, Nissan sales increased 25.3 percent. The industry’s seasonally adjusted, annualized selling rate rose to 13.1 million, the first time since April that they had exceeded 13 million. General Motors and Ford Motor each said they still expected total sales for 2011 to top 13 million, which would require demand to jump further in the fourth quarter. Auto executives and analysts said shoppers had not been dissuaded by a declining stock market, bleak consumer confidence surveys, a sluggish housing market or high unemployment. Bigger discounts offered by some brands have helped, as have new offerings like the Chevrolet Sonic, a subcompact car, and a bevy of redesigned models from Chrysler. “I don’t know of any other month where we had positive gains in auto sales with all of those negative factors,” Jesse Toprak, vice president for industry trends and insight at TrueCar.com, which tracks sales and pricing. “The automakers might be convincing some consumers who may not be so eager to spend their money to buy a car because the product is so compelling.” Mr. Toprak said more consumers also were showing up at dealerships because their current vehicle had outlived its useful life and they had no choice but to buy a replacement. High used-car prices are prompting some in that situation to buy a new one instead. “As long as things remain relatively stable, even in the face of persistently high unemployment, we’re going to consistently see slow growth,” Don Johnson, G.M.’s vice president for United States sales operations, said in a conference call. “Right now, the pent-up demand due to age of vehicles is what’s keeping this nice, steady, slow growth going.” G.M. sales increased 19.7 percent in September over a year ago. Falling gas prices helped persuade more shoppers to buy pickup trucks and other larger vehicles. Sales of light trucks, including sport utility vehicles and minivans, rose 16.1 percent, while passenger cars were up 3.4 percent. Sales of full-size pickups, which typically fare best when the construction industry prospers, surged 46 percent at Chrysler and 33 percent at G.M. Ford, whose sales were up 9 percent over all, sold 18 percent more light trucks but 8.7 percent fewer cars. At Chrysler, September was the 18th consecutive month of year-over-year sales growth. It reported a 24.3 percent gain for its Jeep brand of S.U.V.’s. “Irrespective of the economy, strong products equal strong sales,” Reid Bigland, Chrysler’s head of United States sales, said in a statement. “There is no double-dip downturn going on around here.” Another carmaker with considerable momentum is Nissan, which experienced relatively minor disruptions from the Japan disaster. Nissan sold 68 percent more of its subcompact car, the Versa, and its midsize sedan, the Altima, has outsold the Honda Accord so far this year. In addition, the Nissan Leaf, an electric car, added to its sales lead over the Chevrolet Volt, G.M.’s plug-in hybrid. Nissan sold 1,031 Leafs to G.M.’s 723 Volts, but G.M. officials said they were still ramping up production while expanding sales to dealers nationwide. For Toyota and Honda, even though plants are running at full speed, inventories are expected to remain below prequake levels until early next year. But dealerships said they were finally able to meet most shoppers’ needs again, rather than just taking an order or hoping the customer came back later. “It’s beginning to feel like normal, almost,” said Adam Skolnick, the general manager at Toyota of Watertown, near Boston. “We have plenty of cars on the lot, and I’m anticipating many, many more coming in the next 45 days or so.” Mr. Skolnick said the arrival of the redesigned Toyota Camry  sedan a week ago was helping the dealership make a quick recovery. For September, Camry sales fell 19.2 percent, but it was the industry’s top-selling car. “It’s been like a bakery here, with people taking numbers to see the car,” Mr. Skolnick said. “It makes it feel fun again.”DETROIT — Auto sales defied a downcast economy in September, climbing 9.9 percent to their highest level in five months as new models arrived at dealerships and inventory shortages eased.</text></article>

What gave the stimulus to the Tigers? In a city always on the lookout for good news, the sports teams were on the front page Monday, and up front in conversation, too. Somehow the football team had a 4-0 record, while the baseball team had just escaped from New York with a split, and was sending its ace, Justin Verlander, against the Yankees’ ace, C. C. Sabathia. Verlander lasted eight gallant innings as fans waving white towels willed him into throwing 99 miles per hour on his 120th and final pitch in a 5-4 win. Whether any of this October madness makes any real difference in the economic prospects of the Motor City is open for debate. But feeling good never hurt. This shrinking city — New Orleans North — has moved into the pop culture of an Eminem commercial and a Clint Eastwood movie, making the viewer root for the underdog. What could be more American than underdogs? (Or so we like to tell ourselves.) “I love that the owners brought the Lions downtown and built a new ballpark for the Tigers,” Scott Hay said Monday afternoon. He was wearing a No. 13 Tigers jersey in homage to Lance Parrish (“I couldn’t find a Chet Lemon jersey”) and nursing a beer in the Hockeytown Cafe, gazing across an underused Woodward Avenue at the light towers of Comerica Park, where a ballgame would break out in four hours. “I love the Red Wings,” said Hay, a native of Grand Rapids, Mich., now living in Sandy, Utah. “Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but they have won so much, but now you have the Lions and Tigers winning on the same day. That doesn’t happen very often.” The evening was so promising that the Hockeytown Cafe, opposite the historic Fox Theater, was likely to draw a crowd on all three indoor levels and even the outdoor garden on a chilly but not brutal night. The manager, who identified himself as Jason, said he had put 60 people on staff; the norm for October might be 10. That sixfold work force was an affirmation of the folk wisdom that sports were good for fading downtowns. “I think it’s fantastic,” Verlander had said Sunday evening when asked what sports success can do for Detroit. “One, the more you win, the more fans come.” He added, “When things are going well with the sporting teams, obviously, people tend to migrate there much more often.” Obviously, these were patrons of a sports oasis, not the hardest-hit residents of Detroit. But on Monday, they were migrating to this city of unintentional Potemkin villages — skyscrapers built for thousands of workers, in support of factories built to produce millions of cars — but downtown has as many ghosts as workers. In midafternoon, the handsome Old Wayne County Building on Randolph, with its Beaux-Arts and neo-Classical touches, was sitting empty, for sale or lease. The 2010 census showed that Detroit’s population had dropped 25 percent —to 713,777, from 951,270 in 2000 — after a peak of 1.8 million in 1950, when it was the fifth-largest city in the United States But some fans could detect life in the old town. “I love Detroit,” said MariAnn Saenen of Caro, Mich., which is in “the Thumb of Michigan,” in the northeast corner of the state. She and her friend Marie Berridge from Bad Axe, Mich., were in the Hockeytown Cafe, waiting for Saenen’s son and grandson to arrive on a flight from Virginia Beach bearing tickets to the game. The two friends make the run to Tigers games a few times a year and praise Mayor Dave Bing for his plans to use the vacant space for a smaller, greener city. David Yost of Mount Pleasant, Mich., was guarding two beers and two chairs for his family and saying he comes back for games in the Detroit of Mayor Bing. “In the past, you wouldn’t go down Woodward,” Yost said, “but now, people have an ‘it’s not so bad’ attitude.” Detroit has become a symbol for a nation that still likes to think it builds things. In the babble of the Super Bowl last winter, probably the most touching moment (well, except for Packers fans and bettors) was the two-minute Chrysler commercial featuring Eminem — a panorama of snow-pelted, scuffling Detroit, with narration: “You see, it’s the hottest fires that make the hardest steel.” The message was that Motor City still has a mission — Imported From Detroit. Motor City was implanted in our consciousness in 2008 by Clint Eastwood, in his film “Gran Torino,” about a bigoted autoworker watching the world change around him — foreign cars, foreign ways. But the old crank grows to love the young Hmong brother and sister next door, maybe as much as he loves the Gran Torino he helped build. It was a Detroit movie. It made the viewer hope that the center would hold. Lately, there has been a modest comeback by the auto industry, stemming from the proactive investment by the Obama administration. General Motors recently signed a four-year contract with the United Auto Workers, and the union has called in its members for a possible vote on a Ford contract as soon as Tuesday. In the long run, jobs in plants mean more than whether Verlander could beat the Yankees. But there’s no point faulting people who think that matters, too. E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 8, 2011 The Sports of The Times column on Tuesday about the boost Detroit has received from the success of the Tigers and the Lions misidentified the narrator of a Super Bowl commercial for Chrysler that featured the rapper Eminem. The narration was done by Kevin Yon, a voice-over artist, not by Eminem.DETROIT</text></article>

T. Barnum and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.Panoramas of the era were giant realistic paintings of exotic landscapes, unscrolled on rollers to the accompaniment of piano music. They astonished audiences, much as IMAX films did some 150 years later. Americans have repeatedly indulged in big views ever since: picture windows in the ranch house, CinemaScope at the drive-in, wide screen television in the media room. A similar passion for the wider view may be taking shape in automobiles. Huge double sunroofs are growing more popular. They offer a view of the sky that attracts about as many car buyers as those who get navigation units, at a cost roughly equivalent to the $1,500 that is the car salesman’s rule of thumb for leather seats. The Web site of an auto industry publication, Wardsauto.com, recently reported that 31 percent of vehicles are bought with a sunroof today, while a decade ago only about 20 percent had one. Ford says orders for its expansive Vista Roof option are double what had been projected; in two crossover models, the Edge and Explorer, half of the buyers spent the extra money for it. The option is also available on the Lincoln MKX. Gerry McGovern, head of design at Land Rover, said panoramic roofs made a vehicle’s interior seem larger, opening it to the outside world. “They bring in the urban ambiance,” Mr. McGovern said. (He has given the new Land Rover Evoque a very large sunroof.) The notion is not a new one: publicity for the De Soto Skyview taxicabs of the 1940s and ’50s promoted their open roofs as an attraction to city visitors. New types of glass have helped make the trend possible. Today’s glass is treated to filter out ultraviolet and reduce heat load, lowering the demand on air-conditioning systems. Ceiling glass can also make tightly packed interiors seem more attractive, designers say — a benefit to companies trying to meet new fuel economy standards by selling smaller cars. Passenger vehicles must meet federal safety standards, no matter what type of roof. Panoramic roofs have also fared well in independent tests. “We have tested a couple of vehicles with panoramic-style sunroofs,” Russ Rader, vice president for communications of the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, said in an e-mail. “There is no indication that these roof designs aren’t as strong as roofs without them.” He added: “However, this doesn’t mean that vehicles with glass roof panels would be as safe in rollovers as vehicles without them.” Glass roofs could break or pop out. Sunroofs are being sold with the sort of breathless marketing language once reserved for a new engine or transmission. The trade names applied to the panoramic roof systems promise the heavens: Command View, UltraView and perhaps the best, Magic Sky, from Mercedes-Benz. These names awaken memories of the Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser station wagons of the 1960s and 1970s, with their angled roof windows inspired by Vista-Dome railroad cars. The roofs are getting bigger. The latest version of Cadillac’s UltraView sunroof, available on the SRX crossover and CTS models, has grown on the new model: the SRX’s sunroof covers 70 percent of the roof area and has a power retractable shade. Volkswagen says that the glass roof of the 2012 Beetle is 80 percent larger than its predecessor’s and that it blocks 99 percent of the ultraviolet radiation and 92 percent of the heat energy. The Volkswagen EOS even offers a sunroof within its folding hard top. “It is an upscale feature,” said Rainer Michel, vice president for product marketing and strategy at Volkswagen of America. “You don’t have to give up the outside entirely when the top is up,” he said. The large sunroof appears to link with the windshield, turning the whole roof into a sheet of glass, Mr. Michel said. Acura says that the panoramic window of its slope-backed ZDX crossover is the largest in the industry. But the most dramatic and extreme treatment may be that of the Jaguar XJ sedan, whose glass sweeps from the windshield to the rear deck and is the key to the car’s visual identity. Jaguar explains that the XJ roof, unlike a conventional sunroof, has a front section that opens upward and outward to prevent any loss of headroom. There are twin electric blinds for privacy. 1 2 Next Page »THE craze for panoramas swept America in the 1840s, inspiring both P. T. Barnum and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</text></article>

In the summer of 2008, nearly a year before G.M. filed for bankruptcy, its executives were growing desperate. Rick Wagoner, its chief executive, secretly proposed a merger with Ford, while Bill Ford courted the future president, Barack Obama, in an attempt to safeguard his company. This article is adapted from “Once Upon a Car: The Fall and Resurrection of America’s Big Three Automakers — G.M., Ford and Chrysler” by Bill Vlasic, the Detroit bureau chief of The New York Times. The book, to be published Tuesday by William Morrow, reveals new details of the chaos at the Big Three. Conversations recounted in the book were based on more than 100 interviews.DETROIT “HI, Bill, it’s Rick Wagoner. You know, I think it’s really time we put our companies together.” Bill Ford wasn’t sure he’d heard right. Mr. Wagoner, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, wanted to talk about a merger between Ford and G.M.? He did. Mr. Wagoner and his operating chief, Fritz Henderson, would come by to talk. Mr. Ford was stunned. He knew G.M. was desperate. But even now, in July 2008, he had no idea it was this desperate. And he couldn’t snub Rick Wagoner. Sure, Mr. Ford said. Come on over, and bring Fritz. The idea had been the subject of theoretical debate for years. What if G.M. and Ford joined forces? Even in their shrunken state, they would have a combined 38 percent share of the United States market, and a huge international presence. All that purchasing power, manufacturing muscle and technical skill under one roof. Thousands of overlapping jobs could be eliminated. Painful as that might be, it could save billions. Chrysler? Forget it. Instead of a Big Three, there would be a Big One. But could it even be done? G.M. and Ford had competed head-on for decades. This was not just a rivalry. This was opposite sides of town, you-stay-on-yours-and-I’ll-stay-on-mine. So, as a practical matter, a merger had never been seriously considered — until now. Bill Ford didn’t like the sound of it. G.M. must be in serious trouble if its executives were coming to Ford for help or answers. The idea of a merger nauseated him. The U.A.W. would go nuts. Mr. Ford spoke with his C.E.O., Alan R. Mulally, and they agreed that they had to talk to G.M., if only to find out what was going on. Mr. Wagoner’s approach was out of character. Maybe G.M. was in even worse shape than it was letting on. The meeting that followed would profoundly affect the course of both automakers. Mr. Wagoner and Mr. Henderson arrived with Ray Young, G.M.’s chief financial officer. Don Leclair, Ford’s C.F.O., joined, too. Mr. Wagoner began. G.M. and Ford should merge, he said. The synergies would be phenomenal. Savings would be huge. The possibilities were endless. Bill Ford was shocked. G.M. was serious. Who, he asked, would run this new company? As bad as Ford’s stock price was, Ford still had a higher market value than G.M. Mr. Wagoner noted that G.M. was bigger in terms of sales. So, by all rights, it should probably be in charge. But maybe they could share management, or discuss it later, he suggested. Mr. Mulally mostly listened. He wanted to know more about G.M.’s true state. He surely didn’t want any part of any merger. As far as he was concerned, G.M. was a roaring five-alarm fire. Why, he asked, was it coming to Ford now? Mr. Wagoner and Mr. Henderson explained that G.M. was running low on cash and was having trouble borrowing money. By merging with Ford, it could go back to Wall Street. So that’s what this is about. G.M. is going broke, Bill Ford realized. Ford had $30 billion in the bank, and that’s what G.M. really wanted. It wasn’t about Ford at all. It was about saving G.M. Mr. Ford didn’t need to hear any more. “No thanks,” he said. “This would never work out. “ Mr. Henderson jumped in, reiterating how good a marriage could be. “Don and I did a lot of work on this earlier,” he said. “I know G.M. inside and out, and Don knows Ford inside and out. Between the two of us we could figure it out pretty quickly.” Mr. Leclair kept his mouth shut. Mr. Ford was doing the talking. “No,” Mr. Ford said. “No, thanks.” Mr. Wagoner understood. This wasn’t happening. “Well if you don’t do it with us,” he said, “we’re going to look elsewhere.” With that, the G.M. execs left. At first, Mr. Ford was angry. G.M. could be so arrogant. But the overture was disturbing. If G.M. went bankrupt, a big part of the automotive supply chain could collapse. That would hurt the entire industry, including Ford. Bill Ford respected G.M.’s power and mass as no one else at Ford could. After all, he is a great-grandson of Henry Ford. “I grew up in this town, and G.M. was the giant,” he later recalled. “That was just the reality of life for me from childhood.” 1 2 3 4 Next Page »If General Motors were any other company, it would probably be dead by now.

Wendy Kaplan, the show’s curator and head of LACMA’s decorative arts and design department, and Bobbye Tigerman, her co-curator, included the car because it echoed a spirit in design and lifestyle also seen in the furniture, lighting, product and fashion items in the show, she said in a telephone interview. “There was a ‘just get it done’ attitude that we see in furniture and products” of that era, she said, adding that the Avanti embodied an entrepreneurial, start-up quality that would also distinguish the aviation and electronic industries in California. The genesis story of the Avanti borders on legend. Like the United States, Studebaker in 1961 was led by a bold young chief executive, Sherwood Egbert. He took over a company in crisis that had been squeezed out by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Egbert went to Raymond Loewy, the industrial designer best known for his approach to streamlining, to create a savior. Loewy traded on his French origins to impress American business leaders throughout his career, including those at Studebaker, for which he worked, with breaks, since the ’30s. He was also among the last independent professional industrial designers to have a large contract with an auto manufacturer. (Studebaker had hired Brooks Stevens to shape the Lark and Hawk lines before commissioning Loewy.) Loewy hired young designers from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Ms. Kaplan said, and installed them in a rented bungalow in Palm Springs where they executed the entire design in two weeks. The key names are John Ebstein, Bob Andrews and Tom Kellogg, but Avanti fans debate who should receive the lion’s share of credit for the design. That was an approach very different from that in South Bend, Ind., home of the Studebaker Corporation. “Loewy insisted that he be allowed to work without interference from executives in South Bend,” said Ms. Kaplan. Studebaker supported the new car with television ads that drew thousands into the showrooms. It was priced comparably to the Chevrolet Corvette. But it had been rushed to production and problems marred and delayed its premiere. Its body had been built of fiberglass, the miracle material of swimming pools, surfboards and indeed, Corvettes, to save time. But the only miracle, it turned out, was when bodies actually arrived on time. The Avanti faded, and Studebaker went dark. When not in New York or the South of France, Loewy lived in Palm Springs, Fla. He was photographed beside the famous indoor-outdoor swimming pool of his home, designed by Albert Frey. The curators quote the author Wallace Stegner, who declared in 1959 that “California is America, only more so.” That mythos ultimately compelled automakers to build satellite design studios and test centers in the state, where some of the industry’s most innovative thinking still occurs. “California Design” is part of a wider program, called Pacific Standard Time, involving some 60 institutions across the state and sponsored by the Getty Museum. The program is intended to celebrate the emergence of California as a major art market and creative hub in midcentury America. The show is installed through March 25, 2012.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/business/ford-contract-talks-intensify-as-union-prepares-for-strike.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Ford Contract Talks Intensify as Union Prepares for Strike<date>Published: September 26, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — Contract talks between the United Automobile Workers and the Ford Motor Company intensified Monday, but the union was preparing for a strike in case a deal could not be reached.People briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private, said that the parties were only beginning to discuss some of the most important issues and that top-level Ford executives had not joined the talks, indicating that no deal was imminent. The U.A.W. told officials at Ford plants across the country over the weekend to begin forming strike committees and to distribute information to workers about a possible strike. “At this time, there is no indication that a strike will be necessary, but it is in our best interest to prepare ourselves in the event we are forced to call for a strike,” the latest memorandum to workers said. The memo is regarded as a formality but does allow the union leverage to walk out of talks. After taking Sunday off, union negotiators began “high-level financial discussions” with Ford on Monday, according to a memo they posted online. A subsequent memo said the parties had agreed to meet for “very long negotiating sessions” this week and that bargaining would continue around the clock when a deal was near. Ford is the only one of the three Detroit carmakers whose workers are allowed to strike in this year’s talks. Binding arbitration is the only option at G.M. and Chrysler in the event of an impasse, under the terms of their government-sponsored bankruptcies in 2009. Analysts say they expect Ford’s contract to generally follow the pattern set by the tentative agreement with 48,500 workers at G.M., reached Sept. 16. Voting on the G.M. deal is set to finish Wednesday. Workers at large plants in Flint, Mich.; Arlington, Tex.; Parma, Ohio; and Spring Hill, Tenn., have voted for the deal, which would create or retain 6,400 jobs and move some work to the United States from Mexico. The Spring Hill plant, which was mostly idled in 2009, would reopen if the contract were ratified. “For the most part, they feel like it was a good agreement,” said Michael Cartwright, the president of Local 276, which represents 2,400 workers building sport utility vehicles in Arlington. “They understand the state of the business — that things are better but not we’re totally out of the woods because of the economy.” Workers would be guaranteed bonuses of at least $8,000 over the four years of the contract, plus larger profit-sharing checks. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, estimated in a report Monday that workers would collect a total of $40,500 in bonuses throughout the contract, based on his forecasts for G.M. profits. The deal is receiving widespread approval from entry-level workers, who earn about half as much as longtime workers and would get raises of several dollars an hour if the contract passes. At a parts processing plant near Flint where all 450 hourly workers earn entry-level wages, 88 percent voted in favor, according to a posting by Local 651 officials on Facebook. But the deal was rejected over the weekend at a plant near Lansing, Mich., where about 3,400 workers build crossover vehicles and few receive entry-level wages. Local 602 said on its Web site that only 34 percent of production workers and 43 percent of skilled trades workers voted yes. Ratification of the deal would resolve some of the uncertainty that has helped drive down the value of G.M. stock. Shares fell below $20 for the first time on Friday and closed Monday at $21.08, well below the $33 public-offering price last November. By buying out highly paid skilled trades workers and replacing them with entry-level employees, G.M. can make up for the larger bonuses, Mr. Jonas, the Morgan Stanley analyst, said. “The contract not only offers greater flexibility, it offers the potential of greater profitability for G.M.,” he wrote. Although the union is primarily focused on reaching a deal with Ford, negotiators have continued to meet with Chrysler. Bob King, the U.A.W. president, met with Chrysler’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, on Friday, they said in a jointly released statement. The union and Chrysler agreed to extend their contract, which was set to expire Sept. 14, through Oct. 19.DETROIT — Contract talks between the United Automobile Workers and the Ford Motor Company intensified Monday, but the union was preparing for a strike in case a deal could not be reached.</text></article>

A Mississippi company will pay a $715,000 fine to the Consumer Product Safety Commission to settle the agency’s allegations that the company hid an unintended acceleration defect with its electric off-road buggies. However, in agreeing to pay, Bad Boy Enterprises, of Natchez, did not admit any wrongdoing. It is the second-largest fine the agency has levied against a maker of off-road vehicles,  Scott Wolfson, a commission spokesman, wrote in an e-mail. The largest fine was $950,000 against Polaris Industries in 2005 for failing to promptly notify the agency of safety defects with its all-terrain vehicles. In a news release Friday, the commission said its investigators learned that Bad Boy Enterprises knew in 2008 that it had a problem with unintended acceleration and undertook a repair program. But not until October 2009 did the company inform the agency and conduct a recall of about 3,500 vehicles. In December 2010, the company conducted a second recall of 9,300 vehicles, admitting that the earlier recall had not solved the problem. At the time of the December recall, the commission said it had received 59 complaints of unintended acceleration, including some that resulted in injuries including broken bones. The agency said that the law required “manufacturers, distributors and retailers to report to the commission within 24 hours” after a potentially hazardous defect was discovered. In other recent actions: • BMW is recalling about 190 of its 2011 all-wheel-drive 3 Series models because they may revert to the brand’s rear-wheel-drive heritage. According to a report filed by the automaker with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the front driveshaft attachment bolts on the 328i xDrive and 335i xDrive, which secure the front driveshaft to the all-wheel-drive transfer case, may not have been properly tightened. If not fixed, the problem would lead to a loss of front-wheel drive and a breakdown that could increase the chance of a crash. In a letter dated Sept. 15 that was posted this week to the agency’s Web site, BMW said it learned of the problem in July when workers at an assembly plant noticed an unusual noise coming from several vehicles. The automaker said it didn’t realize until earlier this month that any vehicles with the problem had left the assembly plant. It then concluded that a recall was necessary. BMW’s letter said the company was not aware of any accidents related to the problem. BMW described the recall as voluntary, but once a manufacturer is aware of a safety problem it must inform the safety agency of its plan for a recall or face a fine. • The safety agency is investigating reports of tire jacks collapsing on the 2004-5 Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey minivans. The investigation comes after the agency received a report of one death and three injuries. It covers about 206,000 vehicles. • The agency upgraded its investigation into rusting rear lower control arms on the 2004–5 Jeep Liberty, covering about 200,000 vehicles. The agency began investigating earlier this year and concluded that it had ground for concern, so it intensified the investigation by starting an engineering analysis. • About 1,800 school buses are being recalled because a Cummins diesel engine could cause a fire. They are 2011–12 Thomas Built Bus Saf-T-Liner C2s, MVP-EFs and HDX models. Cummins is recalling about 12,000 engines used on a variety of vehicles because a clamp failure could allow hot exhaust gases to vent before reaching the tailpipe. Cummins told the agency that it was not aware of any fires caused by the defect.</text></article>

Shelves Chrysler Talks and Turns to Ford<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — The United Automobile Workers union said late Wednesday that its next target for reaching a new labor agreement would be the Ford Motor Company, signaling that it was having difficulty coming to terms with Chrysler.After the U.A.W. announced a tentative contract with General Motors last week, it was widely expected to focus on Chrysler next with the goal of striking a more lucrative deal with Ford by leaving that company last. Instead, the union announced a four-week extension of the old contract with Chrysler — hours before an earlier extension was set to expire — and then said it was turning its attention to Ford. “I have just concluded a meeting with President Bob King, and I am proud to announce that we have been chosen as the next department to begin the final stages of negotiations, and not Chrysler as previously speculated,” Jimmy Settles, the U.A.W. vice president in charge of negotiations with Ford, wrote in a message to workers that the union posted on Facebook. Mr. Settles wrote that he is eager “to begin intense discussions with the company and work towards a tentative agreement.” The delay in reaching a deal with Chrysler follows a critical letter that Chrysler’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, sent last week to Mr. King. Mr. Marchionne chided Mr. King for failing to show up to finalize a settlement — Mr. King had chosen to remain in talks with G.M. rather than divide his time between the two companies — and said the two had “failed” workers by not finishing talks before the previous contract was set to expire. Mr. Marchionne then traveled out of the United States on business but returned to Michigan earlier this week and had been expected to meet with Mr. King. He told reporters in Italy on Monday that he expected a quick resolution to the negotiations and was eager to “get this issue behind us.” The latest extension with Chrysler expires Oct. 19. “When one model stalls, you jump in another one that you think will be moving,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California at Berkeley. “It doesn’t mean that Chrysler is deadlocked; it simply means that there were some unexpected obstacles and the union thought Ford would be more productive.” Meanwhile, G.M. workers are beginning to vote on their tentative agreement, which includes bonuses totaling $9,000 over four years, larger profit-sharing checks, raises for entry-level workers and new jobs for work that otherwise would have been performed in Mexico.DETROIT — The United Automobile Workers union said late Wednesday that its next target for reaching a new labor agreement would be the Ford Motor Company, signaling that it was having difficulty coming to terms with Chrysler.</text></article>

DEVORE, Calif. — On an arid, brushy strip of Route 66 near San Bernardino, Calif., about two dozen old Fords gathered Sunday for a hill climb to commemorate the inexpensive 4-cylinder technology that helped set America’s wheels turning faster. The celebration’s fireworks were produced by cylinder heads and exhaust manifolds developed by the country’s nascent speed parts industry before World War II. These were complemented by the occasional smoking tire. The hill climb course, which included a 1/10-mile timed section, lies just alongside Interstate 15. Normally it’s used as a storage area by Caltrans, the California highway department. Permission to drive it was granted by San Bernardino County, which is anxious to promote its Route 66 heritage. The climb itself was sanctioned by Ford “A” Speed Technology,  an international group of about 1,100 members that formed in the mid-’90s. The group promotes hill climbs in six regions in the United States. There are also members in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. According to the group’s rule sheet, the hill climbs hew to the style of those that were popular in the early days of the automobile, and they’re intended exclusively for “cars that were or could have been built prior to World War II.” Competitive classes for these four-bangers, as they’re commonly known, included categories for stock and modified cars and trucks, as well as for stripped-down speedsters. Vintage racing cars were also allowed. Ronald AhrensTire smoke from a Model T pickup. Many participants belonged to the 25-member 4Ever4 club, which formed in 1954 in the Los Angeles area as a response to the street rods and dry-lake racers that had adopted V-8 engines. Jim Brierley, a director of the group and member of 4Ever4 since 1959, said here that the Ford V-8, introduced in 1932, didn’t initially provide more speed than the enhanced incumbent 4-cylinder engines. “In the stock configuration at the dry lakes, the V-8s didn’t start to dominate until they got to be pretty good-sized,” he said, referring to the 95-horsepower flathead V-8 that had its debut with the Mercury brand in 1939. Through aftermarket cylinder heads, multiple carburetors and other improvements, the 200-cubic-inch 4-cylinder engine, which produced 50 horsepower in its 1934 stock form — the final year of its production — could be teased for more power. The hill climb cars here typically made from 75 to 125 horsepower, Mr. Brierley, 74, said. But, Mr. Brierley, a retired truck mechanic from Temecula, who grinds out the high-performance camshafts for many club members’ engines, emphasizes that with the long-stroke combustion cycle, torque is produced in greater measure than horsepower. This became apparent in several runs by Olive Moore, 65, a retired accountant. She conducted her throaty 1927 Model T roadster on five timed attempts in the morning, achieving a best of 8.4 seconds, at a speed of 64.3 miles per hour. “I kept it in first long enough so that second didn’t give out before I hit the timing light,” said Ms. Moore, who lives in nearby Upland. Her purple car, built in 1999 by her husband Art, featured twin Stromberg 97 two-barrel carburetors and a 5-speed manual transmission from a Chevrolet S-10 pickup. The club allows modified cars to incorporate contemporary transmissions. With her final morning run, she was only a couple of ticks off the day’s best, posted by one of the historic racers. Dan Eubanks, the hill climb director, said later in a telephone interview that the fastest time was “in the low eights and 65 miles per hour.” Aside from clever modifications, long-term ownership was another theme of the event. One 81-year-old driver had owned his 1925 Model T dirt-track car for 62 years. And Mr. Brierley still has the 1931 Model A pickup he bought for $150 in 1958. Reflecting on the advanced age of many hill climb participants and the lack of newcomers to the old Ford hobby, he said, “One of my biggest fears is that my pickup will be worth $150 when I die.”</text></article>

But they all agree on one point: cars are going to have to become lighter. A lot lighter. The show, which is open to the public through Sept. 25 at the Messe Frankfurt convention center here, offers millions of square feet of new design studies and production vehicles, all bristling with the latest technologies. During two days of press previews last week, it seemed that at every automaker’s display, company representatives were eager to explain their efforts to make every component, down to the smallest screw or rivet, as light as it could possibly be and still do its job. Jaguar Land Rover even has a new executive position — head of lightweight vehicle strategy — to identify areas where shaving pounds is necessary and possible. The executive, Mark White, said the company found 15 pounds of savings in the way it made vehicles’ hoods. Aluminum has replaced steel in roof panels, saving another 15 pounds. Other lightweight materials like magnesium, better plastics and carbon fiber are being used in a wider range of applications. “Land Rover remains committed to a goal of reducing curb weights of its S.U.V.’s by as much as 500 kilos over the next 10 years,” said John Edwards, the global brand director. That goal — a reduction of more than half a ton — was evident in two lean new concept vehicles, the DC100 and DC100 Sport, that Mr. Edwards introduced here. Jaguar, which rolled out a design study for a sports car called the C-X16, has over the last decade been an industry pioneer in developing aluminum chassis for its luxury sedans and sports cars. While the weight of most new vehicles has gone up in recent years because of added safety equipment, more electronic gadgets and “must have” options, the company’s cars have become significantly lighter, said Ian Callum, the company’s design chief. As a result, Jaguars are realizing improvements in vehicle dynamics and fuel economy. Until it developed aluminum space frames for its large sedans, Audi was among the manufacturers guilty of creeping weight gains in each successive generation of models. Its latest A8 flagship sedan, which has an aluminum space frame, is larger but no heavier than the car it replaces. The 2012 A6 sedan uses a partial aluminum chassis that Audi says helps to “reverse the spiral” of weight gain, shedding a total of 175 pounds compared with the vehicle it replaced. In the introductions of several new models here, including “S” performance versions of all its larger sedans, company executives highlighted how many pounds had been engineered out of each. Exotic sports cars, already among the most weight-conscious vehicles on the road, are also getting lighter. Lamborghini said it would produce its Sesto Elemento, a lightweight hypercar introduced at the 2010 Paris auto show as a technology demonstrator. Porsche said it employed a new “intelligent light building” technique on the redesigned 911 that made its debut here; that car is 100 pounds lighter than the model it replaces, despite having grown slightly. Volvo said it was even using different speakers in its audio systems in an effort to squeeze out a few extra pounds. Component manufacturers have also been put on notice not to deliver porky products. ZF says its new 9-speed automatic transmission, unveiled at the show, is lighter than its 8-speed unit even though it carries an extra ratio and other components. Continental Group said it was designing new brake systems that incorporate the parking brake function, eliminating the need for — and weight of — a separate pedal. Toyota said it was under executive order to reduce the weight and space needed for its Hybrid Synergy Drive system by 35 percent for each new generation of the technology. 1 2 Next Page »FRANKFURT</text></article>

By midday Thursday, an enduring symbol of the city — the Ford Crown Victoria, a four-door sedan that has been a staple of taxi fleets since before Bill Clinton was president — went the way of the 1960 Ford taxi that bounced up Fifth Avenue as “Moon River” started to play in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” And the 1959, 1958 and 1957 Plymouth taxis in the final scene. The last Crown Victoria rolled off the assembly line at 12:30 p.m. It will not join the hundreds of Crown Victorias — “Crown Vics,” to car buffs — that rumble through the city, their meters adding 40 cents to the fare every 1,056 feet. (Assuming, of course, there are passengers inside and the conditions spelled out in the fine print from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, like going over six miles an hour, have been met.) A Ford spokesman said the last Crown Victoria would be exported, probably to Mexico or Saudi Arabia. The city prepared for the Crown Victoria’s demise with its Taxi of Tomorrow contest and chose a Nissan van as the city’s next taxicab. It will have touches the somewhat frumpy Crown Victoria never did, like airplane-style reading lights and a so-called low-annoyance horn system. It has become the taxi that champion taxi hailers hope will take them where they want to go. It does not require them to step up the way the minivans and sport utility vehicles in the taxi fleet do. It has more leg room than other sedans now on the streets, or so they say. The Crown Victoria was a big rear-wheel drive sedan that shared its platform with another almost-bygone staple of city streets, the Lincoln Town Car, a favorite of limousine companies. Crown Victorias were also widely used by police departments across the country. But by the time Ford announced it was discontinuing the Crown Victoria and the Lincoln Town Car, they had become relics from “a bygone era of Detroit boulevardiers, with their front bench seats, soft suspensions and awkward, space-robbing proportions,” Andrew Ganz, senior editor of the Web site leftlanenews.com, wrote last year. His eulogy for that platform, known as the Panther, noted that it dated to the 1970s. “Once upon a time, the Panther platform underpinned coupes, station wagons and sedans marketed by all three of Ford’s divisions,” Mr. Ganz wrote. “Remember the Lincoln Continental Town Car Coupe? How about the Mercury Colony Park wagon? One by one, Panthers dropped off the chart.” And then Mercury dropped off the chart. Ford discontinued the brand. The last Mercury Marquis, another Panther-platform relative of the Crown Victoria, came off the production line in January at same plant that will make the last Crown Victoria on Thursday. The 44-year-old plant, in Ontario, made Ford Mavericks and Pintos in its early days. It will be the 27th plant Ford has closed since the recession began. “Anybody who started working here would be told, ‘Hey, kid, don’t get used to this, because it’s going to close one day,’ ” Dennis McGee, the president of Local 1520 of the Canadian Auto Workers, told The Toronto Star last week. Ford has made Crown Victorias for 19 consecutive years, as long as it made Model T’s — an unusually long run, said Bob Casey, an automotive historian who is the curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. (Ford used the name Crown Victoria on a two-door coupe in the mid-1950s, and in 1979 and 1980 and again from 1983 to 1991, it made a sedan called the LTD Crown Victoria.) “The Crown Victoria is certainly in its construction a very traditional vehicle,” said Mr. Casey of the Henry Ford Museum. “One of the defining characteristics of Crown Victorias was they were all body-on-frames, as opposed to the unibodies they were using on the Taurses and the Five Hundred and the revived Taurus.” With unibody construction, he said, “once the cars were completed, you couldn’t unbolt the body and take it off, as you could on a Crown Vic.” Joshua Bright for The New York TimesThe Ford Crown Victoria taxi, ubiquitous on New York City streets, is headed toward extinction.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/business/uaw-and-auto-makers-near-midnight-deadline-in-contract-talks.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">United Automobile Workers Agrees to Extend Contract Talks with General Motors and Chrysler<date>Published: September 14, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — The United Automobile Workers agreed early on Thursday to extend contracts with General Motors and Chrysler after the parties were unable to reach new deals by the time the old pacts expired at midnight.The extensions came shortly after the chief executive of Chrysler, Sergio Marchionne, sent a letter to the U.A.W.'s president, Bob King, late Wednesday lamenting that the talks had broken down because Mr. King did not show up at the bargaining table as expected. Talks continued past midnight at G.M. until that company and the U.A.W. agreed to extend their contract as well, a G.M. spokeswoman said. Negotiations with G.M. were scheduled to resume at 10 a.m. Thursday. Mr. Marchionne sent the letter to Mr. King after the union leader spent the day huddled in contract talks with General Motors rather than Chrysler. A copy of the letter was obtained from sources close to the negotiations. “I flew back from the Frankfurt Motor Show late last night to be here today to finalize our dialogue that has been started by our teams but that required your presence and mine to conclude,” Mr. Marchionne wrote. “You unfortunately could not be here, I am told, due to competing engagements.” Mr. Marchionne went on to say that he and Mr. King “failed” employees by not concluding the months-long negotiations before the current contract expired. “I am willing to extend the contract by an additional week to allow closure on all outstanding matters,” Mr. Marchionne wrote. Workers for both companies had been anxiously awaiting word of a settlement, and even U.A.W. officials at several plants said they were being kept in the dark about the pace and nature of the discussions. “We are confident that we can reach an agreement that will meet many of the goals we set at the beginning of negotiations,” Joe Ashton, a U.A.W. vice president in charge of negotiations with G.M., wrote in a message to workers that was posted online Wednesday. Any agreements must be approved by the U.A.W.’s local leaders and then ratified by the rank-and-file membership. Labor experts expect the companies to offer workers signing bonuses of at least $5,000 to improve the chances of ratification without permanently increasing labor costs. Workers at all three companies received a $3,000 signing bonus in 2007. Their wages have not increased since 2003. Talks with the Ford Motor Company are not as far along as the negotiations with G.M. and Chrysler. On Tuesday, Ford and the union agreed to extend their contract indefinitely, at least temporarily putting off the possibility that a strike could be called. The union can end the extension with three days’ notice, and it might do so when a deal is close to pressure the company to settle. Talks with all three companies lacked much of the acrimony that has defined past rounds of bargaining in the auto industry. Union leaders have vowed to help keep the carmakers competitive while also seeking ways for workers to be rewarded as the auto industry turns around. Workers at G.M. and Chrysler are barred from striking over wage and benefit disputes through 2015, a provision they were required to approve when the companies received federal loans as they went through bankruptcy protection in 2009. Their only recourse in the case of an impasse is binding arbitration, a somewhat unpredictable process that both sides have said they want to avoid. A major theme for the union during these talks has been regaining much of what workers gave up to keep their employers from collapsing under the weight of heavy debt and plummeting sales. But the union also wants to add jobs in the United States after suffering years of wrenching cutbacks at the three carmakers. Mr. King, the U.A.W. president, has said U.A.W. members each ceded $7,000 to $30,000 worth of pay and benefits since 2005. In 2007, the union agreed to create a two-tier wage system that allowed the carmakers to cut costs by hiring new workers at about half the pay of other workers. Many in the U.A.W. oppose the two-tier system, but Mr. King has said it is a way for the companies to become more competitive without cutting pay for existing workers and helps create jobs. Only about 4,000 of the 112,000 workers at G.M., Ford and Chrysler earn second-tier wages currently, but the companies hope to hire more people at the lower pay scale as older workers retire, further reducing their labor costs.DETROIT — The United Automobile Workers agreed early on Thursday to extend contracts with General Motors and Chrysler after the parties were unable to reach new deals by the time the old pacts expired at midnight.</text></article>

Pact<date>Published: September 13, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — General Motors is aiming to set the framework of a new labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union that would increase entry-level wages and establish a new profit-sharing formula for workers at all three Detroit car companies.Both G.M. and Chrysler have been holding around-the-clock talks with the union for several days, hoping to reach a new deal before their current four-year contracts expire at the end of the night on Wednesday. The third Detroit automaker, the Ford Motor Company, agreed with the U.A.W. on Tuesday to extend its contract until settlements were reached at the other two companies. With its stock price lagging 33 percent below its initial public offering price of a year ago, G.M. needs a deal that bolsters confidence in its comeback from its government bailout and bankruptcy. And with the strongest balance sheet of the Big Three, G.M. is in position to sweeten worker bonuses and raise the pay of second-tier workers in exchange for flexibility in its plants and profit-sharing tied to quality and productivity. “With a vastly improved balance sheet, G.M. has a distinct advantage in negotiation its U.A.W. contract,” said Mike Jackson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Automotive. “It is working hard to set terms that are more favorable to its own cause.” Historically, the union reaches an agreement with one automaker first and expects the other two to follow the framework for wages, benefits and work rules. Recently, G.M. has stepped up its efforts to devise a competitive cost structure that both the companies and the union can live with for the next four years. Underscoring G.M.’s aggressive approach has been the presence of its chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, at the bargaining table. In years past, it was rare for any Detroit chief executive to be directly involved in the talks until the end of the process. The U.A.W. agreed not to strike G.M. or Chrysler as conditions of the Obama administration’s bailouts of the companies. But G.M. is still 26 percent owned by the American taxpayers, and its executives are eager to avoid a prolonged arbitration process if a deal cannot be reached. “A failure to reach a settlement would be looked at as almost a repudiation of the government funding,” said Gary N. Chaison, professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. Among the top issues to be reconciled is how much workers should gain now that the companies have greatly improved their finances. G.M. earned $5.7 billion in the first half of 2011, and Ford’s profit for the same period was nearly $5 billion. G.M. also has a cash stockpile of more than $30 billion, which it has been using to pay down debt and create what it calls a “fortress balance sheet.” A deal that investors see as favorable for G.M. could help reverse the slide in the company’s stock price. Shares of G.M. closed at $22 on Tuesday, one-third lower than the price for its initial public offering last November. Instead of increasing wages — which have been frozen since 2003 — analysts expect the carmakers to offer workers large bonuses that they would receive as lump sums after the contract is ratified. That avoids permanently increasing the companies’ annual labor costs, and the signing bonuses most likely would amount to considerably less than four consecutive years of small raises. The bonuses will probably be $5,000 to $7,500 at G.M. and Chrysler, and slightly more at Ford, predicted Arthur Schwartz, a former G.M. negotiator who is now president of the consulting firm Labor and Economic Associates in Ann Arbor, Mich. Ford would pay more because it is healthier and thousands of its workers have filed a grievance against the company over executive bonuses. A hearing on that matter is scheduled for Thursday. “Their pay rates are already competitive, so why they’re entitled to a pay increase by definition is certainly debatable,” Mr. Schwartz said. “A nice-size signing bonus would go a long way.” A U.A.W. spokeswoman, Michele Martin, said reports that the union had asked for bonuses of as much as $10,000 were “inaccurate” and creating “false expectations” among workers. The bonuses are meant to increase the chances of ratification by rank-and-file members, but a large amount would undoubtedly draw criticism from opponents of G.M.’s government bailout and could even cause workers to think they are being taken. “Most workers could see a large signing bonus almost as a sign of a bribe,” Mr. Chaison said. “If it’s too large then they’ll get suspicious about what they’re being asked to accept.” The companies are expected to slightly increase pay for workers on the entry-level pay scale, which currently starts at $14 an hour, or half as much as most autoworkers earn. Workers said that they expected the new second-tier pay scale to top out at about $18 an hour. U.A.W. and company officials, however, have not confirmed an amount they are discussing. The union also is seeking to protect as many jobs as possible, and specifically wants to persuade G.M. to reopen closed plants in Tennessee and Wisconsin. But G.M. officials have said they will need to restart those plants only if market demand is sufficient, asserting that they do not need additional capacity yet.DETROIT — General Motors is aiming to set the framework of a new labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union that would increase entry-level wages and establish a new profit-sharing formula for workers at all three Detroit car companies.</text></article>

What can data do for your daily commute? A team of energy policy consultants and software developers met in San Francisco to brainstorm how data sets could be used to make the typical urban commute shorter and greener. They participated in a high-speed coding competition last weekend called the Cleanweb Hackathon. Similar to the collaborative programming sprints used by companies like Facebook and Google to increase workers’ creativity, the Cleanweb Hackathon gave participants 24 hours to build apps from scratch in teams. The stated goal of the event, organized by the venture capitalist Sunil Paul, was to “demonstrate the impact of applying information technology to resource constraints.” One such team devised a system that would reward commercial buildings with incentives like carbon credits, for example, when occupants bike, walk and bus to work instead of driving. The team’s demo application, called Commute Score, was one of 14 tools created as part of the event. According to Kimberly Goodrich, a Commute Score team member, her group wanted to find a way to “bring your commute into the energy equation.” A downtown commercial property may not have adequate room for solar panels, but if its occupants commute by public transit, it may be greener than a solar-powered office park where workers drive a hundred miles each day. Tracking a building’s energy use isn’t enough, they argued; it also matters how people get there. For Commute Score, the developers Bryan Galusha and Andrew Aarestad “created a way to track a commute on a smartphone and then identify the transit signature (walk, bike, bus, train or car) of the commuter,” Ms. Goodrich wrote in an e-mail. “From this data, we attributed carbon kudos to various modes of transit to generate a Commute Score,” she added. Judges for the event included Mr. Paul and the industrial designer Yves Behar, as well as executives from Cisco; Tendril, a smart-grid technology company; Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich and Rosati, a Silicon Valley law firm; and Catamount Ventures, a venture capital firm. On Sunday, the judges awarded Commute Score first prize in the category of Biggest Impact. Other entries dealing with transportation included Tarzan, which integrates traffic and emissions data with a trip planner and calendar, and GreenScore, which employs traffic, fuel consumption and pollution data to rate cities and states for their green performance. Hackathon organizers collected 11 different data sets related to transportation, ranging from real-time traffic documentation from Google to development platforms provided by local transit agencies. But Commute Score ultimately based its signatures on original data collected by Ms. Goodrich and her teammate Dan Suyeyasu, who walked, biked, bused and took trains around San Francisco on Saturday carrying phones with GPS chips. Another team is planning to introduce a version of its Get Tarzan app on Oct. 1. Built using Google Maps and Google Calendar, as well as the Bing search engine and the local weather forecasting Web site WeatherUnderground.com, the tool combines a calendar and route planner, simplifying travel time and costs considerations across multiple modes of transportation. Get TarzanGet Tarzan’s mobile interface. According to Ezra Goldman, a Get Tarzan team member, some of the key features of the concept include factoring in time for parking, I.R.S. tax-deduction rates and real-time data about traffic delays. The mobile version of the app also brings in weather forecasts to help users make decisions about walking or biking. “Future versions could help you to plan your days to do efficient trip ‘chaining’ and avoid unnecessary trips,” Mr. Goldman wrote in an e-mail. The team also says that the app could eventually incorporate taxis or “emerging modes of travel, like car sharing, ride sharing and bike sharing.” Collaborations between independent software developers and transportation companies are increasingly common. On Monday, Ford Motor Company suggested at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, that the car itself could become a platform for the kind of rapid-fire innovation inspired by the Cleanweb Hackathon. As noted by our colleagues at the Bits blog, the automaker has partnered with Bug Labs, an open-source hardware and software provider, to enable people to add electronic components to their cars. And to demonstrate what could be possible as Bug Labs’ so-called OpenXC platform makes its way into Ford’s vehicles, the companies showed off an in-car fuel monitor designed to let drivers compare their fuel consumption to other drivers.</text></article>

The newest workers earn about $14 an hour; longtime employees earn double that. With the economy slumping and job creation once again a pressing issue in the White House and Congress, the advent of a two-tier wage system in Detroit is spiking employment for one of the country’s most important manufacturing industries. The new jobs, which are seen as long term, are being watched closely by economists, executives in other industries and Washington policy makers eager to increase employment in manufacturing and other areas. For many, the opportunity for steady employment is welcome, even at a lower wage and with no certainty when it might increase. “Everybody is appreciative of a job and glad to be working,” said Derrick Chatman, who makes $14.65 an hour putting tires on Jeeps after being laid off at Home Depot, working odd construction jobs and collecting unemployment. What was once seen as a desperate move to prop up the struggling auto industry is now considered an integral part of its future. The demand for $14-an-hour manufacturing jobs is providing Detroit’s Big Three automakers with a ready pool of eager new employees. Last year, Chrysler was flooded with inquiries about the jobs here. It froze the list after receiving 10,000 applications. The companies say the two-tier wages are paying off. Despite the disparity, there is no appreciable difference in the Grand Cherokees produced on the shift dominated since last fall by the lower-paid workers, the plant manager says. At General Motors, savings from its two-tier workers are crucial to production that began last month of an inexpensive, subcompact car in suburban Detroit. Two-tier wage systems have been tried in the airline industry and others with spotty success. Usually the lower wages disappear rather quickly when the economy picks up. But the arrival of vastly different wage rates in auto factories is a seminal event in an industry long influenced by a powerful union devoted to equal pay regardless of seniority. “This is not going away,” said Kristin Dziczek, a labor analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. “It has allowed the Big Three to reduce labor costs without cutting the pay of incumbent workers. Is it good for the health and competitiveness of the companies? Yes. And is that good for job security? Yes.” Four years ago, the United Automobile Workers agreed to allow Chrysler, G.M. and Ford to pay lower wages to new hires to help close the cost gap with foreign carmakers. Now the two-tier arrangement is at the forefront of labor talks between the U.A.W. and the Detroit companies. The union’s president, Bob King, has made an increase in entry-level wages a top priority in negotiations for a new national contract to replace the current agreement, which expires Wednesday. So far, about 12 percent of Chrysler’s 23,000 union workers earn the lower wage, and over all, 4,000 or so of the 112,000 U.A.W. members are second-tier hires. Those numbers are expected to grow — and in fact can increase significantly even under the current contract. The jobs are central to the contract talks because they are viewed as critical to the industry’s continued recovery. Some benefits for the lower-tier workers are scaled back as well. They get the union’s traditional medical benefits, but a maximum of four weeks paid time off a year, versus five for the longtime workers. And instead of the guaranteed $3,100-a-month pension a full-paid worker receives after age 60, the new hires have to build their own “personal retirement plan” based on contributions from the company of less than $2,000 a year. The gap in wages between regular and entry-level workers has created dissent in U.A.W. ranks. Some long-term employees have demonstrated against the two-tier system and called for it to be abolished. Mr. King, however, has focused on getting meaningful pay raises for the lower tier rather than eliminating it. At the big Labor Day parade in Detroit, union activists chanted “equal pay for equal work,” and some full-paid workers said they were willing to forgo a wage increase in the new contract to help the lower-tier employees. 1 2 Next Page » Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.DETROIT — They are a cornerstone of Chrysler’s unlikely comeback: 900 employees turning out a Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle every 48 seconds of the working day at an assembly plant here.</text></article>

You’d have some overhead clearance problems with them in your garage.” Aside from that, Mr. Mays said that “significant elements” of the Evos design would be evident in a new production-intent vehicle to be unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show. “This is a design that has relevance in Ford’s worldwide markets,” he said. “It won’t be limited to any geographical region. Our philosophy is still ‘One Ford’ with this vehicle. The same cars will be available worldwide.” Exactly what car might be first to be imbued with Evos DNA is open to considerable conjecture, but the next model in Ford’s current lineup that is due for redesign might be its midsize sedan, which is sold as the Fusion in North America and the Mondeo in Europe. The Evos is similar in size to those vehicles. When asked about what size engine might fit in the rather short nose of the Evos, Mr. Mays said, “One of our 4- or 6-cylinder engines.” “There’s more room up front than it looks,” Mr. Mays said. “There’s a lot of space under the windshield. We pulled the windshield angle and the A pillar pretty far forward because the design team liked the look of certain old Ferraris with similar angles.” In his estimation, Mr. Mays said the signature feature of the Evos was its “laser-cut” headlamps, which he said would make the current generation of very large headlights soon obsolete. “It gives us better lighting, allows us to lower the nose for a more aerodynamic front, and allows to tie in more styling elements,” he said.

Stephen Odell, chairman and chief executive of Ford of Europe, said the engine would be available next year in certain Focus models sold in Europe. Mark Schirmer, a Ford spokesman, said in conversation that the engine would subsequently arrive in Asia and North America, though he did not offer a timeframe for its introduction in those markets. Mr. Odell said the engine, in turbocharged form, could produce about 118 horsepower and “significantly” improve fuel economy, although he did not supply specific fuel economy numbers. After Wheels published this post, Mark Schirmer, the Ford spokesman, noted that the 1-liter EcoBoost engine was also intended for the North American and Asian markets.

Get ready to start hacking your own car. Bug Labs, an open-source hardware and software company, has teamed with the Ford Motor Company to experiment with ways to let people add new electronic components to their cars. The New York-based Bug Labs makes a product called a Bug that lets people tack together a number of plastic modules, including GPS units and cameras, that can be used to create personalized electronic gadgets. Ford hopes to apply the same concept to its cars. The companies announced the new partnership Monday at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco. Bug Labs Bug Labs created software that allows drivers to see their fuel consumption compared with other cars in the area. Peter Semmelhack, founder of Bug Labs, said in a phone interview that the goal was to allow Ford owners to plug in new hardware — cameras, fuel monitors, GPS — without a need for programming skills or an engineering degree. “It’s going to be as simple to update your car as it is to use a Bug: just plug it in, download some software and you’re good to go,” Mr. Semmelhack said. Ford will adopt a technology called OpenXC for its cars that Bug Labs is using as a research platform. Mr. Semmelhack said OpenXC would allow developers to work on hardware and software for cars without having to learn a new platform. K. Venkatesh Prasad, a director in Ford’s Infotronics Research and Advanced Engineering labs, detailed some possible Bug-Ford scenarios. “We’ve been experimenting with a an in-car fuel monitor, so you can see how green your driving is,” he explained in a phone interview. “But we’ve also added connectivity to the Internet so you can see how your fuel consumption compares to other drivers.” Mr. Prasad said Ford could eventually offer plug-and-play hardware for older cars, where people could buy inexpensive hardware components and then download apps for their car.</text></article>

Brown/Associated PressThe 12 qualifiers for Nascar’s Chase for the Sprint Cup championship pose on Sunday, a day after Kevin Harvick’s win in Richmond, Va. On Saturday night at Richmond International Raceway, Kevin Harvick withstood a final-lap charge by Carl Edwards to win the last event of the Nascar Sprint Cup series’ regular season. The more consequential on-track action, however, unfolded well behind Harvick’s Chevrolet. Dale Earnhardt Jr., the most popular Sprint Cup driver of the last decade, had not qualified for the postseason chase since 2008 and starting 27th on the grid on Saturday, Earnhardt’s prospects were not good. Early and frequent contact with other competitors compromised the front-end aerodynamics of his car, but he managed to finish in 16th, earning sufficient points to take the 10th of 12 total slots for the chase, scheduled to begin on Sept. 18 at Chicagoland Speedway. Denny Hamlin, another question mark for the chase, secured one of two wild card spots with his Saturday performance, moving from 28th on the starting grid to place ninth. Brad Keselowski, with three Sprint Cup victories this year, is the second wild card entry. Meanwhile, Tony Stewart, who like Earnhardt has not won a race this season, placed seventh, securing his spot in the chase. The final standings entering the chase are: Kyle Busch (2,012 points, 4 wins), Kevin Harvick (2,012 points, 4 wins), Jeff Gordon (2,009 points, 3 wins), Matt Kenseth (2,006, 2 wins), Jimmie Johnson (2,003 points, 1 win), Carl Edwards (2,003 points, 1 win), Kurt Busch (2,003, 1 win), Ryan Newman (2,003 points, 1 win), Tony Stewart (2,000 points, 0 wins) Dale Earnhardt Jr. (2,000 points, 0 wins), Brad Keselowski (2,000 points, 3 wins) and Denny Hamlin (2,000 points, 1 win). In other motorsports news: • Sebastian Vettel contended with an aggressive challenge from Fernando Alonso, but Vettel, the 2010 Formula One champion, finished strongly to win the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Alonso established an early lead over the Red Bull driver, but Vettel overtook the Ferrari pilot on the fifth lap. Jenson Button, the McLaren-Mercedes driver, subsequently passed Alonso, securing second place. Vettel, who has won consecutive races, is expected to secure his second consecutive drivers’ championship at the Singapore Grand Prix on Sept. 25. • Ford teammates Mikko Hirvonen and Jari-Matti Latvala produced the top two finishes at the Rally Australia over the weekend, and Sebastien Loeb, the series leader, did not place on the podium after rolling his Citroën DS3. Hirvonen, in third place over all, is 36 points behind Loeb in the World Rally Championship and 11 points behind Sebastien Ogier, Loeb’s Citroën teammate. There are three races left in the season. • According to a report by the BBC, the Yamaha teammates Jorge Lorenzo and Ben Spies are scheduled to compete at the Japanese MotoGP on Oct. 2. Lorenzo, along with Casey Stoner and Valentino Rossi, earlier had vowed not to compete in the race, fearing exposure to radiation from the damaged nuclear reactor at Fukushima, about 100 miles from the Motegi circuit track. Yamaha, however, issued a statement Monday confirming the participation of its riders. Lorenzo, with 224 points, is second over all in 2011 behind Stoner, who has 259 points.</text></article>

A full-size 4-wheel drive pickup with a turbocharged V-6 engine. HOW MUCH? $38,615 as tested, including $1,750 EcoBoost V-6 engine, $1,595 XLT chrome package (with 18-inch wheels), $940 maximum trailer towing package and $950 XLT convenience package. WHAT’S UNDER THE HOOD? A twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 with direct injection, rated at 365 horsepower at 5,000 r.p.m. IS IT QUICK? Yes, considering its curb weight of more than 5,500 pounds. IS IT THIRSTY? Not when compared with an F-150 that has a V-8 of similar power. WITH this year’s addition of an EcoBoost V-6 engine option to its F-150 pickups, Ford took a long-proven strategy — the use of turbocharging to wring more power from a smaller engine — and applied it in a new way, aiming at the mass market for full-size, light-duty trucks. The EcoBoost concept — the boost coming from its intake air being blown into the cylinders by the turbos — is not unique to the F-150. It is the name Ford has given to a family of turbocharged gasoline engines, of varying sizes and cylinder counts, that are finding their way under the hoods of various models. In the case of the F-150, the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 translates to a truck that has more power, hauls more weight and has a higher towing capacity than the standard 3.7 liter V-6 (302 horsepower) — or even the optional 5-liter V-8 (360). Meanwhile, there is virtually no loss in fuel economy. But there is a cost in dollars. If you start with the base 3.7-liter V-6, the EcoBoost is $1,750 additional (or $750 more than buying the same vehicle the optional 5-liter V-8). But choosing the EcoBoost engine can be even more costly, because of “mandatory options” that must be purchased. Consider the base XL with a regular cab, two-wheel drive, the 3.7-liter nonturbo V-6 and an 8-foot bed. Ordering the EcoBoost adds $4,095 to the base price of $24,090. The EcoBoost is $1,750 of that, and the rest is other required equipment, like the heavy-duty payload and maximum trailer towing packages. But the EcoBoost engine brings a huge improvement over the base V-6 in its rated payload (weight of cargo and passengers) and towing capacity. The payload increases to 3,060 pounds, from 1,900; towing capacity goes to 11,300 pounds, from 5,600. Now consider the 4-wheel drive XLT SuperCab I tried. It had the EcoBoost. Then Ford added a different axle ratio and the maximum towing package for an additional $1,340. That increased the payload to 2,080 pounds, from 1,510, while the towing capacity increased to 11,300 pounds, from 5,500. And there’s barely a mileage penalty. The E.P.A. rates the SuperCab with 4-wheel drive and the base 3.7-liter V-6 at 16 m.p.g. in town and 21 highway. The EcoBoost V-6 version gets 15 city and 21 highway. When compared with the V-8 engine, the Ecoboost V-6 produces 5 more horsepower and 40 pound-feet more torque, both at lower r.p.m. — and edges the V-8’s mileage rating of 14/19. And unlike some turbocharged competitors, 87-octane fuel is recommended.  This may be disappointing news for those who hoped the EcoBoost V-6 would bring a huge increase in fuel economy when the F-150 was used as daily transportation. But Ford chose to bolster the F-150’s classic role as a work tool, not as a commuter. I averaged about 18.5 m.p.g. in 520 miles of commonsensical driving on two-lane roads through the White Mountains of New Hampshire, generally between 50 and 60 m.p.h. Thanks to a 6-speed automatic and all that available pulling power — the torque peaks at an accessible 2,500 r.p.m. — acceleration is strong at all speeds. Car and Driver magazine recorded a 0-60 time of 6.1 seconds for a SuperCab similar to the one I tested. The steering has reassuring weighting and predictability, and on smooth pavement the F-150 rides and handles well considering its size, height and great weight. On a rough surface the F-150 does a nice job of muting the sharpness of the initial impact but overall the ride is still precisely what one would expect: trucklike. Ford redesigned the F-150’s interior, making it a more carlike and comfortable place. The driver’s seat is great, comfy-soft yet supportive. Even the back seat of the SuperCab drew nice comments from an adult and a teenager who rode there for an hour or so. Ford would like us to see the EcoBoost as a major technological breakthrough. It is not. However, taking a turbocharged gasoline engine and putting it in a pickup is a clever move that should have wide appeal to those who want a more capable work truck without a big loss in fuel economy.TESTED 2011 Ford F-150 SuperCab WHAT IS IT?

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/automobiles/silencing-noises-at-their-source.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Silencing Noises at Their Source<date>Published: September 9, 2011</date><text>COOLING fans that could poke holes in the radiators of Dodge Chargers and Magnums, and cases of possible coil spring corrosion in Hyundai and Kia crossovers, are among the mechanical ailments covered in the latest technical service bulletins.The bulletins, compiled by alldatapro.com, offer automakers’ insights into some recurring problems with various models. The bulletins, known as T.S.B.’s, are not recalls; they are information provided by manufacturers to dealers’ service departments and mechanics. Unless otherwise noted, the carmakers do not offer payment assistance for these repairs beyond normal warranty coverage. Alldata.com sells a more comprehensive version of the bulletins to consumers. Here are a few recent examples: BMW Gear oil from the front differential may stain the driveways of owners of some BMW X3 crossovers. In T.S.B. 310111 issued on June 1, BMW said the leak from the differential vent may be caused by too much internal pressure. Replacing the vent line with a modified part should stop the dripping. CHRYSLER GROUP Some 2006-8 Chrysler 300s, Dodge Chargers and Dodge Magnums are eligible for new engine cooling fans. In T.S.B. L08 issued on June 17, Chrysler said the fans can separate from the housing and damage the radiator. Owners of affected vehicles should receive letters notifying them about this free repair. DODGE New right-side door latches may be in the offing for some 2010 Dodge Journey and 2010-11 Dodge Nitro models (and the similar 2010-11 Jeep Liberty as well). In T.S.B. L15 issued on June 30, Chrysler said the vehicles may develop a ratcheting sound when using the power door locks. The latches will be replaced free; owners should receive letters regarding the fix. FORD A high-speed vibration may be causing shakes in 2009-10 Ford Escapes and Mercury Mariners. In T.S.B. 11-5-25 issued on May 31, Ford said the vibration was from the rear driveshaft. Replacing its center bearing assembly should clear up the problem. GENERAL MOTORS Some 2008-9 Chevrolet TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy S.U.V.’s may be eligible for an extended warranty on exhaust manifolds. In T.S.B. 11150 issued on July 25, General Motors said a crack may develop in the manifolds of 4.2-liter V-6 engines, causing excessive exhaust noise. The warranty will now be 10 years or 120,0000 for the part, up from 3 years or 36,000 miles. Owners of affected vehicles should receive letters regarding this extended warranty. Also, some 2011 Buick LaCrosses may need a new battery. In T.S.B. 11186 issued on July 1, General Motors said the batteries on some vehicles may not provide enough voltage, which would prevent the LaCrosse from starting. Owners of affected vehicles should receive letters regarding this repair. HYUNDAI AND KIA Added coil spring protection may be needed on some 2011 Hyundai Santa Fe and Kia Sorento crossovers. Hyundai’s T.S.B. 11-01-021, issued on June 23, (and T.S.B. SC091 for Kia models, issued on the same date) said that the springs may collect rocks at the bottom where the spring mounts on the strut, damaging the anti-rust coating and leading to a squeaking noise. Installing a spring protection tube should do the trick. LEXUS Inconsistent brake pedal response may concern drivers of some 2008-9 Lexus LX570 S.U.V.’s. In T.S.B. L-SB-0035-11 issued on June 23, Lexus said the first brake pedal application after the vehicle had been sitting for an extended period may require a longer pedal stroke than normal. The problem is linked to a master cylinder reservoir cap with inadequate venting. Replacing the cap should restore the correct feel. SUBARU Some 2010-11 models may need a new timing belt and belt guide. In T.S.B. 02-120-11 issued on July 25, Subaru said some 2010-11 Impreza WRX and STI 2.5 Turbo MT models may chirp from the right side of the engine. Replacing the timing belt and belt guide should stop the noise. TOYOTA Noisy idler pulley bearings may grate on the owners of some 2006-8 RAV4 crossovers. In T.S.B. 0056-11 issued on June 20, Toyota said the pulley bearing assembly needs to be replaced with an updated version of the part.COOLING fans that could poke holes in the radiators of Dodge Chargers and Magnums, and cases of possible coil spring corrosion in Hyundai and Kia crossovers, are among the mechanical ailments covered in the latest technical service bulletins.</text></article>

In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • Volkswagen, citing legal hurdles, announced Thursday that its long-planned merger with Porsche would not be carried out by the end of 2011, as originally planned. Investors sued Porsche earlier this year for market manipulation and fraud, and Volkswagen said that the resulting legal tangle made it “impossible to quantify the economic risks of a merger.” Shares of Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG were down on Friday. (DealBook) • BMW reported its highest August sales in company history on Friday. Combined sales from BMW and its subsidiaries, Mini and Rolls-Royce, totaled 110,891 for the month, a 7.4 percent increase over the previous record for August, which was logged last year. Ian Robertson, the head of sales and marketing for BMW Group, attributed the growth to redesigned models like the 5 Series sedan and X3 compact S.U.V. Mini sales, meanwhile, are up nearly 25 percent in the first eight months of 2011 compared with the same period last year. (BMW) • The redesigned Volkswagen Passat was named a top safety pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety this week. The nonprofit, which is funded by the insurance industry, awarded the Passat its highest rating, good, for front-, rear- and side-impact protection, as well as for roof strength in a rollover. Eight of the automaker’s current models have been named top safety picks this year. (Volkswagen) • IF Metal North Alvsborg, a labor union representing 1,500 Saab employees, has vowed to not file a bankruptcy petition against Saab Automobile AB. On Thursday, the Swedish automaker’s application for court protection from its creditors was rejected; Saab appealed the decision later that evening. A spokesman for IF Metall indicated that Saab would have enough liquidity to pay salaries. (The Wall Street Journal) • Dr. Dieter Zetsche, the Daimler chairman and head of Mercedes-Benz, is expected to deliver the keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next year. Dr. Zetsche would follow Alan R. Mulally, the Ford chief executive, who gave the keynote in January and used the opportunity to unveil the Focus Electric hatchback.

About 6,100 off-road motorcycles are being recalled by KTM North America because their handlebars may slide out of their normally fixed positions and cause a crash, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The agency said a clamp that stabilizes the handlebar can crack, allowing the unit to move. KTM said it had received one report of a rider being hospitalized after a crash resulting from the flaw. The recall covers all 2011 KTM and Husaberg off-road competition motorcycles. Because the motorcycles are intended for off-road use, the recall goes through the Consumer Product Safety Commission, not the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In other safety news: • Earlier this week, Honda recalled 5,600 of its 2011 CR-Z hybrids with manual transmissions after learning the cars could move forward or backward against the intentions of the driver. In a letter dated Sept. 6, Honda informed N.H.T.S.A. that it learned of the problem in February, during testing in Japan. If the high-voltage battery has a low charge, the letter said, “there is a potential for the motor of a CR-Z with a manual transmission to rotate in the opposite direction of the engaged gear causing the vehicle to move in the opposite direction.” Honda continued to investigate through the winter, spring and summer, the letter indicated, and at the end of August the automaker concluded that a recall was warranted, although it had received no reports of consumers experiencing the problem. Honda plans to update the software controlling the system. • The safety agency has decided not to push Ford to expand its recall of 1.1 million pickup trucks, which was performed because the straps holding the gas tank to the chassis could corrode, allowing the tanks to break loose. In July, Ford said it would recall vehicles in states that used a lot of road salt. That recall, however, covered fewer than half the number of vehicles originally investigated by the safety agency. In a document filed last month on its Web site, the agency said it closed its investigation after concluding that Ford’s recall of 1.1 million pickups appeared to “adequately address the problem at this time.” The recalled vehicles were the 1997–2003 F-150; 2004 F-150 Heritage; 1997–99 F-250 with a gross vehicle weight under 8,500 pounds; and 2002–3 Lincoln Blackwood. • N.H.T.S.A has opened an investigation into the safety of 650 school buses powered by compressed natural gas. The agency identified the buses as 2003–12 Thomas Built Saf-T-Liner HDX models. The agency said it opened the investigation after a Los Angeles school district complained that the tank containing the gas was mounted too close to the vehicle’s frame and could rub against it. It said there was one case in which the frame damaged the wrapping on the tank, raising a concern that the tank might burst.

The series production version of the Ford Focus ST will show its face formally — and finally — next week at the Frankfurt motor show. The hot hatch will be sold in the United States later in 2012. In concept form, the car was first displayed at the Paris auto show a year ago wearing a hue of orange called Tangerine Scream. It made subsequent stops at the Los Angeles, Detroit and New York auto shows. The new ST is not part of Ford’s SVT range aimed at enthusiasts, unlike the previous high-performance Focus sold in North America. It does, however, represent part of a global performance category at Ford. Jost Capito, the head of global performance vehicle strategy at Ford, said in a telephone interview Thursday that the brand intended to introduce several new performance vehicles globally, a push that would also include a 2013 Mustang GT500. The ST, with its wide-mouth trapezoidal grill and dual-outlet exhaust, is rated to deliver 247 horsepower from its turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder EcoBoost motor. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard. Compared with the standard 2012 Focus now on sale, the ST also has a lowered chassis, bigger brakes and suspension tuning tweaks. More details are expected to be revealed next week at the show, but pricing for the United States-bound model is not. The Titanium model, which represents the current high end for the Focus in America, costs $23,495 before options.</text></article>

Aims the Volt at China, but Chinese Want Its Secrets<date>Published: September 5, 2011</date><text>TIANJIN, China — For General Motors and the Obama administration, the new Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid represents the automotive future, the culmination of decades of high-tech research financed partly with federal dollars.But as G.M. prepares to start selling them here by the end of this year, the Chinese government is putting heavy pressure on the company to share some of the car’s core technology. The Chinese government is refusing to let the Volt qualify for subsidies totaling up to $19,300 a car unless G.M. agrees to transfer the engineering secrets for one of the Volt’s three main technologies to a joint venture in China with a Chinese automaker, G.M. officials said. Some international trade experts said China would risk violating World Trade Organization rules if it imposed that requirement. The government’s demand is the latest example of China’s willingness to use the leverage of Western access to the vast Chinese market to extract concessions on advanced technologies. Policies to force technology transfers from non-Chinese companies have already helped this nation build big industries in areas like wind turbines, high-speed trains and water purification. Western companies have complained that the tactics create an uneven playing field for business ventures trying to compete with domestic Chinese industries. The dispute over the Volt threatens to lead to another trade dispute with the West and could affect the dynamics of a visit to China this month by the American energy secretary, Steven Chu. The consumer subsidies in question are considered crucial for helping electric and hybrid vehicles catch on in China, which became the world’s largest car market in 2009. The government has made a priority of moving beyond cars that burn fossil fuels and emit polluting exhaust. At an industry conference here in this port city near Beijing over the weekend, government officials called for Chinese automakers to put new emphasis on producing more fuel-efficient and technologically advanced models, including gasoline-electric hybrids and all-electric cars. Right now, the subsidies are available for electric cars made by Chinese automakers, like the e6 made by BYD, giving them a huge competitive advantage. The Volt, if G.M. proceeds with plans to begin selling it in China by year’s end, will be the first mass-market predominantly electric car imported to China by a foreign manufacturer. The Volt has not yet been priced in China. But the Chinese subsidies are nearly half the Volt’s suggested retail price in the United States of $41,000, before including a tax break of up to $7,500 that Washington offers. The American tax break is not restricted to domestic cars, nor does it require technology transfers. G.M. is pressing Chinese officials to let the Volt qualify for the subsidies and tax breaks without the technology transfer. “We’ll bring it up in every conversation we have,” said Raymond Bierzynski, the executive director of electrification strategy at G.M. China, which has headquarters in Shanghai. G.M. has a series of joint ventures with several Chinese automakers, but plans to import the Volt from Michigan. Global companies like Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen and Daimler have spent billions of dollars to develop electric and plug-in hybrid cars. They are eager to start earning a return on those investments by selling them in China, where 17 million cars — virtually all of them gasoline-powered — were sold last year. But Japanese and European automakers in particular have held back for fear of losing trade secrets if they are forced to share their newest technologies with Chinese companies. The Volt would be the pioneer, with the subsidy issue shaping up as a crucial test case. G.M.’s arch rival, Ford, already intends to accede to the Chinese demand, a Ford executive said. But Ford is still conducting only demonstration projects of electric cars in China, including an effort here in Tianjin, and has not set a date for commercial sales. Chinese automakers may need technology assistance for advanced cars because their research budgets tend to be only a tiny share of sales by international standards. That is why the Chinese government wants to ensure that its automakers gain the technology to manufacture their own electric and hybrid cars. “We have to break through and master the core technologies,” Chen Jiachang, a deputy director of the ministry of science and technology, said in a speech Saturday at the conference here. At least five trade experts said that Chinese government policies making it uneconomical to sell an imported electric car in China without transferring technology could violate rules of the World Trade Organization, of which China is a member. “The rules do not allow a country to impose a requirement affecting the internal sale, distribution or purchase of a product in a way that favors its own product over imports,” said Carolyn B. Gleason, a partner at McDermott Will &amp; Emery in Washington and longtime specialist in W.T.O. cases. 1 2 Next Page »TIANJIN, China — For General Motors and the Obama administration, the new Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid represents the automotive future, the culmination of decades of high-tech research financed partly with federal dollars.</text></article>

The Ford Evos concept car, which is scheduled to have its debut at the Frankfurt auto show next month, represents a near-term design strategy, said J Mays, the company’s design chief, in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “This will appear on production cars not in four years but in four months,” he said. “We want to grease the skids in Frankfurt so that when the production versions come out people will say, ‘Oh yes, that’s what they were going for.’” That time frame would put an Evos-inspired vehicle on a podium in Detroit in January. Given the dimensions of the Evos, a redesigned Fusion midsize sedan could be the first product to wear the new aesthetic, which Mr. Mays described as an evolution of the kinetic design language reflected by vehicles like the Fiesta, Focus and C-Max. The fastback lines of the concept put some in mind of four-door coupes likes the Mercedes-Benz CLS and Audi A7, as well as the Volkswagen CC. But the brand has no plans to field a combatant. “We will not build a four-door coupe,” Mr. Mays said.</text></article>

Ford and Zipcar are expected on Wednesday to announce an unusual partnership in which the Detroit automaker will supply its vehicles to Zipcar locations on 250 college and university campuses in the United States. The two-year program will provide Zipcar with up to 1,000 Ford Focus sedans and Escape sport utility vehicles for students who prefer short-term vehicle rentals to the trouble and expense of owning their own car. In addition to providing the cars, Ford will offer the first 100,000 university students who sign up for Zipcar a $10 discount on the network’s $30 annual membership fee. In addition, Ford has agreed to subsidize $1 of the hourly rental rate for the first one million hours of use on any of its vehicles. The typical Zipcar rental costs $8 to $9 an hour. The program, which starts Thursday, is a significant step in the expansion of Zipcar, based in Cambridge, Mass., which went public with an initial stock offering early this year, and in August reported strong revenue and membership growth that exceeded Wall Street expectations. Zipcar has been a fixture in urban areas like New York, Boston, San Francisco and Washington for several years, and has been gradually moving into smaller markets like Sacramento and Providence, R.I. Recently, it has been seeking to rapidly expand its presence on college campuses. The alliance with Ford will raise Zipcar’s presence substantially in the student market — and get more American cars into Zipcar’s fleet. Nearly all of Zipcar’s current models are foreign nameplates like the Honda Civic, the Mini Cooper and Toyota Prius. Currently, Zipcar has more than 600,000 members in the United States, Canada and Britain. The impetus for the new partnership began two years ago at a transportation forum when William Clay Ford Jr., Ford’s executive chairman, met Scott Griffith, Zipcar’s chairman and chief executive. In an interview, Mr. Ford said he had become interested in car-sharing networks as part of the long-term answer of how congested cities could solve transportation issues without simply adding more vehicles. As an ardent environmentalist, he said he could appreciate how short-term car rentals could ease fuel consumption in cities already overcrowded with privately owned vehicles. The auto industry has been pouring vehicles into regular rental car fleets operated by big companies like Hertz and Avis, for years. Mr. Ford said that Zipcar offered an opportunity for the automaker to reach a new demographic of younger, college-age drivers who otherwise might not try a Ford product. “We are looking at the future of transportation more holistically,” he said. “We shouldn’t be threatened by these different business models. We should embrace them.” Zipcar owns more than 8,000 cars and offers its members more than 30 different models. But Mr. Griffith said the deal with Ford was a powerful endorsement of its market and its services. “Having Bill Ford and the Ford Motor Company validating Zipcar as a business model and as an emerging transportation brand is a big step for us,” Mr. Griffith said. Zipcar has bought 650 Ford cars and S.U.V.’s to start, and will start making them available for rental within two weeks. The membership and rental subsidies offered by Ford could entice frugal college students to give the brand a try. “The cheaper it is, the more I would be willing to use it,” said Tyler Harangozo of Windsor, Ontario, an incoming freshman at Wayne State University in Detroit. Mr. Harangozo was among a crowd of Wayne State students looking over the Ford Focus during orientation activities on Tuesday. He said he expected to commute to school by bus, but appreciated the option of renting a Zipcar for a few hours if needed. “I can’t rely on public transit to get all around Detroit,” he said. “I’ll probably need a car once in a while.” Zipcar memberships are available to anyone who has had a driver’s license for two years and a good driving record. That makes it especially appealing for people under the age of 21, who often cannot qualify to rent a car from a traditional daily rental agency. At Zipcar, even a teenager can become a member. Rental fees include insurance coverage, and Mr. Griffith said background checks had generally weeded out poor drivers from its membership rolls. “If you have a D.U.I. or high-speed driving violations, you won’t be able to drive one of our cars,” he said. Ford sees the program as an inexpensive means to introduce younger drivers to its products, particularly the compact Ford Focus. The cars are equipped with Ford’s Sync infotainment and communications systems, and they are among the most fuel-efficient models in the company’s fleet. “It’s a great way to reach these first-time drivers,” Mr. Ford said. “And the data shows that the No. 1 reason people leave Zipcar is to buy a vehicle, and that they are heavily influenced by what they have driven as a member.” In the past, Mr. Ford said, his company did not have the right models to attract college-age drivers. “The Focus is the right product at the right time to reach college kids,” he said. “We don’t know where car-sharing is headed, but Ford wants to be a part of it.”DETROIT — It wasn’t long ago that car-sharing services like Zipcar were perceived as a threat to the sales volumes of traditional automakers.</text></article>

On Wednesday, Ford released the first images of the Evos concept, a fastback-style sedan with gullwing doors expected to be unveiled at the Frankfurt auto show next month. J Mays, the group vice president for design at Ford, had previously shown the images to journalists in Romeo, Mich., site of the brand’s proving grounds, on Aug. 23 during a media presentation. The vehicle, he said at the time, heralded a new design direction for the automaker. The company’s current design language, described internally as kinetic design, was introduced with the Iosis concept at the Frankfurt show in 2005. That approach was reflected in numerous subsequent vehicles, including the Fiesta, Focus and C-Max, as well as the current Mondeo midsize sedan sold outside of North America. At a glance, the Evos concept is similar to Iosis in that it has a fastback roofline with a minimal rear deck and a sharply raked windshield, but its form is cleaner and sleeker over all. Hints of the Iosis are also evident in the side windows, but the front-end treatment suggests the midcycle refresh of the Taurus SHO sedan, first shown at the New York auto show in April. Ford Iosis concept. Mr. Mays said during his presentation in Michigan that he expected the Evos to plot the way for the brand for the next five years. He framed discussion of the approach that begat the Evos in terms of six pillars: silhouette innovation, perceived efficiency, refined surface language, technical graphics, the new face of the brand and a concept he called “visual premiumness.” “In terms of silhouette innovation, we want a car that has a different profile,” Mr. Mays said. “Very, very sleek. We also want to have something we call perceived efficiency. That happens not only through the silhouette or the teardrop shape of the cabin, but it happens through the lines on the side of the car that are pulling toward the back and almost vanishing at some point 100 yards behind the car.” Mr. Mays added that the concept of kinetic design that the Iosis introduced was not being abandoned, but rather simplified. “We’re showing the same amount of action and surface language, but in a much simpler and reduced form,” he said. In terms of technical graphics, Mr. Mays discussed headlamp design, lamenting that, throughout the industry, Ford included, headlamps had grown to absurd proportions and had become styling elements. “Headlamps are technical,” he said. “They’re supposed to shine light down the road. And with the new technology that we have, we’re going to go to what we call laser headlamps. They’re going to be very small in height and very stretched out. They’re going to show a technology that you haven’t seen before.” Mr. Mays said that the new face of Ford — in plainspeak, front-end styling — is a direct descendant of the current face, with its inverted trapezoid grille. But with the Evos, the trapezoid has been raised almost to the hood surface, giving the car a look that is more aggressive and, according to Mr. Mays, visually premium. “Because it’s a show car, Evos has not two but four gullwing doors,” said Mr. Mays. “We’re theatrical. We can’t help it.” He added that the gullwing doors would serve a purpose, at least at Frankfurt, as they dramatically display the interior, which features trim, gray seats shaped to wrap around the driver and passengers. The driver’s seat, which is isolated by a stout console, is red — the hot seat. “We’re not going to Frankfurt to provoke people,” Mr. Mays added. “We’re going to Frankfurt to seduce people.” The Web debut of the Ford Evos concept is one of many expected in advance of the Frankfurt auto show, which officially begins its press previews on Sept. 13. Wheels will be running advance coverage of the show’s most highly anticipated debuts and will be on the convention floor in September.</text></article>

ROMEO, Mich. — Sitting behind the wheel of a gently rumbling 2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 here on the tarmac apron at Ford’s proving grounds, I put my foot on the brake, pushed the speed control’s Set button and watched the tachometer needle sweep through its range. With Jeff Seaman, the Mustang program manager, providing instruction from the passenger’s seat — a brave man, he — I released the Set button, then used the plus and minus controls to set the tach to 4,200 r.p.m. When the needle returned to idle, I pressed the speed control’s On button to lock in the r.p.m. setting. Then it was time to push in the clutch and floor the accelerator. The 444–horsepower 5-liter V-8 dutifully rose to 4,200 r.p.m, and I sidestepped the clutch. With just a blip of tire squeal, the Mustang dug in and launched hard, its engine racing toward the 7,500-r.p.m. red line. Playing the moment for all it was worth, I stabbed the clutch and wrenched the short-throw shifter back into second gear. The tires squealed in protest, and the end of the tarmac raced up to meet me. I lifted, stomped the brake pedal and brought my brief adventure to a quick conclusion. The options-sheet checkbox that puts near-perfect dragstrip-style getaways like this within reach of klutzes like me is the TracKey package, available for $302 above the $41,105 base price of a Boss 302. It is a dealer-installed option. TracKey is, surprise surprise, enabled with a key. A red Boss 302 logo distinguishes it from the standard Mustang key, and when inserted into the car’s ignition lock, it activates powertrain control-module software that adjusts over 600 engine management parameters, including camshaft timing, fuel control and spark mapping. Drivability features intended to temper the Boss 302 for city streets are deactivated. The happy result is a track-worthy calibration that delivers increased low-end torque, a higher level of engine braking, hopped-up throttle response and that wickedly addicting launch-control feature. “TracKey was a great cross-functional effort at Ford, a true skunkworks project,” Mr. Seaman told me later in a telephone interview. While the Boss 302 was conceived more as a road racer than a drag-race car, the launch-control function behaves much like the two-stage launch systems found in competitive drag racing. Yet it should also serve the road-racing set well, particularly in Sports Car Club of America-sanctioned events that include a standing start. The launch-control r.p.m. adjustment makes it possible to select engine speed for racing starts in increments of 100 r.p.m. from 2,000 to 5,000 r.p.m. When the throttle is floored, the powertrain control module regulates spark and fuel to restrict r.p.m. to the preselected figure. When the clutch is released, a switch tells the control module to return to the standard 7,500-r.p.m. rev limit. Boss customers will most likely conclude that the resulting four or five seconds of Mittyesque pleasure handily justifies the $302 tariff.</text></article>

The companies said they did not plan to collaborate on developing the vehicles themselves, instead using the hybrid system they develop to power separate models under the Ford and Toyota brands. The resulting hybrid trucks would go on sale later this decade, they said, without providing a more specific timeframe. “Clearly Ford and Toyota will remain competitors,” said Derrick Kuzak, Ford’s group vice president for research and development. “By working together, we will be able to offer our customers more affordable technology sooner.” In addition, Ford and Toyota said they intended to collaboratively develop new technology for information and entertainment systems in vehicles, with the goal of offering more Internet-based services and useful data to drivers. The companies already are among the industry’s leaders in this area, known as telematics, and their partnership could give them enough leverage to essentially dictate the standards that other automakers use to wirelessly connect mobile phones and other devices to vehicles. The partnership sprang from informal talks between the chief executives of the two companies, Alan R. Mulally at Ford and Akio Toyoda at Toyota, that began when the two accidentally crossed paths at an airport, according to Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota’s executive vice president for research and development. Teams led by Mr. Kuzak and Mr. Uchiyamada began working together in April. They said many specifics of the deal had yet to be determined. The companies signed a memorandum of understanding Monday and expect to enter into a formal agreement next year, after completing a feasibility study that will help them lay out more detailed plans. Ford makes the top-selling truck in the United States, the F-150, and Toyota is the leading producer of hybrid vehicles, having sold 3.3 million since introducing the popular Prius car in 1997. Neither company sells a hybrid truck, and other automakers have had little success doing so. But proposed fuel-economy standards, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency last month, that would require automakers to build much more fuel-efficient vehicles in the years ahead are forcing them to explore more advanced technology. By collaborating, Ford and Toyota hope to reduce the costs and development time of such work and keep hybrid trucks from becoming too expensive or lacking in performance. “The E.P.A. fuel standards are a big challenge for us automakers,” Mr. Uchiyamada said through a translator. “Trucks and S.U.V.’s are vehicles that the American society cannot do without. This collaboration we are forming with Ford is not only about lowering carbon dioxide but making light-duty trucks and S.U.V.’s more affordable.” The hybrid system they plan to develop would be for rear-wheel-drive vehicles.

The brands expect to have products in the marketplace before the end of the decade, they said. In addition to hybrid technology, the automakers plan to collaborate on the development of standards for in-car telematics and Internet-based services. Current Ford and Toyota hybrid systems for front-drive vehicles are somewhat similar, so a joint effort would appear to be a good fit. Both automakers currently produce parallel systems that can utilize the electric motor either independent of or in combination with the gasoline engine, while charging the battery pack with a generator fed by the gasoline engine and through regenerative braking. Some news sources reported that Ford licensed Toyota hybrid technology roughly a decade ago. Said Deep, a Ford spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the confusion resulted from the fact that Ford licensed a number of Toyota patents when it introduced its first hybrid vehicles. Toyota also licensed some Ford patents, he said. The cross-licensing of patents is common in high-technology industries, when product similarities are evident, but Mr. Deep said that no Toyota technology was used in developing the early Ford hybrids. In the joint statement, the automakers said that they had been independently developing rear-wheel-drive hybrid powertrains, but decided to collaborate to bring new technology to the marketplace sooner, as well as to save development costs, which would lead to lower costs in the showroom. “We expect to create exciting technologies that benefit society with Ford, and we can do so through the experience the two companies have in hybrid technology,” said Takeshi Uchiyamade, a Toyota executive vice president. While the automakers will collaborate on the development of the new rear-wheel-drive hybrid system, they will work independently when integrating the finalized design into their vehicles and in developing a specific calibration. So while the hardware will be common, the on-road performance and efficiency won’t necessarily be. If Toyota may seem a step ahead of Ford in hybrid technology — its Prius is the top-selling hybrid in the United States — Ford may have an advantage in telematics. The automaker collaborated with Microsoft to develop its Sync in-car entertainment and communication system, which has been in the marketplace longer than Toyota’s Entune system. However, MyFord Touch, an extension of the Sync system, has been widely criticized, so both automakers may stand to profit from a collaborative effort on this front as well.</text></article>

Akerson, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, driving a 1960 Chevrolet Corvette down Woodward Avenue with Steve Girsky, the G.M. vice chairman, in the passenger seat Thursday. DETROIT — After a lengthy spell in the doldrums, and encouraged by improved sales, domestic carmakers are stepping up involvement in the Woodward Dream Cruise, suburban Detroit’s annual paean to all things automotive. Created in 1995 to raise funds for a suburban soccer field and held the third Saturday in August, the Cruise attracts 1.5 million people who line Woodward Avenue, metro Detroit’s central thoroughfare, to watch 40,000 vehicles snake, peel and rumble their way north for 16 miles through eight communities. The cruise begins in Ferndale and reaches its terminus in Pontiac. Leading the love-in this year is Chevrolet, which is committed to sponsorship through 2013. The General Motors division, like most other automakers, had dialed back its participation as the industry reeled. Last year, the Motor City casino was the chief sponsor. “Obviously, we didn’t do as much the last couple of years, but we’re ramping back up,” said Tom Wilkinson, Chevrolet’s communication’s manager, in a telephone interview. “And the next two years will also give us a chance to get some rhythm and keep building.” Chevrolet sales increased 14 percent from January through July in the United States, he added. With multiple events scheduled throughout the weekend, Chevrolet is also using the cruise to mark the brand’s centennial celebration. “The strategy was not to have one big event,” Mr. Wilkinson said. Chevrolet’s three-year sponsorship totals $1.2 million, not including independent marketing, said Martin Pawlusiak, who handles cruise sponsorships. The event last year injected about $56 million into the local economy and benefited 100 charities, he said. As of Thursday, sponsorship was up 15 percent over last year, he added, including a $35,000 from Auburn Hills-based Plex Systems, a software company that sells to auto suppliers. “We doubled the size of our company in the last three years and thought this was a great opportunity to give back to the local community in a way that works well with our customer base,” said Patrick Fetterman, the company’s vice president of marketing. Tony Michaels, the cruise’s executive director, said that while the industry’s sales gains had been modest, the corporate mood had brightened. G.M.’s domestic sales improved from 185,105 last August to 214,915 in July. Ford’s totals increased from 157,327 to 180,315, while Chrysler went from 99,611 to 112,026. Companies recently announced plans to hire new workers. “There’s a substantial uptick that is obvious,” Mr. Michaels said. “You can see they’re excited.” The festivities began this week when the G.M. design team was the host of a cruise-route car show, featuring entertainment and vehicles owned by team members. On Thursday, Daniel F. Akerson, the G.M. chairman and chief executive, drove a 1960 Corvette down Woodward, accompanied by 50 owner-driven Chevrolet Volts, 20 employee-owned Chevrolet heritage vehicles, the new Camaro ZL1, the Chevrolet Sonic and other classic vehicles. Ford returns this year with an expanded Mustang Alley, which occupies Nine Mile Road near Woodward in suburban Ferndale. The presentation features the 2013 Ford Focus ST production concept, which is due in showrooms next spring, as well as more than 700 Mustangs. Technicians will be on hand to install performance parts on newer vehicles or modern parts on classic cars. “We’re offering a bigger array of vehicles and engines than before,” said Richard Truett, Ford’s powertrain communications manager, in a telephone interview, adding that Ford has sunk more resources into marketing than in recent years. “We have more people working on it.” In addition to mobile billboards and a prominent Fiat wallscape in suburban Birmingham, Chrysler has more space than usual in a strip-mall parking lot. “It’s a little bigger than last year,” said Dianna C. Gutierrez, the automaker’s marketing and advertising public relations manager. “This is definitely an important event for us.” The manufacturer is highlighting production and historical vehicles, a Nascar show car and seven employee-owned muscle cars. If the industry may be regarded in rebound relative only to its turn in the abyss, Dana DeCoster, publisher of Cruis’news, which covers the classic and hot-rod industry, said it was still progress. “From being out on the streets the last couple of days, I’ve noticed a much larger presence of the Big Three,” he said in a telephone interview. “The companies are coming back, and what better place than the cruise to show that off.”</text></article>

MONTEREY, Calif. — A memento from Ford Motor Company history, Edsel Ford’s personal Model 40 Special Speedster, was unveiled Friday at the Lodge at Pebble Beach after undergoing a three-year process to refurbish it to its original state. Edsel Ford II, a grandson of his namesake, introduced the completed car here. Work on the vehicle was conducted by RM Auto Restoration. “My grandfather was an early believer that everyday objects, including automobiles, could be seen as works of art,” Mr. Ford said. “While he wasn’t a designer in the traditional sense, his eye for styling and influence was apparent as he initiated and built the design department at Ford Motor Company.” Based on a 1934 Ford roadster, the car was fashioned by E.T. Gregorie, the company’s head stylist at the time, according to specifications first laid out by Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford, in 1932. He asked Gregorie to design and supervise the construction of a personal sports car similar to ones he’d seen “on the continent.” Following Edsel Ford’s death in 1943, the car was sold and changed hands several times until it sold for a paltry $603 in 1958. In 2008, the car, considerably altered from its original condition, was sold by RM Auctions for $1.76 million. The new owner died in 2010, and the car was bequeathed to the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House in Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich. Restoration was approved after that, with the intention of putting the car back in the condition as it appeared in 1940. After the Pebble Beach weekend, during which it will be on display courtesy of Lincoln, the speedster will be returned to the Ford House.</text></article>

Look at what it is today,” Ms. Bachmann, a Republican presidential candidate, told the audience. She did not discuss how she would bring about such a reduction, but she has been a proponent of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and developing oil-shale extraction techniques in the West. (Politico) • Bloomberg is reporting that the rumored Chrysler-based Maserati S.U.V., affectionately dubbed the Maser-ango by your Wheels team, would be built at the American brand’s Jefferson North plant in Detroit. The S.U.V. is expected to be unveiled at the Frankfurt auto show next month, although Fiat, Maserati and Chrysler’s corporate parent has yet to officially confirm the vehicle’s existence. The platform used by the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango is expected to underpin the luxury S.U.V. (Bloomberg) • The entry-level 2012 Grand Cherokee, meanwhile, will cost over $3,000 less than the 2011 model-year vehicle, Kicking Tires reports. The base S.U.V., with rear-wheel drive and the brand’s V-6, will sticker for $26,995, excluding an undisclosed destination charge. The 2011 vehicle cost $31,040, including $825 delivery. For its redesigned Explorer, Ford based much of its advertising this year on a base price, $28,995, which was lower than the Jeep. (Kicking Tires) • Coda, the electric vehicle start-up based in Southern California, reportedly has signed a letter of intent with Great Wall Motor Company, the Chinese automaker, to co-develop E.V.’s. Under the agreement, Coda would supply powertrains and other systems and components to Great Wall, which would be used on the company’s S.U.V.’s and crossovers. In January, Coda hired Philip Murtaugh to be its chief operating officer. The former executive from Chrysler and General Motors is widely recognized for developing G.M.’s lucrative Chinese operations. (AutoObserver) • Major automakers increasingly leave a spare tire off of their vehicles’ equipment lists, The Detroit News reports. A study by Edmunds.com found that in the last five years, there has been a 38 percent decrease in the number of new vehicles offering full-size spares, relative to the previous five years. There has been a corresponding increase in new cars coming equipped with repair kits in lieu of the full spare. Most vehicles still are equipped with at least a doughnut spare. Honda is the only major automaker in the United States that, as of this year, still offered a full spare in all of its vehicles. (The Detroit News)</text></article>

They have more power than drivers are likely ever to exploit, and bragging rights depend on statistics that are, in practical terms, theoretical.Like a Lamborghini Aventador’s top speed, a GMC Sierra HD’s maximum tow rating (21,700 pounds) is more of a chest-thumping point than a practical consideration. In some versions of the Sierra 2500, you could theoretically carry a Corvette Z06 (3,175 pounds) in the bed. Of course, if that’s not enough capability, there’s always the 3500 model, which can carry even heavier things. While you can’t buy a diesel engine in a mainstream light-duty pickup, heavy-duty pickups now offer propulsion suitable for a tandem-axle dump truck. I’m not exaggerating. Ford’s 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V-8 packs 400 horsepower and 800 pound-feet of torque; the base engine in a Peterbilt 348 dump truck offers a mere 260 horsepower and 660 pound feet. Does your pickup really need more power than a Peterbilt? I drove three new heavy-duty models that represent distinct points on the monster-pickup spectrum. The GMC Sierra Denali 2500HD ($62,124 as tested) is aimed at people who’d rather drive a Mercedes S-Class, if only it could tow 10 tons. The Ford F-350 Super Duty Power Stroke ($56,390) is a towering confluence of old-school truck design (hello, solid front axle) and up-to-the-minute diesel technology. And the Ram 2500 Power Wagon ($50,310) is an outlier, a heavy-duty truck that’s optimized for off-road adventure, provided you can find a trail wide enough to use it. It’s kind of like a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with a thyroid condition. The GMC and Ford that I drove were diesel V-8s, while the Ram was powered by a 5.7-liter, 383-horsepower Hemi V-8. (The Ram HD is also available with a 6.7-liter Cummins diesel in-line 6 that’s rated at 350 horsepower and up to 800 pound-feet. But diesel propulsion isn’t available in the Power Wagon.) The diesel trucks hold a nominal edge in horsepower and a huge advantage in torque, but the rev-happy gas-powered Ram felt the friskiest of the three. What the diesels lack in outright speed, they make up for with a certain relentlessness. In testing by Popular Mechanics, the GMC’s 0-to-60 acceleration took 7.8 seconds. That’s not a head-turning number in the context of gasoline-powered trucks, but the Sierra felt as if it would clock the same time even if it were hitched to the Pacific Plate. I used the GMC to tow a 3,500-pound boat, and the Denali seemed ready to yank the trailer out from beneath the boat, like a magician pulling a tablecloth from under a dinner setting. Nonetheless, I get the idea that the manufacturers’ fixation on power numbers (the Ford got a power bump midway through the model year, just so it would have three more horsepower than General Motors’ trucks) created unrealistic expectations. While I was driving the F-350, a guy in a white Econoline van pulled alongside and asked, “That’s got the new 6.7, right? Is it fast?” Well, I’m sure the Great White Whale looked pretty fast to Ahab, in the manner of all huge things that move with anything other than ponderous deliberation. Perhaps a better question would be, “Do you have to take the whole cab off to gain access to the turbocharger?” No you do not, and that’s a new development. If the pre-2011 model needed a new turbo, it was as if the dentist were to say: “O.K., we’re going to fill that cavity. Just keep your mouth closed while we get the skull saw.” Your local Super Duty mechanic might not need a cab hoist, but he’ll want a sturdy stepladder. To give you an idea of how tall the F-350 is, the tailgate includes a fold-down step and a vertical grab handle. You know you’ve got a tall truck when it has its own staircase and newel post. The Ford is wide, too. In fact, the outside rearview mirrors telescope and fold to aid parking. One observer, upon watching me navigate into a parking spot and retract the mirrors, burst out in laughter. Now I know how Dumbo felt. The word “handling” doesn’t really apply to any of these vehicles, but the Ram was the best at impersonating a car. An enormous, awful car — maybe a 1978 Caprice that’s been fitted with wooden wagon wheels — but a car. Perhaps that’s because the Power Wagon’s off-road preoccupations result in sportier suspension tuning than you get in a truck that’s optimized to haul a pallet of granite. 1 2 Next Page »HEAVY-DUTY pickup trucks are the supercars of the truck world.

Audi is recalling about 920 of its high-performance R8 Spyders from the 2011-12 model years because of a fire hazard, the automaker told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In a notice posted Thursday to the safety agency’s Web site, Audi said that a fuel line could rub against a heat shield, which “could lead to a small fuel leak.” Without elaboration, the automaker attributed the condition “to production tolerances.” Audi told the agency that it first learned of the problem in June after a customer complained of smelling gasoline. The notice did not say if there were any fires, and Andrew Lipman, a spokesman for Audi, said he had no additional information. In other safety actions this week: • General Motors informed the agency that it would recall about 10,300 of its 2012 Chevrolet Impalas with the 3.6-liter V-6 engine, citing a fire hazard. In a document posted on the agency’s Web site early on Friday, the automaker told the agency that a hose for power-steering fluid was misrouted and might be too close to the catalytic converter. The automaker said it learned of the problem as the result of a “thermal event” during testing at the assembly plant. A G.M. spokesman said the company was not aware of any other fires. • General Motors said it was recalling about 4,000 2012 Buick Lacrosse sedans because the electronic stability control system could “falsely activate resulting in sudden changes in vehicle handling and deceleration, particularly at higher speeds.” In a document posted on the agency’s Web site on Friday, the automaker said that the condition “may cause the driver difficulty in maintaining the vehicle’s desired path of travel and desired vehicle speed.” The problem was attributed to an incorrect calibration in the software, which was discovered by a supplier. • The agency began investigating possible fuel leaks on about 40,000 2011 Volkswagens equipped with the TDI engine. The agency said it received seven complaints of fuel leaking from the line to the No. 2 fuel injector on the Jetta TDI and one complaint about a Golf TDI. There were no reports of accidents or fires. • N.H.T.S.A. began investigating about 120,000 BMW 7 Series sedans from the 2002–8 model years because the automatic transmission might not secure the vehicle in Park, allowing the vehicle to roll. • Shifting problems are being investigated on about 26,000 Ford Mustangs from the 2011-12 model years. The agency said it received 32 complaints from owners who said they were unable to get the transmission into gear. Ford introduced the 6-speed manual, which is made in China and supplied by Getrag, on the 2011 models, replacing a 5-speed manual.

In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • Ahead of the Frankfurt auto show, which begins in September, Audi teased an electric urban-runabout concept this week. The car, which makes use of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer to maintain low weight and increase rigidity, has 1-plus-1 seating, with a passenger seat positioned behind the driver. A lithium-ion battery supplies power to two electric motors, which Audi brands under its e-tron banner. In the style of a Caterham 7, the wheels are positioned outside the fuselage. (Audi) • A123 Systems, the Massachusetts battery manufacturer, has won a contract to provide General Motors with battery packs for an undisclosed number of vehicles to be sold in select global markets. According to a report by The Associated Press, the packs will be produced at the battery manufacturer’s plant in Livonia, Mich. LG Chem, which also maintains a plant in Michigan, provides the lithium-ion pack used in the Chevrolet Volt and its European equivalent, the Opel Ampera. (General Motors) • Ford announced Wednesday that it would join with SunPower, a solar-power infrastructure company, to provide home-charging units for buyers of the automaker’s coming Focus Electric and other planned plug-in models, like the C-Max. Pricing for the rooftop solar array, including assessment and installation, would begin at $10,000, but would not include the 240-volt home-charging unit that Ford intends to sell at Best Buy. SunPower estimates that the system delivers sufficient energy to fuel 1,000 miles of monthly, grid-free driving. (Ford) • Better Place, the electric-vehicle infrastructure company, opened its first retail store in Israel this week. In March, outside of Copenhagen, the company opened its first shop, and the country’s first battery-swap station followed last month. (That system was recently tested by Bradley Berman in The Times.) Like the Denmark store, the new location in Israel serves as a demonstration center, where prospective customers can test drive the Renault Fluence Z.E., the only mass-produced vehicle available that is designed for quick battery swaps. (Ha’aretz) • Hyundai North America spokesman Jim Trainor said in an interview with USA Today that the company had stopped supplying an Apple iPad in lieu of a paper owner’s manual for its Equus luxury sedan. Mr. Trainor said that iPads and iPods could still download the digital owner’s manual, but the iPad itself would no longer be included in the car’s glovebox, which was intended only as a yearlong promotion. (USA Today) • Ron Bloom, President Obama’s auto czar, announced that he would leave the position at the end of August. Mr. Bloom joined the president’s auto industry task force in February 2009 and was involved in organizing the bailouts and subsequent bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors later that year. As noted by The Times, Mr. Bloom also was instrumental in orchestrating discussions among major automakers about the latest round of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, which call for companies to achieve a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.

In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • Though it was unveiled to a North American audience last week in Pasadena, Calif., the Pagani Huayra is encountering resistance from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which stipulates that the hypercar be equipped with sophisticated air-bag systems. Pagani Automobili had appealed for a hardship exemption, which would have allowed the 700-horsepower Huayra to go on sale in the United States without the air bags, but in a notice posted to the agency’s Web site on Tuesday, the agency said that the Italian automaker had “failed to demonstrate that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship.” (Transportation Department – PDF) • Ford moved Tuesday to dispel reports that the rollout for the automaker’s Focus Electric model was delayed. David Finnegan, the Ford marketing manager for electrified vehicles, was quoted on a forum site saying that the car would ship in spring of 2012 to 19 targeted markets aside from California and New York, the car’s launch markets, which are scheduled to receive the E.V.’s by the end of 2011. In a statement, Ford said that it always intended a staggered rollout for the E.V. Alan R. Mulally, Ford president and chief executive, appeared on “The Late Show With David Letterman” last week with the car. (USA Today) • Ford is also making an aggressive product push for the Frankfurt auto show, which begins press previews on Sept. 13. The automaker is expected to show four new models, including a design concept. Among the models already previewed as concepts that are expected to be shown in production form is the Focus ST high-performance hatchback. Ford showed the Vertrek concept at the Detroit auto show in January, which is widely believed to dictate the styling direction for the coming replacement of the Escape compact S.U.V. (Car &amp; Driver) • Though supercar manufacturers tend not to traffic in new-product blitzes, Ferrari is reportedly planning to produce four models over the next two years. The first of these, a convertible version of its 458 Italia, is expected to have its debut at the Frankfurt auto show in September. Also planned are a replacement for the 599 GTB, a track-tuned Scuderia version of the 458 and a new flagship hypercar in the mold of the Enzo. Meanwhile, the brand’s new FF shooting brake will begin deliveries in the United States shortly. (Car magazine, via Automotive News) • On Monday, Toyota announced pricing for its Yaris subcompact, which was redesigned for 2012. The base two-door hatchback will cost $14,115, before destination charge, while the higher-specification SE will begin at $17,200. The Yaris will be expected to compete within a crowded segment that includes the Mazda 2, Nissan Versa, Hyundai Accent, Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta and Kia Rio. (Toyota)</text></article>

Complaints about the 6-speed manual transmission on about 26,000 Ford Mustangs from the 2011-12 model years have prompted an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency said it received 32 complaints from owners who said they were unable to get the transmission into gear. Ford introduced the 6-speed manual on the 2011 models, replacing a 5-speed manual. Richard Truett, a Ford spokesman, said in an e-mail that the MT82 transmission used on the 2011-12 Mustangs was built in China as part of a joint venture between Getrag Corporate Group and Ford. “Some reports allege incidents occurred while merging into high speed traffic and others allege that incidents occurred while turning left across oncoming traffic,” said a notice posted to the safety agency’s Web site over the weekend. “Some complainants allege that the erratic shifting behavior almost caused a collision with adjacent vehicles.” The complaints came from owners of the V-6 and V-8 models. Two Mustangs powered by V-8s, the GT and Shelby GT500, were reviewed in the Automobiles section last weekend. Ford issued a technical service bulletin in March blaming shifting problems on “cold ambient temperatures” and telling dealers to use a different type of transmission fluid. But some drivers who complained to N.H.T.S.A. said they experienced problems in hot weather or when the gearbox should have been completely warmed up. “The difficulty in shifting is mostly confined to cold weather states and occurs when the gearbox is cold,” said Mr. Truett, the Ford spokesman, echoing the technical bulletin. “We have made a few engineering changes and installed a new fluid to correct the problem.” On the agency’s Web site, a California woman wrote that while stopped at a traffic light, a driver approached at high speed behind her. “I started prepping if I had to move forward into the intersection that had no traffic just in case,” she wrote. “Would not shift into first gear no matter what I tried. Quickly I shifted into second and saw the driver smash the brakes while his tires were smoking as he was approaching my rear end in a slide. Car had enough power to move me forward 10 feet to avoid a collision.” The investigation is called a preliminary evaluation. If the agency found additional reason to be concerned, it would upgrade the investigation to an engineering analysis, which could be followed by a recall or a decision that no further action would be warranted.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/automobiles/autoreviews/for-wild-mustangs-heaps-of-thoroughbred-power.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">For Wild Mustangs, Heaps of Thoroughbred Power<date>Published: August 5, 2011</date><text>Santa Barbara, Calif.IN a world of infinite resources, one without responsibilities or consequences, I would drive nothing but V-8 Ford Mustangs. Each morning I’d get out of bed, fire up one of my perfectly toned muscle machines and spin its rear tires until great clouds of burned rubber billowed skyward. I’d spend the day racing all challengers, quitting only when it was time to head home for some sleep — and to dream of doing it all again the next day. In the real world, my life does not live up to these Mustang fantasies, but that’s not because of any shortcoming of the car. On the contrary: the 2011 Mustangs were impressive from the moment they went on sale in April 2010 with fresh engines and transmissions. The V-6 Mustang, reviewed on these pages last year, proved to be a well-balanced package, with a 3.7-liter engine that delivered 305-horsepower — and 31 m.p.g., by the E.P.A.’s rating, on the highway. While that V-6 is a popular — and in most ways entirely fulfilling — choice among buyers, historical precedent demands that a selection of V-8 engines is available. Brute power remains a prime attraction of the Mustang and its colleagues, a market segment that today has shrunk to include only the Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger as its other surviving members; as a class, it accounts for far fewer sales than when it was given the label of pony cars in the 1960s. Ford has stepped up with a pair of new V-8s: a 412-horsepower 5-liter engine for the Mustang GT and a supercharged 5.4-liter of 550 horsepower for the Shelby GT500, both available in summer-ready convertible form. The V-8s elevate the Mustang’s performance so that the GT now closely matches the 426-horsepower Chevrolet Camaro SS, and the GT500 closely parallels the supercharged Camaro ZL1, due next year. From outside, it’s the 5.0 emblems on the 2011 Mustang GT’s fenders that distinguish the car, giving it a direct, nostalgic appeal to the generations of homegrown mechanics who grew up hot-rodding the 5-liter Mustangs built from 1979 to 1993. But those cars ran an all-iron V-8, an engine whose family tree had roots reaching back to 1962. That engine used pushrods to operate two valves for each cylinder, and its performance in factory-installed form peaked with a 240-horsepower version used in the 1994-95 Mustang Cobra. Squeezing 72 percent more power out of virtually the same displacement required updated technology. Nicknamed Coyote by Ford engineers during its development, the new 5.0 is an all-aluminum, twin-cam, 32-valve design with variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust cams. Capped by a composite plastic intake manifold, this 5.0 is far more than a warmed-over version of the underwhelming 4.6-liter “modular” V-8s used in the Mustang GT since 1996. But it is related. What it has in common with the 315-horsepower engine of the 2010 Mustang GT is a basic geometry that allows it to be machined and assembled on the existing production lines in Windsor, Ontario. Though the latest 5.0 lacks up-to-the-minute features like direct fuel injection, it absolutely rips to its 7,000 r.p.m. limit. It’s giddy, glorious, romping fun, exhaling magnificent sounds through its stainless steel exhaust headers. And the GT is quick. In tests done by Insideline.com, part of the Edmunds car-buying Web site, a GT coupe equipped with the sublime Getrag 6-speed manual transmission thumped to 60 m.p.h. in 4.8 seconds and ran through the quarter mile in 13.3 seconds at 107.3 m.p.h. (The coupe is 115 pounds lighter than the 3,720-pound convertible, according to Ford.) Despite its capacity for furious acceleration, the Mustang GT’s electronic throttle is sweetly progressive, enabling the engine to trawl through traffic with dignity. The E.P.A. rates the manual-shift 2011 GT at a respectable 17 m.p.g. in the city and 26 m.p.g. on the highway. With a solid rear axle — independent suspension is apparently too adventurous a concept — in every current Mustang, the chassis specifications seem primitive, at least on paper. But Ford gets plenty out of the GT in any case. The handling is reassuring, the steering is light and communicative, the optional Brembo front disc brakes just don’t fade and there’s plenty of grip from the 235/50ZR18 Pirelli PZero tires. 1 2 Next Page »Santa Barbara, Calif.</text></article>

It’s brighter, more vibrant and better performing, but stripped to bare bones, it’s essentially the same car. Named after, inspired by and striped to look like the 1969-70 Mustang Boss 302 — a quasi racer that Ford built to unseat the Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 in the Sports Car Club of America’s Trans Am series — the new Boss amplifies the GT’s talents with careful detail changes and some old-school demon tweaks. For instance, Ford used the Mustang GT’s 5-liter V-8 as the foundation for the Boss’s engine, but improved its breathing with cylinder heads whose intake and exhaust passageways have been carved out by computer-controlled milling machines. Then Ford installed high-performance camshafts. The completed head assemblies are bolted to a V-8 block that contains stronger forged (instead of cast) aluminum pistons. The result is an engine that not only spins faster, but is also strong enough to deal with the increased power output. The maximum r.p.m. was kicked up to 7,500, from 7,000; the output jumps to 444 horsepower, from 412, on premium fuel. It’s the new, improved Happy Fun Ball, with 8 percent more bouncy, bouncy fun. Bolted behind the Boss engine is the same sweet shifting 6-speed manual transmission used in the GT, now sending the power to a rear axle geared for acceleration. So naturally the Boss 302 is quicker than the GT. Insideline.com measured the Boss 302 ripping from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 4.6 seconds (0.2 seconds quicker than the GT) and running the quarter-mile in 12.7-seconds at 113 m.p.h. But it’s the engine’s flexibility that’s most impressive: it’s willing to scream all day above 7,000 r.p.m., but is still strong at low r.p.m. And it returns the same E.P.A. mileage, 17 m.p.g. in the city and 26 m.p.g. on the highway, as the GT. That engine lives in a capable chassis built around Pirelli PZero performance tires, 255/40R19 in front and 285/35R19 at the rear. Compared with the GT, the Boss has a large antiroll bar at the rear, revised springs, manually adjustable shock absorbers and a slightly lower ride height. The Boss reacts to steering inputs instantly, sticks in corners as if it were buried under the asphalt and still manages to ride well. Its Brembo front brakes could probably stop a nuclear chain reaction. Order the $41,105 Boss 302 with the optional Recaro seats, and a Torsen limited-slip differential comes along. That makes the Boss a solid daily driver and fantastic track-day car. Add the dealer-installed TracKey and the powertrain control computer will deliver quicker throttle action and adds a two-stage launch control system for harder initial acceleration. Go for the $6,995 Laguna Seca package and a bunch of track equipment is added while the rear seat disappears in favor of a stiffening brace. Forget any other Mustang, even those with Shelby in their names. This new Boss 302 is the best one yet.Gardena, Calif.</text></article>

Ms. Rowley, who has a boutique here on the east end of Long Island, spends summer weekends with her husband, Bill Powers, at the surf shack she bought in 1999. “We wake up and we surf, and then we wakeboard, and we ride bikes and we play tennis,” she said. “We just go from activity to activity. And then there’s stuff at the store all the time.” On this Sunday afternoon, Ms. Rowley was wearing a nautical striped top, cut-off jeans and a colorful hat. The activity of the moment? Tracking down a Mexican food truck called the Montaco. “It’s a pink truck,” she said excitedly, before changing into a print dress and hopping into Mr. Powers’s red 1971 Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible. They headed for Ditch Plains, a beach the Montaco was known to frequent. The Cougar, whose lines emphasize the prominent rear fenders, looks a bit like a muscle car. But the grandiose ambitions of the 1970s can be seen in its long hood and in the wide span of its grille and headlights. Based on the Ford Mustang platform, the Cougar strived to be more of a luxury car. In its advertisements, Mercury said the Cougar was “inspired by classic European road cars.” But Mr. Powers’s car, one of around 1,700 XR-7 convertibles built in 1971, was still capable of rumbling off the line. “I think it has a 351 Cleveland,” he said, describing the car’s V-8 engine. Ms. Rowley gave him the Cougar on his first Father’s Day. They saw the car in a showroom in Palm Springs, Calif., and Ms. Rowley secretly bought it and shipped it to New York. At the time, the couple rented their weekend cars. When Mr. Powers went to the garage in Manhattan, he expected to pick up the usual rental. “They drive it down, and it’s really loud,” Ms. Rowley said, grinning as she recounted the car’s delivery. “The guy just turns it off and hands Bill the key.” It wasn’t the first time Ms. Rowley had picked up an old car on an impulse. She once bought a 1964 Ford Galaxie on her way into a concert. “I was walking through the parking lot, and I saw a sign in the window with the phone number,” she said. “So I called the number. And the person was in the concert. I went in. We met and made a deal, and I got the car a couple of days later.” Before the Galaxie, Ms. Rowley had a 1972 Porsche 911 with a sunroof — and its share of problems. “The gas pedal would get so hot,” she said. “I don’t know what was wrong, but it would get so hot that I would have burns on the bottom of my foot. I had to wear one boot in the summer to drive.” Eventually, the Porsche’s floor rotted out. “This friend of ours who deals in vintage cars said if I had gone over a bump, the whole bottom could’ve dropped out,” Ms. Rowley said. “It would be like a Flintstones car.” Mr. Powers, who used to own an old International Scout, said the family — they have two daughters — originally drove the Mercury from the city. But a frightening experience squelched that. The Cougar broke down on the underpass from the Long Island Expressway to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. “It just died there and there’s no shoulder,” he said. The alternator belt had snapped. “There were no real hazards on it,” he said, referring to the four-way flashers. “Cynthia was calling AAA.” Mr. Powers continued: “Finally the guy showed up. And he said he was going to go on break, but that a woman had called saying there was an emergency and there was another woman screaming in the background.” Mr. Powers paused, and his wife laughed. “He was screaming and freaking out,” she said, as Mr. Powers smiled his admission. “That’s when we decided it was probably best that it just lives out here,” he said. Arriving at the Ditch Plains beach, Mr. Powers surveyed the mostly empty parking lot. “O.K., I’m not seeing the Montaco truck,” he said. “Bummer,” Ms. Rowley said. Mr. Powers turned the Mercury around, back onto the Montauk Highway. 1 2 Next Page »MONTAUK, N.Y.</text></article>

Introduced by his uncharacteristically effusive host as a “hero” and the man “responsible for rescuing the Ford Motor Company from the brink of bankruptcy,” Mr. Mulally took his seat with a smile and a wave to the audience and, beyond it, the country Mr. Mulally hoped to sell on the Focus Electric, a purely electric compact car due in showrooms in 2012. The conversation began in autobiographical cruise control, as the men swapped remembrances of early jobs bagging groceries and delivering newspapers. Mr. Mulally, at Mr. Letterman’s urging, then talked about his 37 years of experience in the aviation industry, specifically at Boeing. “Nearly 6 billion people have traveled on the 737,” said Mr. Letterman, to the applause of the audience. After a few minutes, the perfunctory give-and-take was steered not so deftly by Mr. Letterman into the car world. Mr. Mulally described the opportunity extended by William Clay Ford Jr., the automaker’s chairman, to lead Ford as his chance “to serve a second American global icon.” Mr. Letterman then pointed out that Ford weathered the global financial crisis without “government bailout money.” Cue a clapping audience and a beaming auto executive. “When I joined Ford five years ago, Dave, clearly we needed to move very quickly to a different strategy,” said Mr. Mulally. “We decided together to get focused on the Ford brand and divested all the other ones.” During Mr. Mulally’s tenure, Ford sold its Jaguar-Land Rover and Volvo divisions, closed its Mercury brand and significantly divested itself of its holdings in Mazda. Mr. Mulally sidestepped a question as to why other domestic automakers could not follow Ford’s example, before leading Mr. Letterman on a tour of the Focus Electric hatchback, which has a driving range of 80 miles, Mr. Mulally said. Sliding behind the wheel, Mr. Letterman drove the car from one side of the stage to the other. Mr. Mulally’s sales pitch was on target, but the shared moments of schtick were flat and felt scripted. The appearance felt like a car commercial, which is probably what it was meant to be.</text></article>

Although Ford previously insisted the condition presented no unreasonable risk to safety, it agreed to recall about 1.1 million pickup trucks because metal straps cradling the fuel tank may rust, allowing the tank to break free and drag on the road. The automaker is recalling fewer than half of the vehicles originally investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That investigation, begun late last year, ultimately was expanded to cover 2.7 million pickups nationwide, but Ford said it was recalling only vehicles sold or registered in states where road salt is used heavily. This is a geographic recall, something that N.H.T.S.A. has allowed for decades over the objections of consumer and auto-safety advocates, who say that automakers are allowed to save money by recalling fewer vehicles and could miss vehicles that should be covered. “Our investigation is still open, but we’re satisfied with the steps Ford has taken,” wrote Karen Aldana, an agency spokeswoman, in an e-mail Tuesday. The vehicles being recalled are the 1997–2003 F-150; 2004 F-150 Heritage; 1997–99 F-250 with a gross vehicle weight under 8,500 pounds; and 2002–3 Lincoln Blackwood. The states in which the recall applies are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia also is included. Asked whether Ford would assist consumers in nonaffected states — a measure that other automakers, like Nissan, have undertaken — Wes Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, wrote in an e-mail that those customers should contact their dealer. As for why Ford changed its stance and decided to recall the vehicles after insisting there was not a problem, Mr. Sherwood wrote that the company saw “an increasing number of complaints alleging this condition” after the agency upgraded its investigation in May. “We also received reports of a couple of vehicle fires,” he added. “We are aware of eight incidents alleging sparks or fires, three of which led to vehicle fires and one injury. The others self-extinguished or were put out by onlookers.” At the time that the agency opened its investigation, Ford said the rate of strap failure was “remarkably low” and “the majority (over 80 percent) of reports of strap fracture that were identified make no mention of any resulting fuel leak.” But in May, the agency upgraded that inquiry, making clear that it did not accept Ford’s conclusion. The agency said it learned of 243 cases in which gas tanks broke free and dragged on the ground. In one of those cases, a fire destroyed the vehicle, although there were no injuries, according to Ford. There were nine reports of the dragging tanks causing sparks. “When the tank drops, it remains attached to the vehicle only by the fuel filler hose and/or supply lines, or in rare instances, by the skid plate, if present,” investigators wrote in their report posted on the agency’s Web site in May. “This raises the possibility that the weight of the dropped tank could sufficiently strain the hoses and fittings to cause separation and fuel leaks between those components,” it continued. “The fire hazard created by the leaking gasoline is increased by the possible presence of sparks created by the metal tank being dragged along the road.” On July 29, Ford sent a letter to the safety agency informing it of its plan for a recall.</text></article>

Ms. Dunning brought the car to the Concours d’Élegance of America, held in her hometown of Plymouth, Mich., this past weekend. For an innocent little country gal, as she described herself, Margaret Dunning was a rock star at Sunday’s Concours d’Élégance of America, where the 101-year-old showed the Packard she has owned for six decades. “From the time she manhandled that thing into position, tough steering and all, she had a mob around her wherever she went,” said James McCarter, the event’s executive director, in a telephone interview. “It was unbelievable.” Ms. Dunning and her cream-color 1930 Packard 740 roadster were featured in an article in the Automobiles section on July 10. The Packard was one of 331 entries in the affair, until this year called the Meadow Brook Concours d’Élégance and held in suburban Rochester. Mr. McCarter said more than 10,000 people attended the event, up 20 percent from last year. Although Ms. Dunning’s Packard was not one of the winners, its owner had a blast, even tarrying for the evening afterglow. “All the attention was a little embarrassing, but it was wonderful seeing people that I’ve known for 40, 50, 60 years,” said Ms. Dunning in an telephone interview, after sleeping in a bit. “I couldn’t believe it, all the following me around. I was very tired last night, but it was a happy tired. The whole thing was very gratifying.” She was happy the venue was her beloved Plymouth, where she has lived in the same house since she was 13. “What a great event to have in our own backyard,” Ms. Dunning said. “The setting was magnificent.” Sweltering heat, however, threatened to rival her luminosity. She drank plenty of water and found relief under tents and an abundance of trees. “And they had so many cars to shuttle us around, which was a godsend since it was so hot,” she said. “All those volunteers were really just so nice. Their purple shirts were like little dots of sunshine. They have a bouquet coming.” Ms. Duning wore a gray pantsuit to complement the Packard’s red interior, she said, and was accompanied to the concours by two friends. “It purred like a kitten,” she said of the car’s performance during the short trek. “But I got kidded about that mile and a half. They told me that must have been quite a struggle.” Once she got there, she was happy about the level of participation. “It was a thrill to see that the auto industry is alive and perking,” said Ms. Dunning, whose parents were friends of Henry Ford when she lived on a farm in neighboring Redford. “Some of those old-timers even have patents on car parts.” Ms. Dunning, who never married, has been driving since she was 8, starting with her family’s Overland touring car and advancing to tractors and a Model T Ford. In addition to the Packard, her garage is stocked with two classic Cadillacs, a 1931 Ford Model A and her everyday car, a 2003 Cadillac DeVille. She is anticipating driving her 1966 DeVille Aug. 20 in the Woodward Dream Cruise, suburban Detroit’s rolling tribute to classic and antique cars. The Packard soon gets transported to the Gilmore Car Museum, about 125 miles west of Detroit, where it is scheduled to be displayed through the weekend. Ms. Dunning also has a 1906 Model N and a 1930 convertible Cadillac DeVille there. Her Detroit-built Packard, which she has owned since 1949, has an inline 8-cylinder engine, black fenders and a rumble seat and storage compartment in back. From 1899 to its demise in 1958, Packard, a luxury brand, introduced many innovations, including the modern steering wheel and the V-12 passenger car engine. “That car’s my love, and it’s all about sharing,” said Ms. Dunning, a philanthropist who has workedin real estate, banking and retail. “That’s why I’m active with them. It’s what these cars are for.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/business/carmakers-back-strict-new-rules-for-gas-mileage.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Carmakers Back Strict New Rules for Gas Mileage<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — Four years ago, the American auto industry was so opposed to higher fuel economy standards that executives of Detroit camped out in Washington in an unsuccessful bid to undercut them.On Friday, when President Obama announced even stricter standards — in fact, the largest increase in mileage requirements since the government began regulating consumption of gasoline by cars in the 1970s — the chief executives of Detroit’s Big Three were in Washington again. But this time they were standing in solidarity with the president, who was also surrounded by some of Detroit’s highest-tech — and most fuel-efficient — new vehicles. While the American carmakers, as well as their Asian rivals, once argued against even minimal increases in government fuel rules, they are acquiescing without protest to an increase to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, from the current 27 miles per gallon. The new standards are seen by the Obama administration as critical to reducing oil consumption and cutting consumer expenses at the pump, and the White House made it clear to Detroit executives that the changes were coming and they needed to cooperate. It is an extraordinary shift in the relationship between the companies and Washington. But a lot has happened in the last four years, notably the $80 billion federal bailout of General Motors, Chrysler and scores of their suppliers, which removed any itch for a politically charged battle from the carmakers. And the auto companies have gotten a lot better at building popular small cars that are fuel efficient — thanks to gas-electric hybrids and advances in battery technology — and consumers are responding. Six of the 10 best-selling vehicles in America are small or midsize cars, and one of the most popular pickup models on the market is a Ford F-Series with a high-mileage, six-cylinder engine. Still, the industry’s meek acceptance of what are considered extremely challenging fuel-economy goals is a marked retreat from years past, when the companies argued that consumers would not be willing to pay for the technology needed to meet higher mileage requirements. “The auto companies’ level of vitriol and rhetoric has changed,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a group that works to mitigate global warming. “We welcome all epiphanies.” The new mind-set in Detroit has been helped by some give and take on the government’s side. G.M., Ford and Chrysler pressed for less onerous mileage goals for their profitable pickup trucks and got them. And the administration agreed to revisit the new requirements halfway through their course, with the possibility of adjusting them. In the end, though, Detroit was faced with an undeniable political reality: there was no graceful way to say no to an administration that just two years ago came to its aid financially. “This was no time to fight these regulations,” said one Detroit executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the closed-door negotiations. “And you’re starting to see these fundamental shifts in the market that play a huge role in this,” the executive said in advance of Friday's announcement. Environmental groups find themselves in the unusual position of lauding the automakers for making fuel economy a priority in virtually all their newest products, from the tiniest subcompact to the heaviest pickup. “These proposed standards can be met using well-known technologies such as better engines, lower-cost hybrids and electric cars,” said Roland Hwang, transportation program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The proposal introduced by the president calls for a 5 percent annual increase in fuel economy for cars from 2017 to 2025. The gains are more modest for the light-truck category, which includes sport utility vehicles — 3.5 percent a year through 2021, and then 5 percent annually in the next four years. The standards announced four years ago run through 2016, requiring a corporate average of 36 miles per gallon by then. Over all, the new standards will require a 54.5 miles per gallon corporate average for 2025. That standard will be made more easily achievable by credits that automakers can earn by producing battery-powered vehicles, hybrids and alternative-fuel models. Details of how the credits will work have not yet been made public, but the intention is to encourage the development of cars with far lower emissions. Initially, the White House floated a much more aggressive target of 62 miles per gallon by 2025. It reduced that twice before agreeing on the final number. 1 2 Next Page » Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.DETROIT — Four years ago, the American auto industry was so opposed to higher fuel economy standards that executives of Detroit camped out in Washington in an unsuccessful bid to undercut them.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/opinion/detroit-the-union-and-improving-times.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Detroit, the Union and Improving Times<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>Detroit’s automakers have rebounded since the dismal days of 2009, when Washington steered General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy proceedings on the taxpayers’ dime. Sales of cars and light trucks have slowed slightly recently, but they are still expected to hit 13 million this year, up from 10 million in 2009. The carmakers posted a combined profit of $6 billion in the first quarter of the year. This week, the automakers kicked off the first round of contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers since the government bailout. Both sides seem serious about finding a reasonable compromise. We hope that attitude survives as the parties stake out their positions. While the U.A.W. must refrain from extreme demands, Detroit’s automakers must remember that their rebound would not have been possible without deep concessions by the union. It is time for them to start giving back to their workers. In the last contract talks four years ago, the union agreed that newly hired workers would earn about half the $29 an hour made by the existing work force. As car sales plummeted in 2008, the unions made further concessions, including giving up cost-of-living increases, dental coverage and the “jobs bank” that allowed laid-off workers to keep drawing most of their wages. Detroit is right to insist that its labor costs remain competitive with those at nonunion foreign carmakers across the South. The U.A.W. acknowledges this fact. Right now, labor costs at Chrysler — $49 an hour in salaries and benefits, according to the Center for Automotive Research — are even lower than Toyota’s and Honda’s. Labor costs at Ford and G.M. are still higher than at the nonunion shops. Growing profits at all three should allow them to give something back — perhaps through merit bonuses or a bigger share in future profits. They could also make commitments of new work in unionized plants as demand recovers and they need to add capacity. Together with the transfer of retiree health care payments to a union-run fund, U.A.W. concessions have reduced average labor costs at the three Detroit carmakers by some $20 an hour in the last four years. Every new hire at the lower wage will further reduce average labor costs. The companies are certainly willing to reward their top executives. Alan Mulally, Ford’s chief executive earned a compensation package worth $26.5 million last year. General Motors is partially owned by the federal government and faces executive pay restrictions. Dan Akerson, chief executive since September 2010, still got $2.5 million for those four months. Chrysler is now controlled by Fiat. Its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, received no salary from Chrysler last year but got roughly $2.9 million worth of Chrysler shares, on top of $4.8 million from Fiat. Carmakers should also be willing to sweeten the deal for their workers.Detroit’s automakers have rebounded since the dismal days of 2009, when Washington steered General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy proceedings on the taxpayers’ dime.

The investment is Ford’s latest push into fast-growing markets in Asia and Africa, where it lags other big automakers. The company’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said this year that Ford aimed to get a third of its sales from these two regions, about double what it was getting now. Ford has been adding factories, rolling out new models and opening dealerships in countries including South Africa and Thailand. India, where passenger car sales grew 29 percent in the last fiscal year, to 2.5 million, is expected to become a critical market over the next decade, Ford executives said Wednesday. Ford expects a “dramatic spike up in India” by the middle of the decade as incomes increase, said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Asia Pacific and Africa, during a meeting with reporters in Delhi. Ford is investing in the state of Gujarat, whose chief minister, Narendra Modi, has drawn international attention for his business-friendly attitude. But Mr. Modi, a longtime Hindu nationalist, also remains one of India’s most polarizing politicians because of allegations that he played a role in 2002 riots that left more than 1,000 dead, mostly Muslims. Ford executives said they had chosen Gujarat because of its probusiness environment and because it had ports, which could allow the company to export from India in the future and to diversify from its existing Indian operations in the south. “These are long-term investments,” said Mr. Hinrichs. Ford is “trying to make the right long-term business decisions for multidecade investments, which will last far beyond any one political career.” Ford plans to build two new factories in Sanand, Gujarat, by 2014 that will employ 5,000 and have the capacity to assemble 240,000 cars and build 270,000 engines. Ford already has operations in the southeastern state of Tamil Nadu that employ 5,000 in manufacturing and 5,000 in back-office work and information technology. Growth in India’s booming passenger car market may outstrip that of China’s this year, as the Chinese government tries to slow its sector’s growth, removing subsidies and incentives for new car purchases. Ford is not alone in channeling more capital into India. The Toyota Motor Corporation said on Wednesday that it would invest an additional $220 million in the country, to double production capacity to 310,000 units by 2013. Ford’s performance in India has lagged its performance in other markets. The company sells only 3 percent of all passenger cars in India, compared, for example, with 10 percent of Brazil’s cars. Ford was the only Detroit automaker to emerge from the 2009 recession without going into bankruptcy. And on Tuesday it reported its ninth consecutive quarterly profit, although its rebound was showing signs of slowing. “Because we came out of the crisis much stronger financially, we now can make long-term investments, and that is what we are doing,” Mr. Hinrichs said.NEW DELHI — The Ford Motor Company plans to invest almost $1 billion in northwest India, building factories to make nearly a quarter of a million cars a year, company executives said on Wednesday.

Ford was the only Detroit automaker to emerge from the 2009 recession without going into bankruptcy. And on Tuesday it reported its ninth consecutive quarterly profit, although its rebound was showing signs of slowing. “Because we came out of the crisis much stronger financially, we now can make long-term investments, and that is what we are doing,” Mr. Hinrichs said.</text></article>

But it was the ninth consecutive quarterly profit for Ford, which was to begin contract talks with the United Automobile Workers union this week. With first-half profit totaling $4.95 billion, the carmaker remains ahead of its pace in 2010, when it earned $4.7 billion in the first half and $6.6 billion for the full year. “We delivered very good second-quarter results, while growing the business globally and serving more customers in every region,” Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a statement. “Despite an uncertain business environment, we further strengthened our balance sheet and continued to invest for the future.” The second-quarter profit, equal to 59 cents a share, compares with earnings of $2.6 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2010. Revenue increased 13 percent, to $35.5 billion, and sales rose 7 percent. Automotive operating margins fell to 7 percent from 9.1 percent in the period a year earlier. Ford’s operating profit in North America was flat, at $1.9 billion. Operations in South America, Europe and Asia Pacific-Africa were profitable, but each of those regions fared worse than a year earlier. Ford said it paid down its debt by $2.6 billion during the second quarter, to $14 billion. It ended the quarter with $22 billion in its cash reserves, an increase of $700 million from three months earlier. Excluding special items, including personnel reductions and winding down the Mercury brand in the United States, Ford’s pretax operating profit was $2.88 billion, or 65 cents a share. That figure beat Wall Street’s consensus forecast of 60 cents a share, but is below the operating profit of $2.94 billion, or 68 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Investors will be closely watching negotiations with the U.A.W. to assess their effect on Ford’s profit potential in the future. The U.A.W.’s contract with each of the three Detroit carmakers expires in September. Ford was not able to obtain no-strike pledges from the union, unlike General Motors and Chrysler, and the more money it makes, the more that workers have been clamoring for a rollback of the concessions they took in recent years. Mr. Mulally, on a conference call with analysts Tuesday, said the results did not suggest that Ford could acquiesce to demands for higher pay and benefits. Instead, they show “what can we do together to continue to improve the competitiveness of the business,” he said. Ford’s chief financial officer, Lewis W. K. Booth, said the contract talks were a major hurdle to regaining an investment-grade credit rating, which would reduce the company’s borrowing costs. Ford lost its investment-grade rating in 2005; its credit is currently rated two notches below that level by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings and three levels below that by Standard and Poor’s. “We’re doing everything we can to improve our business, and at some point the ratings agencies will recognize that,” Mr. Booth told reporters at Ford’s headquarters. “We expect to get to investment grade sooner rather than later.” The second-quarter profit is less than the $2.55 billion Ford earned in the first quarter. Ford previously warned that the first-quarter profit probably would be its largest of the year because of rising commodity and structural costs. Mr. Booth said prices were climbing for many of the commodities Ford uses, including steel, plastics, copper and aluminum. The company was on track with its previous projection that it would have to pay about $2 billion more for materials this year than in 2010, he said. Ford already has raised prices across its lineup three times this year, in part to compensate for the higher commodity costs. Ford is the only one of the three Detroit carmakers to survive the recession of 2009 without filing for bankruptcy protection and taking a federal bailout.

Both companies said that revenues increased in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of this year, but profits dropped partly because of higher costs. In Chrysler’s case, the company posted a loss as a result of paying off government loans associated with its 2009 bailout and bankruptcy. In addition, the mediocre results underscored market conditions in which demand had fallen short of expectations. Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive, said, “2011 was originally slated to be a recovery year.” She added, “Instead, it’s just become sort of a get-through-it kind of year.” Some of the slowdown can be attributed to product shortages in the wake of the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which disrupted the automakers in that country. However, weak employment numbers and high vehicle prices have also contributed to the lower sales. Through the first six months of the year, overall United States sales have been running at a rate below 13 million for the full year. While that represents a solid improvement over the 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, it is not yet the recovery the industry had hoped for. “The market is not as buoyant as one could possibly expect,” said Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and its parent company, the Italian automaker Fiat. Chrysler reported revenues in the second quarter of $13.7 billion, up from $13.1 billion in the first three months of the year. However, it reported a loss of $370 million, in contrast to a profit of $116 million in the first quarter. The automaker would have reported a $181 million profit in the second quarter, but had to take a $551 million one-time charge for costs associated with the repayment of loans from the Treasury Department and the Canadian government. Ford also reported higher revenue in the second quarter than in the first — $35.5 billion versus $33.1 billion. But its net income dropped to $2.4 billion, compared with $2.55 billion. The lower profits were partly a result of higher prices for parts and materials, as well as Ford’s continued efforts to pay down debt and invest in new products. Ford’s chief financial officer, Lewis Booth, said the overall United States market continued to be hurt by spotty demand and cautious spending by consumers. “We never really expected to see a drastic recovery this year,” said Mr. Booth, adding that Ford still projected the full year to produce sales of 13 million to 13.5 million vehicles for the entire industry. He said consumer demand was “getting pent up,” but declined to predict when buyers might return to new car showrooms in larger numbers. “Employment levels are one of the biggest things” needed for the market to improve, he said. Mr. Marchionne said Chrysler was not expecting sales of more than 12.7 million vehicles for the year. The challenge for Chrysler, he said, is to continue to bring out fresh products that allow it to gain share in a bland sales environment. “We have never been overly optimistic about 2011,” he said. “The car business will not have a tremendous year, but it won’t have a lousy year either.” Industry analysts said companies were now resigned to the fact that the comeback was unfolding more slowly than predicted after miserable years in 2009 and 2010. IHS Automotive, the research firm, is also projecting 12.7 million sales for the full year. Given that slow pace, the financial results by the Detroit companies is somewhat of a surprise. “It’s a minor miracle that they’re doing as well as they are,” said Ms. Lindland, the analyst. General Motors, the largest American automaker, will not report its second-quarter results until early August. While they grapple with slow market conditions, Ford and Chrysler are taking steps to improve their operations and position themselves for better times. Ford reduced its automotive debt by $2.6 billion in the second quarter, to $14 billion, and increased its cash reserves by $700 million to $22 billion. Chrysler has now paid off its entire $7.6 billion in loans to the American and Canadian governments, and is poised to merge more operations with Fiat, which owns a 53 percent stake in it. Mr. Marchionne said Tuesday that he expected soon to announce a major management reorganization that would better integrate Fiat and Chrysler. “What is important for us is that we start acting as a team that manages the business on a global scale,” he said. Both companies, as well as G.M., are also opening talks this week on new contracts with the United Automobile Workers. Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said Tuesday that the negotiations represented an opportunity for the company and the union to show “what we can do together to continue to improve the competitiveness of our business.”DETROIT — Just when the American auto industry appeared ready to hit a higher gear, its comeback has shifted into neutral.</text></article>

In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • McLaren will bring three of its MP4-12C GT3 cars to the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium for this weekend’s Total 24 Hours of Spa race. According to the brand, a road car-derived McLaren has not competed in a 24-hour race since the F1 GTR ran the Le Mans circuit in 1995. The 12C GT3 car, which raced earlier this month at the British GT Championship, is undergoing competition testing before deliveries of the $508,000 car to privateer teams commence for the 2012 GT3 season. (McLaren) • Fiat is expected to show its high-performance Abarth version of the 500 subcompact at the Los Angeles auto show in November, the company announced on Twitter. The European-specification Abarth offers two power plant options: a 135-horsepower engine and a 170-horsepower engine, each of which have been on sale in Europe for a few years. It is not yet known which, if either, engine will be in the American Abarth. The introduction of an Abarth 500 was confirmed by Laura Soave, the brand manager for Fiat in America, in February. (Car and Driver) • Infiniti teased its coming JX crossover, which is scheduled to make its debut during the Pebble Beach collector car festivities next month, in a Web preview. The JX is expected to go on sale in spring 2012. Some styling cues, particularly the S-curve in the car’s D-pillar, reference the Essence concept first shown at the Geneva auto show in 2009, and more recently the Etherea concept at the 2011 Geneva show. (Inside Line) • Having unveiled its 481-horsepower C63 AMG coupe at the New York auto show in April, Mercedes-Benz has opted to squeeze more power from the car’s 6.2-liter big-block V-8, showing a Black Series edition of the high-performance coupe at Sunday’s German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. The engine’s displacement is stroked to 6.3 liters, and horsepower is bumped to 510. Pricing will be announced closer to its arrival in showrooms this fall. (Motor Trend) • On Tuesday, Ford posted its ninth consecutive quarterly profit, reporting $2.4 billion in earnings for the second quarter. Though the figure represented a 7 percent decline over the company’s performance a year ago, its first-half profits for 2011, at $4.95 billion, remained ahead of its pace for the first half of 2010, when it earned $4.7 billion.

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — In a mall parking lot here, I was trying to back a new Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, which I review in Sunday’s Automobiles section, out of a spot. Two huge S.U.V.’s were parked on either side of me, blocking my field of view of oncoming vehicles. Backing slowly, an alarm suddenly warned me of approaching cross traffic. The alert saved me from a collision with a careless, speeding driver. The system, bundled on my test car in a $5,695 package of technical and convenience features, is rather new, especially in its current form. Less expensive equipment packages include the system as well. The technology is not unique to the MKZ, or even to Lincoln. It is available in a variety of Fords as well as in vehicles from other makes, like the Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan, reviewed in The Times last month. It is part of a larger system of driver vision aids that includes blind spot monitoring, parking sensors and a backup camera. The camera on the MKZ projects a particularly high-resolution image, in color, on one side of the rearview mirror. The system was originally developed by Volvo, when it was part of the Ford Motor Company, and made its debut on the 2006 S80 sedan. Ford retained the technology after it sold Volvo to Geely in 2010. Initially, the Volvo-sourced system included only the blind-spot recognition capability, where a warning light illuminates on or near the exterior side-view mirrors when a car is traveling next to you, at about the rear quarter panel area. This area is known as a driver’s blind spot because it is outside the range of peripheral vision, but not far enough behind to be seen in most mirrors. Ford has added additional components, like that fine camera, parking sensor alarms and now, the cross-traffic alert. This was my favorite feature on the 2011 MKZ Hybrid, and not just because it prevented me from having to call my insurance company (again). It’s a clever idea, and the first occasion where its usefulness was so emphatically demonstrated to me. I see it becoming a standard feature on many vehicles in coming years. Such a system, if it had been around years ago, likely would have saved my beloved Schwinn Phantom cruiser, parked outside our garage, from its cruel fate under the wheels of my father’s 1957 Ford F-100.</text></article>

After a period of plunging sales, bankruptcies and government bailouts, the union is hoping to regain some of its lost jobs, reopen closed factories, and increase the pay of its 111,000 members, some of whom are being paid half as much for entry-level jobs as other workers under a two-tier wage arrangement. But those goals run against the priorities of Detroit’s Big Three automakers, who want to hold the line on costs and further close the gap in productivity with foreign-owned factories in the United States, which employ much cheaper nonunion workers. And while contract negotiations are always prickly, this round has a particularly prominent backdrop: the long shadow of the Obama administration, which bailed out both General Motors and Chrysler and shepherded the automakers through Chapter 11. As part of the bailouts, the U.A.W. agreed to no-strike clauses at both companies and to submit to arbitration in the event that a contract could not be reached. That leaves Ford, the most successful of the three, as the only possible strike target should the talks fall apart. But the U.A.W. benefited greatly from the federal intervention, and Ford has been hailed by consumers for surviving the recession without financial help from taxpayers. For the union to strike Ford or enter a contentious arbitration process could reignite debate over the bailouts and prove politically embarrassing to President Obama as he readies next year’s re-election campaign. Bob King, the union’s president, said in an interview that he was “morally and legally” bound to get the best deal possible for his membership, regardless of the political consequences. “But if we end up with a strike or arbitration,” he acknowledged, “I’d feel like I failed in many ways.” The union’s four-year contracts with G.M., Ford and Chrysler expire in mid-September. Indications are that the U.A.W. will be aggressively seeking better profit-sharing, job guarantees, and wage increases for lower-paid, entry-level workers. “Our members have sacrificed a lot,” Mr. King said. “We’re trying to figure out a path that gives members more income but doesn’t disadvantage the companies.” All three automakers are making money and expanding sales. But they are loath to do anything that hurts their newfound competitiveness or adds costs to their streamlined manufacturing operations. The Big Three earned nearly $6 billion in combined profits during the first quarter of this year, and paid sizable profit-sharing checks this spring based on their 2010 results. “We all know that there are things we can’t do to go back to how we were,” said Cathy Clegg, head of G.M. labor relations, during an appearance Monday at a truck plant in Flint, Mich. “We need to see a pretty healthy market recovery before we start turning factories back on.” All three companies have drastically cut production and jobs in recent years to better match their smaller market shares. The U.A.W. currently has less than half the number of employees at G.M., Ford and Chrysler than just five years ago. The pain of losing so many jobs is still fresh in the minds of the surviving workers, said Mr. King, who was elected president last year after previously running the U.A.W.’s Ford division. “They want stability,” he said. “They want to know they’ll be working next week and next year, and that they will be able to send their kids to college.” But while preserving jobs is paramount, Mr. King said that workers deserved a bigger share of the economic benefits of Detroit’s turnaround. While Mr. King does not expect across-the-board wage increases, he said the automakers should improve their profit-sharing formulas, something some auto executives have indicated a willingness to consider. He added that new entry-level workers, who are paid about $15 an hour compared with $28 for regular U.A.W. members, deserve pay increases in the new contract. “I don’t think you should be working in the auto industry at poverty-level wages when the companies are doing well,” he said. 1 2 Next Page »DETROIT — American carmakers and the United Automobile Workers union open contract talks next week with a common task of preserving the comeback of an industry that was on the verge of collapse just two years ago.</text></article>

Lee/The New York TimesThe Ford Transit Connect, photographed in Times Square for an article that ran in The Times in April. Because New York’s anointed Taxi of Tomorrow won’t be here tomorrow, the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission approved a measure on Thursday that would allow fleet owners to put Ford Transit Connect vans, the Ford Taurus and the Chevrolet Impala on the streets as yellow cabs. The Transit Connect Taxi, which The Times featured in April, and the sedans are expected to arrive late this summer as taxi fleet owners replace worn vehicles, primarily Ford Crown Victorias. Allan Fromberg, a spokesman for the commission, said in a telephone interview that there were 13,237 licensed taxis in the city and that about 2,500 of them were replaced annually with new models. In May, the city formally selected the Nissan NV200 minivan to be its next taxicab for 10 years after it arrived. Mr. Fromberg said the Fords and the Chevrolet would be used as “interim cabs” until the Nissan arrives, which he expected would be in November 2013. The new cabs will be allowed to remain in service, even after the NV200 arrives, until they are no longer roadworthy. The NV200 vans are to be equipped with a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine, and the option exists to convert them into plug-in hybrids. The Ford Transit Connect first went into service as a taxi in Boston late last year and subsequently was added to fleets in Chicago, Los Angeles and Orlando, according to a Ford statement. More than 100 have been sold to taxi fleets, the company said. The conventional van uses a 4-cylinder engine and automatic transmission, a combination that delivers a combined 23 miles per gallon. The van is available as an electric vehicle for fleets and can be converted to run on liquefied propane gas or compressed natural gas. The Transit Connect, the NV200 and an entry by Karsan, a Turkish automaker, were the three finalists in the Taxi of Tomorrow project, which was announced in 2007 and sponsored by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. In 2009, the commission issued an open call for manufacturers to submit their designs for a new, purpose-built taxi for New York to replace the Crown Victoria, which Ford discontinued this year.</text></article>

The Focus is no longer Ford’s smallest car in the United States. The Mexican-built Fiesta now holds that spot, sliding the Michigan-built Focus upscale in features and size. The latest model is available as either a sedan or a four-door hatchback. With an overall length of 178.5 inches, the sedan is about 3.5 inches longer than the old model. The four-door hatchback is 171.6 inches long, 3.1 inches longer than the hatchback that Ford discontinued after the 2007 model year. The least expensive Focus is the S sedan with a 5-speed manual transmission, which has a starting price of $17,295. The SE hatchback, also with the manual, starts at $18,995. The top Focus is the Titanium hatchback at $23,495, but a self-indulgent buyer can pile on options all the way to $28,000. Ford boasts that it is offering some features not available from competitors like the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla. The most notable is a system that automatically parallel-parks the car. The least expensive model on which this is available is the SEL, on which it is a $695 option, but because it requires buying other options the total cost is $3,085. I tested an SE sedan, which is reasonably well equipped for the base price of $18,195. But the test car had more than $5,000 in extras, including cruise control, heated front seats, a 6-speed automatic transmission and a sport package. The window sticker totaled $23,195. Like the original Focus, the 2012 models were developed in Europe. However, most of the work on the PowerShift automatic and the 4-cylinder engine was done in the United States. Greg Burgess, the Focus vehicle engineering manager, said the American model handled almost identically to its Euro-sibling. One difference: all-season tires replaced the high-performance “summer” tires used in Europe. The vehicle I tested had a sport package that includes higher-performance tires and replaces the rear drum brakes with discs. It also had optional 17-inch wheels with 215/50R17 tires. “The suspension tuning is pretty much the same,” Mr. Burgess said. Two things are remarkable about the sport package. One is how quickly the Focus can travel even the most convoluted mountain road, changing direction quickly and displaying impressive adhesion and confidence-inspiring composure. The steering is precise and predictable; the body, which benefits from the inclusion of high-strength steel, feels wonderfully rigid. The other notable benefit is that the ride quality — even on bad roads — remains quite good. Typically, sport suspensions make a car’s passengers suffer for the driver’s fun, but that’s not the case with the Focus. So just as it seems that Ford has hammered a gee-whiz home run, we come to the automatic transmission, expected to be chosen by 90 percent of buyers. Dual-clutch designs are revered for sporty, fast shifts rivaling those of manual transmissions. But Ford has calibrated the PowerShift to maximize fuel economy by seeking the highest gear possible as quickly as possible, which keeps the engine speed low. The gearing is not a problem on the Interstate, but can be aggravating on back roads or in stop-and-go traffic. The transmission is often in the wrong gear at the wrong time, resulting in jerks, pauses and lethargic acceleration. Putting the shifter in the Sport position delays shifts but creates its own problem. Touching the brake while in Sport causes the gearbox to downshift. Some automatic transmissions are programmed to shift to a lower gear if they receive a signal from the steering that the driver is turning. The idea is to provide better acceleration through the turn and onto a straight. But PowerShift doesn’t receive any steering input, so when set to Sport it mindlessly downshifts whenever the driver brakes. The driver can manually select gears by pushing a button on the side of the shift lever. This works reasonably well, but is not convenient and cannot offset the pervasive misbehavior. 1 2 Next Page »TO the long list of things that have gone awry despite the best of intentions, add the 6-speed automatic transmission in the 2012 Ford Focus — an otherwise admirably redesigned compact car.</text></article>

It costs $17,295. To get the SFE package, one must first buy the more expensive SE with the automatic transmission and then add the $495 SFE package. That comes to $19,785. The SFE is rated at 28 m.p.g. in town. To figure out the savings, I went to the government Web site fueleconomy.gov, operated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The site provides not only fuel-economy ratings, but it includes a feature for calculating the cost of driving. To maximize the SFE’s advantage I selected 15,000 miles a year with 80 percent of those on the highway. I set the price of gas at $3.80 a gallon. According to the site’s calculations, the total fuel cost for the SFE came out to $1,541 a year. That, however, was only $186 less than the base Focus with the 5-speed manual. Because the least expensive Focus with the SFE package costs $2,490 more than the least expensive Focus with a manual transmission, it would take a little more than 13 years to make up the difference. The most favorable comparison would be to figure that the consumer already wants an SE with the automatic transmission. In that case, the additional cost for the SFE package is $495. Using the same fuel-economy calculations, the SFE would save its owner $88 a year. That means it would take about 5.6 years to recoup the extra cost of the higher-mileage version. The SFE includes low-rolling-resistance tires and aerodynamic tweaks to gain an additional 2 m.p.g. on the highway over the SE automatic.ALTHOUGH the 40 miles per gallon highway rating of the Ford Focus with the SFE (Super Fuel Economy) option seems alluring, the economics don’t work for penny pinchers: it could take 13 years to get your money back.</text></article>

In Sunday’s Automobiles section, Christopher Jensen reviews the 2012 Ford Focus, the first all-new Focus since the 2000 model year. Like the Ford Fiesta and the coming C-Max, the Focus is a global car, and its spirited demeanor befits a compact car developed largely in Europe, Mr. Jensen finds: The Focus can travel even the most convoluted mountain road, changing direction quickly and displaying impressive adhesion and confidence-inspiring composure. The steering is precise and predictable; the body, which benefits from the inclusion of high-strength steel, feels wonderfully rigid. Yet however impressive the car’s composure and its evident build quality, a poorly calibrated dual-clutch automatic transmission fitted to Mr. Jensen’s sedan undermines much of the progress made by Ford engineers elsewhere. The transmission is often in the wrong gear at the wrong time, resulting in jerks, pauses and lethargic acceleration. Putting the shifter in the Sport position delays shifts but creates its own problem. Touching the brake while in Sport causes the gearbox to downshift. It would take an utterly oblivious driver not to notice the PowerShift’s problems.

In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • A diesel version of the Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan is expected in American showrooms in 2013, according to a report by The Associated Press. The car, which would be assembled at the Cruze’s primary plant in Lordstown, Ohio, would achieve around 50 m.p.g., comparable to the performance of the current-generation Toyota Prius. Chevrolet produces a turbodiesel version of the Cruze in Australia, but it is not known if the automaker will develop a new engine for the North American market. (AutoWeek) • With dealers running low inventories and production capacity strained, Audi plans to open an assembly plant in North America. Rupert Stadler, chairman of the board of management at Audi AG, was quoted in a report by Automotive News stating that the company would open an engine and transmission plant, with a decision about location to come within three years. Chattanooga, where Volkswagen Group, the Audi parent, builds its Passat sedan for North America, could be a likely choice, according to many analysts. (Chattanooga Times Free Press) • Pete Lawson, the Ford vice president of government affairs, said on Monday that the brand supported a ban on hand-held mobile devices in moving passenger cars. H.R. 2333, also known as the Safe Drivers Act of 2011, would ban mobile devices intended to be used with at least one hand. Ford’s Sync technology includes hands-free calling capability. The automaker previously had backed legislation to ban texting while driving. (The Hill) • BMW plans to purchase the leasing division of ING NV, the Dutch financial services company, for 637 million euros, or roughly $915 million. The sale would increase the German automaker’s presence in the European lease market from its current level of 300,000 contracts under management to 540,000. The deal also would give the brand a larger test group for electric-vehicle platforms currently under development. (The Detroit News) • Kelley Blue Book, the used-car pricing service, expects the values of used fuel-efficient vehicles to fall as much as 15 percent by the end of 2011. Prices for these models at used-car auctions have achieved records amid volatile gasoline prices and shortages of new cars caused by the March earthquake in northeastern Japan. But with production levels normalizing and gas prices stabilizing, the service expects a buyer’s market to return. (Kbb.com)</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/business/ford-sued-over-patents-for-sync-connectivity-system.html?ref=fordmotorcompany">Ford Sued Over Patents for Sync Connectivity System<date>Published: July 7, 2011</date><text>DETROIT — The Ford Motor Company’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, has been fond of saying that Ford is “more than just a car company — we’re also a technology company.”High-tech amenities, like the popular Ford Sync system that lets drivers seamlessly connect their car and mobile phone, have helped bring more customers and huge profits to the automaker. But now a small company in Washington State says it actually developed the technology behind Sync and a handful of safety features that Ford is adding to much of its lineup. The company, Eagle Harbor Holdings, has filed a federal lawsuit against Ford, accusing the carmaker of infringing on seven patents. Although the suit, filed last week, is unlikely to result in Ford being forced to stop putting the features in its vehicles, the carmaker could pay millions of dollars in licensing fees if it loses in court or agrees to settle. Analysts say such cases, commonplace in the high-tech world but not in the auto industry, will be seen more frequently as cars and trucks increasingly become roadworthy computers. “When you start getting into more software in the vehicles you’re going to have this happen a lot more,” Kevin Hamlin, an analyst with the research firm IHS iSuppli, said. “Writing code in software leads to a lot of these suits. It just kind of goes along with the territory.” Ford declined to comment on the suit, saying in an e-mailed statement that officials “have not yet had an opportunity to review the details.” Eagle Harbor’s general counsel, Jeff Harmes, said the company had been in discussions with Ford for six years about licensing its technology to the automaker, but Ford cut off the talks in 2008. The founders of Eagle Harbor, Dan Preston and his son Joseph, are inventors whose previous company, Airbiquity, developed technology licensed by General Motors for its OnStar communication service. Ford currently licenses technology from Airbiquity. “This is a group of engineers with a long track record of developing commercially viable technology,” Mr. Harmes said. In addition to Sync, which Ford developed in a partnership with Microsoft, the technology at issue in the suit includes MyKey, which gives parents the ability to monitor and limit actions by teenage drivers, and several safety features that use sensors. One of the features automatically steers the vehicle into a parallel parking space and another alerts drivers to vehicles in their blind spots and warns of potential collisions when backing out of a parking space. Ford has been highlighting some of the innovations in recent commercials, and about 80 percent of Ford buyers get their vehicle with Sync, a $395 option that responds to voice commands and has been installed on nearly four million vehicles since its introduction in 2007. Sync has been a major contributor to Ford’s improved reputation and increased market share, though a newer offshoot known as MyFord Touch has been panned by Consumer Reports and criticized by buyers in a recent J. D. Power &amp; Associates quality survey. Mr. Harmes said, before filing suit, Eagle Harbor repeatedly told Ford in 2009 and 2010 that it was infringing on the company’s patents. “We would prefer to reach some business settlement with Ford as opposed to continuing the suit,” he said. Eagle Harbor has been in discussions with other automakers and suppliers about its technology but none have agreed to license it yet, Mr. Harmes said. It also is working to commercialize environmental technology, including a method to strip metals from the waste created by coal-fired power plants The company, with just 15 employees and a small office on an island in Puget Sound, would seem to have long odds in taking on Ford. But it is being backed by the Northwater Intellectual Property Fund, an investor in i4i, a Canadian company that was awarded $290 million in patent dispute against Microsoft that was upheld last month by the United States Supreme Court. Katherine E. White, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and an expert on intellectual property litigation, said infringement cases like the one against Ford hinged on whether the technology performed “the same function, in substantially the same way, to get the same result” as the patented concept. She said Ford was in little danger of having to stop offering Sync or the other disputed technology, so its risk was limited to paying royalties, not halting production and losing sales. “Injunctions have become very difficult to get now for companies that don’t make anything,” Ms. White said. “Big companies can afford to pay the damages later. What they can’t afford is to stop producing.” Ford agreed to pay $10.2 million to Robert Kearns, who invented intermittent windshield wipers, in a highly publicized 1990 case; it was the subject of the 2008 film “Flash of Genius.” Mr. Kearns later also received $30 million from Chrysler. About a year ago, Ford settled a longstanding case brought by a Florida company, Paice, that accused Ford of infringing on a 1994 patent for hybrid technology. Ford agreed to license the Paice technology, but the terms were not released publicly. Paice also had sued Toyota, which agreed to license 23 patented technologies.DETROIT — The Ford Motor Company’s chief executive, Alan R.

If young American carbuyers were impressed by vehicles produced by domestic brands in recent years, they certainly didn’t express it with their wallets. The finding comes from a study by TrueCar.com, a data company that tracks vehicle pricing and sales, in which the purchasing habits of four million car buyers from ages 18 to 27 were examined. During 2009 and 2010, the years covered by the study, Toyota’s youth-focused Scion brand proved the most popular choice among the Generation Y, or millennial, demographic. Rounding out the top five were Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan and Volkswagen. Not a single American brand cracked the top 10. “Gen-Y is a very demanding and tech-savvy graphic that is looking for vehicles that are highly contented,” said Kristen Andersson, a TrueCar.com automotive analyst, in a telephone interview. Scion vehicles tend to include features like power windows and locks, a leather-trimmed steering wheel, cruise control and air-conditioning as standard equipment. Ms. Andersson also credits the Japanese brand with tailoring its no-haggle purchasing to the demands of younger car buyers. “They don’t want to be hassled,” she said. “You go in and you know you’re going to get a fair price.” Despite the results, the prevailing trends may not hold. The TrueCar data reflects an overwhelming purchasing trend toward smaller cars. New domestic models like the Chevrolet Cruze and Sonic, as well as the Ford Fiesta and overhauled Focus, are challenging the dominance of Japanese brands in these segments. “I think they should have been worried a couple years ago, but they’ve stepped up their efforts to appeal to Gen-Y,” Ms. Andersson said of domestic automakers. “I definitely see the domestic automakers, in terms of marketing, as appealing to this demographic. They’re making these brands fresh and young and cool. That’s hard to do with a brand that has longstanding heritage.”</text></article>

Although automakers have demonstrated their ability to deliver fuel savings through hybrid technology, they are not delivering on the technology’s promise, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists’ 2011 Hybrid Scorecard. According to the nonprofit organization, automakers are bringing more hybrids to market that are engineered around conventional performance metrics like acceleration, which compromises their environment benefit. Automakers also were chastised for weighing certain hybrids down with features that inflate their cost, keeping the cars beyond the reach of many consumers. This is the second hybrid scorecard issued by the organization, which seeks to determine how well automakers are using hybrid technology. This year, the U.C.S. evaluated 34 hybrids from the 2011-12 model years for their fuel efficiency, environmental improvement, value to the consumer and their forced-feature premium — that is, features bundled specifically on hybrid models that do not directly improve fuel efficiency. On the negative side, only 13 of the 34 hybrids cut more than 25 percent of greenhouse emissions compared with their gasoline engine counterparts. The worst offender, according to the union, was the Volkswagen Touareg hybrid, with less than a 10 percent reduction, an all-time low on the scorecard. The Touareg was singled out as an example of a “muscle” hybrid that emphasized power over fuel efficiency. That said, the scorecard cited more top performers than it did in 2010. In addition to the Toyota Prius, automakers like Ford, Hyundai, Honda and Nissan are using hybrid technology to increase fuel efficiency and decrease tailpipe emissions without imposing significant price premiums for those benefits. The Prius remained the top nonluxury model in the scorecard’s environmental improvement category by emitting 40 percent less greenhouse emissions than comparable nonhybrid models. In the luxury category, the Lincoln MKZ hybrid and Lexus CT200h were cited for similar performance, an achievement the authors attributed to their relatively small gasoline engines. Others scoring high on environmental improvement included the Ford Fusion hybrid, Honda Civic hybrid and Toyota Highlander hybrid. The group noted that nine of the 10 top-selling hybrids from Jan. 1 through April achieved more than 30 miles a gallon and scored above average for environmental improvement and value.

Above, a 2011 MKZ hybrid. Metropolitan Lincoln, a dealership in Garden City, Mich., is closing after more than 50 years of business. Located less than 10 miles from Ford Motor Company headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., the dealership historically has been among the sales leaders for Ford’s Lincoln brand and the discontinued Mercury brand. Ford terminated its Mercury division in 2010, so like most franchises that formerly sold Lincolns and Mercurys, sales volume at Metropolitan was seriously affected. John Obeid, Metropolitan’s managing partner, posted a statement on the dealership’s Web site late last month saying that the Mercury brand had accounted for about 70 percent of the dealership’s new car sales and that the loss of sales volume had been crippling. Mr. Obeid could not be reached for comment. Calls to the dealership on Wednesday did not go through. The closing of Metropolitan Lincoln came just weeks after Ford committed to spending $1 billion over the next four years to improve the Lincoln product line. The commitment was made, according to a report in The Detroit News, in response to Lincoln dealer demands for vehicles that could compete better with Cadillac and Buick, as well as makes from Europe and Japan. Over the first five months of 2011, Lincoln sales were down 7.5 percent relative to their levels over the same period last year, but the brand achieved a 17 percent gain over 2010 numbers for June. “We’ve laid out our plans for the future and the expectations that we have for the brand,” said, Christian Bokich, a Lincoln spokesman, when asked in a telephone interview to comment on the dealership closing. “At the end of the day, the decision of whether or not to stay with Lincoln is that of the individual dealer,” he added. Lincoln’s product line lacks the risky styling and performance-driving orientation of its crosstown rival Cadillac, but Lincoln recently has experienced successes on some fronts. In the J.D. Power &amp; Associates 2011 Vehicle Dependability Study, Lincoln took top honors, knocking Porsche out of the leadership position. In the same organization’s 2011 Initial Quality Study, Lincoln fell to 17th place after finishing eighth in 2010. However, the decline was not related to manufacturing quality, but rather to the MyLincoln Touch in-car telematics system, which many owners had found overly complex and unintuitive.</text></article>
