The Libyan leader’s death diverted attention from a lethal article involving Citigroup that deserved more attention because it helps to explain why many average Americans have expressed support for the Occupy Wall Street movement. The news was that Citigroup had to pay a $285 million fine to settle a case in which, with one hand, Citibank sold a package of toxic mortgage-backed securities to unsuspecting customers — securities that it knew were likely to go bust — and, with the other hand, shorted the same securities — that is, bet millions of dollars that they would go bust.It doesn’t get any more immoral than this. As the Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint noted, in 2007, Citigroup exercised “significant influence” over choosing $500 million of the $1 billion worth of assets in the deal, and the global bank deliberately chose collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, built from mortgage loans almost sure to fail. According to The Wall Street Journal, the S.E.C. complaint quoted one unnamed C.D.O. trader outside Citigroup as describing the portfolio as resembling something your dog leaves on your neighbor’s lawn. “The deal became largely worthless within months of its creation,” The Journal added. “As a result, about 15 hedge funds, investment managers and other firms that invested in the deal lost hundreds of millions of dollars, while Citigroup made $160 million in fees and trading profits.” Citigroup, which is under new and better management now, settled the case without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. James Stewart, a business columnist for The Times, noted that Citigroup’s flimflam made “Goldman Sachs mortgage traders look like Boy Scouts. In settling its fraud charges for $550 million last year, Goldman was accused by the S.E.C. of being the middleman in a similar deal, allowing the hedge fund manager John Paulson to help choose the mortgages and then bet against them without disclosing this to the other parties. Citigroup dispensed with a Paulson figure altogether, grabbing those lucrative roles for itself.” (Last Thursday, the U.S. District Court judge overseeing the case demanded that the S.E.C. explain how such serious securities fraud could end with the defendant neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing.) This gets to the core of why all the anti-Wall Street groups around the globe are resonating. I was in Tahrir Square in Cairo for the fall of Hosni Mubarak, and one of the most striking things to me about that demonstration was how apolitical it was. When I talked to Egyptians, it was clear that what animated their protest, first and foremost, was not a quest for democracy — although that was surely a huge factor. It was a quest for “justice.” Many Egyptians were convinced that they lived in a deeply unjust society where the game had been rigged by the Mubarak family and its crony capitalists. Egypt shows what happens when a country adopts free-market capitalism without developing real rule of law and institutions. But, then, what happened to us? Our financial industry has grown so large and rich it has corrupted our real institutions through political donations. As Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, bluntly said in a 2009 radio interview, despite having caused this crisis, these same financial firms “are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they, frankly, own the place.” Our Congress today is a forum for legalized bribery. One consumer group using information from Opensecrets.org calculates that the financial services industry, including real estate, spent $2.3 billion on federal campaign contributions from 1990 to 2010, which was more than the health care, energy, defense, agriculture and transportation industries combined. Why are there 61 members on the House Committee on Financial Services? So many congressmen want to be in a position to sell votes to Wall Street. We can’t afford this any longer. We need to focus on four reforms that don’t require new bureaucracies to implement. 1) If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big and needs to be broken up. We can’t risk another trillion-dollar bailout. 2) If your bank’s deposits are federally insured by U.S. taxpayers, you can’t do any proprietary trading with those deposits — period. 3) Derivatives have to be traded on transparent exchanges where we can see if another A.I.G. is building up enormous risk. 4) Finally, an idea from the blogosphere: U.S. congressmen should have to dress like Nascar drivers and wear the logos of all the banks, investment banks, insurance companies and real estate firms that they’re taking money from. The public needs to know. Capitalism and free markets are the best engines for generating growth and relieving poverty — provided they are balanced with meaningful transparency, regulation and oversight. We lost that balance in the last decade. If we don’t get it back — and there is now a tidal wave of money resisting that — we will have another crisis. And, if that happens, the cry for justice could turn ugly. Free advice to the financial services industry: Stick to being bulls. Stop being pigs.CITIGROUP is lucky that Muammar el-Qaddafi was killed when he was.

Sends Wrong Signal<date>October 26, 2011, 12:50 pm</date><text>Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Back when the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was doing its work, I would check in periodically with someone who worked there to find out how it was going. “Good news!” my source would joke. “We got the guy who caused it.” That is the way I felt last week when the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had agreed to a measly $285 million settlement with Citigroup over the bank having misled its own customers in selling an investment it created out of mortgage securities as the housing market was beginning its collapse. In addition, the S.E.C. accused one person — a low-level banker. Hooray, we finally got the guy who caused the financial crisis! The Occupy Wall Street protestors can now go home. The Trade View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink After years of lengthy investigations into collateralized debt obligations, the mortgage securities at the heart of the financial crisis, the S.E.C. has brought civil actions against only two small-time bankers. But compared with the Justice Department, the S.E.C. is the second coming of Eliot Ness. No major investment banker has been brought up on criminal charges stemming from the financial crisis. To understand why that is so pathetic and — worse — corrupting, we need to briefly review what went on in C.D.O.’s in the years before the crisis. By 2006, legions of Wall Street bankers had turned C.D.O.’s into vehicles for their own personal enrichment, at the expense of their customers. These bankers brought in savvy (and cynical) investors to buy pieces of the deals that they could not sell. These investors bet against the deals. Worse, they skewed the deals by exercising influence over what securities went into the C.D.O.’s, and they pushed for the worst possible stuff to be included. The investment banks did not disclose any of this to the investors on the other side of the deals, or if they did, they slipped a vague, legalistic disclosure sentence into the middle of hundreds of pages of dense documentation. In the case brought last week, Citigroup was selling the deal, called Class V Funding III, while its own traders were filling it up with garbage and betting against it. By the S.E.C.’s own investigations of and settlements with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, and by reporting like my ProPublica work with Jake Bernstein and early stories by The Wall Street Journal, we know that these breaches were anything but isolated. This was the Wall Street business model. (Goldman, JPMorgan and Citigroup were all able to settle without admitting or denying anything, which, of course, is part of the problem.) Neither the Citigroup settlement nor any of the others come close to matching the profits and bonuses that these banks generated in making these deals. And low-level bankers did not, and could not, act alone. They were not rogues, hiding things from their bosses. Last week’s S.E.C. complaint makes clear that the low-level Citigroup banker that it sued, Brian H. Stoker, had multiple conversations with his superiors about the details of Class V. At one point, Mr. Stoker’s boss pressed him to make sure that their group got “credit” for the profits on the short that was made by another group at the bank. Pause, and think about that. The boss was looking for credit, but as far as the S.E.C. was concerned, he got no blame. The S.E.C. did not respond to a request for comment, so we are left to wonder what explains its failure to reckon adequately with the pervasive problems. Contrary to expectations, the embattled and oft-assailed agency has done almost everything right with structured finance investigations, taking aim at abuses related to C.D.O.’s and other complex deals. The S.E.C. has also devoted adequate resources to the issue. It put together a special task force on structured finance, sending the proper signal of the agency’s priorities both internally and externally. The task force is staffed by bright people, an invigorating mix of young go-getters and experienced hands. Those people have understood for years what was wrong with the C.D.O. business on Wall Street. O.K., so what is it? Risk aversion. Based on the major cases the S.E.C. has brought, a pattern has emerged. It is making one settlement per firm and concentrating on only the safest, most airtight cases. The agency’s yardstick seems to be, who wrote the stupidest e-mail? Mr. Stoker of Citigroup wrote an incriminating e-mail that recommended keeping one crucial participant in the dark. Goldman’s Fabrice Tourre, the other functionary the agency has sued, wrote dumb things to his girlfriend. But the S.E.C is not the G-mail G-man. It is the securities police. Imprudent e-mailing is not the only way to commit securities fraud. Maybe the agency hopes that private litigation will take up the slack. It cannot investigate and wring a prosecution or settlement out of every corrupt deal. Instead, it has long aimed to plant a flag and let private litigants take care of the rest. But private litigation has failed. One problem is that the defrauded institutions often committed their own sins. In a monstrous daisy chain, C.D.O.’s bought pieces of other C.D.O.’s. These investments were run by management companies. They might have been the victim in one C.D.O., but complicit in the predations of another. Other victims, like large financial institutions and money managers, do not want to sue because it could reveal their own compromised behavior. Or they would be revealing to customers that they had simply been taken by other, smarter bankers. You cannot very well convince people that you are a good steward of their money if you are simultaneously complaining that the Wall Street sharpies fleeced you. And private litigation has changed in the last decade and a half. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which was meant to make class-action lawsuits harder to bring, has had a spillover effect beyond those cases, according to plaintiffs’ lawyers. Courts have raised the bar for securities fraud cases, even where the act does not apply. The rules color how judges look at financial disputes. So the S.E.C. has the wrong approach. This is a matter of will and leadership. Its chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, while deserving credit for pushing investigations of structured investments, is sending the signal that she does not want to lose. Her agency is meekly willing to get token settlements when the situation calls for Old Testament justice. Someday, the S.E.C. will have to go up against a top executive who has resources to fight, and who was too sophisticated to put anything rash in writing. This seems to be our fate: our bankers took reckless risks, but our regulators take none.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/online-account-opening-isnt-as-easy-as-it-looks/?ref=citigroupinc">Online Account Opening Isn't as Easy as It Looks<date>October 25, 2011, 10:00 am</date><text>If you’ve ever tried — and failed — to open and fund an online checking account, you’re not alone. A new report from Javelin Strategy &amp; Research finds that only a little more than half of consumers who try to do so are successful. The other half meet with frustration and a quarter abandon the process, Javelin’s report says. The finding doesn’t bode well for banks, especially larger ones, that are facing a great deal of consumer backlash of late, especially over the growth in user fees. Most people apply for accounts online because they expect it to be faster and more convenient (and possibly cheaper, for online-only accounts) than doing it over the phone or visiting a branch, says Mark Schwanhausser, a senior financial services analyst with Javelin. (There may also be, Bucks suspects, a risk for smaller banks and credit unions hoping to win new accounts on the coming “Bank Transfer Day” on Nov. 5. If their online account-opening process isn’t smooth, some prospective new customers could give up in frustration.) As part of the research for the report, a team of Javelin “secret shoppers” tried out the online application process for various types of accounts at 10 major banks, as well as five other institutions including credit unions and online banks, and found convenience sorely lacking in some cases. Some banks boasting of online applications actually direct customers to download paper application forms for submission. At ING Direct and Wells Fargo, the report found, some online applications are restricted to existing customers. In the case of Wells Fargo, for instance, existing customers were allowed to apply online for a credit card, but newcomers were directed to apply at a branch. At Citibank, an application for a home-equity line of credit led to a “cycle of frustrating links” that forced the user to call a bank representative on the phone for help. (Citibank corrected the navigation problem shortly after the interaction, the report notes.) In another case, Bank of America seemed overly aggressive in following up on an online application. A Javelin researcher began an online application for a mortgage at Bank of America, providing contact information as an initial step, but abandoned the process before completion. Within a minute, a bank sales representative called on the telephone. While that might make sense from the bank’s perspective, Mr. Schwanhausser said, it could unnerve some applicants. “If you’re trying to be anonymous in shopping habits, it could be jarring or even somewhat creepy,” he said.

Complaint<date>Published: October 19, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — As the housing market began its collapse, Wall Street firms and sophisticated investors searched for ways to profit. Some of them found an easy method: Stuff a portfolio with risky mortgage-related investments, sell it to unsuspecting customers and bet against it.Citigroup on Wednesday agreed to pay $285 million to settle a civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had defrauded investors who bought just such a deal. The transaction involved a $1 billion portfolio of mortgage-related investments, many of which were handpicked for the portfolio by Citigroup without telling investors of its role or that it had made bets that the investments would fall in value. In the four years since the housing market began its steady descent, securities regulators have settled only two cases related to the financial crisis for a larger sum of money. This is also the third case brought by the S.E.C. accusing a major Wall Street institution of misleading customers about who was putting together a security and about their motive. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company both settled similar cases last year. The settlement will refund investors with interest and include a $95 million fine — a relative pittance for a giant like Citigroup. On Monday, the company reported that in the third quarter alone it earned profits of $3.8 billion on revenue of $20.8 billion. The settlement may also have trouble getting approval from Jed S. Rakoff, the federal district judge in New York who must ultimately sign off on the fine and who has taken a hard line on S.E.C. settlements. Neither the S.E.C. nor the Justice Department would say whether the case raised questions about whether Citigroup had been involved in any criminal wrongdoing. But the case highlights a growing frustration felt by foreclosed homeowners, investors and Wall Street protesters alike that few, if any, senior banking executives have faced criminal charges for losses growing out of the financial crisis. Citigroup has settled one case stemming from the crisis. Last year, it agreed to pay $75 million to settle federal claims that it hid from investors vast holdings of subprime mortgage investments that were losing value during the crisis and that ultimately prompted the federal government to rescue the bank. “The securities laws demand that investors receive more care and candor than Citigroup provided” to investors in the security, said Robert Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, referring to Wednesday’s action. “Investors were not informed that Citigroup had decided to bet against them and had helped to choose the assets that would determine who won or lost.” The complex amalgamation of investments known as Class V Funding III produced $126 million in profits for Citigroup’s brokerage subsidiary, and another $34 million in fees for putting it together. All of that, including interest and the $95 million fine, will now be going back to the investors; the government will not receive anything. In a statement, Citigroup noted that the S.E.C. did not charge it with “intentional or reckless misconduct.” Rather, it settled charges that its actions were negligent and misleading to investors. Despite its profits on the current deal, over all Citigroup lost tens of billions of dollars on its holdings of mortgage-related investments. “We are pleased to put this matter behind us and are focused on contributing to the economic recovery, serving our clients and growing responsibly,” the company said in a statement. “Since the crisis, we have bolstered our financial strength, overhauled the risk management function, significantly reduced risk on the balance sheet and returned to the basics of banking.” The S.E.C. on Wednesday also brought a case against Credit Suisse, which played a smaller role in the transaction, and against one individual at each company. But those individuals were midlevel employees in each company’s investment and trading departments; no senior executives at either company were charged. 1 2 Next Page » Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.WASHINGTON — As the housing market began its collapse, Wall Street firms and sophisticated investors searched for ways to profit.

Practices<date>October 20, 2011, 8:58 pm</date><text>Justin Maxon/The New York TimesJudge Jed S. Rakoff has taken the S.E.C. to task for resolving cases without making defendants admit wrongdoing. It is boilerplate language found in nearly every settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission: A company resolves its case “without admitting or denying” wrongdoing. There it was again in the S.E.C.’s announcement on Wednesday that Citigroup had agreed to pay $285 million to settle a civil complaint that it had defrauded investors in a mortgage securities deal. The bank did so “without admitting or denying” the government’s accusations. But the S.E.C.’s longstanding policy of using this phrase in its settlements is likely to come under scrutiny by the federal judge who must approve the Citigroup settlement — and it could, legal experts say, cause the deal to come undone. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Citigroup to Pay $285 Million to Settle S.E.C. Charges That is because the judge presiding over the S.E.C.’s action against Citigroup is Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan, a jurist whom many consider the agency’s bête noire. “Given his recent jurisprudence, if anyone’s going to rattle the S.E.C.’s cage on this issue, it’s Judge Rakoff,” said Michael Koehler, a professor of business law at Butler University who has written about the S.E.C.’s settlement practices. Judge Rakoff is known for a scathing ruling in September 2009, when he rejected a proposed $33 million settlement between the agency and Bank of America over its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The judge called it a sweetheart deal for the bank that had been done “at the expense, not only of the shareholders, but also of the truth.” (He later grudgingly approved a $150 million settlement.) More broadly, Judge Rakoff has sharply criticized the agency’s practice of resolving cases without forcing the defendant to admit any wrongdoing. In a little-noticed ruling in March, he raised the specter of scuttling the next S.E.C. settlement in his courtroom that included such language. Judge Rakoff said the use of the “without admitting or denying wrongdoing” language created “a stew of confusion and hypocrisy unworthy of such a proud agency as the S.E.C.” By using the boilerplate phrase, ”only one thing is left certain: the public will never know whether the S.E.C.’s charges are true, at least not in a way that they can take as established by these proceedings,” he wrote. Judge Rakoff’s disapproval of the agency’s settlement practices came in an accounting fraud case against the technology company Vitesse Semiconductor and two of its former executives. He ultimately approved the Vitesse settlement, finding it fair and reasonable, but not before criticizing the commission on a number of fronts. He chafed at the S.E.C.’s lack of explanation for why he should approve the settlement and described the agency as treating the court as a “rubber stamp.” But much of his opinion was aimed at the “neither confirm nor deny the allegations” phrase, which he called “troubling.” Judge Rakoff looked back at the history of the practice and found that the S.E.C. had permitted defendants to settle without admitting wrongdoing because that made obtaining settlements much easier. And defendants preferred it, he noted, because if they were forced to acknowledge their bad behavior, private plaintiffs would pile on with civil actions seeking monetary damages far greater than anything regulators were likely to impose. Then, in the 1970s, the S.E.C. began prohibiting defendants who settled from publicly denying the accusations. That was intended to prevent them from engaging in public relations campaigns to contend that they had settled only to avoid protracted litigation. Those historical reasons were met with scorn by the judge. “The defendant is free to proclaim that he has never remotely admitted the terrible wrongs alleged by the S.E.C.; but, by gosh, he had better be careful not to deny them, either,” the judge wrote. He suggested that permitting the defendant to neither admit nor deny the misconduct was indefensible. “An agency of the United States is saying, in effect, ‘Although we claim that these defendants have done terrible things, they refuse to admit it and we do not propose to prove it, but will simply resort to gagging their right to deny it,’ ” he said. Such strong language is the norm for Judge Rakoff, one of the more colorful judges on the federal bench in Manhattan. Judge Rakoff, 68, is a former federal prosecutor who also spent years as a criminal defense lawyer before he was named to the bench. He is currently presiding over a number of major cases, including several of the insider trading prosecutions and a dispute between the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff’s fraud and the owners of the New York Mets baseball team. Judge Rakoff is not alone in his discomfort over the “neither confirm nor deny” language. The Justice Department has long prohibited defendants, except in the most unusual circumstances, from pleading guilty to a crime without admitting or denying the charges. William F. Galvin, the top financial regulator in Massachusetts, has also been a critic of the “neither admit nor deny” language and has forced companies that settle to admit they engaged in unlawful conduct. And at least one top agency official has expressed concern. In a speech earlier this year, Luis A. Aguilar, an S.E.C. commissioner, worried that defendants who settled with the agency were issuing press releases after settlements that amounted to “revisionist history.” If this continued, he said, “it may be worth revisiting the commission’s practice.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/the-late-mover-advantage-in-citigroups-settlement/?ref=citigroupinc">The Late-Mover Advantage in Citigroup's Settlement<date>October 20, 2011, 10:15 am</date><text>Robert Caplin/Bloomberg News Citigroup agreed to pay $285 million to settle fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Oldest children often complain that their parents treated them worse than their younger siblings. Goldman Sachs may feel the same way after Citigroup agreed to a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two cases are almost identical, but Citigroup doesn’t face the same highly charged outrage. The allegations related to a synthetic collateralized debt obligation sold in 2007 to 15 investors. Citigroup, the charges claim, took a short position on the subprime mortgage-backed securities underlying the C.D.O., while influencing the selection of the assets. The settlement — in which the financial firm agreed to pay $285 million without admitting or denying guilt — appears to be of little concern to Citigroup investors. They’re likely to be happy that the bank has put the issue to rest. By comparison, Goldman’s settlement last year triggered banner headlines and a sharp drop in its stock. While Citigroup’s deal made the front page of The New York Times, the stock ended the day down only modestly and was up slightly in premarket trading on Wednesday. The difference doesn’t have as much to do with the facts of the case as much as it does with the timing and other crucial distinctions. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink According to the complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the marketing materials created to sell the C.D.O. to investors “suggested that Citigroup was acting in the traditional role of an arranging bank, when in fact Citigroup had exercised significant influence over the selection of the assets and had retained a $500 million proprietary short position of the assets it had helped select, which gave Citigroup undisclosed economic interests adverse to those of the investors.” The C.D.O. lost almost all of its value within months of being sold. Like in the Goldman case, investors who bought the Citigroup C.D.O. were sophisticated, and the bank disclosed there was a possibility that it would be taking a short position. To show how poor an investment Citigroup peddled, the S.E.C. quoted from an e-mail sent by a C.D.O. trader that it was “dog” excrement and another by a collateral manager that “the portfolio is horrible.” Just because others think it is a bad deal does not prove fraud, but it does help show that this was not the type of investment that should have been sold. The complaint against Citigroup alleges conduct that could be considered more pernicious than the charges against Goldman. Citigroup reaped $160 million in profit from its short position. In contrast, Goldman set up the C.D.O. that helped one of its investors, John Paulson, profit from shorting the mortgage-backed securities, but the firm did not realize any gains itself. Goldman and Citigroup settled claims that they violated two subsections of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, which only require proof of negligence. But in its initial complaint against Goldman, the S.E.C. alleged that it also violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, much more serious fraud charges. As part of its settlement, Goldman had to acknowledge that its marketing materials were incomplete, but no such admission was required from Citigroup. Perhaps most importantly, Citigroup was able to negotiate a settlement before the S.E.C. filed its charges, something that was not offered to Goldman. By settling the case, Citigroup turned it into a one-day news event, while Goldman endured weeks of negative publicity from the S.E.C. case before it finally settled three months later. Citigroup even received a lighter penalty than Goldman, paying disgorgement, interest and a civil penalty totaling $285 million, compared with the $550 million penalty Goldman had to pay, which the S.E.C. said was the largest in its history. The C.D.O.’s each firm sold were worth about $1 billion, so Citigroup seems to have benefited from coming later in the queue. Citigroup is the third major Wall Street bank to reach a settlement related to selling a C.D.O. tied to mortgage-backed securities, joining Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, which paid more than $153 million in June to settle an S.E.C. complaint. With the cases resolved, the banks have taken another step toward putting the collapse in the mortgage market behind them. And it shows how much better it is to not be the first firm sued by the S.E.C., because the settlement looks much less painful for Citigroup. Peter J.

Loan growth is still modest. And it remains heavily weighted toward the strongest corporate and consumer borrowers. But after several quarters of having their loan balances plunge or flatten out, several of the nation's biggest banks are reporting increases. On Monday, Citigroup officials said the bank recorded loan growth, compared with a year ago, in almost every one of its businesses during the third quarter, and in almost every corner of the globe. Wells Fargo executives said new loan commitments to small businesses were up 8 percent, while lending to bigger companies has been growing for 14 months in a row. Across the industry, analysts expect credit card loan balances will start increasing before the end of the year. ''The narrative that banks aren't lending is incorrect,'' Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, said in an interview. ''Lending is strong, and based on what we're seeing,'' he added, it will ''continue to grow.'' Still, the stocks of both banks, and the sector as a whole, dropped on Monday as the sluggish economy and revenue figures pointed to broad drags on the banks, including low returns on making loans and exposure to the European debt crisis. But the new lending numbers suggest that while the economy remains extremely fragile, the confidence of consumers and businesses may be more resilient than many experts had believed. ''It hasn't really strengthened, but it looks like the recovery is still here,'' Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chairman and chief executive, said after heralding his bank's lending data last week. There are myriad explanations behind the uptick in loan growth, including more customers taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates and borrowers in need of cash drawing on their credit lines. Others believe the downbeat headlines in recent weeks have been overblown. If the confidence clouds hanging over Europe and the United States were removed, the lending figures would be even stronger, analysts and bankers say. Housing remains the banking industry's Achilles' heel. Mortgage and home equity loans have fallen more than 6.2 percent since their peak in late 2007 and early 2008, according to weekly data from the Federal Reserve. Most banks have ratcheted up the underwriting criteria so that fewer new borrowers qualify for a loan, especially in the housing markets along the coasts that were hit hard by the recession. As existing loans end, they are less likely to replace them with a new one. But there has been a modest increase in lending elsewhere. Over all, corporate lending has rebounded 7.2 percent after bottoming out in October 2010. Consumer lending, with the exception of housing-related loans, turned positive during the second quarter and has been gradually increasing since then, the data show. All told, total loan balances are near where they stood in mid-2007. ''The banks want to lend,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a longtime banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. After all, he said, more than 70 percent of their income is tied to that activity. And the Federal Reserve survey of loan officers shows that banks have been gradually relaxing their underwriting requirements. Others, however, say the banks are still clinging to their purse strings. For a broader recovery, they will need to make loans more available to more consumer borrowers with blemished credit histories and a broader array of small businesses, the critics say. ''I don't think the lending window is open near enough to what you need to see to get the economy growing, businesses expanding, and to bring the unemployment rate down,'' said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm. So far, the revival in lending has not been strong enough to significantly move the revenue needle for the nation's biggest banks, either. The poor performance of their Wall Street-related businesses and the elimination of once-lucrative overdraft and credit card penalty fees have weighed on their results. Meanwhile, the rise in new loan volume has not been enough to offset the lower profit margins on new loans as a result of the Fed's decision to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2013.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/citigroup-earnings-rise-74-to-3-8-billion/?ref=citigroupinc">Citigroup Earnings Rise 74% to $3.8 Billion<date>October 17, 2011, 8:21 am</date><text>Jemal Countess/Getty Images for TimeVikram Pandit, chief of Citigroup. 5:14 p.m. | Updated With a big push from a one-time accounting gain, Citigroup on Monday squeezed out its seventh consecutive quarterly profit, but it faces significant challenges to growth. Citigroup announced a third-quarter profit of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 a share, beating analyst consensus estimates of 81 cents a share. That represented a 74 percent increase from a year ago, when the bank announced a quarterly profit of $2.2 billion, or 72 cents a share. But a big portion of that increase came from gains that will be difficult to repeat. Citigroup benefited from a paper gain of $1.9 billion, reflecting a sharp increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt — an accounting adjustment that gave JPMorgan Chase a similar earnings increase last week. Citigroup also delivered another $1.4 billion to its bottom line from money it had previously set aside to cover losses on credit cards and other loans. Together, those items accounted for more than 67 percent of the company’s pre-tax earnings. “Citi continues to navigate a challenging economic environment and delivered another quarter of solid operating results,” Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup’s chief executive, said in a statement. In a contrast to the sober overtones when JPMorgan kicked off bank earnings season with its results on Friday, Citi executives were a bit more bullish about the broader economy. “We are seeing loan growth in every one of our businesses, in every geography,” said John Gerpsach, Citigroup’s chief financial offer, on a conference call with journalists. “There still is a recovery in place. It may not be moving as robustly as we would like it, but it’s there and having an impact.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Revenue Slips at Wells Fargo Even so, revenue growth remains under pressure. Excluding the accounting adjustment on its debt, revenue dropped 8 percent to $18.9 billion as the bank contended with the global economic slowdown and some of the most turbulent markets in decades. Like the rest of the banking industry, Citigroup has come under pressure from rising expenses, slim lending margins and the evaporation of many of the lucrative fees that kept its consumer businesses afloat. Indeed, Citi shares have fallen sharply since the bank completed a reverse stock split in early May that brought its price to around $45 from $4.50. After a bit of a lift in early trading Monday, Citi shares closed down 47 cents, or 1.65 percent, at $27.93. Mr. Pandit has been engaged on an ambitious plan to streamline the sprawling bank and turn it into a leaner, more nimble lender. Only three years ago, Citigroup was in such dire straits that it needed to be bailed out twice by the federal government. And ever since then, Citi has had to play catch-up in investing in its businesses. Expenses continue to rise, a result of the weakening dollar and increases in areas like marketing and building new branches Expenses were up 9 percent in the third quarter, even as the bank’s core revenue was down by about the same amount. And that is after a deliberate plan to reduce the total size of its balance sheet. Today, the pile of assets that Citi plans to sell or shed is about $289 billion, although the pace of reduction has slowed substantially since the beginning of the year. The bank has struggled to find buyers for some of the biggest assets that remain earmarked for sale: CitiFinancial, its large consumer lending franchise; a roughly $115 billion portfolio of American mortgages, and a $42 billion private-label credit card loan business. Mr. Gerspach said the bank continued to solicit buyers for the consumer lending franchise and the mortgage portfolio. On Monday, Citi formally announced that it planned to retain the private-label card business, which it manages on behalf of companies like Home Depot and Sears, after telegraphing the decision for months. “We have been reworking that portfolio for the last couple of years, changing some of the underwriting criteria” so that it was more heavily weighted toward borrowers with stronger credit records, Mr. Gerspach said on the conference call. “It’s a markedly different portfolio than what it was in 2008 and 2009.” On the surface, Citigroup’s investment bank fared better in the third quarter than some of its Wall Street competitors. Profit was up 58 percent, to $2.2 billion. But the bulk of that profit stemmed from the widening of its own credit spreads, which allowed the bank to book a paper gain since it would theoretically cost less if it were to retire its debt. But there was sharp fall-off in investment banking fees and trading revenue amid the market turmoil. In particular, the bank’s equities derivatives unit had an extremely bad quarter, while the bank also missed out on revenue from its decision to wind down its proprietary trading unit in light of the new financial rules restricting such activities. Citigroup’s lending businesses performed better, with profit up 31 percent to $1.6 billion. The results reflected the bank’s strength in emerging markets in Latin America and Asia. Meanwhile, its American consumer lending businesses were helped by the bank’s decision to release the $1.4 billion of loan loss reserves, largely because of the continued improvement in the performance of its credit card borrowers. Although JPMorgan Chase elected not to take down its reserves, Mr. Gerspach said Citi officials believed their action was prudent and told reporters that current economic data suggested that the bank had room to release additional money in future quarters. Citi officials said they were remaining attentive to the risks stemming from the running debt crisis in Europe. The bank has about $20 billion in gross exposure to the peripheral countries, like Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In addition, it has about $14.4 billion of gross exposure to France and Belgium. But because of decisions to hedge and collateralize many of those loans, its net current exposure is about $7.1 billion to the peripheral countries, and another $2 billion to France and Belgium. “We believe it is manageable at current levels but obviously, it is something we are vigilant about,” Mr. Gerspach said on the conference call. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 17, 2011 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Citigroup's reverse stock split in early May. The split brought its price to $45 from around $4.50, not the other way around. An earlier version of the article said that 85 percent of Citigroup's pre-tax earnings in the third quarter came from one-time gains. It was 67 percent.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/banks-start-to-make-more-loans/?ref=citigroupinc">Banks Start to Make More Loans<date>October 17, 2011, 9:58 pm</date><text>Despite all the bleak economic news, a funny thing has been happening in the financial industry over the last few months: the banks have quietly turned on the lending spigot. Loan growth is still modest. And it remains heavily weighted toward the strongest corporate and consumer borrowers. But after several quarters of having their loan balances plunge or flatten out, several of the nation’s biggest banks are reporting increases. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink On Monday, Citigroup officials said the bank recorded loan growth, compared with a year ago, in almost every one of its businesses during the third quarter, and in almost every corner of the globe. Wells Fargo executives said new loan commitments to small businesses were up 8 percent, while lending to bigger companies has been growing for 14 months in a row. Across the industry, analysts expect credit card loan balances will start increasing before the end of the year. “The narrative that banks aren’t lending is incorrect,” Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “Lending is strong, and based on what we’re seeing,” he added, it will “continue to grow.” Still, the stocks of both banks, and the sector as a whole, dropped on Monday as the sluggish economy and revenue figures pointed to broad drags on the banks, including low returns on making loans and exposure to the European debt crisis. But the new lending numbers suggest that while the economy remains extremely fragile, the confidence of consumers and businesses may be more resilient than many experts had believed. “It hasn’t really strengthened, but it looks like the recovery is still here,” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chairman and chief executive, said after heralding his bank’s lending data last week. There are myriad explanations behind the uptick in loan growth, including more customers taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates and borrowers in need of cash drawing on their credit lines. Others believe the downbeat headlines in recent weeks have been overblown. If the confidence clouds hanging over Europe and the United States were removed, the lending figures would be even stronger, analysts and bankers say. Housing remains the banking industry’s Achilles’ heel. Mortgage and home equity loans have fallen more than 6.2 percent since their peak in late 2007 and early 2008, according to weekly data from the Federal Reserve. Most banks have ratcheted up the underwriting criteria so that fewer new borrowers qualify for a loan, especially in the housing markets along the coasts that were hit hard by the recession. As existing loans end, they are less likely to replace them with a new one. But there has been a modest increase in lending elsewhere. Over all, corporate lending has rebounded 7.2 percent after bottoming out in October 2010. Consumer lending, with the exception of housing-related loans, turned positive during the second quarter and has been gradually increasing since then, the data show. All told, total loan balances are near where they stood in mid-2007. “The banks want to lend,” said Gerard Cassidy, a longtime banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. After all, he said, more than 70 percent of their income is tied to that activity. And the Federal Reserve survey of loan officers shows that banks have been gradually relaxing their underwriting requirements.

So far, the revival in lending has not been strong enough to significantly move the revenue needle for the nation’s biggest banks, either. The poor performance of their Wall Street-related businesses and the elimination of once-lucrative overdraft and credit card penalty fees have weighed on their results. Meanwhile, the rise in new loan volume has not been enough to offset the lower profit margins on new loans as a result of the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2013. On Monday, Citigroup reported that its core revenue fell 8 percent, even as it squeezed out a $3.8 billion profit with some favorable accounting. It booked a $1.9 billion paper gain since the cost of retiring its debt had, theoretically, declined because of concerns over its financial condition. It also delivered about $1.4 billion to its bottom line, using money it had previously set aside to cover credit card and other loan losses. Together, those moves accounted for 67 percent of its pretax earnings. Wells Fargo also reported a 6 percent drop in revenue, as several major divisions, like its vast mortgage operations and its investment banking businesses, reported a decline from last year. But the bank still managed a record $4.1 billion profit, thanks in part to a sharp reduction in charge-offs and the release of $800 million in loan loss reserves. But buried in the numbers of both big banks were signs that loan growth was modestly improving. Citigroup pointed to healthy demand in emerging markets, which have only recently started to feel the impact of the global slowdown. In Asia, for example, corporate loans grew 22 percent, while card lending increased by about 4 percent, excluding the impact of the exchange rate. Citi’s Latin American operations showed similar resilience, while even the North American business showed a slight increase in lending, with the exception of mortgages. Much of it is not “forced lending” as borrowers tap credit lines because they are in desperate need of money to pay their bills, Citi executives said. Small-business customers are “drawing them down because they have real needs and we are extending additional commitments,” said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer. “Absent the continued uncertainty, you would likely have loans growing and the economy growing at a faster rate.” Executives at Wells Fargo, whose giant lending operations are largely focused on consumer and corporate borrowers in the United States, said that “customer sentiment is good” even though some of the economic data worsened during the third quarter. “It’s not just energy or commercial real estate; it’s really across the board,” said Mr. Sloan, the chief financial officer at Wells Fargo. Some of the growth was due to foreign lenders ceding some ground to Wells and other large American banks, rather than an overall increase in demand. The uptick in Wells Fargo’s commercial lending business was aided, in part, by a $1.1 billion commercial real estate portfolio it bought from the Bank of Ireland. Even its mortgage business, which reported more than a 50 percent jump in home loan applications, owed some of the lending growth to consumers refinancing existing loans — not people obtaining new ones. On Thursday, Mr. Dimon was keen to highlight JPMorgan’s lending numbers in an otherwise sobering quarter. Lending to small businesses with less than $50 million in revenue was up 70 percent through this year compared with the same period in 2010, while lending to middle-market customers was up 18 percent. “These are pretty powerful numbers,” Mr. Dimon said on a conference call with journalists. “We look at loan growth translating to jobs.”</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/business/media/bids-for-emi-group-said-to-be-lower-than-expected.html?ref=citigroupinc">Bids to Buy Citigroup’s EMI Group Are Said to Fall Short of Expectations<date>Published: October 16, 2011</date><text>When the Warner Music Group, the home of Neil Young and Green Day, was sold in May for $3.3 billion, music executives and media analysts were pleasantly surprised. The higher-than-expected price, after a frothy auction that drew as many as 20 suitors, seemed to indicate an enduring faith in music as an investment after a decade of bad news.But five months later, Citigroup’s sale of the EMI Group, one of the three other companies that dominate the world music market, is drawing less confidence. Turmoil in the financial markets has driven away many potential buyers and reduced the number of banks willing to finance bids. And according to several people involved with the auction, bidding prices have been lower than expected. EMI, which releases recordings by, among others, the Beatles, Coldplay and Katy Perry and has a music publishing division that controls the copyrights of 1.3 million songs, was seized by Citigroup in February after a disastrous four-year ownership by the private equity firm Terra Firma. After writing down EMI’s debt by $3.5 billion, Citi put the company on the market in June, with expectations among analysts and potential buyers that it might sell for up to $4 billion. Of the five parties that have bid on all or parts of EMI, four are other big music companies. Warner — whose new owner is the Russian-born investor Len Blavatnik — and the Universal Music Group have made offers for EMI’s recorded music division, along with MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, the holding company controlled by Ronald Perelman. Those bids are said to be from $1 billion to $1.3 billion, according to these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements. EMI’s publishing unit has drawn offers of $1.75 billion to $2 billion from Sony and BMG Rights Management, a joint venture between Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts and the German media giant Bertelsmann. In addition, some of these companies have made offers for the entire company, but those bids are said to be lower than what Citi would get by splitting the company up. Those companies declined to comment, as did Citi. Many analysts say they believe the auction is simply the victim of bad timing. Tightened credit markets have made it more difficult for potential buyers to finance their offers, and nervous banks have required bidders to put up more equity. “The global economy is in a different place than it was in February or March,” when the Warner auction began, said Ben Rumley, a media analyst with Enders Analysis in London. “Everything you read in the news indicates that it is difficult to raise financing for any business, let alone music. It’s not the greatest time to be looking for debt financing.” Bidders have also sought to limit their exposure to EMI’s pension liabilities, which by some estimates could be as high as $600 million. Despite the interest in Warner, there are persistent doubts about the health and investment value of large music companies. Among those concerns are the labels’ ability to shoulder the transition from physical to digital sales. New digital services like Spotify, which sell access to music by subscription, have generated excitement but are not profitable. “The music market is continuing to contract more quickly than record labels’ digital strategies can offset,” said Mark Mulligan, an independent analyst of the music industry. “For a prospective buyer, that brings the serious consideration of waiting until the market bottoms out and getting most value then.” Since most of the bidders are other major music companies, the auction faces regulatory complications in the United States and Europe. EMI’s record division is the smallest of the four major companies, with about 9 percent market share. But its publishing division — which controls the copyright for the music and the lyrics underlying songs — is one of the largest and most successful, with about 20 percent market share. Depending on which company or companies win the auction, that could mean that EMI’s recorded music and publishing halves could be further carved up as a pre-emptive move to satisfy antitrust regulators. The last round of bids for EMI were submitted to Citi earlier this month, but the people involved with the auction said that the bank had not given an indication of when it would make a decision. These people said that it could take weeks, and that there was still the chance that Citi could postpone the auction until market conditions — and bids — improve.When the Warner Music Group, the home of Neil Young and Green Day, was sold in May for $3.3 billion, music executives and media analysts were pleasantly surprised.

Both its consumer and Wall Street businesses were hit hard by the still-anemic recovery in the United States. The bank made $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $4.4 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analysts’ consensus estimate of 96 cents a share. Shares of JPMorgan fell almost 5 percent on Thursday to $31.60. Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and chief executive, said that his bank had seen surprisingly few signs that consumers and businesses were retrenching. In fact, he pointed to a modest increase in credit card loans and a much sharper uptick in loan growth to small and midsize corporations as evidence the broader economy was doing much better than many had feared. In addition, loan losses appear to be stabilizing. “It hasn’t really strengthened, but the recovery is still here,” Mr. Dimon said in a conference call with journalists on Thursday. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release In one sign of confidence, the bank bought back more than $4.4 billion of shares and warrants during the third quarter. The paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter. That helped offset $1 billion the bank set aside in pretax funds to cover potential legal claims largely stemming from problems in its mortgage division. The bank also took a $542 million pretax loss in its private equity unit. Revenue remained under pressure, falling to $24.4 billion, or 11 percent, from the second quarter, amid a slowdown in stock and debt offerings that had propped up the bank’s results in the past. Difficult trading conditions, slimmer profit margins on lending, and the elimination of overdraft and other penalty fees all weighed on top-line growth. One thing that has not changed, however, is banker compensation. This year, workers at JPMorgan’s investment bank are on track to be paid, on average, about $389,000 per employee, up 4 percent from $369,000 per employee in 2010. Over all, the bank’s employees are poised to make about the same amount as they did in 2010 — an average of about $118,000 in salary, bonus, and other compensation. Star bankers and traders stand to reap millions. As a diversified bank and the first to report earnings, JPMorgan is seen as an indicator for the financial industry. It was among the first banks to prompt analysts to start cutting earnings estimates when it warned in early September of a sharp fall-off in its Wall Street businesses. The other big banks will report earnings next week; Citigroup and Wells Fargo are to release their results on Monday morning, and Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs follow later in the week. All are expected to report a similar slowdown in their investment banking businesses, with some analysts forecasting that Goldman Sachs will report its second quarterly loss as a public company. Investors are so concerned about the banks’ prospect for growth that they fled the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks are down more than 30 percent since January. Stagnant loan growth, higher capital requirements, and the reduction of once-lucrative debit card swipe fees are expected to take a big bite out of profits. What’s more, investors are increasingly nervous about the exposure of American banks to their counterparts in Europe, which have vast holdings of bonds backed by Greece and other nations with weak economies. The choppy markets weighed heavily on its JPMorgan’s investment bank’s results. Profits dropped 20 percent from the prior quarter, to $1.6 billion. Over all, trading revenue was down sharply from a year ago, when market conditions were much better. The bank’s large fixed-income and commodities operations fell 14 percent from the second quarter, while equities fell 15 percent, excluding the accounting gains taken on its debt. Investment banking fees fell 31 percent, as corporations shelved plans for acquisitions as well as stock and bonds deals, given all the uncertainty swirling in the markets. Those figures were roughly in line with guidance provided Wall Street in mid-September. Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan expected to eliminate around 1,000 jobs, largely through attrition. “We are building an investment bank for the long run but we always trim our sails,” he said. Chase Home Lending, the bank’s mortgage division, continues to bleed money. Losses have improved slightly, to around $900 million this quarter, but show few signs of letting up anytime soon. “We don’t expect a lot of improvement going forward in housing numbers,” Mr. Dimon said during the conference call. “It’s hard not to be cautious.” On top of that, Chase faces billions of dollars in potential legal claims stemming from the federal government and private investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage bonds backed by loans that quickly went sour. It might also have to pony up several billion dollars more as part of a settlement with federal and state regulators for its role in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure mess. Banking analysts say the mortgage problems could cost the bank up to $9 billion. The bank’s other major businesses fared a bit better, despite the looming concerns about the job and housing markets. Chase Card Services, its credit card lending arm, posted an $849 million profit, down 8 percent from last year. Chase’s large commercial banking unit booked a $571 million profit, amid an 18 percent uptick in lending to middle-market corporations. JPMorgan’s asset management unit posted a $385 million profit despite facing the same drop in trading-related activity as the investment bank.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/citibank-adds-money-tracking-tools-to-online-banking/?ref=citigroupinc">Citibank Adds Money-Tracking Tools to Online Banking<date>October 3, 2011, 1:57 pm</date><text>Updated at 2:40 p.m. to add Citibank comment on avoiding monthly checking account fees. Citibank on Monday introduced an updated online banking site with new financial management tools, in the mode of money-tracking Web sites like Mint.com and Learnvest.com. The bank is gradually rolling out the new site to customers in randomly selected groups, so not all customers will see the new version immediately. (The bank declined to say how many online banking customers it has.) The new features come as the bank is making other checking account changes that may be unpopular with customers. Citi has said it would not institute a monthly fee specifically for debit card use (unlike the move by Bank of America to charge a $5 monthly fee, which drew customer outrage last week). But, as reported by American Banker and others, Citi is increasing monthly service fees and raising the minimum balance necessary to avoid them on certain checking accounts. A Citi spokesman said users of the bank’s Basic Checking account can avoid a monthly fee if they make one direct deposit and one online bill payment monthly (or, if they maintain a $1,500 combined monthly average balance in their checking and linked savings account). Citi’s public Web site was included in the online makeover too. The public site and the online banking site now feature colorful graphics, less text to digest and an avoidance of “banker speak,” said Tracey Weber, head of Citi’s online and mobile banking operations in North America, during a brief demonstration of the new site last week. The new site won’t necessarily make you ditch your own bank and join up at Citi. After all, you can already get budgeting tools at sites like Mint.com and elsewhere. But, if you’re already a Citi customer, the new tools add some functionality. For instance, Citi customers are now able to see a dashboard with summary information about their accounts, including credit cards, in one place. You can even choose to pull in information on accounts you hold at other institutions, without leaving the Citi site. (As with other budgeting tools that aggregate your accounts in one place, users must enter account information and log-on information so the financial details can be imported.) Citi’s new suite of financial tools (offered with no fee) automatically categorizes expenditures into different headings — rent, entertainment, etc. — so customers can track where they are spending their money. Users can change the categories as needed to better reflect their habits. Users can also set a budget goal and track how their actual spending compares with that number. The tool displays a color-coded pie chart, showing spending in different areas. The new tools aim to have the site “become a place for people to plan their financial lives,” not just pay bills, said Ms. Weber. The site can also provide feedback on the customer’s account — for example, how to avoid service fees or how to upgrade to different accounts. The update is Citi’s latest move in its effort to upgrade its electronic banking options. This summer, the bank began offering a banking app for the iPad that uses some of the same financial tools. If you’re a Citi customer, let us know what you think of the new banking site. How does it compare with the old one and to other financial management sites you use?</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/business/banks-to-make-customers-pay-debit-card-fee.html?ref=citigroupinc">Banks to Make Customers Pay Debit Card Fee<date>Published: September 29, 2011</date><text>Bank of America, the nation’s biggest bank, said on Thursday that it planned to start charging customers a $5 monthly fee when they used their debit cards for purchases. It was just one of several new charges expected to hit consumers as new regulations crimp banks’ profits.Wells Fargo and Chase are testing $3 monthly debit card fees. Regions Financial, based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to start charging a $4 fee next month, while SunTrust, another regional powerhouse, is charging a $5 fee. The round of new charges stems from a rule, which takes effect on Saturday, that limits the fees that banks can levy on merchants every time a consumer uses a debit card to make a purchase. The rule, known as the Durbin amendment, after its sponsor Senator Richard J. Durbin, is a crucial part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Until now, the fees have been 44 cents a transaction, on average. The Federal Reserve in June agreed to cut the fees to a maximum of about 24 cents. While the fee amounts to pennies per swipe, it rapidly adds up across millions of transactions. The new limit is expected to cost the banks about $6.6 billion in revenue a year, beginning in 2012, according to Javelin Strategy and Research. That comes on top of another loss, of $5.6 billion, from new rules restricting overdraft fees, which went into effect in July 2010. And even though retailer groups had argued that lower fees were important to keep prices in check, consumers were not likely to see substantial savings. In fact, they are simply going to end up paying from a different pot of money. Or as Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, put it after passage last year of the Dodd-Frank Act, “If you’re a restaurant and you can’t charge for the soda, you’re going to charge more for the burger.” Chase is now charging customers for a paper statement. It also, like many other banks, scrapped its debit card rewards program. And customers that Chase inherited from Washington Mutual no longer enjoy free checking accounts. The bank is also exploring a number of other fee increases, including for online banking, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Bank of America’s debit fee is steeper than most of its competitors’, reflecting the broader challenges the bank is facing after the financial crisis. The bank has introduced an online-only account that charges customers for doing business at a local branch. It also plans to apply its new debit card fees to anyone who uses the card to make recurring payments like gym fees or cable bills. Citibank is one of the few that said it would not introduce a charge for debit card use. “We have talked to customers and they have made it abundantly clear that ‘if you charge me to use my debit card, I would find that very irritating,’ ” said Stephen Troutner, head of Citi’s banking products. Still, the bank has made it more difficult to qualify for free checking, among other moves. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo estimated that the Durbin rules would cost the bank $250 million in revenue every quarter. It hopes to make up half that gap with a variety of new products and customer fees, including the monthly debit card fee of $3. The change is part of a “pilot program” the bank will begin on Oct. 14 in five states across the country, including Washington and Georgia. As of Saturday, the bank will discontinue its debit card rewards program. Meanwhile, HSBC said that it recently increased an A.T.M. fee — to $2.50 from $2 — for certain customers when they used a competitor’s A.T.M. It also recently introduced a debit transaction fee of 35 cents, though the first eight transactions are free. And at TDBank, customers will now have to pay $2 for using A.T.M.’s outside their network. “Durbin essentially moves the cost of debit away from merchants, and now it’s more focused on consumers,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin. “There are all sort of things happening where banks are saying, where can we put fees in place for our service to generate revenue or how can we reduce our costs?” Over the last few years, consumers have increasingly shifted their spending to debit cards from credit cards, in large part to curb their spending. But some analysts predicted that the new fees could prompt consumers to return to credit cards — a more lucrative alternative for the banks. Consumers have already begun to react to the changes. Patrick Shields, 48, said he had decided to leave Citibank, where he has held a small-business account for his residential window cleaning business since 1986. He was contemplating opening a personal checking account, but realized he could do better at a credit union. “At the credit union, they opened it free of charges, which Citi could not and would not do,” said Mr. Shields, who noted that a personal checking account would have cost more than the one he uses for his New York business. “Now I have both accounts covered, and I am fee-free.” The so-called Durbin rule quickly emerged as one of the thorniest provisions of Dodd-Frank, touching off a long and furious fight in Washington. Wall Street dispatched an army of lobbyists to tame the rule, ultimately yielding mixed results. In June, the Senate defeated a measure that would have delayed the new rule. But just three weeks later, the Federal Reserve decided to cap the fees at 21 to 24 cents for each debit card transaction, a much lighter blow than once expected. In a statement on Thursday, Senator Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said that small businesses would benefit from the new limits. “Swipe fee regulation will still allow banks to cover the actual costs of debit transactions but will rein in the banks’ excessive profit-taking.” Ann Carrns contributed reporting.Bank of America, the nation’s biggest bank, said on Thursday that it planned to start charging customers a $5 monthly fee when they used their debit cards for purchases. It was just one of several new charges expected to hit consumers as new regulations crimp banks’ profits.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/for-deals-wall-street-goes-east/?ref=citigroupinc">For Deals, Wall Street Goes East<date>September 28, 2011, 6:48 pm</date><text>Dan Cosgrove In 1902, the International Banking Corporation, a predecessor of Citigroup, went in search of the next big gold rush. But it did not go west. It opened up small outposts in Shanghai, Calcutta and Manila.

The story of Wall Street in the emerging markets has been a long one, filled with twists and turns. Most recently, deal makers and big banks have been contending with the global market volatility, which is rocking such risky locales. But in the age of globalization, with developed economies beginning to slow, emerging markets — once considered the final frontier — are beginning to bear fruit for patient investors and firms that have waited decades, and in some cases more than a century. DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section - Fall 2011 Three of the largest markets for initial public offerings last year were Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. Private equity firms focused on emerging markets raised $22.6 billion in the first half of 2011, compared with $23.5 billion for all of last year. And Chile, Ukraine and Thailand are among the fastest-growing markets for deals. Wall Street titans can truly claim the title of Masters of the Universe — or at least the World. “Today, Horace Greeley would say, “Go east, young man,’ ” said Richard Peterson, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s Capital IQ. Antonio Quintella, chief executive of Credit Suisse’s Americas business, has had a front-row seat to the evolution of Wall Street. A native of Brazil, he was a summer associate at Credit Suisse in 1991 and rejoined the firm in 1997. Since then, he has watched Brazil get its inflation problems and debt under control. Now, the big question is whether Brazil is too hot. Despite a spate of near collapses in the region, Credit Suisse has remained committed. In 1998, the firm bought Banco de Investimentos Garantia and later acquired the asset manager and private bank Hedging-Griffo. Through such acquisitions, Credit Suisse has built one of most powerful investment banks in Latin America. “There used to be no capital markets business there,” Mr. Quintella said. “Now it’s a very significant part of our business.” Here’s a good measure of the significance. In 2010, Mr. Quintella was the firm’s highest paid banker, taking home $17.4 million. He bested his own boss, Brady W. Dougan, the Credit Suisse chief executive, who made $14.4 million. Big private equity firms are also investing heavily, often at considerable cost, to build a presence in countries that were once considered unthinkable. Last year, the Blackstone Group acquired Pátria, Brazil’s top alternative asset manager. The Carlyle Group, the Washington firm that made its name investing in military and aerospace, has set up more than a dozen new offices in the last five years. It has the globe covered with bases in China, Beirut, Dubai, Hong Kong and Istanbul, as well as Lagos, Nigeria; Mumbai, India; São Paulo, Brazil; and Seoul, South Korea. “The interest among Western institutional investors to getting exposure to China, Brazil and India is clear. It’s a big mind shift,” said Sarah Alexander, president of the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association. And she added, they’ve been looking farther afield. “You’ve got Indonesia on the map, Colombia, Peru.” David M. Rubenstein, the co-founder of Carlyle, spent two decades on an airplane, fund-raising for his firm, often meeting with investors in remote parts of the world to put money in the United States. Now, Americans are asking him about opportunities abroad, and sovereign wealth funds want investment in their own backyards. In 2007, I traveled to Dubai, where Mr. Rubenstein was speaking at a conference and raising money for a new Middle East fund that, at the time, was considered a speculative bet. He intended to invest in places like Libya. Over lunch, he recalled a phone conversation the previous night with his mother about his trip. “Of course, she asks, ‘Is it safe? There’s always bombs going off and wars.’ ” He rolled his eyes: “I told her Dubai is probably a lot safer than Florida.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/chinese-policies-put-squeeze-on-the-banks/?ref=citigroupinc">Chinese Policies Put Squeeze On the Banks<date>September 28, 2011, 6:47 pm</date><text>Harry Campbell Globalization has been kind to Wall Street. The opening of European capital markets to American investment banks quickly led to United States financial domination of the Continent and of a large part of the rest of the world. American private equity firms have been equally successful at capturing the global market. But as they say on Wall Street, past performance is no indication of future results. Can Wall Street continue its winning streak? The question boils down to whether it can succeed in Asia, particularly in China. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section - Fall 2011 Investment banks in the United States and in Europe have historically dominated the Asian capital markets, but this dominance has been spotty of late. In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs was the best American performer in the rankings for Chinese debt raised offshore, ranking sixth with a 5.9 percent market share. For all Asian debt offerings, only two United States banks, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, were ranked in the top 10. Still, in other areas, the United States is competing strongly. Dealogic reports that for the first half of 2011, five of the top 10 investment banks underwriting equity in Asia were based in the United States. And Western banks occupy seven of the top 10 slots for providing advice to Asian companies on takeovers. Yet in China, domestic banks held five of the top 10 slots for providing takeover advice on Chinese acquisitions, according to Thomson Reuters. The performance highlights an ominous failure in China. The American banks compete in international offerings with only spotty success. But they don’t compete at all for Chinese companies raising money domestically. According to Dealogic, in the first half of 2011 no American investment banks ranked in the top 10 for locally raised Chinese debt denominated in renminbi. The reason is China’s exclusionary policies. Until this year, China did not allow non-Chinese firms to operate in domestic markets. Previously, American firms were forced to operate through partnerships with domestic Chinese firms. Not surprisingly, these Chinese domestic partners have viewed American banks as merely short-term partners to provide capital and expertise. For example, the China International Capital Corporation, one of China’s biggest investment banks, was formed by a partnership between Morgan Stanley and China Construction Bank. Morgan subsequently grew disenchanted with the relationship as C.I.C.C. grew and Morgan was squeezed out of its day-to-day operations. Morgan sold its stake for $1 billion in 2010. Even with the rule change, American banks remain hobbled in the Chinese domestic market. China recently allowed Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase to form their own mainland ventures, but with the condition that they observe certain operational restrictions, including doing business through a Chinese partner with less than a one-third ownership stake. Morgan Stanley has now established a joint venture with Huaxin Securities to replace its C.I.C.C. relationship. Chinese investment banks are now big enough to compete for international offerings. China’s biggest domestic underwriter of initial public offerings, the Guosen Securities Company, has doubled its staff in Hong Kong in the last year. Guosen, which is controlled by the city of Shenzhen, will compete with American banks for more international offerings by Chinese companies from Hong Kong. Chinese investment banks are entering this new beachhead by hiring staff members trained by the Western investment banks. Guosen Securities, for example, lured Cheng Gang from HSBC Holdings to head its Hong Kong operations. And these domestic banks are being aided by the Chinese government, which often pushes local companies to include Chinese investment banks for its international offerings. Bank of China picked three Chinese banks but only two international banks for its recent $7 billion Hong Kong offering. The Chinese government is thus doing in investment banking what it is doing in other industries. It is strong-arming foreign investment banks to provide capital and expertise as a bridge to building a bigger market share for domestic players. Presumably, the goal is for these Chinese investment banks to compete throughout Asia and globally represent Chinese companies. Underwriting fees in Hong Kong have fallen to as low as 1.9 percent for the recent Prada offering, from a range of 2 to 3.5 percent. One reason is the increased competition among investment banks. Underwriting fees remain at about 6 percent in the United States. Given the obstacles, one would think that American private equity firms might try a different approach in China. Instead, these firms also appear to be striking Faustian bargains, trading their capital and expertise for a Chinese presence. Private equity firms cannot buy whole companies because Chinese regulations largely prohibit such ownership. Instead, the private equity firms have teamed up with local entities for minority stakes or have otherwise bought interests in publicly traded Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong or abroad. These investments, however, have succeeded in part because of the bubbly nature of the Chinese markets. It remains to be seen how these firms will do with these investments if China’s markets slow. Private equity has been rushing to take advantage of this growth by establishing renminbi-denominated funds. Carlyle formed one with the Beijing municipal government. Blackstone, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also teamed up with local Chinese governments to form these funds. Because the funds are denominated in renminbi and have mostly Chinese investors like municipalities, they have much freer investment rein. The Chinese government is also experimenting with a program to allow limited foreign investment in these funds. It is unlikely, however, that Chinese governments will allow private equity firms to take the kinds of profits they can realize in the United States. For one thing, American private equity firms, like American investment banks, are seeing more competition. According to a recent McKinsey report, local private equity firms occupy 20 percent of the market — double the number from 2007. These Chinese firms are more likely to attract Chinese government investment than are their foreign rivals. The same dynamic at work in investment banking will work in private equity as these local Chinese firms gain experience and hire Western private equity firm employees. Last year, TPG and Goldman Sachs lost senior private equity employees who left to start their own domestic funds. The $300 billion Chinese sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation, has bought 10 percent of Blackstone and is earmarking more funds for private equity investment, some of it to be spent abroad. Ultimately, these local private equity firms are likely to rise to advise C.I.C. and other Chinese investors on this foreign investment. It is hard to blame American investment banks and private equity firms, though. They are going for half a loaf rather than nothing at all. While the Chinese financiers are likely to keep elbowing out United States banks in China, it remains to be seen if they can become international bankers in Asia, or, like the Japanese banks, remain local players. One thing appears certain: Wall Street is going to have to fight to preserve its global and Asian position, let alone to grow in places like China. Wall Street will have to be doubly careful it doesn’t give away its business in the headlong sprint into China and Asia, by buying short-term growth in a way that creates long-term global competitors.

Vikram S. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, boldly promised in 2009 that “we will be the single largest emerging markets financial services company.” Goldman Sachs’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said at a conference last year that one of his firm’s big goals was “to be Goldman Sachs in more places.” Special Section Fall 2011 View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section Fall 2011 But there’s a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks. “A lot of big banks are looking to developing markets, but historically it’s tended to be a volatile move,” said James Sinegal, a bank analyst at the research firm Morningstar. “It might not be as easy as they expect.” Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. The economies of countries like China, India and Brazil are growing faster than that of the United States. Such places also represent an untapped client base, with a growing middle class and a large number of wealthy individuals. As profits wane on the home front, Wall Street firms are increasingly dependent on the emerging markets to bolster their bottom lines. Citicorp, a division of Citigroup, draws about half of its revenue from emerging countries, up from roughly 25 percent in 2005. International markets account for 47 percent of Goldman’s profits. Morgan Stanley generated nearly a third of its net revenue from outside the Americas. “With the United States slowing down, it is not surprising that institutions are looking in the emerging markets,” said Hamid Biglari, a Citicorp vice chairman and chief of emerging markets. But the perils can be plentiful, with economic, political and regulatory challenges. Foreign regulators have scolded banks, fined them and even banned their activities in various countries. Citigroup twice ran into problems with Japanese authorities. In turn, Wall Street says it has cleaned house at overseas offices, taken greater control of foreign ventures and tapped local bankers to lead new projects. Local knowledge is especially critical, as firms try to navigate the regulatory and political environment that is crucial to a bank’s business. Earlier this year, Citigroup found itself in hot water with Indonesian regulators. After an investigation into suspected embezzlement by an employee and the death of a client after meetings with the bank’s outside debt collectors, the country’s central bank imposed sanctions on Citigroup, including a one-year ban on opening new branches. In June, the bank removed its top country officer, replacing him with a native Indonesian, Tigor M. Siahaan, a seasoned banker experienced in dealing with local regulators and government officials. Now, the bank is tweaking its internal controls, bringing its debt collecting in-house and regularly rotating back-office personnel. The bank said it was also working closely with Indonesian authorities. “How to behave responsibly in these markets comes with experience,” Mr. Biglari said. “You have to figure out how to work with the cultural norms.” Financial firms have also realized that they need to commit to a market, because it can take years if not decades to build up local relationships and understand the country’s customs. While Goldman says on its Web site that it has had a presence in Russia since 1998, the firm has had its troubles in the country. Not long after opening in Russia, Goldman downsized its operations, concerned about the financial crisis that prompted the government to devalue the ruble. It closed the Moscow office and reassigned staff members. Christopher Barter, co-chief executive for Goldman’s Russia business, said the investment bank should not have left the country. “We missed out on years of a footprint there,” he said. “When you go into a country, you have to maintain your commitment.” It took years to build up the business in Russia again. Goldman reopened the Moscow location in 2001, but it didn’t fully ramp up there until 2006, when it obtained a brokerage license. Today, the firm has 140 employees in Russia, up from 30 people five years ago. The company has established stronger ties in the country since it has returned. In 2008, Goldman held a board meeting in Russia, a nod to its re-emergence there. Michael Sherwood, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs, now visits Russia several times a year. And Mr. Blankfein, along with other Wall Street chiefs like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, has joined a committee set up by the Russian government to help bring more foreign money to the country. Firms have also realized they need more management oversight of overseas investments. Morgan Stanley was one of the first investment banks to establish a joint venture in China. In 1995, it teamed up with China Construction Bank to form the China International Capital Corporation. But the Wall Street bank was a passive investor, owning just one-third of the business, the limit for foreign securities firms under Chinese rules. It also ceded management control to its partners. In 2010, Morgan Stanley sold the stake to a group of private equity firms. Since then, Morgan Stanley has forged a new relationship with Huaxin Securities. While it still owns a one-third stake in the venture, called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, it has seats on the firm’s board and plays a role in the day-to-day management of the firm. A Morgan Stanley managing director, Yang Kai, is the chief executive of the company. While foreign business is hardly a guaranteed win, financial firms are willing to take the risks. It’s one of the industry’s few options as banks deal with costly new regulations, sluggish economic growth in their home markets and a volatile market — all of which are weighing on profits. “These guys are hurting and it gets worse by the day,” said Michael J. Driscoll, a professor at Adelphi University’s business school and former senior trader at Bear Stearns. “You can only squeeze so much till you go looking elsewhere for a return.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/business/moodys-downgrades-credit-ratings-of-three-large-banks.html?ref=citigroupinc">Moody’s Downgrades Credit Ratings of Three Large Banks<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>Moody’s cut its credit ratings Wednesday on three large banks — Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — underscoring the challenges the sector still faces three years after the onset of the financial crisis.The downgrades were driven by Moody’s conclusion that the federal government was less likely to step in and provide support for a faltering big bank the way it did after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, when Washington executed a series of actions including capital infusions and credit guarantees to halt the spreading panic. Moody’s had put the banks on notice for a possible downgrade on June 2. While Moody’s said it “believes that the government is likely to continue to provide some level of support to systemically important financial institutions,” the agency added that the government “is also more likely now than during the financial crisis to allow a large bank to fail should it become financially troubled.” Under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform passed by Congress in 2010, financial institutions must file a so-called living will that lays out steps for an orderly liquidation in the event of a financial collapse. The goal is to avoid future government bailouts, as well as the kind of turmoil unleashed by Lehman’s unexpected bankruptcy. “Now, having moved beyond the depths of the crisis, Moody’s believes there is an increased possibility that the government might allow a large financial institution to fail, taking the view that the contagion could be limited,” the firm said in a statement. Even so, Moody’s said it doubted whether a global financial institution could be liquidated “without a disruption of the marketplace and the broader economy.” The ratings agency cut Bank of America’s long-term senior debt to Baa1, three levels above junk. For Citigroup, Moody’s cut its ratings on short-term debt to Prime 2 from Prime 1, while affirming its A3 long-term rating. Moody’s lowered its rating on Wells Fargo’s senior debt to A2 from A1. Its Prime-1 short-term rating was affirmed. Of the three institutions, Bank of America has the lowest credit rating. Shares of all three big banks fell sharply after the downgrade, but Bank of America dropped the most, falling 7.5 percent to $6.38 a share. Although big banks enjoyed higher credit ratings before the financial crisis, Wednesday’s move was not unexpected, and analysts played down its significance. Although it could slightly raise borrowing costs over the long term, banks are not expected to have to pay significantly more to finance their operations in the near term. “It’s not a good headline, but it shouldn’t have much impact,” said Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital, adding that even the federal government’s loss of its AAA rating this summer had not raised its borrowing costs. In addition to seeing the government as less likely to support Bank of America, if needed, Moody’s said that the company “remains exposed to potentially significant risks related to both the residential mortgage and home equity loans on its balance sheet, as well as to mortgages previously sold to investors.” Investors are seeking to force Bank of America to pay billions of dollars for its alleged misdeeds during the height of the housing boom, especially the bubble-related excesses at Countrywide Financial, the subprime giant Bank of America acquired in 2008. Bank of America has reached settlements with some investors, but other holders of mortgage-backed securities assembled by Bank of America, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, another subsidiary, are suing to recover multibillion-dollar losses. Moody’s was careful to note that its action did not reflect a weakening of Bank of America’s “intrinsic credit quality.”Moody’s cut its credit ratings Wednesday on three large banks — Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — underscoring the challenges the sector still faces three years after the onset of the financial crisis.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/why-citi-wasnt-broken-up/?ref=citigroupinc">Why Citi Wasn't Broken Up<date>September 16, 2011, 8:50 am</date><text>A new book by Ron Suskind, “Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President,” contends that some economic decisions by President Obama, including one to consider an overhaul of Citigroup, were met with indifference or ignored by top administration officials, The New York Times reports.

Forbes valued his fortune this year at $19.4 billion, making him the 26th richest man in the world and the single richest in the Arab world. The accuser did not go public, and the original complaint appears to have remained largely unknown. The case was quietly closed in July 2010 for what a judge on the Mediterranean resort island of Ibiza called a lack of evidence. But on appeal, a Spanish provincial court for the Balearic Islands, which has jurisdiction over Ibiza, ordered the judge to resume investigating and to summon the prince to appear. The provincial court said the judge, Carmen Martín Montero, was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. Heba Fatani, a spokeswoman for Prince Alwaleed’s investment arm, the Kingdom Holding Company, called the accusations “completely and utterly false.” “The alleged encounter simply never happened,” Ms. Fatani said in a statement. Ms. Fatani also said the prince was never in Ibiza in 2008 and provided pages of his calendar indicating that he spent time that summer in Paris; Cannes, France; and Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. He did not charter a yacht in Ibiza, nor did he take his own there, she said. Other people who spent time with the prince that summer can confirm his whereabouts, she said. Prince Alwaleed first learned of the 2008 case on Tuesday, Ms. Fatani said, and his lawyers had not been informed about it. Son of a gadfly senior prince, Talal ibn Abd al-Aziz, Prince Alwaleed has long been outspoken about expanding opportunities for women in the kingdom. The women who work in his Saudi offices are not segregated, nor do they have to wear the enveloping black abayas — his royal stature keeps them out of reach of the religious police who enforce such measures. The model, whose lawyer has identified her by only her middle name, Soraya, filed a police complaint in August 2008, saying the prince had raped her on the yacht after she was drugged. She said she had been invited to the yacht at an Ibiza nightclub. The Balearic archipelago is one of the most popular vacation destinations in the Mediterranean and welcomes a flotilla of luxury yachts during the summer months. According to a summary of a provincial court’s order to reopen the case, medical tests conducted by departments of Spain’s National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Science turned up traces of semen and a sleep-inducing chemical, nordazepam, in her urine. In the 2010 decision to close the case, the Ibiza judge said the forensic and medical tests had shown no signs of physical violence that could confirm a rape. The judge also questioned whether the sleep-inducing chemical found in the model’s body could have acted swiftly enough to induce a semiconscious state between the time she left the nightclub and reached the yacht. Her lawyer, Javier Beloqui, said the tests supported her claim that her drink had been spiked and that she was sexually assaulted. He called on Prince Alwaleed to provide at least a DNA test in order to compare it with the traces of semen found. Mr. Beloqui welcomed the decision to reopen the case. “Nobody was even questioned at the time,” he said, “which is unbelievable when you consider the seriousness of the crime and the evidence that has been gathered.” Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from New York.MADRID — A Spanish judge has reopened an abandoned sexual assault case against a Saudi prince who is one of the world’s richest men, reviving accusations that he raped a 20-year-old model on a luxury yacht in the Spanish Mediterranean in August 2008.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/business/wall-street-banks-bracing-for-drop-in-trading-revenue.html?ref=citigroupinc">Wall Street Banks Bracing for Drop in Trading Revenue<date>Published: September 13, 2011</date><text>The worries of Wall Street banks keep growing.As if the troubles in Europe were not enough, two months of the most turbulent markets in decades are expected to seriously damp trading results for the nation’s largest banks. In a bellwether for other large financial firms, JPMorgan Chase warned that third-quarter trading revenue was likely to fall about 8 percent from a year ago. Investment banking income is also expected to drop by one-third from a year earlier, as corporations get cold feet about acquisitions as well as stock and debt offerings. “I think you can safely expect a decline in our markets revenue,” Jes Staley, the head of JPMorgan’s investment bank, said in remarks at the Barclays financial services conference on Tuesday. There are still 13 trading days left in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, and Wall Street firms will not release their final numbers until the middle of next month. But a sharp fall-off in summer trading seems poised to weigh heavily on the banks’ earnings — and perhaps accelerate another round of layoffs expected in the coming months. After helping lift Wall Street’s results during the financial crisis, trading revenue is projected to fall for a second straight quarter. On average, it is expected to be down by about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also expected to have weak third-quarter results. Investors shrugged off the latest bad news as shares of the biggest banks rose slightly on Tuesday in relatively calm trading. But bank stocks have been pummeled recently. The KBW index, a widely cited gauge of the banking sector, has fallen more than 28 percent since January. Although Wall Street firms can land windfalls making speculative bets with the banks’ own capital, the bulk of their trading revenue comes from transactions made on behalf of clients. But with the heightened volatility over the summer, many companies and investors remained on the sidelines — causing a significant slowdown in trading activity. The lackluster trading results come at a bad time for the industry, when profits and revenues have slipped to the levels attained before the housing boom. Many are bracing for a slowdown in lending, as consumers grow nervous about their job prospects and businesses put off expansion plans. Banks still face an endless stream of legal headaches and litigation fees from the foreclosure mess. In addition, new regulation has ratcheted up compliance costs and caused once-lucrative income streams, like debit card swipe fees and overdraft charges, to vanish. And all that is not counting the impact of the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates low for the next two years — a move that will erode lending profit margins in the months ahead. In anticipation of leaner times ahead, banks are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations. On Monday, Bank of America announced plans to cut about 30,000 jobs across the company, or nearly 10 percent of its work force. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Credit Suisse and UBS are among the major Wall Street firms that have started laying off employees in the last few months. JPMorgan’s investment bank is more than halfway through a five-year plan to save about $1.3 billion a year by consolidating its trading operations — a move that will involve shedding as many as 3,000 workers, some of whom will be employed elsewhere in the bank. But so far, Mr. Staley said the bank does not anticipate a major round of layoffs beyond those previously announced. “We have had a very good first half of the year,” he said at a banking conference in Frankfurt last week. “We will see how this plays out.” Still, the numbers at JPMorgan may foreshadow more pain ahead. JPMorgan was among the first major banks to sound the alarm bells over souring subprime mortgage loans in early 2007. In 2008, the bank flagged concerns about ballooning losses on its large portfolio of home equity loans ahead of many competitors and has moved quickly to shore up its reserves against legal claims stemming from the mortgage mess. In his remarks, Mr. Staley said investors could expect equity and fixed income trading revenues to decline about 30 percent from the second quarter, putting them at about $3.85 billion. Investment banking fees are expected to fall to about $1 billion, down from $1.9 billion in the second quarter. He also said that the bank’s private equity business would face a “moderate loss” of about $100 million and that its asset management business would see trading-related declines. Other banks may see a similar fall-off in trading. Citigroup, which has a giant fixed-income business, could see core trading revenue drop 47 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Overall trading revenue at Morgan Stanley is expected to fall about 1 percent from a year earlier, while revenue at Bank of America is expected to rise about 11 percent. Both banks had relatively weak third-quarter results in 2010. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs’s trading income is expected to fall about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse. But that may not represent the full extent of the declines it can expect. Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote in a recent report that the bank could face more than $3.2 billion in losses tied to its investment and lending businesses, which include private equity and other investments made with the bank’s own capital. That is because it must adjust its accounting to reflect the market’s recent round of wild swings.The worries of Wall Street banks keep growing.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/after-losing-emi-guy-hands-tries-new-legal-tack/?ref=citigroupinc">Undaunted by Past Setbacks, Hands Resumes EMI Fight<date>September 7, 2011, 5:19 pm</date><text>Qilai Shen/Bloomberg NewsGuy Hands, chief of Terra Firma. 8:08 p.m. | Updated Guy Hands is back. Months after Citigroup seized EMI Group from him, Mr. Hands, the charismatic British financier, went to court on Tuesday in an effort to win back control of the music company. Mr. Hands has asked the High Court in London for access to documents that show the valuation methodology used by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to justify Citigroup’s seizure of EMI in February. If a judge granted Mr. Hands the right to see those documents, he could use them to challenge Citigroup’s taking control of the music company. Mr. Hands believes that EMI, which was making interest payments, was not insolvent when Citigroup took it over. “We believe there is no basis for any claim against Citi,” said Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a bank spokeswoman. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink This latest legal dust-up comes as Citigroup has put EMI up for sale. A handful of private equity firms and music labels have expressed an interest in the company. Mr. Hands’s action could scare off any potential buyers. But Citigroup plans to indemnify any of the bidders from legal claims by Mr. Hands, according to two people briefed on the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly. Tuesday’s move rekindles what has been a bitter dispute between Mr. Hands and his former bankers over EMI, the record label whose stable of artists include Snoop Dogg and Katy Perry. Chris Ratcliffe/BloombergThe EMI music label is being shopped by Citigroup. Last year, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, a jury cleared Citigroup of any wrongdoing in its role in the sale of EMI. Mr. Hands had sought an $8 billion recovery, plus punitive damages, accusing the bank of defrauding him during the auction of EMI. He directed his charges at David Wormsley, a top British banker at Citigroup and Mr. Hands’s once-trusted adviser. He said that Mr. Wormsley artificially drove up EMI’s price by lying to him that there was another bidder for the company. He said that the misrepresentation caused him to pay $6.8 billion for the company. Mr. Hands is appealing the verdict. The debt-laden purchase of EMI by Mr. Hands’s firm, Terra Firma Capital Partners, is widely considered one of the buyout boom’s worst deals. It was struck in August 2007 just as the credit markets were freezing up. At the same time, the record business began to tank. Mr. Hands bet about 30 percent of Terra Firma’s most recent fund on EMI. It lost about $2.5 billion on the deal. Despite those woes, Mr. Hands continues to press on. Terra Firma plans to raise a new multibillion-dollar fund next year. Aside from the EMI debacle, the rest of Terra Firma’s most recent fund has performed well. Though it is still suffering paper losses, Mr. Hands said that he hopes to return all of the capital invested to his investors. Citigroup, meanwhile, continues to carry out its auction of EMI. Potential bidders that have expressed an interest in the company include Warner Music and the billionaire investor Ronald O. Perelman.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/the-last-women-standing-on-wall-street/?ref=citigroupinc">The Last Women Standing on Wall Street<date>September 7, 2011, 9:44 am</date><text>Evan Kafka; Morgan Stanley, via Associated Press; Jonathan Fickies/Bloomberg News and Hiroko Masuike for The New York TimesWALL STREET DEPARTURES From left, Erin Callan of Lehman Brothers, Zoe Cruz of Morgan Stanley, Sallie Krawcheck of Bank of America and Heidi Miller of JPMorgan Chase. Women — always a rare breed in the upper echelons of Wall Street — are looking like an endangered species in the executive suite of big banks. On Tuesday, Bank of America reshuffled its management team, culling Sallie Krawcheck from its ranks. With her departure, a handful of women will still report directly to the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, but they largely fill top roles in groups that don’t produce revenue. Among them: Anne Finucane, the global strategy and marketing officer; Christine Katziff, the corporate general auditor; Andrea Smith, the head of human resources; and Cathy Bessant, the head of global technology and operations. It is a long-running theme across Wall Street, with the plum spots in investment banking and brokerages most typically held by men. At Goldman Sachs, women make up little more than 12 percent of the partnership, an elite group that includes the firm’s most senior executives and biggest stars.

Erin Callan, the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers, got the boot just months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Zoe Cruz, the co-president of Morgan Stanley, was ousted in a management shake-up in late 2007. Terri Dial lasted just a year as chief executive of Citigroup’s consumer business in North America. And Heidi Miller, the head of JPMorgan Chase’s international efforts who was once viewed as a potential successor to the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is set to depart the company early next year. That is not to say women do not hold some pretty powerful positions in finance. Earlier this year, the private equity firm Carlyle Group, which just filed to go public, tapped Adena T. Friedman as its chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Ina Drew, the bank’s chief investment officer, sits on the operating committee. In January, Cece Stewart joined Citigroup to head up its consumer and commercial division in the United States. Edith Cooper runs human resources for Goldman Sachs. Ruth Porat is the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley. But their status is more the exception than the rule. In the United States, women account for 2.7 percent of the chief executives in the financial industry, and 16.8 percent of the executive officers, according to a study by Catalyst.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/business/us-is-set-to-sue-dozen-big-banks-over-mortgages.html?ref=citigroupinc">U.S. Said to Be Ready to Sue Banks Over Mortgages<date>Published: September 1, 2011</date><text>The federal agency that oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is set to file suits against more than a dozen big banks, accusing them of misrepresenting the quality of mortgage securities they assembled and sold at the height of the housing bubble, and seeking billions of dollars in compensation.The Federal Housing Finance Agency suits, which are expected to be filed in the coming days in federal court, are aimed at Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, among others, according to three individuals briefed on the matter. The suits stem from subpoenas the finance agency issued to banks a year ago. If the case is not filed Friday, they said, it will come Tuesday, shortly before a deadline expires for the housing agency to file claims. The suits will argue the banks, which assembled the mortgages and marketed them as securities to investors, failed to perform the due diligence required under securities law and missed evidence that borrowers’ incomes were inflated or falsified. When many borrowers were unable to pay their mortgages, the securities backed by the mortgages quickly lost value. Fannie and Freddie lost more than $30 billion, in part as a result of the deals, losses that were borne mostly by taxpayers. In July, the agency filed suit against UBS, another major mortgage securitizer, seeking to recover at least $900 million, and the individuals with knowledge of the case said the new litigation would be similar in scope. Private holders of mortgage securities are already trying to force the big banks to buy back tens of billions in soured mortgage-backed bonds, but this federal effort is a new chapter in a huge legal fight that has alarmed investors in bank shares. In this case, rather than demanding that the banks buy back the original loans, the finance agency is seeking reimbursement for losses on the securities held by Fannie and Freddie. The impending litigation underscores how almost exactly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of a financial crisis caused in large part by subprime lending, the legal fallout is mounting. Besides the angry investors, 50 state attorneys general are in the final stages of negotiating a settlement to address abuses by the largest mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup. The attorneys general, as well as federal officials, are pressing the banks to pay at least $20 billion in that case, with much of the money earmarked to reduce mortgages of homeowners facing foreclosure. And last month, the insurance giant American International Group filed a $10 billion suit against Bank of America, accusing the bank and its Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch units of misrepresenting the quality of mortgages that backed the securities A.I.G. bought. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan all declined to comment. Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said, “We can’t comment on a suit that we haven’t seen and hasn’t been filed yet.” But privately, financial service industry executives argue that the losses on the mortgage-backed securities were caused by a broader downturn in the economy and the housing market, not by how the mortgages were originated or packaged into securities. In addition, they contend that investors like A.I.G. as well as Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated and knew the securities were not without risk. Investors fear that if banks are forced to pay out billions of dollars for mortgages that later defaulted, it could sap earnings for years and contribute to further losses across the financial services industry, which has only recently regained its footing. Bank officials also counter that further legal attacks on them will only delay the recovery in the housing market, which remains moribund, hurting the broader economy. Other experts warned that a series of adverse settlements costing the banks billions raises other risks, even if suits have legal merit. The housing finance agency was created in 2008 and assigned to oversee the hemorrhaging government-backed mortgage companies, a process known as conservatorship. “While I believe that F.H.F.A. is acting responsibly in its role as conservator, I am afraid that we risk pushing these guys off of a cliff and we’re going to have to bail out the banks again,” said Tim Rood, who worked at Fannie Mae until 2006 and is now a partner at the Collingwood Group, which advises banks and servicers on housing-related issues. 1 2 Next Page »The federal agency that oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is set to file suits against more than a dozen big banks, accusing them of misrepresenting the quality of mortgage securities they assembled and sold at the height of the housing bubble, and seeking billions of dollars in compensation.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/softbank-offloads-yahoo-stake-to-repay-loan/?ref=citigroupinc">Softbank Offloads Yahoo Stake to Repay Citigroup Loan<date>August 26, 2011, 9:00 am</date><text>Jo Yong-Hak/ReutersMasayoshi Son, chief of Softbank. TOKYO – The Japanese Internet and telecommunications company Softbank said Friday that it would offload most of its 4 percent stake in Yahoo to Citigroup to pay off a $1.1 billion loan. The sale is the latest step in a gradual unraveling of once-close relations between Yahoo, Softbank and another Asian Internet company, Alibaba. Softbank said in a statement that it would transfer its Yahoo shares to Citigroup to return a $1.136 billion loan it took out in 2004. Under an agreement made at the time, Softbank would repay either in cash or Yahoo shares.

The portal site Yahoo Japan, operated by Softbank, now uses Google technology instead of Yahoo’s. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma, has been keen to buy back Yahoo’s 40 percent stake in the Chinese company. Because Yahoo’s share price has slumped almost 50 percent since then, Softbank’s stake is worth about $660 million. After the transfer, the Japanese company’s stake in Yahoo will fall to 0.002 percent. Softbank, which runs Japan’s third-largest wireless network, owns 42 percent of Yahoo Japan, while Yahoo in the United States has 35 percent. There has been speculation that Yahoo is looking to shed its stake in the joint venture.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/as-irene-approaches-banks-prepare-for-the-worst/?ref=citigroupinc">As Irene Approaches, Banks Prepare for the Worst<date>August 26, 2011, 12:58 pm</date><text>  5:37 p.m. | Updated As Hurricane Irene travels up the East Coast, New York is steeling itself for potential disaster. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the state on Thursday, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has urged city residents of low-lying areas to evacuate their homes by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Wall Street, too, is entering the bunker. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Interactive Feature: Hurricane Irene Tracking Map Many of New York’s largest investment banks have their headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, and thus fall outside the city’s designated flood zones. Bank of America‘s 1 Bryant Park skyscraper, Citigroup‘s 399 Park Avenue building, Morgan Stanley‘s 1585 Broadway bureau, and JPMorgan Chase‘s 270 Park Avenue offices are all outside the zones. Credit Suisse‘s tower, located a little further south at 11 Madison Avenue, also carries a “no zone” designation. But the headquarters of Goldman Sachs, located at 200 West Street in Battery Park City, is located in Zone A, the low-lying area that the mayor has ordered to be evacuated. So is American Express‘s office in the World Financial Center. Deutsche Bank‘s 60 Wall Street headquarters, several blocks away from Goldman, is in Zone B. A Goldman spokesman declined to detail the bank’s hurricane preparations, but said that the bank had “plans in place to ensure the safety of our people and the ongoing operation of our business.” A Deutsche Bank spokesman said in a statement: “We are monitoring the storm closely and keeping employees informed with regular updates. We have already taken steps to ensure that we can conduct business as usual while maintaining the safety of all our employees, which is of utmost importance.” Some Midtown banks have second offices in high-risk zones. The Tribeca office of Citigroup, located near the Hudson River at 388 Greenwich Street, is in Zone A, as is Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, also in the World Financial Center. Citigroup’s Tribeca office houses its investment bank and trading floor. Merrill Lynch Wealth Management employees and other tenants of the World Financial Center were sent instructions for a “controlled lockdown” on Friday, but a spokeswoman for Brookfield, the building’s manager, said the lockdown protocol had been superseded by Mayor Bloomberg’s evacuation order. Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said that the bank had off-site offices in undisclosed locations available in the case that employees are unable to get to their normal locations. “Citi is committed to providing uninterrupted service to our clients during the storm and seeks to minimize any possible impact,” she said. Goldman Sachs, normally a bastion of conservative fashion, has told employees in some divisions they can dress casually on Monday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a memo, the firm instructed employees to “exercise good judgment” when determining proper dress. Some banks have begun booking hotel rooms for critical employees who may not otherwise be able to make it in to Manhattan, and a professional golf tournament sponsored by Barclays, which was scheduled to finish on Sunday, was shortened to 54 holes from 72 holes because of the impending storm. Chase announced that it would keep its 376 New York City branches open until 8 PM on Friday, to give customers ample time to complete banking transactions before the storm. It said the branches would be open until 11 a.m. on Saturday. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is located at 33 Liberty Street, said, “We are monitoring the storm and have contingency plans in place and multiple levels of redundancies to ensure regular operational functioning.” A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, John Nester, said: “We have been communicating throughout the day with markets and securities firms on whether the markets will be open Monday. Discussions will continue Saturday and Sunday as appropriate. The markets will make the decision whether to open in consultation with the S.E.C.” The New York Stock Exchange, which at 11 Wall Street is located in Zone C, is “planning to open on Monday,” a spokesman said, though it has a number of options if the storm makes that impossible, such as routing trades to its electronic market.

The planned issuance, a group of bonds backed by commercial mortgages that was valued at $1.5 billion, was scheduled to be carried out in late July. But a last-minute decision by Standard &amp; Poor’s to re-examine its criteria for evaluating so-called conduit securities, or ones with multiple borrowers, meant that it would not rate the banks’ joint offering. Without a stamp of approval, the deal was effectively dead. The bond package, known as GC4, has become something of an albatross for the banks. The deal had already been priced, after having been revised several times to attract buyers, and had already been parceled out to investors when S.&amp; P. decided not to rate it. The decision sent both banks into a scramble, and led competitors, including the Blackstone Group, to assure investors that their commercial mortgage-backed securities would be unaffected. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Bond Sale Thwarted By S.&amp;P. In the weeks surrounding the failed sale of GC4, both Warren Geiger, the head of commercial bond trading at Citigroup, and Matthew Salem, Mr. Geiger’s equivalent at Goldman, left their positions. A Citigroup spokeswoman, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, said at the time that Mr. Geiger’s departure was unrelated to the failed sale. Representatives from Goldman and Citigroup declined to comment on the hiring of Moody’s, which was reported earlier by Dow Jones Newswires. A rating from Moody’s will give new life to the bond package, but the market turbulence of the last few weeks may have taken a toll. With more uncertainty over the commercial real estate picture than in late July and greater premiums demanded for risky investments, it remains to be seen whether the deal will command anywhere near the $1.5 billion it was originally anticipated to bring in. The move to another rating agency may also focus more attention on S.&amp;P., which is already being questioned over its decision to cut its rating on United States debt.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/s-p-s-new-president-a-crisis-troubleshooter/?ref=citigroupinc">S.&amp;P.'s New President, a Crisis Troubleshooter<date>August 23, 2011, 9:10 am</date><text>Yoshikazu Tsuno/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDouglas L.

Mr. Peterson is taking over S.&amp;P. from Deven Sharma at a time when the agency is dealing with outcry over a ratings downgrade of United States debt, inquiries over its rating of subprime mortgage securities and activist pressure on its parent company, McGraw-Hill. (A Citigroup internal memorandum has more about Mr. Peterson’s departure.) Since last year, he has worked as chief operating officer of Citigroup‘s retail and commercial banking unit. But he has one item on his résumé that shows he knows how to deal with a crisis: his stewardship of Citi’s Japanese operations after its private bank there was accused of securities law violations. In May 2004, Mr. Peterson was appointed by Citi’s then chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, as the point man to handle the fallout. The Japanese government eventually decided to withdraw the Citi unit’s operational license, forcing the firm to close the unit down.

After that scandal, he built up Citi’s presence in Japan, especially after the firm became the first foreign bank to obtain a local operating license. Citi purchased the country’s third-largest brokerage, Nikko Cordial, in a $10.8 billion deal that required a great deal of sensitivity. But the bank’s dreams of establishing a sprawling universal bank in Japan faded after the financial crisis and it needed to raise fresh capital. Mr. Peterson oversaw the dismantling of Citi’s Japan operations, including the Nikko businesses. “Just a week or two after reaffirming Citi’s commitment to Japan, Vikram says we’re splitting,” a bank executive told MarketWatch in 2010, referring to current Citi chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit. “It could have made him [Peterson] look like a liar, or like he was out of touch, but he didn’t let himself get bogged down in that — he said O.K. and played the hand he was dealt.” Mr. Peterson returned to the United States that year to take on another operational challenge, helping to rehabilitate Citi’s huge retail and commercial lending arm, Citibank.

The decision by Mr. Sharma to resign comes as the ratings agency is under pressure from several fronts, including an inquiry by the Justice Department into its ratings of subprime mortgage securities and a push by activist investors to break up its parent company, McGraw-Hill. Mr. Sharma will be replaced by Douglas Peterson, a top executive at Citigroup, the company said on Monday. The management change had been in the works for months and was unrelated to either the Justice Department’s inquiry or to the emergence of the activist investors, Jana Partners and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Sharma, 55, will step down on Sept. 12, but will remain with the company through the end of the year to help oversee McGraw-Hill’s review of its businesses. His replacement, Mr. Peterson, 53, is currently the chief operating officer of Citibank, the banking unit of Citigroup. “We are pleased to welcome Doug to the important role of president of Standard &amp; Poor’s as it continues to build on the enhancements of recent years and accelerates global growth,” Harold McGraw III, McGraw-Hill’s chief executive, said in a statement. He added, “As we welcome Doug, I particularly want to thank Deven for his dedicated leadership of S.&amp;P.” One of the most recognized names in finance, Standard &amp; Poor’s is composed of two separate businesses. One is its credit rating agency, a vital cog in global capitalism that monitors the corporate world’s debt issuances. The other is a unit that manages its index products like the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. The ratings agency’s decision to downgrade the United States’ long-term credit rating to AA+ from AAA on Aug. 5 set off a storm of controversy, including criticism by President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. The decision contributed heavily to the worst drop in American stocks since the financial crisis three years ago, as well as volatility that continues to whipsaw the markets weeks later. The other big ratings agencies, Moody’s and Fitch, maintained their top-tier rating on United States debt. At the same time, the agency is being investigated over whether it improperly rated mortgage securities in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Standard &amp; Poor’s, along with the other major ratings agencies, gave their highest ratings to bundles of troubled loans that appeared less risky during the housing boom, but have since collapsed in value. Since the financial crisis, the agencies’ business practices and models have been scrutinized by Congress, and Standard &amp; Poor’s is also being investigated by the Justice Department, people briefed on the matter have previously said. At issue is whether the agency’s independent analysis was driven by profits. The Justice Department inquiry, which began before the Standard &amp; Poor’s downgrade of the United States’ debt, is centered on whether analysts’ decisions to assign securities a low credit rating on subprime mortgage loans were overruled by business managers. Meanwhile, the activist investors pushing for change at McGraw-Hill have recommended that Standard &amp; Poor’s ratings business appoint a “well-known independent oversight figure” to handle government relations. But people briefed on the matter said Mr. Sharma had been considering stepping down well before the latest attacks on the company. They say that Mr. Sharma first began pondering his options after McGraw-Hill announced last November that Standard &amp; Poor’s would be split into its two component businesses. That corporate reorganization left Mr. Sharma with less responsibility, leading him to ask about his odds of eventually becoming the company’s chief executive. He was informed that such a move would be unlikely, prompting his desire to leave, one of these people said. Then McGraw-Hill began a search for his successor at Standard &amp; Poor’s, this person added. Mr. Sharma has been with the company for just under five years, and became president of Standard &amp; Poor’s almost exactly four years ago. His appointment coincided with the beginning of one of the most controversial and tumultuous periods in the history of the 151-year-old company, which was acquired by McGraw-Hill in 1966. McGraw-Hill’s board eventually signed off on his resignation in a meeting on Monday. That was the same day that top executives met with representatives from Jana and Ontario Teachers, who presented a plan to split the company into four groups: an education business, a media and information arm, S.&amp;P.’s ratings and financial business and its Standard &amp; Poor’s indexes. The investors’ rationale is that the four units share little in common operationally and have different, and sometimes conflicting, capital needs. And the high-growth operations like S.&amp;P.’s have been hidden by the low growth at divisions like publishing and education. Many of Jana’s recommendations are in line with the thinking of research analysts. According to Goldman Sachs, McGraw-Hill is undervalued by 20 percent compared with its peers. McGraw-Hill was already reviewing its portfolio of businesses by the time Jana, a hedge fund based in New York, and the Ontario Teachers fund, of Canada, built up their stake to 5.6 percent. Mr. McGraw has said the company expects to make a major announcement in the second half of the year. Azam Ahmed and Nelson D.

And despite the stock market’s recent craziness, they are almost as hot as some of the stocks they cover. Long after star analysts of the dot-com era self-destructed, along with Pets.com and its sock puppet, a new generation of Wall Street researchers is grabbing attention — and a lot of money. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink These Internet analysts are nowhere nearly as famous (or infamous) as Jack Grubman and Henry Blodget, who came to symbolize the conflicted, let’s-put-lipstick-on-this-pig research of the dot-com era. Nor are they as influential as Mary Meeker, the onetime Queen of the Net at Morgan Stanley, whose pronouncements captivated the investing public in the late 1990s. But not since those heady days of the Nasdaq stock market bubble has working as a technology analyst seemed so, well, sexy. Even as the economy wobbles again, there’s money to be made in providing banking advice to big names like Facebook. And the great investment houses are sparring over specialists in Web search and social media, who are hired to tell the stories of these hot companies to investors. Such analysts have been jumping from one bank to another, chasing the highest offer. Today, some of these analysts are pulling down several million dollars a year — figures that, not so long ago, would have been almost unthinkable. Graphic: Three Analysts’ Stock Recommendations (Click for Larger Image) Even in Wall Street circles, some people wonder whether all of this is another sign that Internet mania is again spinning out of control. Add to this the recent turbulence in the financial markets — including big declines in technology stocks — and you might conclude that some analysts yet again were telling investors to buy at exactly the wrong time. Gustavo G. Dolfino, president of a Wall Street recruitment firm, the WhiteRock Group, has conducted searches for roughly a dozen analyst positions so far this year, versus seven in all of 2010. “It is red-hot out there,” Mr. Dolfino says. Whether the bull market in technology specialists will last if the economy and markets sour is anyone’s guess. Hype or not, talk that companies like LinkedIn, Facebook and Groupon will change the way we live and do business — and make their shareholders rich in the process — has Wall Street pining for the fees that come with taking these companies public. And, in turn, the banks need people who can explain these companies to investors and, hopefully, spot the right time to buy or sell. Banking executives rarely talk publicly about how much they pay employees, particularly their stars. But privately, insiders at several banks have been buzzing about a number of Internet analysts who made big-money moves this year. According to people familiar with the compensation of various analysts, here are three analysts who have done well of late: Douglas Anmuth was lured to JPMorgan Chase earlier this year with a pay package valued at roughly $2 million. He had been making about $1.3 million at Barclays Capital, an arm of the British bank. Heather Bellini landed at Goldman Sachs with a remarkable pay package worth almost $3 million. And Mark Mahaney, whom JPMorgan tried to hire with an offer of about $3 million, stayed on at Citigroup — after getting a raise. The three analysts, as well as media officers for the banks, declined to comment for this article. ON the surface, the work of a stock analyst might seem straightforward. You size up companies, run the numbers, handicap potential winners and losers and issue one of three classic stock recommendations: buy, hold or sell. In practice, it’s more complicated than that. Even after the dot-com imbroglio, the subsequent research scandal, the financial collapse of 2008-9 and all the ups and downs in between, Wall Street rarely says “sell.” Even now, for instance, just a handful of the 38 analysts who cover Bank of America, one of the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average so far this year, have a “sell” recommendation on it, according to Bloomberg. Nor, according to that data, are there very many sells on I.B.M., Microsoft, Yahoo, General Motors, General Electric, Google or Apple — the list goes on. One possible explanation is that Wall Street research reflects the inherent optimism of the marketplace — the attitude that says, “Hey, you gotta believe!” Another is that Wall Street is in the business of advising corporations and selling investments, so why bother trashing too many stocks? Whatever the case, analysts have typically ranked far below traders and bankers in Wall Street’s pecking order, in both pay and prestige. Headliners of the 1990s like Mr. Blodget, Mr. Grubman and Ms. Meeker broke out by becoming the public faces of Wall Street. Late in that decade, after Mr. Blodget correctly predicted that the share price of Amazon.com would vault above $400 — from less than $250 at the time — a new phrase entered the investment lexicon: to “Blodget” a stock. It meant that analysts could cause such a stir with seemingly over-the-top predictions that those predictions would become self-fulfilling. But the Nasdaq collapse laid bare conflicts at the heart of the Wall Street research machine. Many analysts, it turned out, were pushing stocks to help their banks win lucrative investment banking business. They were issuing favorable research reports and pitching corporate clients to clinch deals. It was good fun while it lasted, at least for some top analysts, who were pulling down $15 million or even more a year. Regulators cracked down. As part of a landmark settlement over research in 2003, major banks paid a $1.4 billion fine. Mr. Blodget and Mr. Grubman were banished from the securities industry. (Mr. Blodget is now editor in chief and C.E.O. of the Business Insider, a business and news Web site. Mr. Grubman is a managing partner at the Magee Group, giving strategic advice to telecom, media and tech companies.) The settlement forced banks to change the way their research departments operated. To avoid conflicts of interest, banks were barred from subsidizing analyst research with revenue from their investment-banking operations. Regulators specified that analysts be paid based on seniority, experience, quality of research and the demand for their services in the marketplace — not on the deals they help wrangle. Wall Street research has been searching for a viable business model ever since. Without the rich backing of investment banking, analysts’ pay plummeted. In 2001, analysts earned an average of $1.45 million. By 2005, that figure had dropped to less than $800,000, according to a study by three Harvard professors, Boris Groysberg, Paul M. Healy and David A. Maber. Professor Healy says research budgets have been cut sharply, and people who run research departments agree. One says his analysts, on average, now earn about $700,000 a year in salary and bonus. Granted, many ordinary Americans would be thrilled to make $700,000 a year. But on Planet Wall Street, it has been a big letdown for former stars. The 2003 Wall Street analyst settlement, led by Eliot Spitzer when he was the New York attorney general, still haunts the industry. Banks are often reluctant to give raises to analysts who cover industries in which their investment bankers are particularly active, for fear of drawing regulators’ attention. But just when you think the glory days of Wall Street analysts are over, the bidding wars for the new breed of Internet analysts suggest otherwise. WHATEVER financial pros say about the numbers and the metrics, the stock market is often about stories. What companies capture the imagination? Inspire a little old-fashioned greed or fear? One big story right now is social media. After LinkedIn went public at $45 a share this year, its share price shot as high as $122.91. The run-up gave LinkedIn one of the highest valuations, based on its ratio of stock price to earnings, of any nonfinancial company in the United States. Was Wall Street insane? It was great news for LinkedIn investors, and for companies like Facebook, which appears set to go public in the next year. Recent private investments in Facebook have valued that company at more than $100 billion. Some analysts are still upbeat. LinkedIn’s stock has since come off the boil, closing at $79.03 on Friday. But of the six analysts who cover the stock regularly, according to Thomson Reuters, two say “buy.” Three have “hold” recommendations, and one has an “underperform” rating on it, which means you should really start thinking about selling. Given the heat in this market, tech analysts are sitting pretty. The 2003 settlement laid out conditions under which analysts can get pay raises. One easy way is to get a job offer from a rival bank. “We have some leeway in pay,” says a bank research executive, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified for fear of tipping his hand to competitors. “But once an analyst has a competing offer, we can move if we want to bump pay substantially.” But analysts are a bit like stocks: they go in and out of style and are often hostage to marketplace whims. Those who happen to cover booming industries, or sectors ripe for takeovers, tend to get the most attention. Oil, mining, information technology, emerging economies — these areas are of particular focus to investors today, and, therefore, so are the analysts who cover them. Bryan Keane, an analyst who covers technology service companies like Accenture, got a pay bump of several hundred thousand dollars for moving to Deutsche Bank from Credit Suisse, according to people with knowledge of his pay. Mr. Keane and Deutsche Bank officials declined to comment. But Internet analysts are by far the hottest commodities. That is partly a function of the story, partly a function of supply. At the height of the dot-com boom, no fewer than 616 Wall Street analysts were covering Internet companies. Today, the figure is 362, according to data from Thomson Reuters. And fewer than a dozen of those specialize in social networking stocks, as Mr. Anmuth does. Mr. Mahaney at Citigroup covers Pandora, and some people expect he will cover Facebook. As long as investors bid up these stocks, Wall Street will keep bidding up the price of its analysts. BUT for better or worse, it seems unlikely that this new class of Internet analysts will ever rival the dot-com generation in reach and influence. The irony is that the Web, which these analysts embrace and celebrate, has actually shrunk their roles in the marketplace. These days, investors trawl through blogs and comment posts, run their own numbers and compare notes with other investors. Analysts are no longer the only game in town for insight and advice. And, of course, there is the matter of trust, and whether analysts as a group can ever fully regain it. Some of the tarnish of the dot-com era has stuck. Inside banks, analysts no longer have their old cachet because they can no longer help bring in investment-banking business. The good news is that some of today’s Internet analysts seem more tempered in their predictions than their predecessors did. In late June, Mr. Anmuth issued a positive report on LinkedIn after his employer, JPMorgan, helped take the company public. LinkedIn, he wrote, was “disrupting both the online and offline job recruitment markets.” With the stock then trading at around $76, he set a price target of $85. But on July 18, after shares of LinkedIn raced past $100, Mr. Anmuth pulled back. He downgraded his rating from overweight to neutral. Whether investors will listen is anyone’s guess.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/the-advisers-behind-h-p-s-autonomy-deal/?ref=citigroupinc">The Advisers Behind H.P.'s Autonomy Deal<date>August 18, 2011, 6:09 pm</date><text>12:00 a.m. | Updated How many advisers does it take to put together a $11.7 billion technology deal?

Among the prominent names in listing are two boutique firms. One is Qatalyst Partners, the investment bank run by Frank P. Quattrone. Mr. Quattrone, the Silicon Valley veteran, who also had a hand in Motorola Mobility‘s proposed $12.5 billion sale to Google earlier this week, sold two other companies to H.P. last year: Palm for $1.2 billion and 3Par for $2 billion. And then there’s Perella Weinberg Partners, one of H.P.’s two main advisers, alongside Barclays Capital. Perella is also advising H.P. on the possible spinoff of its personal computing business. Meanwhile, Barclays is also the sole arranger of debt financing for H.P., in a role similar to JPMorgan Chase‘s blockbuster lender role in AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion deal for T-Mobile USA. (To recap: JPMorgan provided an enormous $20 billion bridge loan to AT&amp;T, a longtime client. Of course, JPMorgan later syndicated the loan.) While DealBook couldn’t learn how much Barclays is lending, the bank is expected to cover a significant amount of the purchase price. The deal could lead to relatively big paydays for the companies’ main advisers. H.P. could pay Perella and Barclays $27 million to $34 million, according to calculations by the consulting firm Freeman &amp; Company.

That appears to be the mind-set of many nervous investors when it comes this week to financial stocks, which are down more than the broader market. Goldman Sachs is down almost 12 percent since Monday’s open. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are both down roughly 17 percent. Citigroup dropped 15 percent and JPMorgan Chase shares sank almost 9 percent. Some market insiders feel the sell-off is overdone. Bank executives are grumbling about it. There is nothing systemic seemingly going on here, they say. In some cases, banks have record-high capital levels thanks to recent regulatory rules requiring them to put up more capital against riskier businesses. Leverage, or how much money a firm borrows to fund its business, is down significantly since the financial crisis. An optimist may even argue these stocks are a screaming buy right now. All of the country’s biggest financial stocks are trading below book value, or crucial financial measure that refers to the liquidation value of a company’s assets if it were forced to sell everything. So what gives? No one cares about all that right now. “What you are seeing is the manic ‘I remember 2008’ selling,” said Glenn Schorr, a banking analyst with Nomura. “And the only thing that worked then was to get out of the way and not come back too early. The more cash they have, the safer people feel right now.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links A Rough Patch for Hedge Funds Europe Weighs Short Selling Ban Holders of financial stocks, burned by what happened in 2008, don’t want to stick around and see how this latest bump in the road ends, especially given the questions surrounding bank exposure to Europe, continued litigation stemming from the credit crisis and the potential impact of a possible recession, which threatens to crimp big money makers for the banks, including M.&amp;A., underwriting and beyond. Mr. Schorr said while most banks have stated they have bought protection to hedge against their exposure in Europe, bank investors are worried it may not matter. “There may be a voluntary restructuring instead of an actual bankruptcy so the protection they have bought might not pay off,” he said. Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities, is downright pessimistic, saying concerns over Europe and litigation are just a symptoms of larger problem, one that is systemic. “This is a continuation of 2008,” he said. “We are finally coming to grips with the fact we have a massive debt problem that needs to be dealt with. This is not a problem for our grandchildren. It is our problem. We have a financial system structured on a bankrupt currency and that system is now breaking down and a new system will arise to replace it, but we don’t yet anything to replace it. “ Mr. Bove said recently moved all his holdings into cash. While everyone’s hair seems to be on fire this week, major players including Fidelity, Wellington Management and AllianceBernstein have been big sellers of financial stocks for months now, regulatory filings show. This selling points perhaps to another concern about these stocks. Financial firms, with lower leverage levels and more rigorous capital requirements, simply won’t be able to generate anywhere near the returns they did before the financial crisis. Goldman’s return on equity was just 8 percent in the second half of this year, down from more than 30 percent in 2006. Banks argue that big shareholders are always selling in and out of their stocks. This week’s hubbub aside, the selling by some of these long-term holders suggests that concerns run deep. And even though the country’s banks are well capitalized and have significantly lowered their leverage levels since the crisis, it may be some time before investors wade in again.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/financial-stocks-plunge-in-us-as-anxiety-rises-over-european-bank-crisis.html?ref=citigroupinc">Financial Stocks Plunge in U.S. as Anxiety Rises Over European Bank Crisis<date>Published: August 10, 2011</date><text>Fear is on the rise again that worsening problems at some of Europe’s biggest banks may wind up hurting financial institutions in the United States.The clearest signs of the anxiety are in the stock market, where shares of American banks plunged again on Wednesday. Bank of America dropped almost 11 percent. Citigroup sank 10.5 percent. Goldman Sachs fell 10 percent, while Morgan Stanley was down 9.7 percent. All told, bank stocks have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year — and have swung wildly up and down over the last week — as the weakening economy is expected to take a toll on business and reduce earnings. But concerns about European banks are driving the latest wave of selling. Société Générale’s share price dropped 14.7 percent on Wednesday, the most of any European bank, as its chief executive “denied all rumors” that he said caused the stock to fall. Other European giants were alsopounded. Shares of Intesa Sanpaolo of Italy fell nearly 14 percent. Crédit Agricole and AXA Financial of France dropped more than 10 percent apiece. Financial institutions across the Continent have huge holdings of government and corporate bonds from Italy and Spain. Doubts about the financial health of European lenders are encouraging investors to unload their shares and driving up their borrowing costs. Those banks, in turn, trade billions daily with their counterparts on Wall Street. They also rely on billions of dollars invested by American money market mutual funds to finance loans and other investments. That has created a vicious circle, where fears about the soundness of European banks are feeding new concerns about the stability of American financial institutions. “The European situation is back and isn’t going away,” said Alex Roever, the head of short-term fixed income at JPMorgan Chase. “It continues to keep pressure on the market.” Only a few months ago, American banks looked as if they had finally found their footing. Loan losses were easing. Profits and bonuses were back. Even some of the new regulations had turned out to be not as draconian as many bankers once believed. But there has been a steady drumbeat of dismal headlines in the last few weeks. First, weak data for the housing market and the broader economy suggested that banks would find it even harder to grow. Standard &amp; Poor’s downgrade of the United States government further rattled confidence, the lifeblood of the financial system. Then, in a sign of how grim things had become, the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of pledging to keep interest rates near zero for the next two years. That may prevent the economy from slipping into another recession, but it will squeeze lending profits that make up the bulk of banks’ income. And that comes as demand is already slowing for all kinds of loans and a wave of deal making has been shelved. “Everyone is going to be lowering their estimates,” said David Ellison, the chief investment officer of two FBR mutual funds that invest in financial companies. “You are going to have lower loan growth and lower margins; we are in a new era.” If that were not enough, there are lingering worries about the legal hangover from the housing bust. Bank of America, which faces potentially tens of billions of dollars in investor claims, held an unusual conference call on Wednesday to reassure shareholders it could cope with all settlements, among other concerns. Its shares fell to $6.77 on Wednesday, after reaching a postcrisis high of almost $20 in April 2010. Now, as Europe’s fiscal troubles spread to core trading partners like France, there are renewed fears of contagion. The links between French and American institutions, after all, are orders of magnitude larger than they are between American banks and say, Greek, or even Spanish ones. For example, according to the Bank for International Settlements, French banks owed American institutions more than $160 billion at the end of 2010.  Spanish banks owed less than $20 billion. And that’s not counting the billions of dollars that big American banks lend directly to overseas companies or any European government debt they hold as investments. Nowhere is that nervousness greater than in the short-term financing markets, where European banks turn to American money funds each day for tens of billions of dollars in funding. 1 2 Next Page »Fear is on the rise again that worsening problems at some of Europe’s biggest banks may wind up hurting financial institutions in the United States.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/citi-and-american-airlines-to-offer-an-e-m-v-card/?ref=citigroupinc">Citi and American Airlines to Offer an E.M.V.

The card carries a host of travel perks as well as a hefty $450 annual fee, and an E.M.V. version is expected to be available sometime later this year, Citibank and American said in a press release. A Citibank spokeswoman declined to provide details on precisely when the chip cards would be made available, or to discuss whether the chips would be offered on less-pricey versions of the Citi AAdvantage card. In the press release, the companies noted that cards with E.M.V. chips — the initials stand for Europay, MasterCard and Visa — were “increasingly important when making credit card purchases abroad.” That’s for sure.

Goldman Sachs and Citigroup shelved plans for a large commercial mortgage bond sale on Wednesday night, after Standard &amp; Poor’s told them it would not rate the sale, the banks said in a joint statement. The planned offering, for a group of mortgage-backed bonds valued at $1.5 billion, had been expected to close on Thursday, after the banks had retooled the deal to entice buyers. The deal had already priced, and investors had already laid claim to the bonds, when S.&amp;P. announced that it was re-examining its criteria for evaluating certain types of “conduit” securities, or ones with multiple borrowers. That meant the Goldman/Citigroup joint bond package, called GC4, would no longer be rated as planned. Without a rating from the agency, the deal was doomed. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink S.&amp;P. indicated “that until its review is completed, it will not assign new ratings to transactions based on those criteria, including the GC4 transaction,” the banks’ statement said. “Standard &amp; Poor’s had previously informed Goldman and Citi that they were prepared to rate the GC4 transaction.” The failed offering comes at a tough time for bond underwriters. Goldman recently reported disappointing second-quarter earnings — especially hard hit was revenue in the company’s fixed-income division, which includes bond underwriting and trading. Matthew Salem, Goldman’s head of commercial mortgage bond trading, was reported to have left the bank last week. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Mortgage-backed bond underwriting ground to a halt during the financial crisis, after the securities created havoc on balance sheets all over Wall Street. But the sector has recovered this year, with yields rising and more bonds being issued. On Thursday, after the S.&amp;P. decision, JPMorgan Chase sent a memo to its investors about one of its own commercial mortgage-backed securities, a $425 million bond package to finance a hotel portfolio owned by the Blackstone Group, according to Dow Jones. That transaction would not be affected by the new ratings criteria, JPMorgan said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/once-unthinkable-breakup-of-big-banks-now-seems-feasible/?ref=citigroupinc">Once Unthinkable, Breakup of Big Banks Now Seems Feasible<date>July 27, 2011, 3:48 pm</date><text>Bebeto Matthews/Associated PressJohn A. Thain, chief of Merrill Lynch, left, and Kenneth D. Lewis, chief of Bank of America, in 2008. What was made can be unmade. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo may have venerable names, but they and the pseudo-venerable Citigroup and Bank of America are all products of countless mergers and agglomerations. There is no rule of markets that requires a financial system dominated by four cobbled-together, lumbering behemoths. Lawmakers and regulators have failed to remake our system with smaller, safer institutions. What about investors? Big bank stocks have been persistently weak, making breakups that seemed politically impossible no longer unthinkable. Bank of America’s recent quarterly earnings were so weak that investors and commentators wondered whether the bank should sell off Merrill Lynch, the investment bank for which it foolishly overpaid at the height of the crisis. Bank of America trades at half of its book value (the stated value of its assets minus its liabilities), an indication that investors view its asset quality and prospects just a notch below abominable, as Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg News pointed out last week. The Trade View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink For Bank of America, the question is whether it will have to raise capital. Selling shares at such depressed prices would be costly. Regulators won’t push for it. They just gave stress tests to the biggest banks, and merely restricted the bank from paying out a dividend. The logical solution is that Bank of America shed business lines in a bid to improve its prospects in the eyes of Wall Street. Citigroup’s stock, revenue and earnings have lagged for a decade. “Look, if you can’t compete in the major leagues for over a decade, it’s time to go back to the minors,” said the always outspoken Mike Mayo, an analyst with CLSA. His chronicle of ruffling bank management feathers, “Exile on Wall Street” (Wiley), will be published in the fall. JPMorgan Chase is as well managed as any gargantuan bank can be. But if you look at its businesses, it’s hard to see any area where it is clearly the best, something even its own executives concede. Not in credit cards, where the premier name is American Express. Not in money management, where you might offer up T. Rowe Price. Investment banking — Goldman Sachs (the last quarter notwithstanding). Back-office transactions, State Street. Yet even JPMorgan is merely trading at book value. Put another way, the market regards the value that JPMorgan provides as a financial services conglomerate as zilch. How well do all of JPMorgan’s divisions work together? In presentations to investors, JPMorgan executives show how much revenue they gain from existing clients. But these measures are hardly unbiased. Executives have an incentive to defend their empires. Who is to say that a certain division of JPMorgan wouldn’t have won that business anyway? And nobody measures how much a bank loses through conflicts of interest. Even in the face of investor pressure, there are forces that would hold bank breakups back. Mainly pay. “The biggest motivation for not breaking up is that top managers would earn less,” Mr. Mayo said. “That is part of the breakdown in the owner/manager relationship. That’s a breakdown in capitalism.” Institutional investors — the major owners of the banks — are passive and conflicted. They don’t like to go public with complaints. They have extensive business ties with the banks. The few hedge fund activist investors who aren’t cowed would most likely balk at taking on such an enormous target. Also, there are reasons to think that smaller banks wouldn’t necessarily make the system safer. A wave of small bank failures can have systemic effects, as was the case in the Great Depression. Focused companies like Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns failed in the recent crisis, worsening it. Making a nuanced argument, John Hempton, a blogger, investor and former regulator in Australia, says that it’s better for shareholders — and societies — to have large banks with lots of market power. That makes them more profitable and leads them to take less risk, making them safer and more enticing for investors. Another oft-trotted-out argument against breakups: The United States needs global banks to service its giant, multinational corporations and to preserve our position in world markets. Color me unconvinced. When a giant corporation wants to do a major bond offering or a big company goes public, the banks, despite their size, don’t want to shoulder all the risk themselves, preferring to share the responsibility. If the stocks continue to lag for quarters upon years, these arguments will seem less convincing, while institutional reluctance will begin to erode. Investors don’t care about size, they care about performance. It’s undeniable that smaller banks are easier to manage. And they are easier for regulators to unwind — and therefore less terrifying to trading partners — when they fail. One of the most remarkable aspects of the debate about overhauling the financial system after the great crisis was the absence of serious contemplation of breaking up the largest banks. It’s not a perfect solution. Banks responding to investor pressure would react haphazardly. But it’s a good start.

The performance of the investment bank, which has largely shed the legacy of the financial meltdown, points to the new reality on Wall Street. Amid regulatory and economic uncertainty, Goldman is struggling to lift its earnings power to precrisis levels. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release The second-quarter profit of $1.85 a share fell short of analysts’ expectations of $2.27 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Still, it was an improvement for the period a year earlier, when Goldman posted a profit of $453 million, or 78 cents a share. The fixed-income department took a big hit in the quarter. The unit, which includes fixed Income, currency and commodities client execution, logged net revenue of $1.60 billion, 53 percent lower than in the second quarter of 2010; results were down in mortgages, commodities and interest rate products. The firm substantially reduced its risk in the three months ended June 30, an overly conservative approach that cost millions in the short term, said a person with knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak on the record. Goldman, in part, hedged its trading activities, a move that ate into profit. It also robbed the company of the upside in certain commodities like oil, the person said. David Viniar, Goldman’s chief financial officer, didn’t mince words on the firm’s call with analysts to discuss earnings. “I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” he said. “We underperformed.” The results in the fixed income department, he said, were among the weakest in the firm’s 12-year history as a public company. By one key measure, Goldman — usually considered one of Wall Street’s biggest risk takers — played it safer than in the past. Its value at risk, roughly what the firm could lose on an average day because of bad market conditions, fell to $101 million in the second quarter, down 10 percent from the first three months of the year. Chris Kleponis/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesLloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs. “During the second quarter, the operating environment was more difficult given global macroeconomic concerns,” said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chairman and chief executive. “In addition, certain of our businesses had disappointing results as we reduced our market risk in response to attempting to manage fluctuations in prices and market liquidity.” Not all banks were created equal this quarter, and others appeared willing to take more risk than Goldman. With its diversified business model, JPMorgan Chase posted a quarterly profit of $5.4 billion, up 13 percent from the period a year earlier. Citigroup also had a strong showing, as improvements in lending helped offset lackluster trading results. By comparison, Goldman is more dependent on the commissions generated from trading, which dropped sharply in recent months. Overall revenue at the bank fell to $7.28 billion from $8.8 billion in the period a year earlier. “Trading activity has been extremely slow,” said a Nomura stock analyst, Glenn Schorr, who accurately predicted the bank’s earnings at $1.85 a share. While the decision to dial back risk ate into profits in Goldman’s fixed income department, the firm’s other divisions posted decent returns. Net revenue in investment banking was $1.45 billion, 54 percent higher than the second quarter of 2010. Within investment banking, bond underwriting saw the best rise in net revenue, increasing 77 percent over year-ago levels to $433 million. Net revenue in investment management was $1.27 billion, 12 percent higher than the second quarter of 2010. Another closely watched number at Goldman is the compensation ratio, or percentage of net revenue allocated to pay employees. It has set aside $8.44 billion for compensation this year, while it had earmarked $9.3 billion during the same period in 2010. Most of the compensation at the firm, which comes in the form of one-time bonuses, is not allocated until the fourth quarter, so it is too early to predict the final numbers. But compensation will most likely fall if the results do not improve in the second half of the year. In an attempt to reduce overall costs, Goldman is planning to layoff employees and cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses in the next 11 months.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/business/second-lien-loans-may-prompt-new-losses-for-banks.html?ref=citigroupinc">Second-Lien Loans May Prompt New Losses for Banks<date>Published: July 16, 2011</date><text>HAVE you heard the good news?

Still to be dealt with are potentially large legal bills — and settlements — related to accusations that many banks acted improperly, first in bundling all those loans into mortgage securities, and later in foreclosing on homeowners. Under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, banks have been estimating the potential damage in their financial filings. Last October, the S.E.C. warned them to be scrupulous in detailing risks associated with demands that they buy back soured loans or securities, as well as about possible defects in securitizations and foreclosures. But while the S.E.C. has been pressing banks to make comprehensive disclosures about these potential pitfalls, regulators have been quiet on another worry for investors: how banks are valuing their vast holdings of home equity lines of credit, also known as second liens. Privately, however, the S.E.C. has been pushing banks hard on this issue, according to Meredith Cross, the director of the commission’s corporation finance unit. As regulators review banks’ annual reports, they are asking tough questions about how institutions are valuing their second liens. Ms. Cross expects banks to provide more details about these loans in quarterly reports due next month. The numbers are significant. Banks held $624 billion of such loans in the first quarter, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data show. Millions of these loans are deeply troubled. According to CoreLogic, a real estate data concern, almost 11 million of the nation’s mortgaged properties — nearly 23 percent of the total — were underwater at the end of March. Some 4.5 million of those properties carried home equity loans, according to CoreLogic. The average amount of negative equity shouldered by borrowers across the nation was $65,000. WHEN first mortgages run into trouble, second liens are at greater peril, even if homeowners manage to keep up with their payments. That is because in a foreclosure, first mortgages are supposed to be paid off before second mortgages. It is not clear that is happening, however. Banks like the big four — JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo — not only hold home equity lines but also service first mortgages held by others on the same properties. Some analysts worry that servicers are able to protect their own holdings of second-lien loans while foreclosing on the first liens. “The big four are pretending that the second liens are still money good because many are still performing,” said Christopher Whalen, editor of the Institutional Risk Analyst, a research publication. By performing, he means that borrowers are still making payments, if only the minimum. Many home equity lines require only the payment of interest for the first 10 years. Banks have written off about $500 billion in assets since 2008, Mr. Whalen said. Most of those assets were related to housing, but write-downs on second liens have been pretty sparse so far at the big banks. As of the first quarter of this year, Bank of America carried $136 billion of second liens on its books. During 2010, it wrote down $6.8 billion. Wells Fargo held $108 billion in such loans in the first quarter; it wrote down $4.7 billion last year. JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to second liens stood at $60 billion at the end of the second quarter. The bank charged off $1.3 billion in the first half of 2011 and $3.44 billion in 2010, said Joseph M. Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank. As for how Morgan values these assets, he said that since 2010 the bank has routinely reserved for the higher probability of defaults on them, assuming an average loss rate of 60 percent on high-risk second liens. Citibank’s home equity lines of credit totaled $46 billion last March; $6.2 billion belonged to borrowers with credit scores below 660 — that is, risky — and consisted of loan amounts that were greater than the values of the underlying properties. Spokeswomen for Wells Fargo and Citigroup declined to comment. Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, says the bank considers whether first mortgages are distressed when valuing home equity loans. If the second liens are performing, the bank doesn’t book a full loss on them. But if foreclosure seems inevitable on a first mortgage, the bank books a 100 percent loss on the second lien, he said. But Mr. Whalen suspects some values are too high. The trouble in the housing market does not appear to be reflected fully on bank balance sheets yet. . “If home prices do not stabilize, much less recover, then banks are likely to feel pressure to begin wholesale write-downs of first and second liens,” Mr. Whalen said. “There is probably as much loss prospectively facing the banking industry as a whole on residential real estate exposures as have already been charged off.” DENIAL in the banking industry — known in the trade as “extend and pretend” — is a powerful thing. But it works for only so long.HAVE you heard the good news? Big banks are making more money than we thought. On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase said it earned $5.4 billion during the second quarter.

Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg NewsVikram S. Pandit, chief of Citigroup. 8:43 p.m. | Updated For two and a half years, Vikram S. Pandit was forced to hunker down to fix Citigroup’s troubled businesses and fend off the bank’s critics in Washington. Now, after reporting a 24 percent profit increase for the second quarter, Mr. Pandit, Citi’s chief executive, is starting to play offense. Citigroup has been hiring dozens of investment bankers, dialing up advertising and drawing up plans to add several hundred branches from Buenos Aires to Bucharest, including more than 200 in major cities across the United States. The bank is in the middle of stitching together its disparate technology systems — a mammoth effort known internally as Project Rainbow — and spending more than $1 billion a year to keep up its prized global transaction services franchise. As a result, expenses have shot up more than 9 percent from last year and are expected to remain elevated though the end of 2011. Investors may have to wait a year or longer to see the payoff. Despite an earful from Wall Street analysts, Citi executives say that after several years of cutting back on investment spending, they need to loosen their purse strings to make up lost ground. Citigroup, via ReutersJohn Gerspach, Citigroup’s finance chief. “Coming out of the crisis, there wasn’t a lot of investing going on in 2008 and 2009,” John C. Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call with journalists. Stronger rivals like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have been investing all along. Now, Mr. Gerspach added, “We are in investment mode.” How Mr. Pandit keeps close tabs on expenses while building out his global banking franchise is perhaps his next great challenge. After clawing Citi back from the brink of collapse during the financial crisis, he has been engaged in an ambitious plan to transform it from a sprawling financial supermarket to a leaner, more focused company. Mr. Pandit has been successful shedding assets, improving risk management and severing the bank’s ties with the federal government. His efforts, however, have not lifted Citi’s share price. It has floundered since the completion of a reverse stock split in early May that took the price to around $45 from $4.50. On Friday, it closed at $38.38, down 1.64 percent. Citi showed the inherent power of its franchise when it pulled off a second-quarter profit of $3.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion last year, despite a sluggish global economy. Many analysts were skeptical of that headline. Despite modest loan growth and strong investment banking fees, almost half of the bank’s pretax operating profit came from the reversal of more than $2 billion of funds the bank had set aside earlier to cover credit card and other loan losses. And unlike the solid gains that JPMorgan showed on Thursday, revenue at Citigroup fell 7 percent from a year earlier, to $20.6 billion. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release Bank Earnings Season Starts on a High Note Profit in Citigroup’s investment bank was down by almost one-third from a year ago, falling to $1.2 billion. Traders on the currency, interest rate and mortgage desks were hard hit, while Citi’s equity derivatives group also reported lower revenues. Its North American banking operations also struggled, with a litany of mortgage troubles continuing to weigh on its results. “I consider mortgages the biggest risk we run,” Mr. Gerspach said. Although tighter supervision and the smaller size of Citi’s mortgage unit allowed it to avoid the charges that swamped Bank of America and Chase’s results, Citi was still forced to set aside an extra $224 million to cover potential losses on securities backed by faulty loans that it had sold to investors. That brought its total reserves to $1 billion. The bank also raised its projections of mortgage servicing cost increases to around $70 million a quarter — double its prior estimates, although nowhere near the billion-dollar charges taken by its larger peers. Abroad, the news was mixed. For the last two years, the bank’s consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America have been one of the few bright spots. Loan losses eased faster in those regions than in the United States, and corporate lending has been quicker to gain steam. That was true again in the second quarter, when nearly 60 percent of profit came from emerging markets. But its European results were weak, particularly in its investment banking unit. And then there is the expense problem. Operating costs for Citi’s core operations rose to $10.1 billion, a 14 percent increase from a year ago. Bank executives said that about one-third of that cost could be attributable to unfavorable exchange rates and another third to increased legal expenditures tied to mortgages and other issues. The rest comes from technology investments, hiring and other expansion efforts, largely outside the United States. “We don’t like the idea that our expenses are going to be above guidance any more than anyone else does,” Mr. Gerspach said. “You can either manage back down to the guidance by cutting investment programs, or you can agree to press on.” Some Citi analysts and investors, who have a long history of hearing the bank’s executives make promises they cannot fulfill, were skeptical. Others say the bank has little choice. “The company was on its death bed, and the investing they were doing was to make sure they survived,” said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Now, they are looking to make up for that period of time.” Just as with investment spending, Citigroup will be playing catch-up to its main competitors when it comes to buying back its own shares. JPMorgan, for example, announced that it had repurchased about $3.5 billion of the company’s stock in the second quarter. Mr. Pandit has said that the bank is unlikely to do so until sometime in 2012.

But on Thursday, robust gains in almost all of JPMorgan Chase’s main businesses offered some hope that the industry’s prospects are not as bad as feared. Over all, the bank said second-quarter revenue climbed 7 percent to $27.4 billion — a strong showing amid a stagnant consumer economy and some of the most challenging trading conditions of the last few years. That helped JPMorgan handily beat analysts’ consensus estimates with a profit of $5.4 billion, or $1.27 a share. Still, it was not enough to lift beaten-down bank stocks. Shares of Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo fell slightly on Thursday. The solid revenue figures fly in the face of the dismal projections by many Wall Street analysts, who have been warning that banking is quickly returning to a boring, low-growth business. The figures also take some of the air out of the financial industry’s arguments that new regulations are depressing revenue and stifling the fragile economic recovery. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release JPMorgan Names Co-Head of North America Investment Banking Even the chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has raised concerns about the cost of the new rules, acknowledged that his bank would be able to make up a big part of the missing revenue. “JPMorgan will be just fine,” he said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters. Bank officials said the revenue levels largely reflected a modest increase in lending and an uptick in fee income that could be sustained in the months ahead. For example, JPMorgan’s investment bank had a sharp increase in underwriting fees for debt and equity, as well as a big increase in deal advisory income that helped offset weaker trading results. Its Chase retail banking unit benefited from more profitable home lending and an increase in fee income from checking accounts, debit cards and the sale of investment products. That helped it absorb charges totaling almost $1 billion to cover mortgage losses, and an additional $2.3 billion in charges tied to rising legal and foreclosure costs. Revenue in its corporate banking, asset management and treasury services units also grew. Only the bank’s big credit card business, Chase Card Services, had a decline in revenue from a year ago. It fell 7 percent as a result of legislation that eliminated lucrative penalty fees and its decision to shed a risky credit card portfolio it had acquired with Washington Mutual. The rest of the banking industry has been bracing for lower top-line growth. Besides the impact of the new financial regulations, the weak job and housing markets have curtailed lending. Ultra-low interest rates are putting pressure on profit margins. And Wall Street trading revenue, which helped prop up the banks’ results in wake of the 2008 financial crisis, also has slowed. All told, revenue for the banking industry is expected to fall more than 5 percent, to about $186 billion in the second quarter, according to Trepp, a financial research firm. That would put it near 2005 levels. Second-quarter profits, however, are likely to be far more robust than a year ago — about $30.6 billion industrywide, up 41 percent. The reason is that many banks stand to benefit from the reversal of funds they had previously set aside to cover losses or legal claims. That windfall can help pad bank bottom lines, even if there is little top-line growth. In JPMorgan’s case, a $1 billion benefit from the reversal in credit card loan loss reserves contributed to about 12 percent of its second-quarter, pretax earnings. For the entire industry in the first quarter, about $12.6 billion, or roughly 43 percent of profits, came from the release of reserves. Analysts expect to see similar trends in the second quarter. Citigroup, which will report on Friday, is expected to show revenue falling about 9 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters. Net income, the analysts project, will rise about 9 percent amid lower losses on credit card and corporate loans. At Goldman Sachs, which will report on Tuesday, revenue is expected to fall about 3.5 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates. Profit could rise sharply from the second quarter of 2010, when the bank took a big charges to cover the British tax on bonuses and resolve allegations by federal securities regulators that it had misled investors on a complex mortgage deal. Revenue at Bank of America, which also will report on Tuesday, was expected to drop about 15 percent, largely because of $20 billion worth of charges tied to the cleanup of its mortgage troubles, which it announced in late June. As a result, the bank warned that it would lose $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion. Some analysts suggest that JPMorgan’s strong results could be the exception rather than the rule. Much depends on how banks fare in the most unpredictable of businesses — trading. “For those who own these stocks, it was a pleasant beginning to the earnings season,” said Frederick Cannon, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. “But one point doesn’t make a line.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/the-week-that-was-in-verse-3/?ref=citigroupinc">The Week That Was, In Verse<date>July 8, 2011, 4:13 pm</date><text>Nati Harnik/Associated Press, Matthew Staver/Bloomberg News, Jim Wilson/The New York Times and Rick Bowmer/Associated Press Clockwise from top left: Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Allen Mask and Monopoly.

It’s the real life version of the board game Monopoly. Last week, Citigroup lost an arbitration case in which it tried to claw back $900,000 that it said it “mistakenly” paid to a former executive, Anthony Orefice. Mr. Orefice worked at Citigroup for 14 years. In 2007 he was let go as part of a standard work force reduction, according to the award filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-policing organization, which provides the forum for arbitration like Mr. Orefice’s. Citigroup paid Mr. Orefice $900,000 in late January 2008, a special payment described as part of a “separation agreement and release.” This is where Citigroup’s troubles begin. Citigroup, the arbitration award says, only meant to give Mr. Orefice one payment. Citigroup claimed in arbitration that Mr. Oredice “in essence received a $900,000 payment in error.” Not so fast, say regulators. A Finra arbitration panel found that Citigroup entered “into two separate and enforceable” agreements. “While Claimant may not have wished to twice pay Respondent $900,000.00, Claimant drafted two separate contracts calling for such payments, and made payments pursuant to those contracts,” the panel wrote in its finding against Citigroup. Robert D. Kraus, a lawyer for Mr. Orefice, said the arbitrators “reached the correct conclusion, which is that when you sign an agreement and then perform under it you can’t claim mistake and get out from underneath it.” A Citigroup spokeswoman said the firm was “disappointed” with the award and declined to comment on whether the bank planned to appeal.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/opinion/30thu1.html?ref=citigroupinc">The Cloud Darkens<date>Published: June 29, 2011</date><text>The Internet is getting scary. In recent weeks, hackers known as Lulz Security attacked the Web sites of Sony, the United States Senate, the C.I.A., PBS, among others. They stole names, e-mail addresses and passwords of millions of users and published them online. Then, last weekend, they regrouped under a new name.These attacks are among the hundreds of online security breaches this year alone, compromising data of more than 22 million people, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Targets have included Citigroup, Lockheed Martin and even RSA Security, which makes password tokens that big companies use to protect themselves from intrusion. A survey earlier this month by the Ponemon Institute found that 9 out of 10 companies had suffered an online attack in the last 12 months. Companies and the government are unprepared. Citigroup didn’t track patterns of activity on its credit card site and failed to notice immediately when hackers took data on more than two million card users, said Avivah Litan, a security expert of Gartner. Sony didn’t encrypt the data of users of its PlayStation network — phone numbers, passwords, e-mail addresses and account histories. Recently, for several hours, Dropbox, a popular service for storing documents and other files in the so-called computing cloud, allowed anyone to log into any of its 25 million user accounts using any password. The company tried to keep the glitch quiet but was exposed by a security researcher. No wonder concern about Internet security from Americans has jumped sharply in the past few months. Technology professionals are getting cold feet about moving more operations onto the cloud when poor corporate security practices are exposing customers to devastating identity theft and fraud. This vulnerability could stymie the Internet economy. There is no fail-safe technology that is immune to hacking. Online security will evolve as hackers and security experts work continuously to outwit each other. Still, current standards are too low. Companies — and the government — must devote substantially more resources to security, making it integral to every new application, rather than patching it on as an afterthought. There are some signs of progress. Security experts are deploying a new worldwide system to identify Internet addresses that will make it very difficult to forge or spoof a Web site. In May, the Obama administration proposed legislation with sensible provisions to ensure that companies running critical infrastructure — like the nation’s power grid — have adequate systems to reduce the risk of an attack online. The proposal would standardize 47 state laws on breach reporting, requiring notification of customers whose accounts were compromised. This could be a powerful incentive for firms to take security more seriously. Other tactics are also needed. The Federal Trade Commission wants rules to force companies to minimize the information they collect from customers and to dispose of such data as soon as possible. The stolen Sony data, for example, had been on dormant servers for years. We are putting our lives in the cloud, as companies and consumers store everything from family photos to corporate business secrets on remote servers. Beefing up online security is of paramount importance.The Internet is getting scary.

Mr. Foster, a 35-year-old former assistant vice president in Citi’s internal treasury finance department, was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents at Kennedy Airport Sunday morning after returning from a trip to Europe and Asia. On Monday afternoon, he pleaded not guilty to charges of bank fraud at a hearing in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and was expected to be set free on $800,000 bond. Mr. Foster, who is divorced and has two children, had been enjoying the high life. He owned six properties, including an apartment in Midtown Manhattan; two luxury apartments in Jersey City; a $1.35 million house in Tenafly, N.J.; and a $3 million home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., that had a $500,000 entertainment system and bathroom mirrors that turned to video screens when touched, according to a law enforcement official. He also owned a Maserati GranTurismo and BMW 550xi. A Ferrari was on order, said the official, who was not authorized to speak about the investigation. Mr. Foster’s lawyer, Isabelle A. Kirshner, said that she had spoken only briefly with her client and had just started to review the allegations. “We will investigate the matter thoroughly,” she said. She would not comment on her client’s personal assets. The fraud charges are the latest effort by the Justice Department to crack down on white-collar crime at a time when the agency is under increasing pressure to hold Wall Street bankers accountable. This case is against a relatively junior Citigroup executive, and appears to have little to do with the financial crisis. Still, it is yet another embarrassment for a bank that once made its entire work force take an ethics pledge and uses “responsible finance” as a corporate slogan. It also raises new questions about Citi’s internal controls, nearly two years after regulators forced it to strengthen its risk management and compliance practices upon losing tens of billions of dollars during the financial crisis. Earlier this month, the bank came under fire from lawmakers after taking more than a month to disclose that hackers stole data from more 360,000 Citi credit card accounts. In this case, it took nearly a year after the claimed embezzlement began before Citigroup’s internal auditors uncovered that millions of dollars were missing. According to the complaint, Mr. Foster transferred the money from various Citigroup corporate accounts to his own bank account at JPMorgan Chase late last year. From July to December 2010, he moved about $900,000 from Citigroup’s interest expense account and about $14.4 million from Citigroup’s debt adjustment account to the bank’s main cash account. Then, on eight separate occasions, he wired the money to a personal account at Chase. To conceal some of the transactions, the complaint contended that Mr. Foster used a false contract or deal number to be placed in the reference line of the wire transfer. Mr. Foster voluntarily quit Citigroup in January, according to a person briefed on his employment. His reasons for leaving are not known. “The defendant allegedly used his knowledge of bank operations to commit the ultimate inside job,” said Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. Citigroup detected the fraud a couple of weeks ago during an internal audit of the treasury department, where Mr. Foster worked, according to the complaint and a person briefed on the situation. The bank said it immediately contacted law enforcement officers after discovering the suspicious transactions and has put in additional safeguards and internal controls. “We are outraged by the actions of this former employee,” said Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman. “In light of the ongoing investigation, we cannot comment any further at this time.” Mr. Foster joined Citigroup in 1999, shortly after graduating from Rutgers University with an accounting degree, according to his profile on LinkedIn. He rose to become an assistant vice president, supervising the derivatives unit in the bank’s treasury finance department. Since leaving Citigroup, he has billed himself as a part-time hedge fund consultant, according to his profile. On Facebook, he counts “traveling the world” as a favorite activity. Mr. Foster was traveling in Europe and Asia, when an F.B.I. agent showed up at the home of his parents in Teaneck, N.J., early last week, according to his lawyer. Alerted by his parents, she added, Mr. Foster immediately contacted the F.B.I. agent and made arrangements to return to the United States. Mr. Foster was arrested on Sunday morning after arriving on a flight from Bangkok. If convicted, Mr. Foster faces up to 30 years in jail. William K.

On Monday, Mr. Foster, a 35-year-old former assistant vice president in the bank’s internal treasury finance department, pleaded not guilty to charges that he embezzled more than $19.2 million from Citigroup.

The new revelations come as the bank was forced to respond to Connecticut’s attorney general and several other state regulators who have opened inquiries into the breach. They join federal authorities, including the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who have been conducting investigations into how the bank was attacked.   On Thursday morning, Sean Kevelighan, a Citigroup spokesman, said that the figures were always rough estimates and the discrepancy could be attributed to an increase in its credit card accounts and other factors. Citigroup now has about 23 million credit card accounts, up from 21 million accounts at the end of 2010, the last publicly reported figure. In the statement, Citigroup also pinpointed May 10 as the date when it discovered the breach, and it said that it had immediately rectified the problem and begun an internal investigation. By May 24, bank officials concluded that the data thieves had captured the names, account numbers, and e-mail addresses of about 360,000 customer accounts. Social Security numbers, expiration dates, and the three-digit security password found on the back of the card were not exposed — a finding that security experts have said would make it hard for the thieves to commit fraud. As of May 24, the bank began preparing to replace about 218,000 cardholder accounts and to prepare notification letters to its customers. Those were mailed beginning June 3, but it waited to notify the public until June 9. Citigroup said it implemented “enhanced procedures” to prevent similar incidents from happening and also notified law enforcement and government officials. It did not indicate when they were contacted, however. In its statement, Citigroup reassured customers that they would not be held liable for fraudulent charges and could take advantage of free identity theft protection assistance, available via a phone number on the back of their credit card, if they believed they were a victim. The bank also encouraged its customers to review their account statements and report any suspicious activity. Citigroup, citing the continuing law enforcement investigation, provided no additional details about how their system was left vulnerable.  The Citigroup credit card data breach exposed the private financial data of more than 360,000 customer accounts, about 80 percent more than it reported last week, according to a statement the bank released late Wednesday night.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/ubs-poaches-citigroup-tech-bankers/?ref=citigroupinc">UBS Poaches Citigroup Tech Bankers<date>June 15, 2011, 9:47 am</date><text>UBS strikes back. Two weeks after Citigroup announced that it had hired two investment bankers from the struggling Swiss bank, UBS said on Tuesday that it had poached two top Citi officials for its technology group. Doug Brengel, who has been at Citi and its predecessor Salomon Brothers for more than 30 years, will join UBS as the chairman of technology banking. UBS also hired Bill Frauenhofer as a managing director in the technology group. Earlier this month, UBS named a Deutsche Bank official, Yusuf Nahmiyas, as a managing director for its technology, media and telecommunications mergers team. The crucial hires come as UBS scrambles to restaff the ranks of its technology group, after losing several top employees to rival banks. UBS has faced a series of prominent defections as it struggles to compete with other big banks that are better positioned to offer lavish compensation packages. John Metz, the head of communications banking within the firm’s technology group, left the Swiss bank in April to join Credit Suisse. The firm also lost Eric Mandl, a tech specialist, to Evercore Partners. Citi said this month that it had nabbed James Glerum, the co-head of UBS’s Midwestern operations and its head of diversified industrials, and Cary Kochman, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at UBS. After the string of departures, UBS has finally managed to lure away some rival bankers. Mr. Brengel will join UBS after spending the bulk of his career at Citi and Salomon Brothers, where he founded the firm’s global technology group in 1992. He joined the firm in 1977. “Doug brings a wealth of relationships, a global perspective, and a long history of successful transactions to our technology practice,” UBS said in an announcement on Wednesday. Mr. Frauenhofer, a managing director at Citi, will focus primarily on semiconductor and capital equipment companies for UBS. Both men will join UBS in late August.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/citi-hires-senior-capital-markets-banker/?ref=citigroupinc">Citi Hires Senior Capital Markets Banker<date>June 15, 2011, 12:06 pm</date><text>Citigroup has hired Elinor Hoover from Morgan Stanley as a vice chairwoman for capital markets and origination in the Americas, the firm announced in an internal memorandum on Wednesday.

That allowed them to capture the names, account numbers, e-mail addresses and transaction histories of more than 200,000 Citi customers, security experts said, revealing for the first time details of one of the most brazen bank hacking attacks in recent years. The case illustrates the threat posed by the rising demand for private financial information from the world of foreign hackers. In the Citi breach, the data thieves were able to penetrate the bank’s defenses by first logging on to the site reserved for its credit card customers. Once inside, they leapfrogged between the accounts of different Citi customers by inserting vari-ous account numbers into a string of text located in the browser’s address bar. The hackers’ code systems automatically repeated this exercise tens of thousands of times — allowing them to capture the confidential private data. The method is seemingly simple, but the fact that the thieves knew to focus on this particular vulnerability marks the Citigroup attack as especially ingenious, security experts said. One security expert familiar with the investigation wondered how the hackers could have known to breach security by focusing on the vulnerability in the browser. “It would have been hard to prepare for this type of vulnerability,” he said. The security expert insisted on anonymity because the inquiry was at an early stage. The financial damage to Citigroup and its customers is not yet clear. Sean Kevelighan, a bank spokesman, declined to comment on the details of the breach, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. In a statement, he said that Citigroup discovered the breach in early May and the problem was “rectified immediately.” He added that the bank had initiated internal fraud alerts and stepped up its account monitoring. The expertise behind the attack, according to law enforcement officials and security experts, is a sign of what is likely to be a wave of more and more sophisticated breaches by high-tech thieves hungry for credit card numbers and other confidential information. That is because demand for the data is on the rise. In 2008, the underground market for the data was flooded with more than 360 million stolen personal records, most of them credit and debit files. That compared with 3.8 million records stolen in 2010, according to a report by Verizon and the Secret Service, which investigates credit card fraud along with other law enforcement agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Now, as credit cards that were compromised in the vast 2008 thefts expire, thieves are stepping up efforts to find new accounts. As a result, prices for basic credit card information could rise to several dollars from their current level of only pennies. “If you think financially motivated breaches are huge now, just wait another year,” said Bryan Sartin, who conducts forensic investigations for Verizon’s consulting arm. The kind of information the thieves are able to glean is shared in online forums that are a veritable marketplace for criminals. Networks that three years ago numbered several thousands users have expanded to include tens of thousands of hackers. “These are online bazaars,” said Pablo Martinez, deputy special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s criminal investigation division. “They are growing exponentially and we have seen the entire process become more professional.” For example, some hackers specialize in prying out customer names, account numbers and other confidential information, Mr. Martinez said. Brokers then sell that information in the Internet bazaars. Criminals use it to impersonate customers and buy merchandise. Finally, “money mules” wire home the profits through outlets like Western Union or MoneyGram. 1 2 Next Page » Riva Richmond contributed reporting.Think of it as a mansion with a high-tech security system — but the front door wasn’t locked tight.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/business/10markets.html?ref=citigroupinc">Shares Soar on Record U.S. Exports Record U.S. Exports Send Shares Up<date>Published: June 9, 2011</date><text>A report that United States exports hit a record high in April sent stocks sharply higher Thursday as investors hoped the economic recovery might not be as sluggish as suggested by the grim economic reports issued over the last week.The increase in exports to $175.6 billion in April could add half a percentage point or more to the government’s estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product, said Anthony Chan, chief economist for JPMorgan Private Wealth Management. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.42 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 12,124.36. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index rose 9.44 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1,289.00. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.49 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,684.87. The gains ended a six-day losing streak and were the first time stocks rose in June. Stocks had dropped after poor reports on manufacturing, home sales, hiring and consumer confidence. It was the longest losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average in more than a year and the longest for the S.&amp; P. since February 2009. The market’s weeklong slump also made stocks appear relatively cheap, Mr. Chan said. The S.&amp; P. 500-stock index lost 6.2 percent over the previous six days of trading. “Markets usually swing like a pendulum,” Mr. Chan said. “This decline has been strong enough that you can easily justify the market taking a breath.” The narrower trade deficit is a sign that goods from manufacturers in the United States are becoming more competitive overseas. United States companies sold more computers, heavy machinery and telecommunications equipment abroad in April compared with March. Imports declined because fewer cars were bought from Japan after factories there were damaged by an earthquake and tsunami. Companies that make farming machinery rose after the government reported that United States corn crops would be smaller this fall. That sent corn prices soaring and raised expectations that farm owners would buy more tractors and other agricultural equipment. Deere &amp; Company and AGCO rose 2.5 percent. A report on claims for unemployment benefits was in line with expectations that new applications would stay about the same. The Labor Department reported that new claims edged up 1,000 to 427,000. Economists had expected a slight decline. The high level of claims still suggests that the job market is slow. The Interpublic Group of Companies, the advertising concern, rose 6.4 percent, the most of any company in the S.&amp; P. 500-stock index, after Moody’s raised its rating on the company. A jump in oil prices sent energy stocks higher. Energy companies in the S.&amp; P. 500-index rose 1.2 percent. Crude rose $1.19 to settle at $101.93. Stocks have been slipping since mid-April on concern that the nation’s economy has hit a soft patch. Oil prices, Japan’s tsunami and nuclear disaster and the risk that Greece might default on debt have led investors to reduce forecasts for growth in the United States this year. Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 101 3/32, and the yield rose to 3.00 percent from 2.95 percent late Wednesday.A report that United States exports hit a record high in April sent stocks sharply higher Thursday as investors hoped the economic recovery might not be as sluggish as suggested by the grim economic reports issued over the last week.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/business/10citi.html?ref=citigroupinc">Citi Data Theft Points Up a Nagging Problem<date>Published: June 9, 2011</date><text>Citigroup’s revelation that hackers stole personal information from more than 200,000 credit card holders makes it one of the largest direct attacks on a major bank.Even more striking is that similar data breaches have been occurring for years — and the financial industry has failed to prevent them. Details remain scarce, but the disclosure of the Citigroup breach on Thursday quickly turned into a debate on whether the banks and major credit card companies had invested enough money to safeguard the personal information of their customers. “They’re not at all on top of it,” said Avivah Litan, a financial security analyst at Gartner Inc. “It’s almost shocking.” In Washington, the finger-pointing has already begun. Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said on Thursday that she planned to call on some banks to strengthen their authentication procedures when customers log onto online accounts. That’s on top of new data security rules that federal regulators are completing. Lawmakers, meanwhile, said they were outraged that Citigroup waited since early May to notify its customers; some are preparing legislation. Representative James R. Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, said he was “shocked and disappointed” to learn of Citi’s delayed disclosure. “They knew the customers’ data was potentially exposed in May and only now are they telling them about the threat,” he said. “Being more forthcoming is essential.” Consumers, meanwhile, are feeling increasingly vulnerable amid recent reports of data breaches at big companies, like Lockheed Martin, Epsilon and Sony. A. J. Angus, a 25-year-old Google employee, was put in double jeopardy. On Thursday, he learned that his Citi credit card data had been stolen. Only a few weeks earlier, he learned that personal data on his Sony PlayStation 3 was compromised. “You have to be vigilant,” he said, adding that he periodically checks his credit report and looks over his transactions almost daily on a personal finance Web site. Last Friday, almost a month after it discovered that hackers had gained access to its computer systems, Citigroup began notifying about half of the 200,000 affected customers that it planned to replace their credit cards.  The bank said that the thieves had obtained customer names, card numbers, addresses, and e-mail details. Social security numbers, expiration dates and the three-digit code found on the back of most credit cards were not compromised — a move that security experts say makes the exposed cardholders less likely to become fraud victims. Neither Citigroup’s debit card business nor its online banking operations were breached. “Citi has implemented enhanced procedures to prevent a recurrence of this type of event,” the company said in a statement. The intrusion is not all that unique. Over the last six years, there have been 288 publicly disclosed breaches at financial services companies that exposed at least 83 million customer records, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. Credit card industry officials say security issues go to the heart of their brands and they are trying to keep up with ever-more sophisticated criminals. “We’re not dealing with 14-year-old hacker kids,” said Steve Elefant, the chief information officer at Heartland Payment Systems, which overhauled its security measures after the systems it used to process credit and debit card transactions were hacked in 2008. “We’re talking about 21st-century bank robbers — sophisticated, organized criminal gangs, located mostly in Eastern Europe and the U.S.” Making matters worse, nearly every step along the payment chain is outsourced from the time a card is swiped to the time a monthly statement arrives, leaving plenty of openings for enterprising thieves. Security is further hampered by a patchwork of data protection laws and regulatory agencies, each with limited mandates. “We need a uniform national standard for data security and data breach notification,” said Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican who is pushing for legislation on better consumer safeguards. “In the meantime, regulators need to do a better job of being a consumer watchdog.” 1 2 Next Page » Tara Siegel Bernard, Riva Richmond and Nelson D.

While information concerning customers’ names, credit card numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses was exposed, the bank said that data like the “Social Security number, date of birth, card expiration date and card security code were not compromised.” Citi is notifying cardholders who have been affected via mail, as well as via their online accounts. Most customers will also receive a replacement card, the company said. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “Citi has implemented enhanced procedures to prevent a recurrence of this type of event,” the bank said. “For the security of these customers, we are not disclosing further details.” While no group has claimed responsibility for the breach, it is part of a spate of recent cyberattacks. Sony has reported a series of assaults on its PlayStation network and several Sony Web sites — one hacker site says there have been 18 so far — after the company sued, and then settled with, a programmer who had cracked the PlayStation code. Other attacks have hit PBS, Fox and an F.B.I. affiliate known as Infragard. And most worrying of all, perhaps, they compromised the security system of RSA, maker of the popular SecurID. But none of those breaches appears to pose as direct a threat to consumers as the one reported by Citi. A spokesman for the bank said that only credit card customers had been affected, not debit card holders, and that law enforcement had been alerted. The Financial Times earlier reported the breach. Two people associated with the hacker collective Anonymous said they did not believe the group was involved. “Anonymous kind of moved off the banks,” one said, adding that it was “because they were bored.” Anonymous has become known for prominent denial-of-service attacks that disable and deface the Web sites of companies the hackers dislike; for example, the group disrupted service at Visa and MasterCard after they stopped allowing donations to WikiLeaks. “For-profit attacks are always foreign,” one of the people said. “I’ve never heard of an American group doing that. You can deface a Web site, but once you start stealing money … we understand the FBI. They can kick your door down for downloading torrents.” Citigroup was reported to have been breached by hackers tied to a Russian group in 2009, and before that in 1995. One of the members of Anonymous questioned Citigroup’s security as the bank described it on its Citi Card site, saying the 128-bit encryption the bank boasts of is “really not that big a deal.” “Two-hundred-and-fifty-six bit would take someone a lifetime to decrypt,” the person said. “The security is so weak right now, if you know a couple attacks, you can just go around and see what works.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/can-cyberattacks-be-stopped/?ref=citigroupinc">Can Cyberattacks Be Stopped?<date>June 9, 2011, 3:32 pm</date><text>Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Citigroup’s discovery of a security breach that occurred last month, affecting 200,000 credit card accounts in North America, underscores corporate vulnerability to Internet attacks.

AXA said the deal, involving 207 positions in buyout funds, was one of the largest transactions ever in the secondary market for private equity stakes. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links AXA press release Citigroup press release Dominique Senequier, chief executive of AXA Private Equity, said in a conference call on Wednesday that the assets included stakes in funds from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Blackstone Group, the Carlyle Group and Providence Equity Partners, among others. She said in a statement that AXA’s “close working relationship with Citigroup” and the visibility of its assets had helped close the deal. Asked about the price that AXA paid, Ms. Senequier would say only that the firm was “happy with the buying conditions.” For Citigroup, the sale of the portfolio continues its exit from various investments that were not central to its main banking business. “This sale marks the completion of a significant share of Citi Holdings’ proprietary private equity investments and demonstrates the progress the Citi Holdings team is making in reducing noncore assets on our balance sheet,” Mark Mason, chief operating officer of Citi Holdings, said in a statement. Last week, under pressure to conform with the new Dodd-Frank financial regulations on the kinds of risks banks can take, Bank of America spun off a private equity fund, now known as North Cove Partners, with about $6 billion of assets under management. AXA Private Equity bought $1.9 billion in private equity stakes from Bank of America a little more than a year ago. It has about $25 billion under management altogether. Aside from the AXA Group’s stake, AXA Private Equity, founded in 1996, raises about 39 percent of its funds in North America.

But Mr. Scanlon, who helps oversee $7.5 billion for the John Hancock family of mutual funds in Boston and specializes in financial companies, is not about to give in and buy more shares. “It’s just not going to be a smooth ride,” he said. “You wake up every day and there’s a new headline and a new concern.” Bank stocks took another tumble late last week after Moody’s, the credit rating firm, warned it might downgrade the debt of giants like Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo as the government eases back on support for the sector. Even as the market absorbed that news, reports that Goldman Sachs had been subpoenaed in an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney further unnerved investors, and sent that giant investment’s bank’s shares sinking. Pessimism about the sector was reinforced by weaker-than-expected economic data, including a bleak reading on unemployment on Friday. What’s more, well-known hedge fund investors like John A. Paulson and David Tepper have been quietly selling the big positions in the sector they had earlier amassed, a sign the smart money has already begun to bail. Mr. Tepper, in particular, had made huge profits by scooping up beaten-down bank stocks when they bottomed out in late 2008 and early 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis and riding their subsequent recovery. But in the first quarter of 2011, he sold off about a third of his positions in Citigroup and Bank of America. For Mr. Tepper, the timing was impeccable. Since the beginning of April, the KBW Bank Index has dropped 8 percent, compared with a much more modest 2 percent decline in the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. Last week, bank stocks sank to their lowest point since early December. For individual investors, who have long favored bank stocks as a source of dividends and at least the promise of stability, their recent performance has been a big disappointment. And few experts expect a turnaround anytime soon. “I haven’t seen investor sentiment this bad in a long time,” said Jason Goldberg, a longtime bank stock analyst at Barclays. “Not owning the group has been the right call, and people are skeptical about getting back in.” By many measures, the sector is pretty cheap. Diversified banks are trading at about 9.4 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 12.4 for the broader S.&amp; P. 500, according to FactSet Research. But then, they may deserve to be selling at a discount. Besides the worries about a possible debt downgrade and the investigations into the role they played in the financial crisis, major banks are facing headwinds on many fronts. For starters, federal regulations passed last year are set to cut deeply into revenue on everything from debit card transactions to trading on Wall Street. The restriction on debit card fees, known as the Durbin Amendment after the senator who proposed it, Dick Durbin of Illinois, could alone cost the top 25 banks roughly $8 billion in lost revenue, Mr. Goldberg said. The new regulations are set to go into effect on July 21, although Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, is pushing a proposal on Capitol Hill that could come up for a vote as early as next week that would delay their start by 15 months. Even if Mr. Tester wins a reprieve for the banks, other rules in the broader Dodd-Frank bill, which overhauled financial regulations, could cost the industry another $8 billion, according to Mr. Goldberg. In addition, new international rules now being developed to require major institutions to hold more capital as a buffer against future financial crises will also erode profitability. That is because money set aside as ballast is cash that will not be available to lend out or pay dividends or buy back stock. More than any of the changes hurtling toward them is a more fundamental problem that banks face — revenue is stuck in neutral. And a huge chunk of profits is not coming from the actual business of lending money, but instead represents gains from the release of reserves set aside in the past for possible loan losses. As these costs have eased, that money for a rainy day has fallen to the bottom line. In the first quarter of 2011, the top 20 banks earned $27.5 billion in pretax income. Nearly $11 billion, or 40 percent of that, came from the release of reserves, according to Mr. Goldberg. The proportion was even higher in the fourth quarter of 2010, when it hit 54 percent. While that money has helped camouflage anemic revenue and lackluster loan growth, it is hardly a long-term strategy for sustainable profit increases. 1 2 Next Page »Michael Scanlon is tempted by bank stocks, truly he is.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/business/03bank.html?ref=citigroupinc">Moody’s Reviewing Credit Ratings of Major Banks<date>Published: June 2, 2011</date><text>Moody’s Investors Service said Thursday that it was reviewing the ratings of the Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup and Wells Fargo &amp; Company for possible downgrades.The banks’ current ratings are already in the middle of the investment-grade corporate credit ratings, and that is with a boost from Moody’s assumption that the federal government would prevent them from failing in a crisis. Moody’s said Thursday that this “too big to fail” assumption might no longer be true. In a statement, a Moody’s senior vice president, Sean Jones, said the Dodd-Frank Act made clear that the government “does not want to bail out even large, systemically important banking groups.” One aim of the act, signed into law last July, was to make it easier to break up large financial institutions. Moody’s currently rates Bank of America’s senior debt A2, Citigroup’s A3 and Wells Fargo’s A1. But the implied government backing pushes those ratings up. The banks may not lose all of that ratings cushion. Moody’s said improving financial strength at Citigroup and Bank of America might temper any ratings cuts. A downgrade would very likely raise the banks’ borrowing costs. In total, eight banks have assumptions of government backing that give them higher ratings. The others are the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company, the Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley and the State Street Corporation. Moody’s said it continued to evaluate its assumption of federal backing for all of them.Moody’s Investors Service said Thursday that it was reviewing the ratings of the Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup and Wells Fargo &amp; Company for possible downgrades.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/citi-hires-2-more-ubs-bankers-as-exodus-continues/?ref=citigroupinc">Citi Hires 2 More UBS Bankers as Exodus Continues<date>June 1, 2011, 10:17 am</date><text>The exodus from UBS continued as Citigroup announced on Wednesday that it had hired two top investment bankers from the struggling Swiss institution. Citi said it had hired James Glerum, the co-head of UBS’s Midwestern operations and its head of diversified industrials, and Cary Kochman, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at UBS. The moves are the latest in a string of defections from UBS, which has lost senior executives as it grapples with limits on compensation. The Swiss bank is still trying to rebuild itself from the financial crisis, when it lost billions of dollars on soured mortgage bets, leaving itself open to poaching from stronger rivals. At Citi, Mr. Glerum will become chairman of regional banking for North America. Before joining UBS in 2004, he worked at Credit Suisse. Mr. Kochman, who also joined UBS from Credit Suisse in 2004, will become head of North American mergers and acquisitions, as well as co-head of the Chicago office alongside Brennan Smith. Mr. Smith will also become head of Midwest industrials. “Jim and Cary are seasoned bankers with extensive experience acting as trusted advisers to leading multinational companies,” Raymond J. McGuire, Citi’s head of global banking, said in a statement. “Their expertise in executing complex M.&amp;A. transactions across sectors and geographies matches perfectly with our global platform. Together with Brennan, they will fortify our presence in the Midwest and drive our banking franchise to further success.” Less than a month ago, Citi hired Kevin Cox, then head of Americas investment banking at UBS, to become its co-chairman of industrials investment banking. UBS executives say that they remain committed to building out their investment banking operations, including in the Midwest. “Our investment banking business in the Americas is performing well this year and is materially ahead versus last year in revenue terms,” Aryeh Bourkoff, the head of UBS’s investment banking for the Americas, said in a statement. And here’s a statement from Robert Wolf, the president of UBS’s investment bank: UBS is absolutely committed to building our investment banking footprint in the Americas. Make no mistake about it. Today, we are one of the top foreign investment banks in the US but we have much higher ambitions. We have a mandate from the Group to make significant investments in the US and we are executing on our plan to achieve our strategic goals.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/citi-hires-former-accounting-c-e-o/?ref=citigroupinc">Citi Hires Former Accounting C.E.O.<date>May 23, 2011, 11:49 am</date><text>Samuel A.

One focuses on government’s right to regulate industry, and the other on the costs and benefits of such regulation. A new, almost biblical twist to one of these arguments was presented at a recent conference organized by Ceres, a Boston-based nonprofit that brings together investors, companies and environmental organizations who embrace sustainable business practices. twist. When it comes to automobile fuel economy, two analysts suggested, the worst shall do best. A report by analysts at Citigroup distributed at the conference said that while the fuel-economy standards currently under consideration by the Obama administration would result in a 6 percent increase in industry sales in 2020, compared with their baseline scenario. But for Detroit’s Big Three automakers, which have lagged behind companies like Toyota in this area, sales would increase 8 percent and profits 12 percent. The report, which leans heavily on analyses by the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan, said that, in playing catch-up on fuel economy, “light trucks and larger cars, in which the Detroit Three sport a greater share, have greater potential to add consumer value through improved fuel economy than do smaller cars and car-based trucks.” New federal and California fuel-efficiency standards for the model years 2017 to 2025 are to be announced in September. Current rules require auto companies to produce a fleet of vehicles averaging 34.1 miles a gallon by 2016. The Citigroup report also estimates that by 2015, hybrids’ market share will rise to 3.4 percent from 2.4 percent in 2010, with a combination of new plug-in and fully electric vehicles combined representing 2.6 percent of the market. Suppliers of pollution-control technology needed to meet the new fuel standards like Johnson Controls and BorgWarner will be “key beneficiaries” of an industry fuel-efficiency standard, according to the report, which estimates that it will reach 42 miles a gallon in 2020. The report was distributed at a news conference featuring Mary D. Nichols, the chairman of the California Air Resources Board and a reliable advocate of the economic benefits of clean-air regulations.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6DE133BF93AA25756C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=citigroupinc">As Citi Revives, Chief Wins a Big Pay Deal<date>Published: May 19, 2011</date><text>8:58 p.m. | Updated After spending years as one of Wall Street's lowest paid chief executives, Vikram S. Pandit received a $23.2 million retention package that could catapult him to the top of the list. Mr. Pandit earned a token annual salary of $1 as he steered Citigroup back into the black over the last two years. But on Wednesday, Citi's board awarded him as much as $16.5 million in stock and options as well as a cash payment valued at more than $6.65 million as part of a special profit-sharing program for top executives. The payouts will be spread over the next four years and are subject to Mr. Pandit's meeting certain performance goals. They will be in addition to his regular salary and annual bonuses. The announcement comes as Citigroup recently posted its fifth consecutive quarterly profit and completed a reverse stock split that, with the stroke of a pen, ratcheted its share price to more than $40 from $4. Just three short years ago, Citigroup was in such dire straits that it twice needed to be rescued by the government. With the bank receiving more than $45 billion of federal aid, questions swirled about whether Mr. Pandit would remain at the helm. The large retention award seems to put those questions to rest. ''Vikram has done an outstanding job since coming on board as the financial crisis began,'' Richard S. Parsons, Citigroup's chairman, said in a statement. ''This award is designed to retain Vikram as our C.E.O. and reward him for future performance benefiting the company and our shareholders.'' The retention package also could signify the unofficial end of the post-bailout pay era. Most banks made minor adjustments to compensation practices amid the uproar over bonuses, shifting more pay into stock from cash but still awarding hefty sums. Others like Citigroup and Bank of America, which accepted multiple government rescues, needed a federal pay overseer to formally approve the awards for their 25 highest earners. Mr. Pandit helped avert even more animosity toward his bankers when he pledged at a 2009 Congressional hearing to accept a mere $1 a year in salary until Citigroup turned a profit. Even so, he continued to benefit from the Citi board's largess. Throughout the crisis, Mr. Pandit was allowed to hold about $79.7 million in cash from the sale of Old Lane Partners, an investment firm he founded that was acquired by Citi in April 2007. Mr. Pandit would have to forfeit that money if he left the company before July 2011, giving the board a strong incentive to extend the retention package now. Careful not to call it a bonus - Mr. Parsons referred to it as a ''long-term, multiyear performance-based'' award. Citigroup's board broke the retention package into three parts. It also has the power to claw back any ill-gotten pay. The largest part of the award is deferred stock valued at $10 million, which will vest in three equal installments from the end of 2013 to 2015. Mr. Pandit must meet largely subjective performance goals, including developing senior managers, satisfying certain regulatory goals like improved risk management and steering the bank toward a culture focused on so-called responsible finance. The second part of the retention package is a special profit-sharing plan for top employees based on the company's financials. If Citigroup's core operations over the period earn at least $12 billion in pretax income during each of the next two years, Mr. Pandit could take home more than $6.65 million. About two dozen or so other top executives participate in the program - including John P. Havens, Citi's chief operating officer, who could receive almost $5.2 million. The bank earned $19 billion in pretax income last year. Citigroup also awarded Mr. Pandit more than 500,000 options, which the company valued at as much as $6.5 million. The options carry strike prices ranging from $41.54 to $60. Citigroup shares currently trade at $41.24. Citigroup's board had signaled a pay increase for Mr. Pandit last fall when it granted stock awards to several of his top lieutenants and announced plans to restore his compensation so that it would be in line with other Wall Street chiefs. In January, Citi's board raised Mr. Pandit's $1 salary to $1.75 million a year. The additional $5.5 million a year in retention payouts will set the stage for him to be paid as much, if not more, than his peers. Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, received about $10.2 million in total compensation for 2010, according to Equilar, a compensation research and consulting firm. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, was awarded a $23.6 million pay package last year, making him the highest paid of any Wall Street chief. The heads of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo were paid somewhere in between. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Vikram S.

Mr. Topper, a Columbia Business School graduate, will be based in Palo Alto, Calif. “This is an exciting period of activity in the technology sector and we are pleased to welcome Ethan who is an outstanding banker with deep relationships throughout Silicon Valley,” Mark Shafir, co-head of Citigroup’s global technology media &amp; telecom banking group, said in a statement. “We look forward to Ethan leveraging his experience to deliver the full range of our institutional platform to technology clients across the industry.” Prior to Union Square Advisors, Mr. Topper was the head of Credit Suisse‘s global technology mergers and acquisitions group.

This legal dust-up involved supposedly conservative municipal bond investments that Smith Barney had peddled to its wealthiest clients. The investments, which were big money-makers for Smith Barney, turned out to be anything but safe for the firm’s clients: various portfolios lost between half and three-quarters of their value during the financial crisis. Arbitrators rarely, if ever, discuss such cases, and the materials turned over by both sides are kept under wraps. But the outsize award, which included $17 million in punitive damages, is not the only thing that is noteworthy. The arbitrators appeared to reject — resoundingly — three defenses that Wall Street often employs when clients sue: No. 1: We didn’t blow up your portfolio. The financial crisis did. No. 2: If you’re wealthy and sophisticated, you should have understood the risks. And, No. 3, the most common defense of all: The prospectus warned that you could lose your shirt, so don’t come crying to us if you do. The investors who prevailed here are Gerald D. Hosier, 69, a wildly successful intellectual-property lawyer, and Jerry Murdock Jr., 52, a prosperous venture capitalist. Mr. Hosier and a trust he set up for his adult children received $48 million. Mr. Murdock got about $6 million. The men, neighbors in Aspen, Colo., suffered $27 million in out-of-pocket losses on their investments. The big clunker was a municipal bond arbitrage strategy that their Smith Barney broker had characterized as safe, according to the men’s complaint. The deal was supposedly designed to eke out more income than a simple portfolio of bonds would generate. Not only did the men recover all their losses in the award, they also received damages. Mr. Hosier was awarded $15 million in punitive damages and $6.3 million in market-adjusted damages. The arbitrators also awarded $3 million for the men’s legal fees. Alexander Samuelson, a Citigroup spokesman, said: “We are disappointed with the decision, which we believe is not supported by the facts or law.” He noted that the bank had won a number of arbitrations involving such leveraged municipal bond strategies and said that the bank was considering its legal options in this case. Mr. Hosier invested in the bank’s municipal arbitrage strategy from 2002 through 2007. Requiring a minimum investment of $500,000, the deals employed the wonders of leverage, borrowing 8 to 10 times the value of the municipal bonds in an underlying portfolio to generate higher income. Calling the strategy conservative and ideal for investors’ safe money, Smith Barney sold the trusts to wealthy investors. But Smith Barney and its brokers were the prime beneficiaries of the strategy, which generated fees not only on the money that had been borrowed to juice the returns but also through the life of the investment. Clients paid 0.35 percent annually on the portfolios, plus a fee of 20 percent of all income earned by the investors above a 5.5 percent threshold each year. Smith Barney’s sales representatives kept 40 percent of the total fees paid by their investors, far exceeding what they would have earned selling ordinary municipal bonds. This arrangement encouraged Smith Barney to lever up the portfolios, Mr. Hosier’s lawyers argued, putting the interests of their clients and those of Smith Barney at odds. Investors who bought these deals agreed to lock up their money for two years and had to pay a substantial fee if they redeemed their holdings during the next three years. Mr. Hosier was the single biggest buyer of Smith Barney’s municipal arbitrage deals, with $26 million invested over time. But four different portfolios in which he invested raised almost $2 billion from all investors. All of the portfolios performed badly. “Citigroup mismarketed this product to high-net-worth investors as an alternative to municipal bonds with a slightly higher return,” said Philip M. Aidikoff, a lawyer at Aidikoff, Uhl &amp; Bakhtiari in Beverly Hills, Calif., who represented Mr. Hosier and Mr. Murdock. “Our clients never knowingly agreed to risk a significant loss of principal for a few extra points of interest.” AS for Citigroup’s three defenses, Mr. Aidikoff, along with the co-counsel Steven B. Caruso, at Maddox, Hargett &amp; Caruso in New York, demonstrated that municipal bonds did not suffer catastrophic losses during the period. This squelched the bank’s argument that the financial crisis did in the strategy. Regarding their clients’ sophistication and wealth, the lawyers agreed that both men were comfortable taking risks in certain circumstances, but not with the money they had given to the bank. “Citigroup misled their wealthiest clients and then tried to blame them for relying on what they were told,” Mr. Caruso said. Arguing that the risks were laid out in the prospectus also seems to have run into a stone wall. Mr. Hosier’s lawyers produced seven different notices on the topic published by Finra and its predecessor regulator since 1994, including a notice from 2009 that states: “Providing risk disclosure in a prospectus or product description does not cure otherwise deficient disclosure in sales material, even if such sales material is accompanied or preceded by the prospectus.” Mr. Hosier’s victory is particularly noteworthy, given the nominal amounts typically extracted by regulators in cases against major banks. The punitive damages awarded to Mr. Hosier, for example, are more than triple the $4.45 million penalty levied against Wachovia Securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission this month in a suit that the S.E.C. settled with the bank. The S.E.C. accused the bank of selling about $10 million of mortgage-related securities to investors at above-market prices and at excessive markups. Wachovia, now part of Wells Fargo, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement. The arbitrators in Mr. Hosier’s case seemed keen to hold Wall Street accountable. And his win against Citigroup does not appear to be an anomaly. Since April 2010, his lawyer, Mr. Aidikoff, has argued 16 other arbitrations involving the same type of investment. Mr. Aidikoff and the lawyers who assist him have won every one. In an interview, Mr. Hosier said the experience had opened his eyes to the disturbing ways of Wall Street. “Instead of the financial world being the lubricant for business, they are out there manufacturing products with no utility whatsoever except for generating fees,” he said. “Somebody’s got to do something about Wall Street. It is destroying the country.”TWO individual investors just scored a remarkable win against Citigroup.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/citis-annual-meeting-ceases-to-be-a-battleground/?ref=citigroupinc">Citi's Annual Meeting Ceases to Be a Battleground<date>April 21, 2011, 4:11 pm</date><text>Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News Richard D. Parsons, above, Citigroup’s chairman, and Vikram S. Pandit, below, the bank’s chief executive, faced a much calmer annual meeting this year than in previous years. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Richard D. Parsons has likened his role at past Citigroup annual shareholder meetings to a gladiator entering the Coliseum. This year, the Citigroup chairman laid down his sword. “It’s not going to be a battle this year,” Mr. Parsons said Thursday, as he glad-handed reporters in the Hilton New York ballroom shortly before the meeting began. “There are still challenges, and we still have a ways to go,” he added. “But we’re clearly through the crisis.” What a difference a year makes. Last April, Citigroup swung to a profit for the first time since the financial crisis erupted in late 2007, and the government still owned a large ownership stake. This year, Citigroup repaid the Treasury Department and appears to be regaining its footing. On Monday, the bank reported a $3 billion profit as several businesses, including credit cards and trading, seemed to stabilize. “We had to make a lot of tough calls for the company, but I actually feel good about the decisions and calls that we made,” Vikram S. Pandit, Citi’s chief executive, told investors from the podium. In prior years, Citigroup shareholders nearly filled the 1,000 or so seats in the ballroom and took turns complaining about former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and other long-serving members of the board. This year, most of the seats were empty, with only about 300 or so shareholders who gradually trickled out as the day wore on. Mr. Rubin’s name was invoked just once. Instead, most of the criticism from the attendees was focused on Citigroup’s planned 1-for-10 reverse stock split on May 6, which was derided as “window dressing” and a flawed attempt to increase the price of the bank’s sagging shares. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Several shareholders complained that Citi’s stock price would need to reach almost $600 for them to break even on their shares. Mr. Pandit patiently explained that the value of their ownership position would not change, only the share count. Furthermore, he said the benefits of attracting a number of institutional investors who were unable to buy shares of companies whose stock traded below $10 outweighed any of the risks, including the potential for short-sellers to once again beat down the stock. (On Thursday, Citi’s shares closed at $4.55.) “These actions open doors for more potential investors to buy in,” Mr. Pandit said in response to a question from a shareholder. Ultimately, more than 95 percent of shareholders approved the stock split, the bank announced. All of Citi’s directors were re-elected with at least 88 percent of the shareholder vote. In contrast to years past, Mr. Pandit seemed remarkably comfortable presiding the meeting and in his role as Citi’s chief executive. He was grayer and thinner as well. And he never showed any signs of exasperation, feeling confident enough to take a veiled shot at some of Citi’s rivals in response to a question about how Citigroup was coping with the mortgage and foreclosure mess. “We are in a very different place than a lot of our competition,” he said, without citing any names. In fact, Mr. Pandit even came to Mr. Parsons’s rescue, when the Citi chairman came under fire from one shareholder as a “part-time executive” who is more focused on his work scouting media deals for Providence Equity Partners. “Mr. Chairman, you are not taking full credit for the job you are doing,” Mr. Pandit said. “The board is involved. The management is involved.” Some things, however, never change. Like the litany of obscure topics, ranging from why Citi shells out so much money for its executives to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to proposals for do-it-yourself deal structures for various business sales. Or the length of the annual meeting, which dragged on for nearly five hours — an hour after Citi’s directors were escorted out of the Hilton ballroom for a meeting that was scheduled in advance.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3DE1F3EF93AA25757C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=citigroupinc">Revenue And Profit Fall at Citi<date>Published: April 19, 2011</date><text>7:45 p.m. | Updated Citigroup took another halting step forward on Monday in its long march back from the brink, reporting a $3 billion profit in the first quarter, in spite of continuing losses in its mortgage unit and lackluster investment banking results. The company earned 10 cents a share, a penny above analysts' expectations, but down 32 percent from the comparable period a year earlier, when it earned its first profit since the financial crisis struck. As has been the case for other financial giants, Citigroup's revenue actually fell during the first quarter, as nearly every major region and business except Latin America experienced a slowdown from a year earlier. Over all, revenue declined 22 percent, to $19.7 billion. Expenses also continued to rise, in part because of new business investments as well as higher legal costs. Citi's results were buoyed by the release of $3.3 billion in reserves that had previously been set aside to cover losses on credit cards and other loans. That helped offset deeper losses in its domestic mortgage business and a weaker performance from its trading and investment banking groups. ''Our core businesses performed well despite the difficult economy,'' Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, wrote in an internal memorandum to employees. ''We've come a long way - and we continue to move forward.'' Mr. Pandit is expected to give a fuller report on Thursday at Citigroup's annual shareholder meeting in Midtown Manhattan. The bank is also planning a 10-for-1 reverse stock split early next month that will almost certainly draw criticism from stockholders who argue it is little more than a symbolic effort to raise the bank's stock price. On Monday, when the broader markets fell sharply, the company's stock was unchanged at $4.42 a share. Citigroup's earnings were tempered by the same factors that weighed on the earnings of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, which reported their first quarter results last week. Traditional banking businesses have been hit by rising foreclosure costs, new financial regulations and a slowdown in growth for home loans. Wells Fargo and several big regional players are expected to report similar trends when they announce their results later this week. But Citigroup, whose stock price plummeted to below $1 during the financial crisis, is under intense pressure to show improvement. For the last three years, Mr. Pandit has been engaged in an ambitious plan to overhaul the troubled company, streamlining its sprawling operations and changing it from a global financial supermarket into a leaner and more focused lender. Citi is close to completing its plan to shrink its balance sheet. Today, the pile of assets that Citi plans to sell or divest is down to $337 billion, less than half of its peak of $827 billion in early 2008. CitiFinancial, its large consumer lending franchise, is one of its last major businesses to go on sale, and several private equity firms are in the final stages of bidding. The bank also identified assets worth an additional $12.7 billion that it will sell in order to free up capital, resulting in a pretax charge of $709 million when it booked the assets at their current market value. ''We are very much on track,'' John C. Gerspach, Citigroup's chief financial officer, said on a conference call with reporters. ''We are going to continue to make progress but it will be at a reduced pace from where we were in 2010.'' Federal regulators acknowledged Citi's progress when they approved Mr. Pandit's plan to reinstate the dividend in early May at a token one-tenth of a penny per share. But unlike several major competitors that announced large share buyback programs, Mr. Pandit has said that the bank is unlikely to buy back stock until sometime in 2012. Meanwhile, the company faces rising costs, especially in its loan servicing business. And unlike JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup did not book a large upfront charge to reflect the higher operating costs required to meet the new servicing requirements outlined in a regulatory enforcement order issued last week. Instead, Citi officials expect operating costs for the mortgage business to rise about $25 million to $35 million per quarter as it hires as many as 500 new employees to handle the increased volume of foreclosures. The bank also expects to take additional charges tied to the overhaul of its servicing business, which could total as much as $40 million to $50 million over the next few quarters. Citi, like most of its big competitors, also faces an array of legal claims from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors who say that the bank sold them securities backed by faulty mortgage loans. Mr. Gerspach said Citi had added about $122 million to its reserves to cover those potential liabilities. Citigroup's investment banking profit fell by 46 percent, to $1.7 billion, from a year ago, when the trading environment was much stronger. Investment banking fees fell 18 percent amid a slowdown in its merger advisory business as well as slower stock and bond underwriting. Trading revenue from its fixed income, commodities and currency group, which long drove the bank's growth, dropped 29 percent. Trading revenue from equities fell 19 percent. Overseas, the news was mixed. For several quarters, the bank's consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America have been one of the few bright spots. Loan losses eased more quickly in those regions than in the United States, and corporate lending has been picking up in those areas. Nearly 70 percent of earnings from Citi's core operations came from overseas in the first quarter. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Vikram S.

With this as the new benchmark for credit-hungry corporate executives, the worry is that banks wind up competing in a game of one-upmanship that leads some to fly solo on riskier deals.Working with just one lender has many merits for borrowers. It has a greater capacity to minimize leaks — an enormous perk when navigating regulatory briar patches like the one AT&amp;T must to win approval for buying T-Mobile. For banks, it means juicy fees and huge bragging rights. It’s going to be difficult for rival banks to meet JPMorgan’s ante. They must have a balance sheet big enough to accommodate so large a single credit without worrying regulators. That probably leaves only Bank of America and Citigroup, both still weak from their excesses in the last boom, given the legal limits on lending. So stepping up on riskier deals would be another way to make a mark. The AT&amp;T loan is about as safe as they come. It’s an investment grade company flush with assets that will generate an estimated $7 billion in cash flow in 2011 after dividends, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Moreover, JPMorgan will soon be joined by a number of other banks interested in taking a slice of the T-Mobile financing. This will create the impression that going it alone isn’t that big a deal. And while joining the syndicate should give banks the first chance on the lucrative refinancing AT&amp;T is sure to start in the bond market, JPMorgan gets the largest share. Moody’s calls the deal a negative since it raises the stakes in an industry that thrives on cutthroat competition. Loans to highly rated companies aren’t too worrisome. That is until bankers, driven by envy and fees, head downscale. Regulators may want to revisit old rules on single-loan limits to nip that possibility in the bud. An Awkward Spot Citigroup is in an uncomfortable spot. Its bankers may have information needed to determine whether the onetime successor to Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman and chief executive, had violated securities laws when personally trading in shares of Lubrizol, which Berkshire just acquired for $9 billion. While uncomfortable, this doesn’t have to be damaging territory for Citi. Merger documents detailing events that led to the Lubrizol deal on March 14 show Citi doing what banks are supposed to do: matching hungry buyers with willing sellers. David Sokol, long considered a leading candidate to take over from Mr. Buffett, asked Citi bankers last fall to come up with good ideas for “possible transactions” in a variety of industries, including chemicals. Citi delivered: on Dec. 13, its bankers went over a list of 18 companies, including Lubrizol, which Citi had already been advising on “a range of strategic alternatives.” Mr. Sokol found Lubrizol attractive and asked Citi to let the company’s chief executive, James L. Hambrick, know he would be interested in having a discussion. So far, so good for Citi. It got the talks started. On Jan. 6 Lubrizol’s board had an “extensive and thorough discussion” about Berkshire’s interest and hired advisers. Shortly after, Mr. Sokol and Mr. Hambrick spoke, and agreed to meet on Jan. 25, where Mr. Sokol made clear that he would need to hand off discussions to Mr. Buffett, who closed the deal. All this is M.&amp; A. 101. And, arguably, the Citi bankers who advised Lubrizol earned their fees for solving the needs of a client that felt its shares were underappreciated. Trouble is that Mr. Sokol, who says he did nothing wrong, bought shares in Lubrizol the day after the Dec. 13 meeting with Citi at which he effectively kicked things off. He did so again on Jan. 5, Jan. 6 and Jan. 7 —before, during and after Lubrizol’s board meeting. Apart from deciding whether the conversations with Citi made Mr. Sokol an insider, the Securities and Exchange Commission must answer a basic question. Did he know the board was meeting on Jan. 6 when he placed his $10 million trade? Going back to the M.&amp; A. textbook, it wouldn’t have been out of the ordinary for Citi to have mentioned that Lubrizol’s board was meeting. If Citi’s bankers haven’t heard from the S.E.C. yet on this question, they’d better prepare.  For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.JPMorgan Chase’s record $20 billion financing for AT&amp;T is turning bankers green the world over.

The transaction, valued at $17.25 a share, represents a 37 percent premium to the closing price of $12.55 a share on Friday. “We believe an investment in Rural/Metro and this industry is a tremendous opportunity for Warburg Pincus,” Sean Carney, a Warburg Pincus managing director, said in a statement. “Rural/Metro is an expert provider of ambulance and private fire protection services with an experienced management team that has delivered excellent results and increased shareholder value,” he added. In its purchase of Rural/Metro, Warburg Pincus follows the lead of another buyout firm, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, which agreed to purchase Emergency Medical Services for about $3.2 billion in February. The deal, which is currently being held up by shareholder litigation, is expected to close later this year. Rural/Metro and Emergency Medical Services, two of the largest players in the private ambulance market, cater to hospitals and businesses like nursing homes and medical clinics. Analysts considered EMS and Rural/Metro to be attractive targets because of the fragmentation of the ambulance market and the opportunity to expand geographically. As the No. 2 player, Rural/Metro is largely concentrated in the Eastern half of the United States, servicing several communities in New York, Tennessee, Ohio and Georgia. The company, which has about $263 million in debt, recorded revenue of $141.3 million in the last quarter, a 6 percent increase from the period a year earlier.

Rural/Metro’s board of directors has unanimously approved the terms of the deal, and it is expected to close by the end of June.

Its stock price was measured in cents, not dollars. But on Monday, the bank announced that it would reinstate a dividend and engineer a reverse split to lift its stock out of the single digits. While these moves are another step in the long turnaround of Citigroup, once the nation's largest bank, they also underscore how far it still has to go. Both actions are largely symbolic. The quarterly dividend will be just a penny a share, down from 54 cents before the financial crisis. And the reverse stock split - giving investors one new share to replace 10 - will raise the trading price from $4.43 to a more respectable $44 a share but not increase the stock's actual value, of course. Citigroup's market capitalization will remain at $129 billion, compared with a high of more than $275 billion before the financial crisis. And with revenue under pressure from volatile trading and the more stringent financial reform rules, analysts expect to company to continue to muddle along for years. ''It has zero impact on the fundamental health of the company,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst who has been critical of Citigroup. ''The company has made strides in several areas from three years ago, but that doesn't mean they have achieved recovery.'' In fact, on a day in which the broader stock market rallied on optimism about the crisis in Japan and AT&amp;T's $39 billion bid for T-Mobile, Citigroup shares fell by 7 cents, to $4.43. Analysts say that stocks tend to underperform after the announcement of a reverse split. Citigroup's comeback efforts still lag behind the progress made by other big banks since the financial crisis. In addition to increasing their dividends, both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo said last Friday that they planned to buy back stock, a step that will actually lift earnings per share. Citigroup is not expected to be able to buy back stock until 2012 at the earliest, because its financial condition remains weaker. Indeed, Citigroup's depressed stock price reflects both its continuing challenges as well as the extraordinary efforts the company had to take to survive the financial crisis amid huge losses on subprime mortgage investments. Billions of new shares had to be issued to bolster its financial position and orchestrate a complex transaction that gave the federal government ownership of nearly a third of the company, in exchange for part of Washington's $45 billion bailout package. For longtime Citi shareholders, the result of all those new shares has meant that the value of their investment now is a fraction of what it was before the crisis. As a result of the 1-for-10 reverse split, planned for May 6, the number of total Citigroup shares will fall to 2.9 billion from 29 billion. Increasing the share price tenfold, even if it is cosmetic, could lead individual shareholders to take another look at Citigroup's stock, and make it easier to buy for institutional investors that have restrictions on owning shares priced under $5. It could also restore Citigroup's place among the companies that make up indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average, which banished it once the stock started to fall. At least in terms of appearances, the reverse split would also put the bank into the company of peers like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, which trade in double digits. ''It's trying to revive the dream,'' said Charles Peabody, a financial services analyst. ''There is a morale issue. There is a perception issue. These are all issues they are trying to address.'' Reinstating the dividend is also largely symbolic. Citi said it planned to pay out an annual dividend of 4 cents a share shortly after it completes the reverse stock split on May 6. It had been paying more than $2.06 during the boom years. In November 2008, regulators forced the bank to eliminate it entirely after receiving a second bailout from the government. Since those dark days, Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, has been trying an ambitious revamping plan, intended to streamline the bank's sprawling operations and transform it from a global financial supermarket into a leaner, more focused lender. The Federal Reserve signed off on the dividend and reverse split after completion of its latest round of stress tests last week.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/4-wall-st-banks-still-dominate-derivatives-trade/?ref=citigroupinc">4 Wall Street Banks Still Dominate Derivatives Trade<date>March 22, 2011, 3:06 pm</date><text>A few select titans of Wall Street continue to dominate the banking industry’s role in derivatives trading, according to a report issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The nation’s four largest banks — JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs — hold nearly 95 percent of the industry’s total exposure to derivatives contracts, the report found. JPMorgan, topping all commercial banks, holds nearly $78 trillion of the industry’s $231 trillion in derivatives, according to the report by the comptroller, the federal agency that regulates national banks. Citi is next on the list, with more than $50 trillion in the insurancelike contracts. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Report on banks' derivatives trading The banks — which structure, buy and trade derivatives — have at least one good reason to wield such a heavy hand in derivatives: they drive profits. Commercial banks in the United States reported trading revenue of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, an 80 percent leap over the comparable period a year earlier, according to the agency’s report. Bank trading revenue reached $22.5 billion for the entire year, nearly equaling the trading revenue records set in 2009. Of course, derivatives can endanger the industry, too. The contracts, which can be used to hedge risk or speculate on market fluctuations, nearly brought the financial system to its knees in late 2008. The No. 1 offender: credit default swaps, which sent the insurance giant American International Group into a tailspin. In the wake of the crisis, banks have shed some of their riskier derivatives. Banks’ credit exposure from derivatives dropped 15 percent to $375 billion in the fourth quarter, according to the report. The amount of derivatives held by all American banks also decreased slightly during the final three months of the year. Common derivatives include futures contracts, options and swaps. Commercial banks primarily use interest rate swaps, which comprise 84 percent of the total value of derivatives. Although more than a 1,000 banks use derivatives, 99 percent of activity occurs at the nation’s 25 biggest banks. That is because only a few banks have the resources needed to handle the complex contracts, according to the comptroller’s report. But some lawmakers and regulators argue that Wall Street is exerting an outsize role in the industry. Many big banks act as derivatives dealers, which structure the contracts for customers to use. They also have financial stakes in some of the major derivatives clearinghouses and exchanges. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has proposed a rule that would prevent a bank or financial firm from controlling more than 20 percent of any one derivatives exchange or execution facility. The Justice Department has called for even tougher curbs on efforts to monopolize the derivatives industry. As The New York Times reported in December, the Justice Department has been investigating possible anticompetitive practices in the industry.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/treasurys-tarp-investment-chief-to-step-down/?ref=citigroupinc">Treasury's TARP Investment Chief to Step Down<date>March 21, 2011, 5:35 pm</date><text>Drew Angerer/The New York Times David N. Miller, the chief investment officer of the Treasury Department’s bailout program. 7:04 p.m. | Updated David N. Miller, the chief investment officer of the Treasury Department’s bailout program, is planning on leaving the government at the end of the month to return to the private sector. Since the onset of the financial crisis, Mr. Miller, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, has worked for two administrations in creating and running programs aimed at stabilizing the nation’s banking system. Mr. Miller said he began thinking about leaving several months ago, in large part because of the difficulty that his job placed on his family. He has been driving back and forth from Washington and his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., twice a week, participating in conference calls as he drives on Interstate 95. “There’s never a perfect time to leave, but it was important to get back to my family,” he said in a telephone interview. “My wife has been ready for this.” The couple has three children. This is the second major departure by a Treasury official connected to the government’s bailout work in recent weeks. James E. Millstein, the Obama administration’s chief restructuring officer, stepped down in February. Revolving Door View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Mr. Miller, 35, joined the Treasury in the fall of 2008, shortly after the start of the financial crisis, to help flesh out the Troubled Asset Relief Program. What emerged from weeks of late nights, fueled by junk food from the Treasury’s vending machines, were major bailout initiatives for Citigroup, Bank of America and other firms. Since then, the government has trimmed the ultimate cost of its bailout programs to $19 billion, from $356 billion a year ago. The Treasury has even generated a profit on some of its investments, including a $12 billion gain on Citigroup. “David’s superior judgment and expertise were instrumental to TARP’s success,” Jeffrey A. Goldstein, Treasury’s under secretary for domestic finance, said in a statement. “He is a true public servant and will certainly be missed.” Among his projects, Mr. Miller said he was most proud of the Capital Purchase Program, in which the Treasury was given up to $250 billion to inject into more than 500 banks. Critics of TARP have argued that the government was too lenient on the banks. But Mr. Miller argued that the main objective, at the time, was preventing a collapse of the financial sector. “The way we’ve done things, we don’t think we’ve given anything away to the banks,” he said. “We were not asked to act like a vulture or distressed investor.” Mr. Miller said that the economy had shown clear signs of improvement, and that confidence in the prospects for banks was returning. But that recovery remains fragile. “We’re in a much better place, but we can’t just assume that the system is completely fixed,” he said. Mr. Miller will be succeeded by Matt Pendo, a former banker who has worked as Mr. Miller’s deputy for almost six months. Mr. Pendo previously worked at Merrill Lynch and then Barclays Capital, where he eventually became a head of United States investment banking. As for what’s next, Mr. Miller said that he planned to return to Scarsdale and eventually look for another job in the New York City area. In the interim, he said he hoped to spend time with his family, deliver a few lectures and train for the New York City marathon.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/citi-announces-quarterly-dividend-of-a-penny-per-share/?ref=citigroupinc">Citi Plans Dividend and Reverse Stock Split<date>March 21, 2011, 8:44 am</date><text>8:24 p.m. | Updated Just two years ago Citigroup stood on the brink of collapse.

Although Mr. Pandit had been hinting at both measures for months, he held them out as “important steps” in his plan to start returning capital to Citi’s beleaguered shareholders sometime in 2012. “Citi is a fundamentally different company than it was three years ago,” Mr. Pandit said in a statement. Under pressure from regulators, he replaced over half of the directors on Citi’s board, overhauled its risk management system, and reduced its balance sheet. Today, the pile of assets that Citi plans to sell or divest is down to $359 billion, less than half of its peak of $827 billion in early 2008. Mr. Pandit has had a few successes. In 2010, Citigroup recorded its first full-year profit since the crisis began — and untangled most of its remaining ties with Washington. Last December, the Treasury Department sold its remaining ownership stake in Citigroup, turning taxpayers a $12 billion profit. But managing the company remains a daunting task made all the more difficult by a number of missteps. Mr. Pandit bungled his first pick of a leader to run Citi’s credit card and retail banking operations, a move that slowed its overhaul even after Mr. Pandit turned over the reins last year to Manuel Medina-Mora. He was urged by Citi’s board to install John P. Havens, a trusted lieutenant running Citi’s investment bank, as chief operating officer over concerns that overseeing 18 senior executives was too much for one person. Mr. Pandit also learned earlier this year that Richard D. Parsons, Citi’s chairman, was thinking about leaving the board, according to a person briefed on the situation. Mr. Parsons was persuaded to stay on for another year, although it was unclear whether Mr. Pandit would eventually be made chairman, like his fellow chief executives at other Wall Street institutions. A spokesman for Mr. Parsons said he holds his “highest regard for what Vikram has accomplished at Citi in overcoming enormous challenges and putting the institution solidly on the right track.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/auction-of-ing-direct-usa-heating-up/?ref=citigroupinc">Auction of ING Direct USA Is Heating Up<date>March 10, 2011, 5:14 am</date><text>The auction process for ING Direct USA is gathering speed, a day after the Dutch financial services company ING Group confirmed it was seeking to sell its American online division. A person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told DealBook that ING was in talks with several parties to merge or divest the unit. Potential bidders include Citigroup, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, as well as the commercial lender CIT Group, according to The New York Post, which said ING Direct USA could be worth as much as $10 billion. “If the price quoted by press is achieved,” a JPMorgan Cazenove analyst, Duncan Russell, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday, “then this should have a strongly positive impact on the share price, given that the market capitalization of ING Group is just 35 billion euros and ING Direct USA is roughly 5-7 percent of the group pretax earnings power.” It would also go a long way toward repaying the 10 billion euro bailout ING received from the Dutch government during the financial crisis. That rescue led the European Union‘s competition commission to require the divestment by 2014 of assets like ING’s American unit, once one of the company’s crown jewels. The unit, although a relative newcomer to the United States, became one of the country’s largest savings banks, attracting more than $80 billion in deposits by offering relatively high interest rates. Much of those savings, however, were invested in subprime and Alt-A mortgages that experienced steep declines in value, meaning that the bank’s liabilities soon outstripped its assets. The Dutch rescue in 2009 took the form of a swap. The government took on 80 percent of the risk of the Alt-A mortgage-backed securities, which were then worth 27.7 billion euros, paying 90 cents on the euro for those assets in an emergency move to save ING from going into free fall. That agreement, however, could complicate the sale of ING Direct USA, as the Dutch would be understandably hesitant to continue to guarantee the risky assets of a foreign institution. That may push ING to lean toward merging the unit instead with a company whose assets are complementary, such as Citigroup or CIT. “We would be surprised by a 2011 disposal,” Mr. Russell wrote, suggesting that a deal would be more likely in 2013, the year before ING is required to sell. In February, the bank reported ts results for fourth quarter of 2010, saying that ING Direct’s losses on investments had narrowed considerably, to 22 million euros from 353 million euros in the period a year earlier. “This was attributable to lower impairments on the U.S. investment portfolio,” the bank said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/jpmorgan-sees-dodd-frank-rules-benefiting-europes-banks/?ref=citigroupinc">JPMorgan Says Dodd-Frank Favors Europe's Banks<date>March 9, 2011, 2:16 pm</date><text>Hannelore Foerster/Bloomberg News New financial regulations emerging from Washington could increase the bottom lines of some banks — just not banks on Wall Street. The regulations instead encourage big European banks to steal business from their United States rivals, according to a new report by analysts at JPMorgan Chase‘s British investment bank in London, JPMorgan Cazenove. The rules lose their authority at the United States border, leaving foreign banks to dominate. Of course, some foreign banks operate United States subsidiaries that insure their deposits with the federal government. Those banks, in many cases, would be subject to the new rules. But in general, big banks in Britain, Germany and France “could benefit from regulatory arbitrage opportunities and gain market shares,” thanks to elements of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, the report from JPMorgan Cazenove said. The opportunities arise from Dodd-Frank provisions that force banks to spin off some derivatives business, halt proprietary trading and wind down their investments in hedge funds. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links JPMorgan Cazenove report (pdf) The report noted that European banks face strict limits on executive pay packages, which “could threaten efforts” to attract high-priced talent. But the compensation curbs pose a “significantly less material” threat to profits than the rules facing Wall Street, the report said. Big European investment banks like Barclays and Deutsche Bank “would be the winners” from the Dodd-Frank Act, while Goldman Sachs potentially has the “most to lose from the new rules,” the report said. Goldman faces its greatest threat from the so-called Volcker Rule. Named after Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who proposed the rule, it prohibits federally insured banks from trading for their own benefit rather than for clients, a tactic known as proprietary trading. The hope, lawmakers said, was to prevent banks from using their own capital to take risky bets while the government guarantees their deposits. Goldman was among the first Wall Street giants to wind down its proprietary trading desks after President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law in July. The bank’s principal strategies group, a proprietary desk whose alumni include a former Treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, recently joined the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. JPMorgan Chase has similarly planned to close its proprietary trading business. The Volcker Rule ultimately could “have a significant impact” on trading revenue, according to the report. The rule also prohibits American banks from owning more than a 3 percent stake in hedge funds and private equity shops. Morgan Stanley recently sold its majority stake in the hedge fund FrontPoint Partners to comply with the rule. Morgan Stanley and Goldman are better positioned to comply with another Dodd-Frank rule that requires banks to spin off their derivatives desks into separately capitalized entities. This move will “create regulatory disadvantage” to banks like Bank of America and Citigroup, which are not well prepared for the shakeup, the report said. The report echoes concerns raised by Congressional Republicans. Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee’s capital markets panel, recently complained that the Dodd-Frank Act would push business overseas. “I am concerned,” he said in a March 3 letter to regulators, that some rules “may be setting up a system that encourages regulatory arbitrage, one where American financial companies will be severely disadvantaged.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/corporate-boards-should-add-diversity-to-the-mix/?ref=citigroupinc">Corporate Boards Should Add Diversity to the Mix<date>March 8, 2011, 5:41 pm</date><text>Harry Campbell Directors can be trouble. Just ask Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused a former Goldman Sachs board member, Rajat K. Gupta, of facilitating insider trading while he was on the Goldman board. A current Morgan Stanley director, Howard Davies, has resigned as head of the London School of Economics because of his dealings with Libya. The news about the two men throws a spotlight on the boards of the two firms for the first time since the financial crisis. Goldman and Morgan were, of course, the two Wall Street investment banks that survived the crisis and that not so coincidentally had better corporate governance than their peers. But has anything really changed in the boardroom since the crisis? Heightened scrutiny, to be sure, has led these firms, as well as others, to shake up their boards. Morgan Stanley has three new directors. Goldman also has three new directors and has shrunk its board to 11 members from 12. Citigroup and Bank of America, which together received over $90 billion in federal help, have a majority of new directors. In all four companies — as well as more broadly in corporate America — there is now a preference for operational experience, for people who have run companies. The recent changes on the Goldman board reflect this trend. Goldman’s three new directors are Lakshmi Mittal, the head of the global steel maker Arcelor Mittal; H. Lee Scott Jr., the former chief executive of Wal-Mart; and James J. Schiro, a former chief executive of Zurich Financial Services. These are seriously accomplished people. We are long past the days when O. J. Simpson could serve as a member of the board and the audit committee of Infinity Broadcasting. Boards are now required to have independent members and separate compensation and audit committees. And in financial institutions, there is certainly a renewed focus on risk, with many boards holding separate breakout sessions on the issue. Peter R. Gleason, chief financial officer of the National Association of Corporate Directors, said recently that a single board membership could take 225 hours a year. It has become less of a perquisite or a way to build client relationships and more of a job. Sidney J. Weinberg, the legendary chief executive of Goldman, sat on more than 30 boards, including that of General Electric. But this is no longer possible. According to a recent survey by the corporate directors association, 37 percent of companies limit the number of other directorships a member can hold. So if directors are more dedicated, is change still needed? Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Boards may be more focused, and the names may have changed, but the type of director is increasingly the same: men, and about 15 to 20 percent women, with operational experience. Despite the experience of the financial crisis, no one expects a board member to be able to price a complex derivative. In the case of a financial institution, the job of a director is about asking good questions and monitoring. Those who want or expect more from a financial firm would end up having a board of math Ph.D.’s to the exclusion of all else. This concept applies to other types of companies like General Motors, which, before its bankruptcy, suffered because its board was unwilling to challenge management. But if it is good questioners we want, is it appropriate to put only members of the same club on the board? There have been hundreds of studies on corporate board composition, but there is no consensus on what works. It is unclear whether independent directors add value, though evidence shows that they do bring more independent decision-making. There is also evidence that separating the chairman and the chief executive can add value. And at least one controversial University of Michigan study found that a Norwegian law requiring boards to be at least 40 percent women reduced a company’s market value. There is also little agreement on whether people from different backgrounds add value. In his book “Fault Lines,” the University of Chicago economist Raghuram G. Rajan argues for a diversity of perspective and background, and that directors should come from academia, public interest organizations and other fields. The idea is that these people will bring independent thinking. It also may affect things like compensation. European companies are required to have labor representatives as directors, and this may be one part of the reason that compensation is lower for European chief executives. But boards need to be collegial places, and a more diverse mix of people may upset this need. This is Goldilocks’s porridge, a hard mix to get right, one that varies with each company. But it is important. If the same type of people are always appointed to corporate boards, will anything change? When the next bubble comes along will these directors critically question industry practices? Or will new directors with more diverse backgrounds continue the perceptible improvement in corporate board decision-making and add value? The rush to appoint operational people with the same skill set is an obvious response to the financial crisis. Certainly, operational experience is valuable, but if everyone is the same, it may spur group-think instead. In many banks currently, the only debate is whether board appointees should have an operational background or an operational background specifically from a financial company. Seven of the 13 members of the Bank of America board are from finance companies and two are from financial regulators. The boards of Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman may be more focused these days on risk and compensation, but their directors largely have similar backgrounds. Adding two or three board members with more diverse backgrounds could spur more critical thinking — a type of introspection that was absent before the crisis. And these four are the leaders in reforming governance. General Electric, which also was in a perilous state during the financial crisis, has added only two new members to its 16-member board since. Many financial institution boards remain unchanged. As we enter proxy season, this type of re-examination is a step that all financial institutions should take and shareholders should request. Deadwood needs to be removed, and directors penalized for their companies’ poor performance. For all companies hiring new directors, perhaps it is time they told their search consultants that some diversity in background is appropriate. As of last year, the S.E.C. requires companies’ to state the “experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills” that led them to choose a director. Operational experience may be valuable, but so is critical thinking. People from other backgrounds may be just the right ingredient to perfect this difficult mix. Steven M.

Over the last week, the country’s big banks for the first time released their potential legal exposure in their 10Ks, the annual report companies are required by regulators to provide to shareholders. They were headline-grabbing numbers at most big banks — except for one, Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs said it could face as much as $3.4 billion in ligation costs for all the lawsuits and regulatory investigations it has on its plate. Citigroup said that an additional $4 billion in costs its possible legal matters. JPMorgan Chase said its woes could run $4.5 billion beyond what that bank has already set aside in reserves. Among the big firms, Morgan Stanley’s tab was the lowest at $518 million. These revelations, according to executives at various firms, came after the Securities and Exchange Commission in late 2010 sent a note to a number of chief financial officers reminding them that they are required to make disclosures when there is a reasonable possibility of a loss. The S.E.C., these executives say, followed up to make sure they would provide deeper information. One executive remarked the agency’s reminders were, put politely, forceful. In their various filings, most firms seem to have made their estimate based on “reasonably possible losses.” Said JPMorgan Chase in its filing: “This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the firm is involved, taking into account the firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made.” Morgan Stanley’s decision not to provide a catch-all number turned heads among Wall Street number crunchers this week. The bank opted instead to provide only its estimate for two separate lawsuits, potential exposure that totaled $518 million. It had previously disclosed this amount while other firms had not typically disclosed any litigation estimates. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Some pundits on Wall Street have questioned the premise of any litigation disclosure, saying it sounds like one big guessing game But at least one analyst says it’s a step in the right direction. “If in doubt put it out, that is the adage the industry should live by,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole Securities.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EED8123FF935A15751C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=citigroupinc">Inquiries May Bring Big Fines, Banks Say<date>Published: February 26, 2011</date><text>Several big banks warned investors on Friday that they could face sizable financial penalties as a result of state and federal investigations into abusive mortgage practices. The disclosures by Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup came after a furor late last year over how foreclosures were being conducted. Until now, the banks have emphasized that the foreclosure controversy was mostly a threat to their reputation, rather than a financial worry. But the disclosures, made in the banks' annual financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, suggest that a settlement with the government may affect both. State attorneys general and federal regulators began examining the servicers' practices last fall after reports that some foreclosures were being pursued despite lost or missing documents. In other cases, employees had signed off on thousands of pages of paperwork a month, after only a cursory look. In some cases, banks mistakenly pursued homeowners who should not have been threatened with foreclosure, while other mortgage holders reported it to be nearly impossible to reach anyone at the banks to discuss their situation. The review also includes more basic practices, including scrutiny of whether the original loans were made properly and whether modifications of existing home loans have been done fairly. ''The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny has the potential to subject the corporation to inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect its reputation,'' Bank of America said in the filing. The state and federal inquiries ''could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs,'' Bank of America said. Wells Fargo said in its filing that it was ''likely that one or more of the government agencies will initiate some type of enforcement action,'' including possible ''civil money penalties.'' Citigroup acknowledged that federal and state regulators were investigating its foreclosure processes, which could result in increased expenses, fines and other legal remedies like a program to reduce the principal amount owed on some loans. While Citigroup has determined that ''the integrity of its current foreclosure process is sound and there are no systemic issues,'' it warned that it could be adversely affected by industrywide regulatory or judicial action. Since last fall, a task force of federal bank regulators has been reviewing the foreclosure practices and internal controls of the 14 largest mortgage servicers. The examination has already identified a range of sloppy practices at all the servicers, including inadequate staffing, lax oversight of outside law firms and other vendors hired to assist with the foreclosure process, and errors with documentation. In testimony before a Senate banking committee last week, John Walsh, the acting comptroller of the currency, which oversees national banks, said his agency and other federal regulators had ordered the servicers to take corrective actions. The banks have not yet received any formal proposals from either the attorneys general or the regulators. But a proposed settlement is expected to be ironed out in the coming weeks and then presented to the banks. The banks are eager to put the foreclosure controversy behind them. Earlier this month, Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said the bank was creating a special unit to hold billions of dollars in defaulted mortgages and other toxic debt. Despite reports in recent days that a global settlement of the mortgage accusations was being floated by the Obama administration, for $20 billion or more, some bank officials and regulators expressed skepticism Friday that the eventual hit to the banks will be that high. Indeed, many regulators in Washington are wary of too punitive a settlement for fear of hobbling their recovery just as they are turning around. Memories of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 and the subsequent federal bailout are still vivid. Still, even if any settlement with regulators and the attorneys general does not run into the tens of billions, the financial consequences of the housing boom and subsequent bust will haunt the banks for years. Private investors are seeking to force financial institutions to buy back tens of billions of dollars' worth of mortgages in default, arguing the original loans were made improperly. Over the last year, the biggest banks have set aside several billion dollars each to cover potential claims stemming both from the foreclosure mess and lawsuits by private investors holding soured mortgages. On Friday, Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who is a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requested information from 11 mortgage servicers and foreclosure specialists as part of a separate Congressional investigation. He also requested special reviews of servicer abuse claims, as well as the actions of law firms specializing in foreclosures. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Baltimore.

At first, there is outrage and a determination to find and punish the villains. But passions fade and investigations run into ambiguities.Those with the most money to protect — typically accountants or banks whose knowledge of the fraud is at best debatable — fight to avoid legal liability. Government investigators eventually move on to other cases, and victims seeking revenge and compensation conclude that there is little point to spending more money to pursue uncertain suits. Settlements are reached on terms defendants can live with. But the Bernard L. Madoff fraud is proving to be different, and not just because Mr. Madoff ran by far the largest Ponzi scheme ever encountered. This time those pursuing the investigation have no other case to move on to, and no need to worry about costs. They can spend what they want, with the cost ultimately borne by some of the same Wall Street firms they are suing. That spending has risen to levels that would be unthinkable if this were a normal case. Through the end of last year, the trustee appointed by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation had spent $228.3 million — and that does not count the money that has gone to victims. Baker Hostetler, the law firm representing the trustee, received most of the money. SIPC (pronounced SIP-ick), a Congressionally chartered company that finances itself from assessments levied against brokerage industry revenue, estimates that it will spend a further $1.1 billion on the case. That is equal to the entire annual budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission. That Madoff investigation has produced a lot of information about how Wall Street operated and about the extremely limited influence of those who were looking for signs of fraud. Red flags were seen, but discounted. Surely there were explanations other than fraud, and anyway, there were profits to be made. In one case disclosed this week, the trustee, Irving H. Picard, asserts that some people at Citigroup were suspicious that there might be fraud, but reassured themselves with a different — if equally illegal — explanation for the consistently good returns Mr. Madoff reported. Maybe his legitimate business, which handled a large volume of stock trades, was profiting from front-running customer orders, buying stocks that were about to have big buy orders and then selling them at a profit. It did not hurt that Mr. Madoff’s trading operations were well known on the street, and thought to be highly profitable. Only lately have we learned that those profits ended some years ago. From 2000 through 2007, the trading business reported profits of $324 million. SIPC, having gone through bank records, says almost exactly twice that was stolen from investors in the Ponzi scheme and diverted to the brokerage business. Citi was not where Mr. Madoff had his banking accounts. That was JPMorgan Chase, which is also being sued by Mr. Picard. If all Citi ever did was run a bank, it would be nowhere near this case. But there were other ways to make money off Mr. Madoff. He generated good, but not great, profits year after year. He never lost much money, even when the market was tanking. So some investors figured they could get fabulous returns by using leverage. That was where several banks, including Citi, came in. They would structure derivative securities that let people get multiples of the profits Mr. Madoff generated — less some very nice fees for the bank, of course. The risk for the banks came in the fact they would have to pay out a lot of money if Mr. Madoff continued to have great results. So they “hedged” their exposure. That is a nice way of saying they invested in hedge funds that served as “feeder” funds for Mr. Madoff. The profits on those investments would offset their exposure. They were taking on no risks, or so they thought. The banks put in terms specifying they had no responsibility for any fraud that might be discovered. In late 2008, with the credit crisis destroying almost everyone else’s returns, Mr. Madoff kept reporting good profits. Some banks cashed in their stakes — leaving them exposed if the returns were real but producing cash they may have felt was needed at the time. Those transactions strike Mr. Picard as highly suspicious. He has not found any smoking-gun e-mails showing the banks knew Mr. Madoff was a fraud, but he still wants to get the money they took out and distribute it to other investors who lost money in the Ponzi scheme. 1 2 Next Page »Financial frauds tend to follow predictable paths after they are uncovered.

As the Egyptian revolt unfolded, 13 Arab bourses lost nearly $50 billion in value in a week. With the global markets on the mend last fall, a private equity consortium moved to sell its 93 percent stake in the Egyptian drug maker Amoun Pharmaceutical. In January, the consortium of American investors, including a Citigroup fund, seemed hopeful they could sign a deal for $1 billion, more than triple what they paid in 2006. But as student protests in the country turned to revolutionary upheaval, buyers never materialized. Now, the deal is up in the air, a person with knowledge of the situation told DealBook, speaking on the condition of anonymity. After two years in a state of paralysis, foreign investors slowly began returning to the Middle East late last year, with deal volume showing a modest uptick. But in the wake of the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, deal makers in the region have once again grown cautious, concerned about economic instability and market volatility. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “Deals are being put on hold, but not necessarily abandoned,” said Sarah Alexander, the president and chief executive of the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association, based in Washington. “There is a wait-and-see attitude, as even pricing is difficult to judge at the moment.” That private equity players are getting spooked reflects just how new the territory is for them. Deal volume, which amounted to just $148 million in 2004, reached $3.7 billion three years later, according to data from Bain &amp; Company, a consulting firm. But during the financial crisis, firms retrenched and deal-making all but disappeared. Late last year, private equity started to show signs of life. Egyptian and Saudi Arabian companies accounted for most of the recent purchases. In the largest deal, Abraaj Capital agreed in December to buy a 49 percent stake in Network International, a credit card service provider in Dubai, for $544 million. But then unrest in Tunisia erupted, quickly spreading to Egypt. It touched off concerns that countries with similar economic and political profiles, like Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, could be next, says Jérémie Le Febvre, the head of emerging markets for Triago, a global private equity firm with a base in Dubai. Although hard numbers are not available for such a short time frame, private equity executives, industry consultants and financial professionals in the Middle East say deal makers are playing it safe for the moment. “Investors need some form of reassurance that their interests will be protected,” said Nasr-Eddine Benaissa, managing partner of the Eastgate Capital Group, one of the largest private equity firms based in Middle East. Such reluctance is likely to flow through to fund-raising efforts, which have already been complicated by the crisis. Last year, Abraaj Capital said it would reduce the planned size of its fourth buyout fund to $2 billion, half its initial goal. Initial public offerings, too, will remain weak, as long as the markets are volatile. Amid the revolt in Egypt, the 13 Arab bourses lost nearly $50 billion in value in the last week of January, according to a report by Kamco, the asset management arm of the investment firm Kipco, based in Kuwait. “When the stock markets fell across the region following the unrest in Egypt and Tunisia, it implied that the I.P.O. market will sour — which means exits are very difficult for private equity companies until conditions improve,” said Jochen Duelli, head of Bain’s private equity practice in the Middle East. Still, the Middle East, like many emerging markets, holds great promise for private equity. Economic growth is strong, propelled by oil exports. But the corporate landscape is underdeveloped, in need of outside investments and operating expertise. That is why private equity has expanded its efforts in the region. Egypt alone now counts 17 buyout firms with headquarters or satellite offices there to scout investments, according to the research firm Preqin. Today, there are a total of 14 private equity funds committed to investing in Egypt, either exclusively or as part of a wider geographic focus. In the short term, for foreign investors, “there is uncertainty,” said Mr. Benaissa of Eastgate. “But if one takes a mid- to long-term view, the fundamentals remain attractive.” Across much of the region, private equity firms have mainly concentrated on deals in consumer goods, tourism and commodities — the main industries driving the local economies. Citadel Capital, a private equity firm based in Egypt, sold the Egyptian Fertilizer Company to a consortium led by Abraaj Capital in a deal worth $1.4 billion in June 2007; it was the largest private equity sale ever in the Middle East. Infrastructure also looks promising. InfraMed Infrastructure, founded in 2010, is looking to raise more than $1 billion to buy transportation, electric power, water and waste treatment companies. Bain &amp; Company estimates that the value of infrastructure deals could reach $10 billion a year, more than double the amount for more traditional areas. “The overall economy is in pause mode right now, and it does mean that foreign investment has disappeared,” said Mr. Le Febvre of Triago. But “there is still a need for schools, hospitals and infrastructure, so long-term private equity opportunities remain unchanged.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/citi-messes-again-with-j-r-actors-claim-is-dismissed/?ref=citigroupinc">Citi Messes Again With J.R.: Actor's Award Is Dismissed<date>February 11, 2011, 6:25 pm</date><text>Christian Alminana/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe actor Larry Hagman, posing here as J.R.

The actor Larry Hagman, who played the rapacious oil tycoon in the 1980s hit series “Dallas,” has lost Round 2 of his battle with Citigroup over how it handled his family investment accounts. This week, a Los Angeles County judge overturned a securities arbitration ruling that required Citigroup to pay nearly $12 million in damages and other costs. Judge Michelle R. Rosenbatt vacated the award by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, ruling that a member of the arbitration panel had failed to disclose that he had been involved in a similar legal dispute and thus had a potential conflict of interest, Bloomberg News reports.

It also ordered Citigroup to pay $460,000 in legal fees and other costs. At $11.6 million, this was the largest Finra arbitration award to an individual investor last year. But Citigroup’s lawyers, who appear to be as tenacious as J.R. Ewing, filed a motion in Los Angeles Superior Court in November to dismiss the arbitration award, alleging that the chairman of the Finra panel had failed to disclose his potential conflict of interest from a past lawsuit. Such motions to dismiss an arbitration award are usually not successful, so Citigroup is savoring a rare court victory in this kind of case. “We’re pleased with the court’s decision,” Alexander Samuelson, a Citigroup spokesman, told Bloomberg News. But don’t forget the spirit of J.R.: Mr. Hagman is fighting back and his lawyers plan to appeal. “We think the result is absurd and feel very comfortable that the appellate court will reverse it,” Philip Aidikoff, a lawyer for Mr. Hagman, told Bloomberg News.

But a set of documents, e-mail messages and minutes of crucial regulatory meetings released recently by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission provide fresh detail about just how close to the brink both firms came. This week the commission will release another set of documents on its Web site, including an interactive timeline that goes back to the Great Depression. The site will also feature hours of previously unreleased audio recordings of interviews with major players in the crisis, like Joseph Cassano of the American International Group, who was at the center of the credit-default swaps business. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Crisis Commission Findings The current documents paint an especially desperate picture of Citigroup, one of the most troubled big banks, which needed several cash infusions from the government during the crisis. “In short, I will characterize the liquidity and confidence situation as negative and deteriorating such that viability may be threatened without outside support,” a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation official, Christopher J. Spoth, wrote of Citigroup in an e-mail on Nov. 21, 2008, to the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair. That late-night missive also contained a chilling summary of a call earlier that day between Citigroup’s risk management team and regulators. Shares of Citi fell 20 percent, to $3.77, on Nov. 21, 2008, and were down about 60 percent in that week. The liquidity pool of the bank, which had received its first bailout funds just a few weeks earlier, was shrinking and customers were panicking. The call summary shows that private bank deposits fell $1 billion that day, with $353 million “withdrawn due to Citi name concerns.” The bank was bleeding money elsewhere as well. At 5 p.m., the so-called broker-dealer cash box — the equity and cash that Citigroup keeps on hand to cover short sales — was valued at $15.3 billion. The pot of money had dwindled to $11.4 billion by the end of the day. Amid the turmoil, counterparties were backing away from Citigroup. “UBS initially cut equity finance lines in half to Citi, from $1.8 billion to $900 million,” the call summary said. UBS temporarily reversed its decision after Citigroup’s senior management reached out to the banks. But the call summary said UBS planned on Monday to ask Citigroup to post additional collateral and would no longer accept certain collateral. That Sunday, documents show, Ms. Bair chaired a closed-door meeting of F.D.I.C. directors to discuss Citigroup’s rapidly deteriorating financial position. Directors gathered in person and by phone to determine whether Citigroup’s ailing health posed a systemic risk. “In hindsight, I think there have been some systemic situations prior to this one that were not classified as such,” said John M. Reich, an F.D.I.C. director, according to a transcript of the meeting. “The failure of IndyMac pointed the focus to the next weakest institution, which was WaMu, and its failure pointed to Wachovia, and now we’re looking at Citi, and I wonder who’s next.” The meeting ended with an agreement that Citigroup should be considered systemically important to the American financial system. The next day regulators intervened. The Treasury, along with the F.D.I.C., agreed to provide protection against the possibility of unusually large losses on an asset pool of $306 billion of loans and securities backed by residential and commercial real estate and other assets. “Citi is a fundamentally different company today than it was before the crisis,” a company spokesman said on Wednesday. “Under Vikram Pandit’s leadership, Citi has overhauled its risk management, reduced its risk exposures and bolstered its financial strength. With the goal of supporting the American and global economic recovery, Citi is implementing a strategy based on its core banking businesses and is focused on responsible growth.” Morgan Stanley, too, was on shaky ground, before negotiating a cash infusion in October 2008 from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan. “Morgan is the ‘deer in the headlights’ and having significant stress in Europe,” wrote Amy White of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in an e-mail on Sept. 19, 2008, to several senior officials of the New York Fed, including its then-chairman, Timothy F. Geithner, currently the Treasury secretary. “It’s looking like Lehman did a few weeks ago,” Ms. White wrote, on a day when Morgan Stanley experienced $22 billion in outflows from its prime brokerage unit. As is well-known at this point, Lehman Brothers was sinking fast. In the bank’s final days, just a week or so before Ms. White’s email, Lehman desperately turned to JPMorgan Chase for advice, and a financial lifeline. “They sent the Junior Varsity — they have no proposal and are looking to us for ideas/credit line to bridge them to the first quarter when they have [sic] intend to split into good bank/bad bank,” a JPMorgan executive, John J. Hogan, wrote in a message to a colleague, Steven D. Black. Mr. Black responded, looping in his boss, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive: “Let’s give them an order for the same drugs they have apparently been taking to think that we would do something like that.” Lehman filed for bankruptcy less than a week later in the largest corporate failure in American history.

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday announced charges against three hedge fund managers, depicting a ''triangle of trust'' in which the three shared tipsters and illegally pooled confidential information about publicly traded technology companies. The complaint also details a brazen cover-up that involved destroying computer hard drives with pliers and tossing them into random Manhattan garbage trucks in the dead of night. Two of the managers charged, Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil, were accused of insider trading while employed at SAC Capital Advisors, the Stamford, Conn., hedge fund run by the billionaire Steven A. Cohen. The two join several other former SAC employees who have been ensnared by the government's investigation. Neither SAC nor anyone now at the fund has been accused of wrongdoing, and it is cooperating with the investigation. The recent charges stem in part from the investigation that led to the arrest in October 2009 of Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire co-founder of the Galleon Group and the most prominent hedge fund executive charged with insider trading. But government investigators have been increasingly examining hedge fund traders' use of so-called expert network firms. These research firms are essentially matchmakers, connecting hedge funds with employees at public companies and other specialists who are paid to provide the funds with insight into their businesses and industries. Over the last 16 months, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has charged 46 people with insider trading. Of those, 29 have pleaded guilty. At least eight associates of expert network firms have been charged. Now prosecutors have turned their focus and harsh words to the hedge funds that they say traded on confidential information. Mr. Bharara said on Tuesday that while there was nothing inherently wrong with hedge funds or expert network firms, ''if you have galloped over the line; if you have repeatedly made a mockery of market rules; if you have converted a legitimate enterprise into an illegal racket, then you have done something wrong and you will not get a pass.'' At a news conference Tuesday, Mr. Bharara deplored the prevalence of illegal trading on Wall Street. He said that, given the scope of the allegations, ''we are not talking simply about the occasional corrupt individual; we are talking about something verging on a corrupt business model, for the defendants seem to have taken the concept of social networking and turned it into a criminal enterprise.'' The complaint announced Tuesday, which accuses the three of trading on confidential information passed along by insiders at technology companies, also describes how two of the hedge fund managers tried to conceal their crimes. After reading news articles in November about a grand jury investigation into insider trading, Mr. Longueuil destroyed the flash drive on which he had logged his conversations with company insiders, as well as two external hard drives bearing incriminating evidence, the complaint says. It says he recounted his actions in a taped telephone conversation with Mr. Freeman. ''You take two pairs of pliers, and then you rip it open,'' Mr. Longueuil, said, according to the complaint. ''Pulled the external drives apart. ... Put 'em into four separate little baggies, and then at 2 a.m. ... 2 a.m. on a Friday night, I put this stuff inside my black North Face ... jacket, ... and leave the apartment and I go on like a 20 block walk around the city ... and try to find a, a garbage truck ... and threw the [expletive] in the back of like random garbage trucks, different garbage trucks ... four different garbage trucks.'' At the news conference Tuesday, Mr. Bharara called the cover-up effort described in the complaint ''something out of a bad movie'' and joked that this probably was the first time that a Wall Street portfolio manager used pliers as ''a tool of the trade.''</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/kindred-healthcare-to-buy-rehabcare-for-900-million/?ref=citigroupinc">Kindred Healthcare to Buy RehabCare for $900 Million<date>February 8, 2011, 7:42 am</date><text>Kindred Healthcare, a private health care company based in Louisville, Ky., agreed on Tuesday to acquire RehabCare Group for roughly $900 million in cash and stock. The deal, the companies said, will create the largest post-acute health care services company in the United States, with operations in 46 states and more than $6 billion in annual revenue.

Kindred plans to issue about 12 million shares for the deal. Kindred, which will also assume about $400 million in debt, plans to secure about $1.9 billion of long-term financing from JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Global Markets. “We believe that the combination will be highly accretive for Kindred stockholders, provide significant long-term strategic benefits to the stockholders of both companies and enhance our future growth prospects,” Paul J. Diaz, president and chief executive of Kindred, said in a statement. The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of Kindred and RehabCare, which is based in St. Louis, Mo. The deal is expected to close on June 30, and requires two members of the RehabCare board to join the Kindred Board. Morgan Stanley advised Kindred, while Citigroup was the financial adviser to RehabCare.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/nyregion/08nyc.html?ref=citigroupinc">Mets’ Owners and Fiscal Scandals: Citi, and Now Madoff<date>Published: February 7, 2011</date><text>Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, is a pleasant stadium — handsome, easily reached by public transportation, child-friendly and packed with diverting food choices in those all-too-frequent moments when the team itself loses its entertainment value. In fact, one of the few things that feel wrong with Citi Field is its name.Make that: one of the few things that continue to feel wrong. Frowns have been abundant ever since the Mets, in 2006, accepted Citigroup’s reported offer of $20 million a year for 20 years for the privilege of slapping its name on the stadium’s facade. But a financial stain that now threatens the team reinforces why many noses have wrinkled in distaste over the choice. The Mets’ owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, stand accused in a lawsuit of having enriched themselves through their long and close connection to the execrable Bernard L. Madoff, whose Ponzi scheme, the lawsuit says, should have been evident to them. The trustee for Madoff victims, who is suing Messrs. Wilpon and Katz, seeks so much money from them, $1 billion, that their ability to hold onto the team has been thrown into doubt. Both men call the trustee’s tactics “outrageous” and his allegations unfounded. Mr. Wilpon has said that he was as much a victim of Mr. Madoff as anyone. But he and Mr. Katz are in trouble. They need money, and have already begun looking for someone to buy a minor share of their ball club. No matter how the lawsuit plays out, the rancid air of impropriety now permeates the Wilpon-Katz Mets, unlikely to be cleansed soon, if ever. The situation is hardly improved by that name above the ballpark entrance. Thanks to a bailout by American taxpayers, Citigroup has rebounded from its near-death experience in 2008. But it remains a symbol of all that went haywire on Wall Street and propelled the United States economy toward disaster. Bad enough that the Mets’ owners are enduringly scarred by their Madoff connection. By clinging to the Citi name, they are also saying they have no qualms about identifying themselves with a central player in one of the biggest financial debacles in this country’s history. Is this, some might wonder, truly good for New York? Its taxpayers, remember, are on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars that went into building this stadium and a companion ballpark for the Yankees, in the form of infrastructure improvements and tax-exempt financing. New Yorkers thus have a stake in what one of the city’s most prominent structures is called. Plenty of alternatives to the sullied Citi name have been suggested. (A favorite here remains Debits Field, but that sort of change is not about to happen.) The name Shea Stadium served just fine for many years. There is no reason why it couldn’t do so once again. The ballpark that went by that name may not have been the finest, but it had the advantage of honoring someone who did something that was actually useful. William A. Shea, a power broker of the first order five decades ago, helped bring National League baseball back to New York after the Giants and the Dodgers had fled to California. The city cannot compel the team and Citigroup to agree to a divorce, amicable or otherwise. But as the Mets’ landlord, the city could lean awfully hard. Our billionaire mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, would seem uniquely positioned to deal persuasively with others who dwell in the income stratosphere. City Hall is disinclined to act, though. Its consistent policy has been that “we’re going to honor the lease agreement, which gives them the authority to designate a sponsor,” said Frank Barry, a Bloomberg spokesman. “Them” referred to the team’s owners. Indeed, the city’s lease with the Mets bestows on them “the exclusive right to designate the name of the stadium,” with a couple of exceptions. The sponsor’s name or logo may not be obscene. “Nor,” the lease says, “shall it be antithetical to the character of the stadium as a prominent symbol of the city.” Purveyors of tobacco products — don’t forget who the mayor is — are the only ones singled out as being antithetical. It will have to be left to others, then, to decide if the behavior of Citigroup, which helped bring about the worst financial crisis in eight decades, meets the dictionary’s definition of obscene as “offensive to one’s feelings, or to prevailing notions, of modesty or decency.” E-mail: haberman@nytimes.comCiti Field, home of the New York Mets, is a pleasant stadium — handsome, easily reached by public transportation, child-friendly and packed with diverting food choices in those all-too-frequent moments when the team itself loses its entertainment value.

Leading the stock sale will be Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Representatives for Ally and the banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. The banks made presentations to Ally’s senior executives late last week, people briefed on the matter previously said. The impending initial public offering for Ally, the onetime auto financing arm of General Motors, is the latest effort by the government to exit a stake it gained through its taxpayer-financed bailouts during the financial crisis. All of the underwriters have worked on at least one other stock sale at a taxpayer-rescued company. JPMorgan has taken a lead role in stock sales for General Motors and the American International Group. Goldman is also handling the A.I.G. sale, while Morgan Stanley was the other main underwriter for the G.M. offering. The Treasury Department has hired Perella Weinberg Partners to advise on the transaction. The fees aren’t expected to be particularly high; G.M.’s initial offering fetched Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan a rate of just 0.75 percent.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E0DE1E31F931A35751C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=citigroupinc">Citigroup Takes Control of EMI, Ending Troubled Deal and Raising Prospect of a Sale<date>Published: February 2, 2011</date><text>Updated at 8:02 p.m. | Citigroup on Tuesday seized control of EMI from Terra Firma, ending the private equity firm's disastrous ownership of the famous music company and most likely accelerating the search for new owners. Terra Firma, which is led by the British financier Guy Hands, had borrowed heavily to acquire EMI for $8.4 billion at the height of the credit market. In taking over EMI, Citi wrote off 65 percent of its loan, or $3.5 billion, leaving EMI with $1.9 billion of outstanding debt and more than $480 million in cash, the two companies announced in a joint statement. EMI, which releases music by acts like the Beatles, Pink Floyd and Coldplay, and also controls the largest catalog of musical compositions in the world through its publishing division, will continue to operate under its current management, but Citi is expected to look for new buyers soon.The handover in ownership of EMI, a British company, ends a publicly acrimonious arrangement between Citi and Terra Firma. In a lawsuit argued late last year, Terra Firma claimed that Citi had misled it during the bidding for EMI in 2007. Mr. Hands sought $8 billion in the suit, but a jury sided with Citi. Citi provided about $5.5 billion of EMI's purchase price in 2007 through a loan to the company. But Citi was unable to resell the debt, and Terra Firma had to invest more than $300 million to meet the requirements of regular financial covenant tests. The next test was scheduled for the end of March, and Terra Firma was reportedly unwilling to inject any additional capital. Citi's seizure of EMI has been widely expected, but it happened more quickly than many on Wall Street or in the music industry thought it would. On Tuesday morning in London, PricewaterhouseCoopers took over as joint administrators of Terra Firma's holding company for EMI, and sold it to Citi. Even Terra Firma may have been surprised by the timing: The Financial Times reported that the company did not have any advance warning of it. A spokesman for Terra Firma would not comment on the timing or on the company's losses, but said: ''Terra Firma is pleased that EMI's debt burden has been reduced through Citi agreeing to write down a substantial proportion of EMI's debt.'' EMI, which has struggled under the weight of its debt and lost major acts like Radiohead amid aggressive cost-cutting, said that Citi's recapitalization gave it breathing room to operate. ''This is a transformational event,'' Roger Faxon, chief executive of EMI, said in an interview on Tuesday. Analysts welcomed the transition. ''It's good news for EMI because this transfer of ownership has happened without it going down to the wire, without a crisis,'' said Claire Enders, a media analyst in London who has followed Terra Firma and EMI. Some analysts speculated that Citi's takeover of EMI might have been accelerated to beat another large music company, the Warner Music Group, to market. Last month, The New York Times reported that Warner had hired Goldman Sachs to help seek potential buyers for all or part of the company. Warner is also exploring buying EMI. Like Warner, EMI could be split into two divisions, one for recorded music and another for publishing, to suit a buyer or overcome regulatory hurdles. Another possible buyer of all or some of EMI would be BMG Rights Management, a joint venture between the German media giant Bertelsmann and the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The takeover of a venerable British company by an American bank did not escape the notice of the British news media. But in a memo to employees on Tuesday, Mr. Faxon wrote: ''Regardless of the country of origin of our owner, EMI remains a British company - both legally and spiritually. The history, tradition and heritage of this company cannot, and will not, be erased by a change in shareholding.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Resurgent markets help. But policy makers, especially Basel officials, have failed to dilute their influence.Standard &amp; Poor’s, as its parent McGraw-Hill now defines the unit, pulled in $1.7 billion in revenue in 2010, 10 percent more than the year before, as companies flocking to raise debt drove demand for its ratings. Moody’s Investors Service, meanwhile, expects to post a 13 percent increase in revenue. Considering the blame for the widespread crisis flung at raters, they’re making quite a comeback. True, at around $30 apiece, Moody’s shares are 60 percent below their 2007 high. Yet both S.&amp; P. and Moody’s are running with roughly 40 percent operating margins. That suggests highly publicized reforms haven’t challenged their keystone status in credit markets, and perhaps never will. One central problem is that bank watchdogs need to measure credit risk to set capital requirements. Ratings from S. &amp;P., Moody’s and, to some extent, Fitch have always been a convenient yardstick. Regulators are struggling to find alternative methods beyond relying on banks’ own metrics. The latest global bank capital standardization effort, Basel III, continues to embrace ratings. American lawmakers tried to go the other way in last year’s Dodd-Frank Act, requiring the eventual excision of references to ratings from certain regulations, a possible wrinkle when it comes to enacting Basel III in the United States. But they undid some of the good work by insisting on regulating rating firms more heavily, thereby bolstering the perception that ratings come with official approval. The result is that the basic industry model — oligopolistic, officially recognized ratings that are still mostly paid for by the borrowers being rated — remains intact, if encumbered by more red tape than before. For now at least, that’s similar to the more or less business-as-usual result achieved by the banking sector. Citi’s Rock Band Vikram Pandit has been banging his head for years over Citigroup’s financial problems. But that doesn’t qualify him as an expert on heavy metal. So expect the bank to quickly offload EMI, the music publishing and recording business it seized on Tuesday. The takeover ends a four-year cycle of recrimination between the bank and private equity boss Guy Hands. Mr. Hands’s Terra Firma, based in London, overpaid for the business in May 2007, larded on too much debt and then, partly because of cuts needed to meet interest payments, soured relations with EMI’s primary asset: its artists. But Mr. Hands also tripled EMI’s profit. Some financial wiggle room and a charm offensive might be all EMI needs to thrive. That’s assuming the past can be forgotten. Terra Firma lost its entire £1.75 billion, ($2.78 billion) investment, while Citi’s £3.4 billion($5.4 billion) loan to EMI, which has now made it the proud owner of the business, has been written down to £1.2 billion ($1.9 billion). That new low base is important. Since Terra Firma bought EMI in 2007, the Warner Music Group, EMI’s closest industry rival, has fallen in market value by around 68 percent. Assuming a similarly downward trajectory, EMI would now be worth the carrying value for the business on Citi’s balance sheet. Because the bank has already taken that write-down, the bizarre rules of Wall Street accounting mean anything above that price earned in a sale to, say, Warner Music or K.K.R., would turn into a gain for Citi. And either of them — or even, ironically, Mr. Hands himself — would be a more suitable owner for EMI than a bank. Moreover, with £300 million, or $477 million, of cash in the bank and a two-thirds reduction in interest payments, EMI is suddenly in good shape. Mr. Hands may have turned off a few divas, but under Terra Firma’s stewardship earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose from £90 million, or $143 million, at the end of 2007 to £241 million, or $383 million, two years later. So if Citi can find a buyer willing to pay 10 times those profits it will effectively double its written-down paper investment in EMI. Though considerable damage has been done, that would help turn a four-year dirge into a happier song. RICHARD BEALES, AGNES T.

The report from the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission has been assailed as a confusing mishmash — poorly organized, unclear about what’s new and weakened by conclusions that are at once obvious and unsatisfying. The problems of the commission were evident from the start: its mandate was too broad, its timetable too short, its budget too small and its commissioners too partisan. Those criticisms are true, but overdone. The report is full of fascinating information, rich detail and fine documentary evidence. The commission should be celebrated for putting more than 1,100 documents online for anyone to search. For me, the report’s biggest failing is its timidity in engaging the most important question looming over the crash: What did Wall Street know and when did it know it? The commission was right to devote a great deal of space in the report to collateralized debt obligations, the bundles of mortgage-backed securities that were at the heart of the financial crisis. C.D.O.’s brought down the Bear Stearns hedge funds that precipitated the emergency. C.D.O. positions brought Merrill Lynch and Citigroup to the brink. One of the most pernicious aspects of that business was “cross-buying” — C.D.O.’s buying pieces of other C.D.O.’s. That rendered them more related to each other and more prone to failure. As Jake Bernstein and I reported for ProPublica, banks were engaged in self-dealing, pushing pieces of C.D.O.’s that they were having trouble selling into others and then retaining most of the new C.D.O. The report sheds new light on this practice, particularly at Merrill Lynch. But it’s also maddeningly elliptical. According to the report, the Securities and Exchange Commission says that “heading into 2007, there was a Streetwide gentleman’s agreement: You buy my BBB tranches and I’ll buy yours.” Quid pro quos like this could help sell otherwise unsalable pieces, in order to complete deals and generate fees. Such arrangements could also be made to preserve the value of assets that were otherwise collapsing. Such behavior could run afoul of securities manipulation laws. The Trade View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink But the report doesn’t elaborate or offer internal bank evidence showing how banks struck these deals. A letter to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission from Brad Karp, a lawyer representing Citigroup, suggests that the commission has more documents on Citigroup’s C.D.O. business, including a chart “that details the amount and percentage of Citi-structured C.D.O. securities in Citi-structured C.D.O. transactions.” In other words, the chart shows how much of its own product Citigroup stuffed into new C.D.O.’s. The report identifies why the bank might do that: Citigroup “reported these tranches at values for which they could not be sold, raising questions about their accuracy and, therefore, the accuracy of reported earnings.” But the commission hasn’t yet made the chart public. And it doesn’t provide enough new information to fully understand on how the bank justified its valuations. The S.E.C. accused Citigroup and two executives of failing to disclose its positions, but the subsequent settlement was a mere slap on the wrist. Citigroup declined to comment, but added that it was “a fundamentally different company today than it was before the crisis.” Then there is the question of credit rating agencies’ culpability in the asset-backed securities debacle. One of the central questions of the C.D.O. business: How were the banks able to create tens of billions of C.D.O.’s in the spring of 2007, after the market was already falling apart? One troubling document from March 2007 suggests that Moody’s knew the games that were being played. Yuri Yoshizawa, who was then in charge of C.D.O.’s, e-mailed Raymond W. McDaniel Jr., the chief executive of Moody’s, to say that banks like Merrill, Citi and UBS are “still furiously doing transactions to clear out” their balance sheets but that a well-placed banker “doesn’t believe that they are selling much of the C.D.O. paper.” She wrote that other bankers had told her that the “banks feel that the mark-to-market is less volatile in C.D.O. paper.” In plain English, that suggests that Moody’s executives, including the chief executive, knew banks were making new C.D.O.’s to create the illusion there were buyers for assets they wanted to avoid taking losses on. Yet Moody’s didn’t stop rating new C.D.O.’s — and didn’t downgrade C.D.O.’s for months. But the report doesn’t push this line of inquiry. A Moody’s spokesman said, “Throughout this period, Moody’s was communicating to the market about what we were observing, including the likelihood of increased defaults in C.D.O.’s, though neither we nor other market observers fully anticipated the distress that this market would ultimately experience.” Finally, there’s the issue of how complicit bankers were in creating C.D.O.’s that were built to fail. The commission considered this topic at length, but didn’t add much to the story that hasn’t been reported elsewhere. “No lawyer worth his salt can’t fight a subpoena for a year.” Josh Rosner, of the independent research firm Graham-Fisher &amp; Company, said to me about the commission’s subpoena power at the beginning of the investigation. Sure enough, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, constrained by this weakness, mostly just requested documents rather than demanding them by using subpoenas. Banks sometimes complied, but didn’t have to. In one important instance, Bank of America “failed to produce documents” requested by the commission, the report says. The documents might have further illuminated what bankers at Merrill Lynch, taken over by Bank of America at the height of the panic, knew about a hedge fund’s influence on C.D.O.’s that it was betting against, a topic we also wrote about last year. Bank of America played hardball on request, and the commission’s staff was unlikely to get enough votes from commissioners to subpoena the bank, according to a person knowledgeable about the matter. Bank of America said that it produced more than a million pages of documents to the commission and that it had provided these particular documents to other regulators on a confidential basis, but it was unable to reach a confidentiality agreement with the inquiry commission. There is hope. The commission is expected to continue releasing documents, including transcripts of interviews with bankers. Reporters are likely to find stories for months in the trove of documents, and historians will make use of the report for decades to come.

Freescale has hired Citigroup and Deutsche Bank to lead the offering, as well as Credit Suisse, Barclays Capital and JPMorgan Chase, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The chip company has already signaled that it is preparing for an initial offering, with proceeds from the stock sale meant to help pay down debt. Freescale was acquired near the height of the buyout boom by a group that included the Blackstone Group, TPG Capital, the Carlyle Group and Permira Advisers. Several of the underwriters advised the buyout consortium in the 2006 deal, including Citi, Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers, whose United States operations were acquired by Barclays Capital in 2008. Representatives for Freescale and the banks either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Private equity firms have been lining up to take their portfolio companies public again, hoping to take advantage of improving stock market conditions to generate returns for their investors. Having several portfolio companies queued up for stock offerings also helps these buyout firms as they seek to raise new money. Freescale, which makes chips for a variety of products, including cars and cellphones, has seen its business slowly improve over the past few years. Last week, it reported a $102 million loss, a slight decrease from the same time the previous year, as sales grew slightly to $1.18 billion. But for the full year, it swung to a $1.05 billion loss from a $748 million profit in 2009. Its $4.46 billion in sales, however, was a 27 percent year-over-year gain. The company has been troubled by a big debt load arising from its leveraged buyout, a burden it has sometimes struggled to refinance. News of the underwriters’ hiring was first reported by Bloomberg News.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/citigroup-takes-over-emi/?ref=citigroupinc">Citigroup Takes Over EMI<date>February 1, 2011, 12:31 pm</date><text>Citigroup has taken over EMI, the British music label of the Beatles and Radiohead, under a restructuring of its debt, EMI announced on Tuesday. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The EMI statement Media Decoder The bank’s takeover of the record company had been widely expected, reports Ben Sisario on Media Decoder, as EMI has been struggling under a heavy debt load as a result of its $6.7 billion buyout in 2007 and amid a decline in music sales. The buyout, by the British financier Guy Hands’s private equity firm Terra Firma, came at the height of the buyout boom. Citigroup provided some $4.3 billion in loans to finance the deal. In a lawsuit, Mr. Hands sought to prove that a Citigroup banker had misled him during the auction of EMI. A federal jury in Manhattan sided with Citigroup. The court defeat made relinquishing EMI seem nearly inevitable. Under the deal announced on Tuesday, EMI’s debt has been cut 65 percent, to 1.2 billion pounds from 3.4 billion pounds. Under Citigroup’s ownership, a sale of EMI is likely. Mr. Sisario notes: The turnover could accelerate a possible sale of EMI, which consists of a recorded music division, releasing music by artists like the Beatles and Coldplay, as well as the music industry’s largest publisher, which controls the copyrights of musical compositions. DealBook reported last month that Warner Music was exploring an acquisition of EMI even while it was seeking out potential buyers for itself.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/emi-taken-over-by-citigroup-making-a-sale-more-likely/?ref=citigroupinc">EMI Taken Over by Citigroup, Making a Sale More Likely<date>February 1, 2011, 12:07 pm</date><text>Updated at 8:02 p.m. | Citigroup on Tuesday seized control of EMI from Terra Firma, ending the private equity firm’s disastrous ownership of the famous music company and most likely accelerating the search for new owners. Terra Firma, which is led by the British financier Guy Hands, had borrowed heavily to acquire EMI for $8.4 billion at the height of the credit market. In taking over EMI, Citi wrote off 65 percent of its loan, or $3.5 billion, leaving EMI with $1.9 billion of outstanding debt and more than $480 million in cash, the two companies announced in a joint statement. EMI, which releases music by acts like the Beatles, Pink Floyd and Coldplay, and also controls the largest catalog of musical compositions in the world through its publishing division, will continue to operate under its current management, but Citi is expected to look for new buyers soon. The handover in ownership of EMI, a British company, ends a publicly acrimonious arrangement between Citi and Terra Firma. In a lawsuit argued late last year, Terra Firma claimed that Citi had misled it during the bidding for EMI in 2007. Mr. Hands sought $8 billion in the suit, but a jury sided with Citi. Citi provided about $5.5 billion of EMI’s purchase price in 2007 through a loan to the company. But Citi was unable to resell the debt, and Terra Firma had to invest more than $300 million to meet the requirements of regular financial covenant tests. The next test was scheduled for the end of March, and Terra Firma was reportedly unwilling to inject any additional capital. Citi’s seizure of EMI has been widely expected, but it happened more quickly than many on Wall Street or in the music industry thought it would. On Tuesday morning in London, PricewaterhouseCoopers took over as joint administrators of Terra Firma’s holding company for EMI, and sold it to Citi. Even Terra Firma may have been surprised by the timing: The Financial Times reported that the company did not have any advance warning of it. A spokesman for Terra Firma would not comment on the timing or on the company’s losses, but said: “Terra Firma is pleased that EMI’s debt burden has been reduced through Citi agreeing to write down a substantial proportion of EMI’s debt.” EMI, which has struggled under the weight of its debt and lost major acts like Radiohead amid aggressive cost-cutting, said that Citi’s recapitalization gave it breathing room to operate. “This is a transformational event,” Roger Faxon, chief executive of EMI, said in an interview on Tuesday. Analysts welcomed the transition. “It’s good news for EMI because this transfer of ownership has happened without it going down to the wire, without a crisis,” said Claire Enders, a media analyst in London who has followed Terra Firma and EMI. Some analysts speculated that Citi’s takeover of EMI might have been accelerated to beat another large music company, the Warner Music Group, to market. Last month, The New York Times reported that Warner had hired Goldman Sachs to help seek potential buyers for all or part of the company. Warner is also exploring buying EMI. Like Warner, EMI could be split into two divisions, one for recorded music and another for publishing, to suit a buyer or overcome regulatory hurdles. Another possible buyer of all or some of EMI would be BMG Rights Management, a joint venture between the German media giant Bertelsmann and the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The takeover of a venerable British company by an American bank did not escape the notice of the British news media. But in a memo to employees on Tuesday, Mr. Faxon wrote: “Regardless of the country of origin of our owner, EMI remains a British company — both legally and spiritually. The history, tradition and heritage of this company cannot, and will not, be erased by a change in shareholding.”</text></article></page></root>
