The department and the Coast Guard found in a report issued last month that BP, Transocean and Halliburton had failed to operate the Gulf of Mexico drilling rig in a safe and responsible manner, had heedlessly endangered their workers, had not followed proper well control procedures and had not properly maintained safety equipment, including the blowout preventer. “The joint investigation clearly revealed the violation of numerous federal regulations designed to protect the integrity of offshore operations,” said Michael R. Bromwich, head of the department’s offshore safety office. “To ensure the safe and environmentally responsible conduct of offshore operations, companies that violate federal regulations must be held accountable.” The actions against Transocean, which operated the drilling rig, and Halliburton, which performed the well cementing job, are the first time that the government has cited contractors rather than just a well’s principal owner, in this case BP, for safety violations. The government considers all three parties responsible for the disaster, although the degree of liability will be decided in pending legal actions. The companies have 60 days to appeal the citations.WASHINGTON — The Interior Department formally cited BP and its two chief contractors on Wednesday for numerous safety and environmental violations in the operation of the doomed Deepwater Horizon well.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/science/earth/15spill.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">BP Shortcuts Led to Gulf Oil Spill, Report Says<date>Published: September 14, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — BP, running weeks behind schedule and tens of millions of dollars over budget in trying to complete its troubled Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, took many shortcuts that contributed to the disastrous blowout and oil spill there last year, federal investigators concluded in a report released on Wednesday.The central cause of the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig was a failure of the cement at the base of the 18,000-foot-deep well that was supposed to contain oil and gas within the well bore. That led to a cascade of human and mechanical errors that allowed natural gas under tremendous pressure to shoot onto the drilling platform, causing an explosion and fire that killed 11 of the 126 crew members and caused an oil spill that took 87 days to get under control. The two-part report, compiled by a joint task force of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement and the Coast Guard and covering more than 500 pages, is the most comprehensive to date on the April 2010 disaster. Its findings largely mirror those of other investigations, including the inquiry by a commission named by President Obama to determine the causes of the calamity. That panel issued its findings in January. “The loss of life at the Macondo site on April 20, 2010, and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico through the summer of 2010 were the result of poor risk management, last-minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the Deepwater Horizon,” the latest report said. The report concluded that BP, as the well’s owner, was ultimately responsible for the accident. But it also said that BP’s chief contractors, Transocean, which owned the mobile drilling rig, and Halliburton, which was responsible for the cementing operations, shared the blame for many of the fatal mistakes. The study goes further than previous reports, citing seven violations of federal regulations as factors. Among them were violations of laws that required BP and its contractors to operate in a safe manner, to take measures to contain oil and gas for the protection of health and the environment, to conduct reliable tests of well pressures and to notify federal regulators of changes in drilling plans. The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation that could bring indictments and heavy fines. David M. Uhlmann, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and former chief of the Justice Department’s environmental crimes section, said the Justice Department almost certainly reviewed the findings of the study before it was released. “Today’s report increases the likelihood that BP, Transocean and Halliburton will face criminal charges for their roles in causing the gulf oil spill,” Mr. Uhlmann said in an e-mail. “The Justice Department may have outside experts for both its criminal and civil cases, and it could develop additional information about the causes of the spill in those investigations, but it will be hard for the Department to distance itself from the findings of the Coast Guard and Boemre.” The well blowout unleashed a spill of nearly five million barrels of oil, fouling the gulf and hundreds of miles of beaches, marshes and fish habitats and causing billions of dollars in damage. The three companies have pointed fingers at one another and are engaged in multibillion-dollar litigation to try to spread the enormous costs of the accident. Families of crew members are suing the companies in federal court, seeking compensation and damages. BP said in a statement that it had long acknowledged its role in the accident and had urged its drilling partners to accept their share of the blame. “BP agrees with the report’s core conclusion — consistent with every other official investigation — that the Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties, including Transocean and Halliburton,” the company said. It added that it had taken steps to improve its safety practices and strengthen oversight of its contractors. Lou Colasuonno, a Transocean spokesman, said that the report identified the cement failure as the primary cause of the accident and defended the actions of Transocean crew members. “We take strong exception to criticisms of the Deepwater Horizon drill crew, nine of whom perished fighting to save their fellow crew members and the rig, for the actions they took in the face of such an unprecedented emergency,” he said in a statement. A Halliburton spokeswoman said that BP was to blame for poor well design and that at least some of the cement set by Halliburton did not fail. The company absolved itself of any blame. “Every contributing cause where Halliburton is named, the operational responsibility lies solely with BP,” the statement said.  WASHINGTON — BP, running weeks behind schedule and tens of millions of dollars over budget in trying to complete its troubled Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, took many shortcuts that contributed to the disastrous blowout and oil spill there last year, federal investigators concluded in a report released on Wednesday.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/world/middleeast/29reconstruct.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Greenhouse Suit Against Army Corps of Engineers Is Settled<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>Ending a six-year legal battle, the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to pay nearly $1 million to a former top contracting official who charged that she was demoted after she objected to a $7 billion no-bid contract granted to a Halliburton subsidiary to repair oil fields in Iraq.In a settlement agreement signed this month and made final by a federal judge this week, the Army Corps of Engineers agreed to pay the former official, Bunnatine H. Greenhouse, $970,000 to cover lost wages, legal fees and compensatory damages, including for harm to her reputation and her mental health. Legal fees make up about 40 percent of the total, said Michael D. Kohn, a lawyer for Ms. Greenhouse. While the Pentagon made no admission of wrongdoing, the payment for damages is unusually large for a lawsuit by a federal employee, Mr. Kohn said. He said it validated Ms. Greenhouse’s charges. The United States attorney’s office in Washington and the Pentagon confirmed the terms of the agreement, but they declined to comment further. The dispute is rooted in the frenetic days leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and in a project that came to symbolize the high costs and poor oversight of Iraqi reconstruction efforts. In early 2003, the Army, in secret and without competitive bidding, put KBR, then a subsidiary of Halliburton, in charge of restoring Iraqi oil production, in a contract potentially worth $7 billion over five years. The Pentagon later said that doing so was necessary because of the “compelling emergency” of war. Ms. Greenhouse, a career civil servant who was the chief contracts monitor at the Army Corps of Engineers at the time, objected that the contract was based on repair plans and cost estimates that KBR itself had been hired by the corps to prepare, and that the emergency conditions did not justify a multiyear no-bid contract. After internal clashes and threats of demotion, she went public with her concerns in 2004. Ms. Greenhouse was demoted from the Senior Executive Service and given a poor performance rating, prompting her to bring the lawsuit. As part of the settlement, Ms. Greenhouse, 67, formally retired this week with full benefits. In the end, KBR collected about $2.4 billion under the disputed contract, according to a Congressional report. It was largely superseded in 2004 by new, competitively awarded contracts that divided up the oil work in Iraq between KBR and the Parsons Corporation.Ending a six-year legal battle, the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to pay nearly $1 million to a former top contracting official who charged that she was demoted after she objected to a $7 billion no-bid contract granted to a Halliburton subsidiary to repair oil fields in Iraq.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/business/energy-environment/17oil.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">As Iraq Oil Industry Rebuilds, American Subcontractors Dominate the Work<date>Published: June 16, 2011</date><text>MOSCOW — When Iraq auctioned rights to rebuild and expand its oil industry two years ago, the Russian company Lukoil won a hefty portion — a field holding about 10 percent of Iraq’s known oil reserves.It seemed a geopolitical victory for Lukoil. And because only one of the 11 fields that the Iraqis auctioned off  went to an American oil company — Exxon Mobil — it also seemed as if few petroleum benefits would flow to the country that took the lead role in the war, the United States. The auction’s outcome helped defuse criticism in the Arab world that the United States had invaded Iraq for its oil. “No one, even the United States, can steal the oil,” the Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, said at the time. But American companies can, apparently, drill for the oil. In fact, American drilling companies stand to make tens of billions of dollars from the new petroleum activity in Iraq long before any of the oil producers start seeing any returns on their investments. Lukoil and many of the other international oil companies that won fields in the auction are now subcontracting mostly with the four largely American oil services companies that are global leaders in their field: Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Weatherford International and Schlumberger. Those four have won the largest portion of the subcontracts to drill for oil, build wells and refurbish old equipment. “Iraq is a huge opportunity for contractors,” Alex Munton, a Middle East analyst for Wood Mackenzie, a research and consulting firm based in Edinburgh, said by telephone. Mr. Munton estimated that about half of the $150 billion the international majors are expected to invest at Iraqi oil fields over the next decade would go to drilling subcontractors — most of it to the big four operators, which all have ties to the Texas oil industry. Halliburton and Baker Hughes are based in Houston, as is the drilling unit of Schlumberger, which is based in Paris. Weatherford, though now incorporated in Switzerland, was founded in Texas and still has big operations there. Michael Klare, professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College and an authority on oil and conflict, said that American oil services companies were generally dominant both in the Middle East and globally because of their advanced drilling technology. So it is no surprise, he said, they came out on top in Iraq, too — whatever the initial diplomatic appearances. United States officials have said that American experts who advised the Iraqi oil ministry about ways to restore and increase petroleum production did so without seeking any preferences for American companies. And immediately after the 2009 auction round won by Lukoil, the United States Embassy spokesman in Baghdad, Philip Frayne, told Reuters that “the results of the bid round should lay to rest the old canard that the U.S. intervened in Iraq to secure Iraqi oil for American companies.” But Professor Klare said that the American officials who had advised the Iraqi government on its contracting decisions almost certainly expected American oil services companies to win a good portion of the business there, regardless who won the primary contracts. “There’s no question that they would assume as much,” he said. The American oil services companies, which have been in Iraq for years on contract with the United States occupation authorities and military, are expanding their presence even as the American military prepares to pull out. For example, Halliburton, once led by former Vice President Dick Cheney, has 600 employees in Iraq today and said in a statement that it intended to hire several hundred more before the end of the year. “We continue to win significant contracts in Iraq, and are investing heavily in our infrastructure,” Halliburton said. The 11 contracts Iraq signed with oil majors, including the six for the largest fields, are intended to raise Iraqi output from about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day now to 12 million barrels daily in 2017. Some of the oil services contracts are for repairing currently productive fields, others to tap mostly unused sites. 1 2 Next Page »MOSCOW — When Iraq auctioned rights to rebuild and expand its oil industry two years ago, the Russian company Lukoil won a hefty portion — a field holding about 10 percent of Iraq’s known oil reserves.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/business/global/12bribe.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Tesler Pleads Guilty in Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root Foreign Bribery Case<date>Published: March 11, 2011</date><text>HOUSTON (AP) — A British lawyer accused of helping a former Halliburton subsidiary bribe Nigerian officials to win more than $6 billion in contracts pleaded guilty Friday to federal charges and was ordered to forfeit nearly $150 million.The lawyer, Jeffrey Tesler, 62, was charged with conspiracy and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which among other things prohibits payments to foreign government officials to help obtain business. Mr. Tesler will be sentenced June 22. Nine other counts were dismissed under the plea deal. Judge Keith P. Ellison of United States District Court released Mr. Tesler, a dual citizen of Britain and Israel, on $50,000 bond and ordered him to stay in Houston until his sentencing. Mr. Tesler was arrested in London in February 2009, and accused of helping steer bribe money from the Houston-based Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root to Nigerian government officials to win more than $6 billion in contracts for liquefied natural gas facilities. The bribery occurred for about 10 years, through 2004, and Mr. Tesler was involved in at least four construction contracts, an assistant United States attorney, William Stuckwisch, said. Mr. Tesler’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that their client should not be extradited because the crimes did not have a substantial link to the United States and the passage of time might prevent a fair trial. The British High Court in January said Mr. Tesler could be sent to the United States. Another British man indicted with Mr. Tesler, Wojciech Chodan, pleaded guilty in December to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. His sentencing is set for April 27. The charges against the pair were part of a federal investigation of Kellogg, Brown’s practices in Nigeria. In February 2009, KBR pleaded guilty in Houston federal court to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by authorizing and paying bribes from 1995 to 2004 for contracts to build liquefied natural gas facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria. The company agreed to pay more than $400 million in fines. A major engineering and construction services company with operations around the world, Kellogg, Brown split from Halliburton in 2007 and is now known as KBR Inc. KBR’s former chief executive, Albert J. Stanley, pleaded guilty in September 2008 for his role in the bribery scheme and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 5.HOUSTON (AP) — A British lawyer accused of helping a former Halliburton subsidiary bribe Nigerian officials to win more than $6 billion in contracts pleaded guilty Friday to federal charges and was ordered to forfeit nearly $150 million.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/digging-deeper-on-macondo/?ref=halliburtoncompany">Digging Deeper on Macondo<date>February 17, 2011, 1:09 pm</date><text>European Pressphoto Agency BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico after the explosion in April. The commission appointed by President Obama to plumb the causes of the blowout of BP’s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year presented its findings a month ago. The seven-member panel essentially concluded that the accident and subsequent oil spill were the result of a cascade of management failures, regulatory oversights, missed signals and time-saving shortcuts that combined to take 11 lives and produce the worst offshore oil release in the nation’s history. On Thursday, the panel released an even more detailed accounting of the immediate causes of the failure of the well that repeats the conclusions of the earlier report but adds new detail to the hours and minutes immediately preceding the deadly catastrophe. The report, compiled by the commission’s chief counsel, Fred Bartlit Jr. and a staff of lawyers and engineers, identifies numerous crucial mistakes and failures to act by the three main companies involved in the well, BP, Halliburton and Transocean. For example, BP had previous warning of quality lapses at Halliburton, which was responsible for the cement job that should have kept the oil and gas contained within the well bore. The new report also cites an engineering reorganization at BP in early 2010 that led to delays and distractions aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Mr. Bartlit’s team also found that BP’s well site leaders had accepted an implausible explanation for a failed pressure test in the well; when that explanation was forwarded to Pat O’Bryan, BP’s vice president responsible for drilling and well completions, he responded with the following e-mail: Mike, ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Regards, Pat. The report notes that Mr. O’Bryan was on the rig during the crucial test but was not asked about its implications. “If anyone had consulted him or any other shore-based engineer, the blowout might never have happened,” the report concludes. The commission’s co-chairmen, the former Florida Senator Bob Graham and William K. Reilly, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that Thursday’s study was the most comprehensive accounting yet of the events leading up to the explosion. “In clear, precise and unflinching detail,” Mr. Graham and Mr. Reilly said in a statement, “this report lays out the confusion, lack of communication, disorganization and inattention to crucial safety issues and test results that led to the deaths of 11 men and the largest offshore oil spill in our nation’s history.” Mr. Bartlit said he had reluctantly concluded that the Deepwater Horizon accident was a preventable disaster that could be repeated without a major overhaul of industry drilling practices and government oversight. “Poor decisions by management were the real cause,” he said in a statement accompanying the release of his report. “Our team of investigators unearthed significant information about the blowout and greatly advanced our understanding of this tragedy. We are putting forward this additional detailed report in the hope that the public, industry and government officials will learn from it, and future disasters might be prevented.” 5:56 p.m. | Updated In a statement, a BP spokesman emphasized on Thursday that the company had “fully cooperated” with the commission’s inquiry and other investigations and “made every effort to understand the causes of the Deepwater Horizon accident to help prevent similar events from occurring in the future,” conducting its own inquiry into the disaster as well. “The findings of the presidential commission – particularly that the accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties – are largely consistent with those contained in the BP internal investigation report,” said the spokesman, Scott Dean. “BP has already incorporated the findings of these reports into its current and future plans and has made significant management and organizational changes to further enhance the company’s safety and risk management processes going forward,” he said. “This includes undertaking a comprehensive review of the way BP supervises its contractors.” The report from the presidential commission’s chief counsel has some interesting accompaniments. For instance, here’s a video/graphic overview of the Macondo well’s technology and design another on the blowout stack. And here’s a video that shows how the oil entered the well bore and got past the cement.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/25halliburton.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Halliburton’s Strong Results Top Estimates<date>Published: January 24, 2011</date><text>The Halliburton Company said Monday its net income more than doubled in the fourth quarter as oil drilling activity remained strong away from the Gulf of Mexico.The company reported net income of $605 million, or 66 cents a share in the quarter, up from $243 million, or 27 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 40 percent, to $5.16 billion from $3.69 billion. Excluding a charge, earnings were 68 cents a share in the quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected earnings of 63 cents a share on revenue of $4.9 billion. The chief executive, David J. Lesar, said increased drilling activity for oil and natural gas in North American shale rock formations more than offset a loss in Halliburton’s Gulf of Mexico operations. The United States government halted most gulf exploration for several months after the BP oil spill in April. Drilling activity there remains limited. “We believe any meaningful increase of activity levels in the gulf is unlikely in the first half of the year,” Mr. Lesar told analysts in a conference call. Mr. Lesar said the number of rigs working in the United States increased 4 percent from the third to fourth quarters. Halliburton raised rates for its services as activity increased, driving up operating income 10 percent and producing its highest revenue ever in the United States. Halliburton also said exploration and production efforts pressed ahead in other regions, including Norway, West Africa, Iraq and Algeria. Mr. Lesar said the company was “modestly” profitable in Iraq in the fourth quarter, and planned to double its work force in the country to 1,200 employees this year. Shares of Halliburton, based in Houston, rose 36 cents, to $39.55. For 2010, Halliburton earned $1.84 billion, or $2.01 a share, compared with $1.15 billion, or $1.27, in 2009. Revenue rose 22 percent, to $17.97 billion.The Halliburton Company said Monday its net income more than doubled in the fourth quarter as oil drilling activity remained strong away from the Gulf of Mexico.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/opinion/12wed1.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">The Verdict on the Spill<date>Published: January 11, 2011</date><text>The most important new message contained in the final report of the presidential commission investigating the gulf oil spill is aimed squarely at Congress: If lawmakers hope to win popular support for ramped-up oil drilling in America’s coastal waters then they must make sure that every possible precaution is taken to reduce the chances of another catastrophe like the spill.The question is whether the newly constituted Congress is in a mood to listen. What the commission is asking for are tough new rules and money to strengthen federal oversight at a time when the House is controlled by politicians who broadly oppose new spending and seem hostile to regulation of any sort. Yet Congress must act, and President Obama should use some of what leverage he has in this new political alignment to see that it does. As the commission co-chairman, Bob Graham, noted, without dramatic action another deep-water disaster will inevitably occur, leaving the public to “wonder why Congress, the administration and industry stood by and did nothing.” The commission’s 380-page report is the most exhaustive accounting so far of what happened on the Deepwater Horizon. As it forecast in a preliminary summary, the commission blames the accident largely on poor decisions and other “management failures” by three companies involved: BP, Transocean and Halliburton. It also strongly reinforces its earlier indictments of industry for failing to prepare adequate response plans and of government regulators for allowing themselves to be captured by an industry they were meant to oversee. What’s new are the recommendations. All are sound, and most will require Congressional help. SAFETY The commission recommended much tougher rules governing basic drilling issues like well design and vital equipment like blowout preventers. Some of these have already been put in place by the Interior Department. More broadly, it urged Congress to create an independent safety agency within the department free of any political influence and with enforcement authority to oversee all aspects of offshore drilling. FINANCING Though it did not specify a figure, the commission implored Congress to provide “adequate and predictable” financing for regulatory oversight. It noted that money for federal regulators had remained static for 20 years while the risks associated with drilling increased dramatically as rigs moved into deeper and deeper waters. LIABILITY The commission noted that the present $75 million liability cap for individual accidents is hardly enough to deter sloppy behavior. It recommended a much higher figure, without identifying one. SCIENCE The Deepwater Horizon explosion revealed that both industry and federal regulators had given environmental reviews short shrift. The commission recommends that Congress amend the various laws governing offshore drilling to make sure that government scientists and fish and wildlife experts are consulted at every step of the process — from the leasing of areas for exploration to the actual drilling of individual wells. RESTORATION Congress is urged to dedicate 80 percent of the penalties assessed under the Clean Water Act — they could be as high as $20 billion — to restoring the fragile Mississippi Delta ecosystem. The commission’s other co-chairman, William Reilly, noted that the delta had been badly degraded over the years and “is likely to continue silently washing away unless decisive action is taken.” This by no means exhausts the commission’s list of useful ideas. The House of Representatives endorsed several of them in an oil bill it passed last year (the Senate did nothing). Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat of Massachusetts, said that he would hold hearings and introduce an even stronger bill this year. We wish him well — and urge Mr. Obama to support him.The most important new message contained in the final report of the presidential commission investigating the gulf oil spill is aimed squarely at Congress: If lawmakers hope to win popular support for ramped-up oil drilling in America’s coastal waters then they must make sure that every possible precaution is taken to reduce the chances of another catastrophe like the spill.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/spill-commission-issues-recommendations/?ref=halliburtoncompany">Spill Commission Issues Recommendations<date>January 11, 2011, 11:14 am</date><text>A presidential commission has issued its final report on the causes of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and laid out its recommendations.

The presidential commission looking into the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico concludes its work on Tuesday with the release of its final report at 10 a.m. 11:05 a.m. | Updated The report has been released; John Broder’s article is here. The seven-member group, appointed in May by President Obama, had already telegraphed its major findings, placing the bulk of the blame for the disaster on the three companies responsible for the well – BP, Transocean and Halliburton – as well as the federal regulators responsible for overseeing them. In a chapter of its final report released last week, the commission said the industry was plagued by “systemic” problems that could lead to another such accident unless major reforms were undertaken by the government and the drilling companies. On Tuesday, the panel will outline its recommendations for new laws, regulations and industry practices to try to limit the chance of another big blowout and spill. According to people in Washington who have been briefed on the panel’s findings, these are among the group’s major recommendations: Creation of an industry-funded safety organization to ensure that all companies are sharing information and employing best practices in drilling in deep water. A significant increase in budget, manpower and authority at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the primary body overseeing offshore drilling. The agency should have its own enabling legislation and a director insulated from political pressure, the group will say. Greater participation of government scientists and engineers in oil leasing decisions, including early involvement of specialists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Coast Guard. The group will recommend greater public input as well. Lifting the current $75 million cap on corporate liability for damages from an oil spill. Devoting the bulk of fines levied under the Clean Water Act to restoration of Gulf of Mexico waters, fisheries and shorelines. Significantly strengthening the oil-spill-response capabilities of government and industry in the Arctic Ocean before any new major drilling is allowed there. Lengthening the time for review of drilling applications from the current 30 days to at least 60 days, to allow for more thorough assessment of the potential environmental and safety risks of the project. Federal regulators have already undertaken a number of these reforms and are seeking additional money from Congress to pursue others. Industry officials have warned that some of these steps will increase the cost of drilling and add to delays in the granting of permits that have already slowed offshore activity in the gulf. The panel’s findings and recommendations parallel those of a number of Congressional inquiries, but Congress adjourned at the end of the last session without enacting any significant offshore drilling reforms.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/07fri1.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Failure in the Gulf<date>Published: January 6, 2011</date><text>The document released Wednesday by the presidential commission investigating last spring’s oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico is a riveting and chilling indictment of “systemic failures” throughout the oil business and of the federal agencies that allowed themselves to be captured by the people they were supposed to regulate.The commission will offer specific recommendations for reform in its full report next Tuesday. But the chapter it decided to release early is, by itself, a powerful summons to the Obama administration to press rapidly forward with stronger regulations, and to the industry as a whole to behave far more responsibly than it has. Another tragedy like the one in the Gulf of Mexico could well occur, the report suggests, unless there is “significant reform in both industry practices and government policies.” The panel traced the blowout to three main factors: MANAGERIAL FOUL-UPS: The most significant failure and “root cause” of the blowout was a seemingly endless series of fateful missteps and oversights by BP and its partners — Transocean and Halliburton — that, in retrospect, could have been avoided. These decisions included not installing enough devices to stabilize the well, not waiting for the results of tests on the foam used to seal the well, and ignoring the results of an important pressure test. Taken together, these and other blunders allowed gases to enter the well and rise with explosive and ultimately disastrous force to the drilling rig. SYSTEMIC FAILURE: Though BP in particular has been accused of putting profit before safety, the report avoided linking any individual decision to cost considerations. Even so, BP and its partners repeatedly chose the riskier, speedier course instead of a slower and safer alternative. As Bob Graham, the commission co-chairman, noted in a separate statement, “This disaster likely would not have happened had the companies involved been guided by an unrelenting commitment to safety first.” The report further asserted that this risk-taking was not unique to BP or its partners in the well, that the blowout was “not the product of a series of aberrational decisions” made by a rogue company, but, instead, reflected an industrywide proclivity for risky behavior. “Do we have a single company, BP, that blundered with fatal consequences,” asked the other co-chairman, William Reilly, “or a more pervasive problem of a complacent industry?” Sadly, Mr. Reilly said, it is the latter. REGULATORY WEAKNESS: As expected, the panel took federal regulators in the old Minerals Management Service to task for a range of mistakes, like rubber-stamping drilling permits and failing to oversee operations on the rig. These failures are hardly new. For years, the service has had neither the will nor the resources to police the industry. Since the blowout, the Obama administration has reorganized the regulatory apparatus to give it greater independence.

What is at issue here is nothing less than remaking the culture of an entire industry.The document released Wednesday by the presidential commission investigating last spring’s oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico is a riveting and chilling indictment of “systemic failures” throughout the oil business and of the federal agencies that allowed themselves to be captured by the people they were supposed to regulate.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/science/earth/06spill.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Gulf Spill Was Caused by Series of Errors, Panel Says<date>Published: January 5, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — The Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was an avoidable accident caused by a series of failures and blunders by the companies involved in drilling the well and the government regulators assigned to police them, the presidential panel named to study the accident has concluded.The companies — BP, Transocean and Halliburton, and several subcontractors working for them — took a series of hazardous and time-saving steps without adequate consideration of the risks involved, the commission reports in a chapter of its final findings, released on Wednesday in advance of the full report, to be published early next week. The panel also found that company officials had failed to consult with one another on critical decisions and that senior management had paid insufficient attention to the troubled well, which was being drilled a mile under the gulf’s surface. The commission warned that without major changes, another such accident was likely. “The blowout was not the product of a series of aberrational decisions made by rogue industry or government officials that could not have been anticipated or expected to occur again,” it concluded. “Rather, the root causes are systemic and, absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur.” BP’s Macondo well erupted on April 20, causing an explosion aboard the drilling rig that killed 11 men and led to the spill of nearly five million barrels of oil, some of which still befouls the gulf shoreline. In a statement on Wednesday, BP noted that the commission had found fault with a number of companies, not only BP, the main owner of the well. BP added that it was taking steps to deal with problems identified by the panel. “Even prior to the conclusion of the commission’s investigation, BP instituted significant changes designed to further strengthen safety and risk management,” the statement said. Halliburton said in a statement that it had acted at BP’s direction in preparing and injecting cement into the well. It said tests the panel identified as indicating problems with its cement formula were preliminary and did not contribute to the disaster. Halliburton also criticized the commission for what it called selective omissions of exculpatory material it gave to the panel’s staff. A spokesman for Transocean said that BP, not Transocean, made the major decisions in the hours before the blowout. “Based on the limited information made available to them, the Transocean crew took appropriate actions to gain control of the well,” the spokesman said. “They were well trained and considered to be among the best in the business.” The seven-member presidential commission, led by Bob Graham, a former Florida senator, and William K. Reilly, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was charged by President Obama last May with finding the root causes of the accident. It is one of several bodies investigating the blowout. The Justice Department is conducting civil and criminal investigations and has sued BP and others, and there is extensive private litigation against the companies as well. The findings will come as no surprise to the companies or to federal regulators, who say they have already taken steps to address the problems identified by the commission. “The report released today reflects areas the Interior Department has already identified, acknowledged and spent months working aggressively to reform,” said Kendra Barkoff, the department’s press secretary. The presidential panel did not try to assign specific blame for a catalog of mistakes and shortcuts taken by the companies and their employees, but it is clear from the report that the major players engaged in highly risky behavior that neither senior management nor government regulators properly oversaw. The chapter released on Wednesday includes a chart listing nine actions taken by the companies that saved time and money when less risky alternatives were available. These included not installing enough devices to stabilize the well, not waiting for the results of tests on the foam used to seal the well, removing drilling fluid from the riser before a cement plug had been set and ignoring the results of a failed pressure test shortly before the well blew out. The report did not pin the accident on any one of these mistakes, but rather attributed it to a broader breakdown of communication and a lack of a culture of safety at the companies involved. “The most significant failure at Macondo — and the clear root cause of the blowout — was a failure of industry management,” the study concluded. “Better management of decision-making processes within BP and other companies, better communication within and between BP and its contractors and effective training of key engineering and rig personnel would have prevented the Macondo incident.” The panel referred to “compartmentalization” of information within and between companies, like the failure of onshore BP and Halliburton officials to report to rig workers known problems with the cement to be used to seal the well. A similar tendency to hoard critical information was a crucial shortcoming identified by the commission named to look into the causes of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which found that federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies failed to share data that might have identified the attackers. The panel also took federal offshore drilling regulators to task, for rubber-stamping permits and proposed changes in well design, and for failing to adequately oversee operations on the rig. It said the Interior Department’s Minerals Management Service (recently renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) lacked the personnel, training and muscle to do its job and had essentially been captured by the industry it was meant to police. Offshore oil exploration is by nature risky, the commission concluded. “Notwithstanding these inherent risks, the accident of April 20 was avoidable,” the panel wrote. “It resulted from clear mistakes made in the first instance by BP, Halliburton and Transocean, and by government officials who, relying too much on industry’s assertions of the safety of their operations, failed to create and apply a program of regulatory oversight that would have properly minimized the risk of deepwater drilling.”WASHINGTON — The Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was an avoidable accident caused by a series of failures and blunders by the companies involved in drilling the well and the government regulators assigned to police them, the presidential panel named to study the accident has concluded.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/world/africa/03cheney.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Nigeria Plans to Charge Cheney in Bribery Case<date>Published: December 2, 2010</date><text>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) — Nigeria’s anticorruption police said Thursday that they planned to file charges against former Vice President Dick Cheney in a $180 million bribery case involving a former unit of the oil services firm Halliburton. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission summoned the country chief of Halliburton on Tuesday and last week raided its Lagos office and detained 10 staff members. “We are filing charges against Cheney,” said Femi Babafemi, a commission spokesman. But he declined to give further details on what the charges were, or where they would be filed. The Houston-based engineering firm KBR, a former unit of Halliburton, pleaded guilty last year to charges in the United States that it paid $180 million in bribes between 1994 and 2004 to Nigerian officials to secure $6 billion in contracts for the Bonny Island liquefied natural gas project in the Niger Delta. Mr. Cheney was the chief executive of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000, when he resigned to run for vice president. KBR and Halliburton reached a $579 million settlement in the United States. But Nigeria, France and Switzerland have conducted their own investigations into the case. Halliburton split from KBR in 2007 and has said that its current operations in Nigeria are unrelated. It has described the raid last week as “an affront against justice,” said its offices were ransacked, and pledged to defend its staff against what it said were “completely false and outrageous actions.” The company said in a statement last week that “one of the participants” in the Bonny Island project “was a subsidiary of Halliburton Company for part of that period of time,” but that Halliburton’s oil field services “have never in any way been any part” of that project.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/us/18BP.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Oil Spill Draft Report Faults BP and Subcontractors<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Inadequate training and supervision of key personnel aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and a lack of focus on safety were among the factors that contributed to the explosion that killed 11 workers and sent millions of barrels of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, according to a preliminary report released Wednesday by a team of scientific experts.BP, which owned the well, and its chief subcontractors, Halliburton and Transocean, made critical decisions in the hours before the April 20 accident that increased the chances of a catastrophic blowout, the experts, from the National Academy of Engineering, found. The steps were taken despite numerous signs of trouble in the well, according to the report. The chairman of the 15-member expert panel, Donald C. Winter, professor of engineering at the University of Michigan and a former secretary of the Navy, said it appeared that the measures were taken at least in part to save the companies time and money. The troubled well was already behind schedule and costing BP $1.5 million a day. “That gives us concern that there was not proper consideration of the tradeoffs between cost and schedule and risk and safety,” he said in a telephone interview. The report, commissioned by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, was harsh in its criticism of BP, citing the company for a lack of “management discipline” and problems with “delegation of decision-making” on board the Deepwater Horizon. “The various failures mentioned in this report indicate the lack of a suitable approach for anticipating and managing the inherent risks, uncertainties and dangers associated with deepwater drilling operations and a failure to learn from previous near misses,” the 28-page interim report stated. But the report found no single cause of the disaster, assigning blame not only to BP and its contractors but also to the Minerals Management Service, the federal agency that oversaw offshore drilling at the time of the spill. Dr. Winter said that officials of the minerals service, which was reorganized after the accident and renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, had failed to put in place the oversight and the procedures that could have prevented the blast and saved lives. Michael R. Bromwich, director of the bureau, said he and Mr. Salazar were aware of the shortcomings and were working to correct them. Responding to the report, BP noted that it did not draw final conclusions about the causes of the accident and had not considered some recent evidence, including independent tests conducted for the presidential commission investigating the spill. Those tests found that the cement formula used by Halliburton consistently produced samples that were unstable and incapable of containing the oil and gas in the well. But Halliburton said in a statement that tests that BP misinterpreted or chose not to run would have identified any problems with Halliburton’s cement job. A Transocean spokesman said the company’s workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon were highly trained and skilled, despite the commission’s findings that at least some of the rig workers lacked sufficient experience for the complexity of decisions they made.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/opinion/15mon2.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">A Culture of Carelessness<date>Published: November 14, 2010</date><text>Though its final report is two months away, the presidential commission investigating the gulf oil spill is beginning to confirm what we already suspected and feared. The April blowout on the Deepwater Horizon was not some unfortunate occurrence. It was the result of a series of bad decisions by companies less concerned about safety than about finishing a project that was over budget and 38 days behind schedule. The commission’s preliminary findings, presented last week, were inevitably sketchy. It has been operating without subpoena powers that could more quickly clear up conflicting accounts given by the three big players — BP, Hallibuton and Transocean. The House has granted these powers; the Senate has not. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, must correct that. The findings did not single out individual workers or executives for blame. The panel’s chief counsel, Fred Bartlit Jr., said that so far his staff had not found “a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety.” Mr. Bartlit amended his comments, suggesting that further digging could turn up instances in which safety was clearly traded for profit. “Any time you are talking about a million and a half dollars a day,” he said, “money enters in.” The commission chairmen, William Reilly and Bob Graham, voiced the same suspicions, noting what Mr. Graham called a “compulsion to get this rig completed in that April 19-20 timetable.” Both men have also condemned what Mr. Reilly has called a “culture of complacency” in the industry generally, and BP in particular. The commission, an earlier House investigation and drilling experts have identified what they believe to be several crucial errors. These include: Halliburton’s decision to cement the well with a mixture it knew to be flawed; BP’s apparent failure to center the well properly; BP’s decision to use seawater instead of heavy drilling mud to fill the well, leaving it vulnerable to an upsurge in gas; BP’s apparent failure to use enough plugs to seal the well; the failure by BP and Transocean to pay close attention to pressure tests showing the well to be unstable. Nailing down the final details won’t be easy, especially with each company eager to pass the blame to the others. Subpoena powers would obviously help. What we do know is that these companies must change their procedures and, more fundamentally, their dangerously skewed priorities.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/e-p-a-subpoenas-halliburton-on-fracking/?ref=halliburtoncompany">E.P.A.

Bartlit Jr., a prominent trial lawyer hired to lead the panel’s inquiry, disputed the findings of other investigators, including plaintiffs’ lawyers and members of Congress, who have charged that BP and its main partners, Transocean and Halliburton, had cut corners to speed completion of the well, which cost $1.5 million a day to drill. “To date we have not seen a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety,” Mr. Bartlit said on Monday as he opened a detailed presentation on the causes of the April 20 disaster on a drilling rig off the Louisiana coast, which killed 11 workers and led to the biggest offshore oil spill in American history. “They want to be efficient, they don’t want to waste money, but they also don’t want to get their buddies killed.” Mr. Bartlit noted that a number of critical questions about the accident remained in dispute, including the cause of the failure of the cement at the bottom of the well, why BP and its partners went ahead with trying to close in the well after it failed an important pressure test and why crew members failed for too long to recognize that oil and gas were gushing up the well bore. He indicated that a number of the contributing causes of the explosion might remain a mystery, because the evidence sank with the drilling rig or because the causes arose from decisions made by men who were killed or badly injured in the blowout. Just hours before the explosion, employees of BP and Transocean, the operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, accepted the results of a pressure test that should have raised serious alarms, Mr. Bartlit and his aides found. Instead of acting on the information, they took no steps to keep the explosive oil and gas mixture out of the well, a decision that Mr. Bartlit and his team concluded contributed to the accident. “The interesting question is why these experienced men out on that rig talked themselves into believing that this was a good test that indicated well integrity,” said Sean Grimsley, one of Mr. Bartlit’s deputies. “None of them wanted to die or jeopardize their safety. The question is why.” Mr. Bartlit’s presentation resembled a prosecutor’s opening argument in a major criminal trial. He used elaborate graphics to illustrate the complex technology used on the BP well, known as the Macondo well, as he walked the seven-member presidential commission and an audience of lawyers, company officials and journalists through his preliminary findings. He said, however, that his purpose was to explain, not to accuse. “We are not assigning blame,” he said. “We are not making any legal judgments on liability, negligence or gross negligence or any legal issues at all. It’s a hard thing to do. Our effort is to look at cause, not liability.” Mr. Bartlit also said he had been handicapped by Congress’s refusal to grant the commission subpoena power. He said he had no reason to believe that any of the company officials he interviewed had lied or withheld relevant data, but he said that his months of investigation had left a number of disputes among the responsible parties unresolved. He said he could not settle those matters without deposing workers and executives under oath. President Obama appointed the commission, led by Bob Graham, a former Democratic senator and governor from Florida, and William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President George Bush, in May. The panel is scheduled to deliver its findings and recommendations in mid-January. Mr. Graham said Monday that he would ask Congress to reconsider granting the panel subpoena power. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, took issue with Mr. Bartlit’s characterization of the motives of BP and some of its employees. Mr. Markey, who led a Congressional investigation into the accident, said the company had consistently taken shortcuts to save money. “When the culture of a company favors risk-taking and cutting corners above other concerns, systemic failures like this oil spill disaster result without direct decisions being made or trade-offs being considered,” he said. “What is fully evident, from BP’s pipeline spill in Alaska and the Texas City refinery disaster, to the Deepwater Horizon well failure, is that BP has a long and sordid history of cutting costs and pushing the limits in search of higher profits.” The first part of Mr. Bartlit’s presentation focused on BP’s well design and the repeated problems BP and Halliburton encountered in preparing the well for cementing, a process meant to keep oil and gas, which are under high pressure in the well, from exploding up the well bore. The commission has concluded that problems with the cement job were a major cause of the well disaster, although Mr. Bartlit emphasized on Monday that a deepwater well was a complicated system and that no single error or flaw was solely responsible. Mr. Bartlit said he could not reach any conclusions about one critical component in the well, the blowout preventer, which is supposed to be the last line of defense against a well’s going out of control. The blowout preventer that was on the Macondo well is in the hands of federal agents as possible evidence in criminal and civil trials. The government has hired a Norwegian engineering firm to examine it and determine if and how it might have failed. Mr. Bartlit said his investigation would not be complete until he had the results of that study. Bill Ambrose, director of special projects for Transocean, which owned and ran the blowout preventer, said at the hearing that the device had functioned “within its design limits,” suggesting that its failure was a result, not a cause, of the accident. The hearing did not resolve the additional question of whether BP made a fatal error by not installing enough “centralizers,” devices used to keep the drill casing centered within the well bore. Halliburton, the cement contractor, has said that the decision on centralizers was part of the reason the cement job failed. BP disputes that contention.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/us/30halliburton.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Halliburton Rejects Blame for BP Cement Job<date>Published: October 29, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Halliburton, whose failed cement job on the BP well in the Gulf of Mexico was identified as a contributing factor to the deadly blowout by a presidential investigative panel on Thursday, is defending its work and assigning the blame for the accident to BP.In a six-page statement issued Thursday night, Halliburton questioned tests that showed its cement mixture to be unstable and incapable of holding back the oil and the gas in the well, saying the tests were conducted on formulas other than what was eventually used on BP’s Macondo well. It said that a sample of the cement mixture it planned to use on the well, tested shortly before pumping began on April 19, had produced a positive result. But Halliburton admitted that no stability test was conducted on the actual recipe for the cement used on the well. The company said that BP had ordered a change in Halliburton’s customary formula for cement by adding a higher proportion of a chemical that slows the hardening of the mixture. The well blew out on April 20, killing 11 workers and eventually releasing nearly five million barrels of oil into the gulf. Since then, BP, Halliburton, Transocean and other partners in the well have traded accusations of blame as civil and criminal investigations have proceeded. The issue of the role of the cement in the blowout may not be fully resolved for some time because the only surviving sample of the actual cement mixture used in the well is under federal safeguard as evidence in continuing investigations. The seven-member presidential spill commission cited a failed cement job as a factor in the deadly accident, basing its findings on previously undisclosed communications between Halliburton and BP and a round of testing of similar cement performed by Chevron. In its statement on Thursday, Halliburton took issue with the Chevron tests, saying they were not based on the exact cement recipe that was used on the Macondo well. Halliburton said it was continuing to study the Chevron report, issued earlier this week, and was reserving further comment. Halliburton also said that two cement samples that failed internal tests in February were not studied under the same conditions that existed at the bottom of the well on April 20. The company also said that a failed April test was likewise “irrelevant” because the laboratory did not use the correct amount of cement blend. A spokesman for the presidential panel, led by Bob Graham, the former senator and governor of Florida, and William K. Reilly, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said it would not comment on the Halliburton statement. But he said that commission investigators would present further evidence on the cement work and other factors that led to the explosion and the spill when the panel next meets in public on Nov. 8 and 9.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/us/29spill.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Halliburton and BP Knew of Cement Flaws, Report Says<date>Published: October 28, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Halliburton officials knew weeks before the fatal explosion of the BP well in the Gulf of Mexico that the cement mixture they planned to use to seal the bottom of the well was unstable but still went ahead with the job, the presidential commission investigating the accident said on Thursday.In the first official finding of responsibility for the blowout, which killed 11 workers and led to the biggest offshore oil spill in American history, the commission staff determined that Halliburton had conducted three laboratory tests that indicated that the cement mixture did not meet industry standards. The result of at least one of those tests was given on March 8 to BP, which failed to act upon it, the panel’s lead investigator, Fred H. Bartlit Jr., said in a letter delivered to the commissioners on Thursday. “There is no indication that Halliburton highlighted to BP the significance of the foam stability data or that BP personnel raised any questions about it,” Mr. Bartlit said in his report. Another Halliburton cement test, carried out about a week before the blowout of the well on April 20, also found the mixture to be unstable, meaning it was unlikely to set properly in the well, but those findings were never sent to BP, Mr. Bartlit found after reviewing previously undisclosed documents. Although Mr. Bartlit did not specifically identify the cement failure as the sole or even primary cause of the blowout, he made clear in his letter that if the cement had done its job and kept the highly pressurized oil and gas out of the well bore, there would have been no accident. “We have known for some time that the cement used to secure the production casing and isolate the hydrocarbon zone at the bottom of the Macondo well must have failed in some manner,” he said in his letter to the seven members of the presidential commission. “The cement should have prevented hydrocarbons from entering the well.” The failure of the cement set off a complex and ultimately deadly cascade of events as oil and gas exploded upward from the 18,000-foot-deep well. The blowout preventer, which sits on the ocean floor atop a well and is supposed to contain a well bore breach, also failed. In an internal investigation, BP identified the faulty cement job as one of the main factors contributing to the accident and blamed Halliburton, the cementing contractor on the Macondo well, as the responsible party. Halliburton has said repeatedly in public testimony that it tested and used a proper cement formula and that BP’s flawed well design and poor operations caused the disaster. Jesse Gagliano, a Halliburton technical adviser, told federal investigators in Houston in August that the company was confident of the cement job and said that BP’s decision to use six well-stabilizing devices known as centralizers contributed to the failure of the cement work. Another Halliburton official, Thomas Roth, told a National Academy of Engineering panel last month that Halliburton’s cement met industry standards and that it had been successfully used at more than 1,000 other wells. Mr. Roth said BP ignored “multiple red flags” in the drilling and completion of the well. The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig was operated by a third company, Transocean. Cathy Mann, a Halliburton spokeswoman, said the company was reviewing the panel’s findings. A BP spokesman said the company would have no comment. Halliburton, a major oil field services company and one of the nation’s largest defense contractors, was once led by former Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Bartlit’s law firm, Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar &amp; Scott, has done legal work for Halliburton in the past but has not represented the company since 2005, the firm said. The commission obtained from Halliburton samples of the same cement recipe used on the failed well, including the same proportion of nitrogen used as a leavening agent and a number of chemicals used to stabilize the mixture. The slurry was sent to a laboratory owned by Chevron for independent testing. Chevron conducted nine separate stability tests intended to reproduce conditions at the BP well and the cement failed them all, the staff report said. “Although laboratory foam stability tests cannot replicate field conditions perfectly,” Mr. Bartlit’s letter said, “these data strongly suggest that the foam cement used at Macondo was unstable.” One and a half gallons of the actual mixture used on the doomed BP well survived and are being held as evidence in criminal and civil investigations. Shortly before technicians began pumping cement slurry down the well on April 19, Halliburton conducted one last test of the mixture. The company changed some of the conditions of the test and appeared satisfied with the result, although those findings were not communicated to BP until after the well explosion, the commission found. The commission concluded, “Halliburton may not have had — and BP did not have — the results of that test before the evening of April 19, meaning that the cement job may have been pumped without any lab results indicating that the foam cement slurry would be stable.” Further, the panel found, “Halliburton and BP both had results in March showing that a very similar foam slurry design to the one actually pumped at the Macondo well would be unstable, but neither acted upon that data.” The commission, appointed by President Obama in May, is led by Bob Graham, the former senator and governor of Florida, and William K. Reilly, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The commission is scheduled to present its interim findings on Nov. 8-9 and its final report to the president in mid-January. It released this report early, it said, because other wells may be planning to use similarly flawed cement. Mr. Bartlit, who conducted a much-praised investigation of the 1988 Piper Alpha blowout in the North Sea off Britain that killed 167 workers, said the flawed cement was not the whole story. Many human and mechanical failures combined to create the disaster, he said, and backup procedures were skipped or ignored. “Because it may be anticipated that a particular cement job may be faulty, the oil industry has developed tests, such as the negative pressure test and cement evaluation logs, to identify cementing failures,” he wrote. “It has also developed methods to remedy deficient cement jobs. BP and/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well.” In its investigation, BP said that on the morning of April 20, its team decided not to conduct a cement evaluation log. It said that in relying on other types of assessments, the team ignored BP’s own guidelines.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/business/29halliburton.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Halliburton in Spotlight Over BP Gulf Spill<date>Published: October 28, 2010</date><text>Halliburton is back in the spotlight, and once again, in an uncomfortable way.In recent years, the giant energy services company has found itself under scrutiny over allegations that it performed shoddy, overpriced work for the United States military in Iraq, bribed Nigerian officials to win energy contracts and did brisk business with Iran at time when it faced sanctions. On Thursday, a government investigation panel said that Halliburton might have played an important role in the April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico by supplying cement that the company knew was unstable to BP, which used it to seal the well. Halliburton has repeatedly blamed BP, the owner of the well, of failing to test the cement and making other errors that led to the accident, which killed 11 people and spewed millions of barrels of crude oil into the gulf. “Halliburton has a history of walking on the energy high beam without a net,” said Chris Ruppel, managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an international investment bank. “Because they have been very aggressive, working on very high-profile types of projects, when anything goes wrong, they will be front and center.” The company, which was led by former Vice President Dick Cheney from 1995 to 2000, has drawn repeated fire for some of its past actions, mostly involving its Kellogg Brown &amp; Root subsidiary, which it finished selling in 2007. Last year, for example, Halliburton and KBR agreed to pay $579 million to settle charges brought by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with bribes that KBR had paid to top Nigerian officials over a decade. The companies still face criminal liability in Nigeria over the episode, which involved contracts to build a liquefied natural gas complex. Several experts said on Thursday that the report by the staff of the commission investigating the accident could have legal and business consequences for Halliburton, which is based in Houston. Investors were certainly concerned, sending the company’s stock plunging 16 percent in the minutes after the report was released. The shares ended the day at $31.68, down 8 percent. In a statement late Thursday, Halliburton said that it believed there were significant differences between its own tests and those performed by the commission. “The commission tested off-the-shelf cement and additives, whereas Halliburton tested the unique blend of cement and additives that existed on the rig at the time Haliburton’s tests were conducted,” the company said. In its report, investigators said that internal tests run by Halliburton found that the cement mixture it had developed for use at BP’s well, called Macondo, did not meet industry standards for stability. Halliburton had shared some but not all of the test results with BP, and the companies proceeded to use the faulty mixture. The report did not conclude that the problems with the cement caused the disaster, but did say that they raised the likelihood that a blowout would occur. Lawyers suing BP, Halliburton and other companies on behalf of workers killed or injured in the disaster seized on the report, arguing that it would expand Halliburton’s potential liability. “The report makes clear for all to see that, by rushing the cement job, BP and Halliburton put their corporate profits ahead of worker safety,” Paul Sterbcow, a plaintiffs’ lawyer in New Orleans, said in a statement. Cement failure is a frequent cause of deepwater oil well blowouts. And Halliburton, which is one of the world’s biggest producers of oilfield cements, also provided the material used in an offshore well near Australia that blew out last year. Oil industry experts were split on the report’s business implications for Halliburton. “It’s going to make people take a second look for other options, other cement companies,” said Donald Van Nieuwenhuise, director of petroleum geoscience programs at the University of Houston. But Robert MacKenzie, managing director for energy and natural resources research at FBR Capital Markets, had a different view, calling the stock market response an overreaction. “I don’t think a report written by nontechnical people is going to affect industry perception,” he said, adding that Halliburton “does billions of dollars of work every year, and one job doesn’t make a reputation among their customers.” Indeed, Halliburton, a global company with $14.7 billion in revenue last year, has weathered a string of public controversies. While KBR was still part of Halliburton, it came under intense scrutiny for large cost overruns and was accused of shoddy work in construction projects for United States military operations in Iraq. In 2003, the Halliburton subsidiary had received a multibillion-dollar, no-bid contract from the American government for work in the war-torn country. In 2007, Congressional Democrats criticized Halliburton for moving the offices of its chief executive from Houston to Dubai, charging that it was an effort to lower its taxes. The company countered that the second headquarters allowed it better business opportunities. That year, Halliburton also said that it was ending its business dealings in Iran. Under longstanding American sanctions, American companies are forbidden from conducting most business with Iran. Lee Hunt, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said harsh criticisms of Halliburton were based on “attitudes that harken back to the Cheney connection and the Bush years that make them convenient punching bags.” “They are worldwide giants in what they do, and they are thoroughly reputable,” Mr. Hunt said. “They have a strong, proven record of quality work.” But Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the company resembled Zelig, the fictional Woody Allen film character who repeatedly turned up unexpectedly at events. “Except Zelig was innocent,” Mr. Markey said. “Halliburton thinks cutting corners is good business.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/opinion/29fri2.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">The Latest Gulf Outrage<date>Published: October 28, 2010</date><text>We have known for some time that a flaw in the cement used on BP’s Macondo well contributed to the disastrous April 20 explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. What we did not know, until now, was that both BP and Halliburton, the company BP hired to cement the well, appear to have been aware that the mixture was prone to failure — and went ahead anyway.This disturbing disclosure is contained in a new report from the presidential commission investigating the explosion. It is sure to cause another round of “not me” blame-shifting between BP and Halliburton. BP has identified the inadequate cement job as a major factor in the explosion and faulted Halliburton, on which it obviously hopes to offload some of its legal and financial responsibilities. The report has plenty of blame to go around. And it leaves the clear impression that two of the most important players in the risky world of deep-water drilling were doing their job on the cheap. According to the report, Halliburton conducted three tests on the cement mixture it planned to use. All showed the mixture to be unstable and thus vulnerable to the high-pressure pool of oil and gas at the bottom of the well. It said Halliburton provided the results of one of these tests to BP on March 8 and that BP failed to act on it: “There is no indication that Halliburton highlighted to BP the significance of the foam instability data or that BP personnel raised any questions about it.” Halliburton carried out a fourth, and differently designed, test that suggested the cement slurry was stable. But there is no doubt that the mixture actually used was fatally flawed. The report emphasizes that faulty cement was only one of a cascade of events, including the failure of the blowout preventer. This investigation is far from over. What we know so far is deeply unsettling and good reason for the commission to keep probing. This is also one more reminder of why the Senate must rouse itself and pass an oil spill bill tightly regulating the drilling industry. The House has passed such a bill, and the Obama administration has imposed tough new rules governing drilling practices, including well design, casing and cementing. We have already seen how the oil industry can game the rules, and the cost. That is why Congress needs to write them clearly and firmly into law.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/us/28hearings.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">In Gulf Oil Rig Explosion, Panel Finds No Single Smoking Gun<date>Published: August 27, 2010</date><text>HOUSTON — More than four months after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, there appears to be no single smoking gun that implicates one person or company in the disaster. Instead, several missteps and oversights by the crew are being explored by federal investigators as possible triggers of the emergency.By Friday, nearly all of the main witnesses, from roustabouts to senior vice presidents, had testified before a federal panel that is drafting a report about the lessons learned from the catastrophe, which killed 11 workers. The 75 witnesses had been grilled by an armada of lawyers and government experts about complex engineering procedures and pressed about yellow pod solenoid failures and lower marine riser packages. But the government has released no conclusions, and many questions about the disaster still exist. “The board wants to get to its conclusions,” said one panel member, Wayne Anderson, a former Federal District Court judge. “It’s a relatively short timetable given the complexity.” The panel, which has held hearings in New Orleans and Houston, plans to release its report by Jan. 16. “I don’t think we’ve truly gotten to the root causes,” said Lee Kaplan, a lawyer for Dril-Quip, a company contracted by BP to provide certain equipment in the well. “There are still more questions than answers.” These are the most important questions that the panel is expected to continue exploring: ¶Who was in charge of the rig, the captain or the offshore installation manager? It seems clear that a work crew would be able to identify its own boss. But witnesses have given conflicting answers about which of two senior officials was in command of the rig during the emergency. Transocean, the rig’s owner, designates the offshore installation manager as the top official when a rig is connected to an oil well, as was the Deepwater Horizon. But international safety regulations place a captain in charge during a crisis. As panic ensued after the rig caught fire, witnesses have testified, questions emerged about who should activate vital emergency equipment and call to abandon ship. As a chairman of the panel, Capt. Hung Nguyen of the Coast Guard, concluded, “Everybody in charge, nobody in charge.” ¶Did financial pressure compromise safety, especially when BP chose riskier equipment? The longer the drilling of the oil well continued, the more expensive it became. The total cost of the project swelled to $140 million from $96 million as delays ensued. Additionally, by the day of the disaster, BP was 43 days behind schedule, costing the company at least $40 million more. Amid these setbacks, BP selected riskier and less expensive equipment, including a type of metal casing that would save the company $7 million to $10 million, witnesses say. For the first time, on Thursday, a BP official acknowledged that price mattered in the well’s operation. “Every conversation, every decision has a cost factor,” said David Sims, a vice president. ¶Who was responsible for cementing the well, Halliburton or BP? BP and Halliburton, a contracted company hired to pour cement around the oil well, have pointed fingers at each other about which company was responsible for controversial elements of the plan. Failure of the cement has been identified as one of the possible causes of the oil leak. ¶Who was responsible for making sure that equipment was actually repaired? In the months before the disaster, a series of audits identified hundreds of mechanical problems with the rig. In September 2009, an audit by four BP investigators found nearly 300 conditions in which rig equipment was past its inspection date, including a crucial emergency device called the blowout preventer, which failed to shut down the well as intended on April 20. BP has said it was the responsibility of Transocean to fix the device and noted that BP officials recommended that the rig suspend operations for five days for repairs. But Transocean witnesses have said BP knew the blowout preventer was past its inspection date and chose to overlook this condition to complete the well. Work Continues at the Well WASHINGTON — The leader of the federal response to the oil spill said Friday that efforts to remove drill pipe from the damaged blowout preventer atop BP’s well had been unsuccessful, and that the company would now try to cut the pipe after the preventer had been lifted off the well. The response leader, Thad W. Allen, a retired Coast Guard admiral, said that on Monday or Tuesday technicians would try to remove the blowout preventer using what he described as a “gentle tug” — about 80,000 pounds of force — to avoid damaging seals at the top of the well. Once the blowout preventer is removed, it will be replaced by an undamaged one. The replacement must occur before a relief well is used to pump more mud and cement into the once-leaking well. HENRY FOUNTAIN</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/us/26hearings.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Lingering Questions at Hearings on Gulf Oil Spill<date>Published: August 25, 2010</date><text>HOUSTON — Even after dozens of witnesses, a hundred hours of testimony and three months of investigation, a chairman of a federal panel exploring the Deepwater Horizon disaster admitted Wednesday that he still lacked a simple fact: Who was the top authority on the oil rig when it exploded?The finger-pointing among various witnesses and lawyers has become so routine at the government hearings that the chairman, Capt. Hung Nguyen of the Coast Guard, said he viewed the rig as a “three-legged stool” — wobbly and without anyone taking responsibility. “Somebody’s got to be in charge here,” Mr. Nguyen said. “I just don’t have a clear picture in my mind of who it is here.” The panel of Coast Guard and Interior Department representatives is trying to determine the causes of the explosion that led to the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. But the hearings have been dominated by disagreements among lawyers for the companies involved: BP, which owned the well and leased the rig; Transocean, the rig’s owner; and Halliburton, which poured cement around the well. Looming over the hearings are pending civil trials and a Department of Justice criminal investigation that are likely to involve the same witnesses and rely on facts that emerge from their testimony. This week, BP has been pushing back against the perception that it is primarily responsible for the spill. On Wednesday, the company issued a statement saying that Halliburton should have stopped work on cementing the well if its workers held genuine safety concerns. To not do so, BP said, would be “morally repugnant.” Halliburton replied with a statement that said BP had ignored its warnings and persisted with a risky plan to use fewer devices called centralizers when cementing the well. “Ultimately, Halliburton acted on the decisions of and at the explicit direction of the well owner,” the statement said. The dispute follows testimony Tuesday about a report from Halliburton to BP two days before the explosion that said the cement could result in a “severe gas flow” problem. The federal hearings have unearthed many new details about the final actions taken to try to control the runaway well. On Wednesday, a senior BP official testified that emergency equipment at the top of the well had been configured improperly and therefore delayed the response effort. The official, Harry Thierens, the vice president for drilling and completions, testified that it was the responsibility of Transocean, the rig’s owner, to maintain and configure the equipment. That testimony could help investigators explain a lingering mystery: why the equipment did not shear the well closed as designed. The equipment, known as a blowout preventer or BOP, is designed to suppress rising hydrocarbons inside the well. It was one of many devices that malfunctioned as engineers tried for months to control the well. Transocean released a statement saying that the configuration mistake “had no bearing on the BOP’s ability to function on the night of the incident.” The statement added that the mistake was discovered by a subsea robot within 24 hours. The oil leak went uncontrolled for 86 days, causing the largest deepwater oil spill in United States history, before engineers finally capped it on July 15.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/us/25hearings.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Halliburton Adviser Testifies Against BP<date>Published: August 24, 2010</date><text>HOUSTON — An official for Halliburton, the company hired by BP to perform a critical step in the process for closing the well connected to the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, testified Tuesday that days before the rig exploded he had raised concerns to BP about its plan for executing the procedure, but that he continued with the job anyway.The official, Jesse M. Gagliano, a shore-based technical adviser, told federal investigators here that he had recommended that BP use a greater number of devices called “centralizers” in the well for the tricky step known as cementing, which is a method of strengthening the well to control pressure from the oil and gas. He said he was ignored. Centralizers help cement flow evenly around an oil well before hardening, and using 6 of them — instead of the 21 that he recommended — made the well more likely to need additional cementing, Mr. Gagliano said. Investigators say they believe that the cement poured by Halliburton may have failed under tremendous pressure on April 20, producing the oil rig explosion that led to the largest deep-water oil spill in United States history. Mr. Gagliano and a lawyer for BP disputed whether Halliburton or BP should be responsible for the final cement plan. “This reflects your best engineering judgment and analysis, doesn’t it?” asked Rick Godfrey, a BP lawyer, referring to a report prepared by Mr. Gagliano two days before the disaster that permitted the six centralizers. “No, my best engineering analysis would have been to run 21 centralizers,” Mr. Gagliano said. The testimony, before an eight-member panel of federal government investigators, provided a fuller portrait of workers’ potentially risky decisions in the days before the disaster: not conducting a test called a “cement bond log,” not using a potentially safer type of well liner, and not conducting a “bottoms-up” test of the drilling solution in the well. In a report to BP two days before the disaster, Mr. Gagliano noted that a reduced number of centralizers could cause a “severe gas flow” problem. By the morning of the disaster, BP had more centralizers flown to the rig, but decided not to install them, Mr. Gagliano said. But internal Halliburton documents suggest that company employees believed that the cement job had been conducted properly by the day of the disaster. “We have completed the job and it went well,” one Halliburton worker, Nathaniel Chaisson, wrote in an e-mail to colleagues on the morning of the disaster. “Full returns were observed throughout.” Another internal Halliburton report from that day said, “Cement job pumped as planned.” Reports by Halliburton experts on the company’s Web site suggest that the company is prepared to control such “severe gas flow” problems as Mr. Gagliano forecast. In 2008, a cementing expert, Ron Crook, recommended that such problems be contained by changing the ingredients and consistency of the cement and its placement in the well. “In wells with severe levels of gas migration,” the article states, the risk of a gas flow problem “can be reduced to a safe level” by adjusting those other factors. A reduced number of centralizers have been used on other wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. Gagliano said. But he said the plan for the Deepwater Horizon made him uncomfortable. “Hey, I think we have a problem here,” Mr. Gagliano said he told shore-based BP officials when he learned that six centralizers were being proposed. But BP overrode his objections, he said. “BP had made their decision,” he said. Earlier in the hearings, an employee for Transocean, the rig’s owner, testified that his company provided financial bonuses to workers based in part on how quickly they made equipment repairs. The testimony from Daun Winslow, a performance division manager on the rig at the time of the disaster, furthered concerns that financial pressure might have trumped safety on the rig. The amount of “downtime” for a rig was a small factor in calculating bonuses, Mr. Winslow testified, although other factors, including the rig’s environmental impact, customer satisfaction, individual performance and safety were also considered. “Safety was a bigger component than downtime,” Mr. Winslow said. “Safety is one of our core values.” Under questioning from BP’s lawyers, Mr. Winslow said Transocean lost as much as $500,000 a day in rig rental fees paid by BP when mechanical repairs prevented drilling for oil. Mr. Winslow also faced questions about an emergency on another Transocean rig in the North Sea that bore similarities to the Deepwater Horizon disaster. He testified that he had never heard of the near-disaster in the North Sea in December, even though Transocean internal documents suggest that the company intended to make critical changes to its oil well safety procedures. Like the disaster in the gulf, the North Sea emergency involved dangerous pressure levels in the well, a failure to detect those pressures in time, a risky plan for sealing the well and an emergency order for the crew to evacuate to lifeboats. Mr. Winslow said Tuesday that knowledge of the episode would have been helpful, although he noted differences to the disaster in the gulf. “I believe this would increase the awareness of anyone in the drilling industry,” he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/us/20spill.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">BP Oil Spill Settlements Likely to Shield Top Defendants<date>Published: August 20, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — People and businesses seeking a lump-sum settlement from BP’s $20 billion oil spill compensation fund will most likely have to waive their right to sue not only BP, but also all the other major defendants involved with the spill, according to internal documents from the lawyers handling the fund.The documents — which include e-mails, draft and final versions of the protocols, claims forms and legal notes about the administration of the fund — provide the first definitive picture of who will be paid by the $20 billion fund, and how and when. They also shed new light on the components of the payment plan that are likely to stir controversy, including the fund’s emphasis on geographic proximity as a determining factor for eligibility. The fund is being administered by a prominent Washington lawyer, Kenneth R. Feinberg, who declined to be interviewed about the documents but verified their authenticity. The eligibility requirements for compensation from the fund are similar to those of the 9/11 victims compensation fund, which Mr. Feinberg also handled. People affected by the spill seeking final settlements face a choice similar to that faced by the 9/11 victims: If they decide to sue instead of accepting a settlement, they could face years of litigation; and if they decide to accept the settlement, it could come before the full damage from the spill is known. A key difference between the spill fund and the Sept. 11 victim compensation fund is the matter of geographic proximity. The 9/11 fund took that issue into account, but it was less controversial because that fund focused on compensating people injured in the terrorist attacks and families of those killed rather than adversely affected businesses. Fishermen, shrimpers and seafood processors as well as hotel and restaurant owners with beachfront property in areas where oil washed ashore will have the easiest time getting reimbursed. An ice cream parlor or a golf course miles from the affected shore but along the main highway headed to the beach will probably not be eligible, the documents indicate. Legal experts said that the eligibility criteria in the protocol, including the emphasis on proximity, make intuitive sense, but they will cut out large sectors of businesses and people that were indirectly but nonetheless deeply affected by the spill. Examples of the kinds of businesses that may be excluded include a bait and tackle supply store in Raleigh, N.C., that equips much of the gulf’s fishermen; a gas station in Flomaton, Ala., alongside Highway 29, which heads to the Gulf Coast; and a beer distributor in Atlanta whose biggest contracts were with restaurant chains on the affected coast. The documents say that people or businesses “in a community or municipality adjacent to a beach shoreline, marsh, bay or tributary of the gulf where oil or oil residues came ashore or appeared in the waters” will be given top priority. Eligibility “will take into account, among other things, geographic proximity, nature of industry, and dependence upon injured natural resources,” the documents say. The possible provision in the final oil spill settlement protocol requiring people to waive their right to sue companies other than BP that were working on the rig is also expected to face protest, legal experts said. Those other companies related to the spill include Transocean, the operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded and sank in April; Halliburton, the company responsible for cementing the well; and Cameron International, the maker of the failed blowout preventer, a device designed to shut off a well. Mr. Feinberg plans to publicly release the protocol for emergency payments on Friday and the protocol for the final settlement in the fall. The eligibility terms for both protocols will be nearly identical, though the burden of proof to qualify for a final settlement payment will be higher, the documents say. Mr. Feinberg’s costs and compensation will come from the interest earned on the money that BP deposits in the fund. How much Mr. Feinberg is earning for his work is not known, but the documents indicate that his payment comes with no added contingencies that incentivize keeping reimbursements down. Even though BP is the fund’s sole contributor so far, it may still be in its interest that the other companies linked to the spill be protected from claims because they could in turn try to sue BP for payment, said Richard Nagareda, a mass torts expert and law professor at Vanderbilt University. While the protocol says that all workers injured or killed as a result of the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon or the spill are eligible to file claims, a letter sent by BP’s lawyers to Steve Gordon, a lawyer representing some of those workers, states otherwise. The letter was handed over to the House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating liability issues and the claims process. “To be clear, it is BP’s position, consistent with this indemnification, that any settlement between Transocean and any of its injured or deceased employees must include a full release of all BP entities from any and all claims or liability in connection with the Deepwater Horizon incident,” said the letter, from John T. Hickey, a lawyer for BP. “This full release of all BP entities would indeed bar any subsequent claims against the fund being established by BP and the claims facility that will be administered by Mr. Feinberg.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/us/25liability.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Liability Questions Loom for BP and Ex-Partners<date>Published: June 24, 2010</date><text>Who will pay for the oil spill?For now, BP appears to be the deep-pocketed party footing many of the bills, including setting up a $20 billion fund to compensate victims of the spill. But the legal endgame of sorting out the final tab among the companies that owned the well and worked on the Deepwater Horizon rig has also begun. Although BP has said time and again that it will clean up the spill and pay all legitimate claims, the company has also put its former rig partners on notice that they will be sharing those costs. And the partners are fighting back. It is a war of words pitched as much to the ears of investors as to tomorrow’s jurists. “Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill, and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations,” said Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, in response to a June 18 statement from one of its partners in the well. That partner, Anadarko Petroleum, has a 25 percent stake in the project, and its joint operating agreement with BP gives it a 25 percent share of the liability, a potentially ruinous amount. On June 18, Anadarko issued a blunt statement intended to distance itself from BP. “The mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of BP’s reckless decisions and actions,” said the company’s chief executive, Jim Hackett. “Frankly, we are shocked,” he said. “BP’s behavior and actions likely represent gross negligence or willful misconduct.” If Anadarko, in court or arbitration, can establish gross negligence or willful misconduct by BP, which owned 65 percent of the well, then BP could end up being responsible for 100 percent of the spill. Joseph A. Grundfest, an expert on business law at Stanford Law School, said Anadarko’s intent was clear. “If BP’s conduct is sufficiently egregious,” he said, “then Anadarko might get off the hook for some or all of its liability as a co-owner of the well.” Anadarko has reasons to send a strong and early signal that it will fight. Investors, concerned about Anadarko’s potential exposure, have fled, lopping off nearly half its market value, or $19 billion, since the explosion. Moody’s has lowered its bond rating into the junk range. A spokesman for Mitsui Oil Exploration Company of Japan, which owns the remaining 10 percent of the well, said the company had given up its interest in oil from the well. “All revenues obtained from the sale of that oil should go to assist those affected and help to restore the natural resources across the Gulf Coast,” Mitsui said in a statement. The company may be hoping that relinquishing its interest will shield it from liability, though Mitsui declined to comment further. The legal battle is also likely to extend beyond the circle of the well’s owners to the companies that helped drill the well, predicted Dan Pickering, co-president of Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Company, an energy-focused investment bank in Houston. “Everybody’s going to be pointing fingers at each other,” he said. “Anadarko is going to be arguing with BP over the well design, BP is going to be pointing fingers at the service companies for the well drilling and evaluation process, and the service companies are going to be pointing fingers back at BP, claiming it’s BP’s oversight and indemnification. It’s a lawyer’s dream.” The service companies have already said they will challenge attempts to hold them responsible. A spokesman for Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig, noted that its contract with BP requires BP to indemnify it. The company’s president and chief executive, Steven Newman, said in a conference call last month that “under our drilling contract for the Horizon, BP has agreed to assume full responsibility for the costs and the liability of pollution and contamination.” “And we believe that contract is clear,” Mr. Newman added. A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Cathy Mann, noted that its contract also “requires the well owner to defend and indemnify Halliburton for all potential liability claims and expenses arising from the blowout,” aside from claims of Halliburton employees. Michael D. Green, an expert in tort law at the Wake Forest University School of Law, suggested that BP might try to argue in court that other companies involved in the drilling process were negligent — for example, the manufacturer of the blowout preventer — and might say that such equipment was designed, manufactured or installed poorly. BP might also argue that, since its plans were approved by the federal government, it should not be found grossly negligent. Whatever happens among the companies, yet another round of litigation is likely between BP and the insurance companies. “What they all want to do is have the insurance companies pay, if possible,” said Tom Baker, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who specializes in insurance. That, too, will be a fight — one that is already under way. BP, like most big oil companies, is self insured. But the insurers for the service companies are already moving to make sure that they do not get dragged in. Last month, Lloyd’s of London asked a federal judge in Texas to declare that it would not have to cover BP’s “excess liability” in cleanup and other costs. Lloyd’s argued that Transocean’s contract limits insurance protection to pollution “originating above the surface of the land or water.” Because the spill, Lloyd’s argued, is “below the surface and from BP’s well, those liabilities are not within the scope of the additional insured protection.” The spill is so big and the liability so vast, Mr. Pickering said, that it will ultimately change the way the oil business is conducted. “The definition of how an operator drills wells, going forward, is going to be much more clearly defined,” he said. “The liability doesn’t stop until the well does.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/science/earth/15rig.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Documents Detail Risky Decisions Before BP Well Blowout<date>Published: June 14, 2010</date><text>Internal BP documents, including an e-mail message calling the well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon a “nightmare,” show a pattern of risky choices made to save time and money in the weeks before the disastrous April 20 blowout, according to a letter sent to the oil company by the leaders of a House committee on Monday.The leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce cited five areas in which the company had made decisions that “increased the danger of a catastrophic well,” including the choice for the design of the well, preparations for and tests of the cement job and assurances that the well was properly sealed on the top. Taken together, the documents offer the strongest case yet that BP bears much of the responsibility for the catastrophic explosion that killed 11 workers and the still-unchecked leaking of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Some of the decisions appeared to violate industry guidelines and were made despite warnings from BP’s own employees and outside contractors, said the committee chairman, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan. They sent their letter to BP’s chief executive, Tony Hayward, in advance of his testimony this week before the committee. An investigation suggested that delays in completing the well “created pressure to take shortcuts,” the letter said, and found that corners were cut in designing the well, in preparing for and testing the cementing job, and in assuring that the well was properly sealed at the top. A BP spokeswoman, Anne Kolton, said that Mr. Hayward would testify before the committee on Thursday. According to the committee schedule, the hearing will be before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, headed by Mr. Stupak. “I’m sure these issues will be covered at the hearing,” she said. The committee leaders said that shortly before the blowout, BP engineers chose a faster, less expensive design for the final string of casing, the steel pipe that lines the well. The design chosen, which used a so-called tapered string, cost about $7 million to $10 million less than another method. But the tapered string afforded less protection if the cementing job were poor and gas were to rise up the well, the congressmen wrote. The choice of the casing design was previously disclosed in The New York Times. In an exchange of e-mail messages in the week before the blowout, BP drilling engineers discussed the casing plans, with one, Brian P. Morel, asking another for a quick review of one schematic diagram. “Sorry for the late notice,” Mr. Morel wrote, “this has been nightmare well which has everyone all over the place.” Time and money were both concerns, the two representatives wrote, because the well was behind schedule. A problem in March had forced the company to apply for a “bypass,” in which a well is drilled around a problem area. By the day of the blowout, the Deepwater Horizon, leased by BP from Transocean for about half a million dollars a day plus contractors’ fees, was 43 days late for its next drilling location, the committee leaders wrote. The choice of a tapered string meant that the well had only two barriers to upward gas flow that could cause a blowout: cement near the bottom of the well and a seal assembly near the top. The congressmen described three flawed decisions relating to the cement, and said the company also decided not to use a device called a “lockdown sleeve” to ensure that the top seal would hold. Among the decisions relating to the cement, the congressmen said, BP opted to use far fewer “centralizers,” devices to keep the final string of casing centered in the well hole and help assure that cement flows evenly around the outside of the casing. BP used six instead of the 21 recommended by the cement contractor, Halliburton, which warned of a potential for a “severe gas flow problem.” A BP official complained in an April 16 e-mail message that it would take 10 hours to install the recommended number. “I do not like this,” he wrote. In addition, the congressmen wrote, BP did not fully circulate heavy drilling mud through the well — which would have taken about 12 hours — before proceeding with the cement job. The congressmen noted that the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, recommends full circulation before cement work to reduce the possibility that the mud will contaminate the cement, which could contribute to its failure. BP also did not order a cement bond log, a testing procedure that would have more fully evaluated the quality of the cement barrier. BP’s own engineers had run computer models suggesting that a good cement job was unlikely, and the company had a crew from Schlumberger on hand to conduct the test, which would have taken up to 12 hours. But BP officials decided not to proceed with the test and the Schlumberger workers left the Deepwater Horizon the morning of the disaster.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/us/06rig.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">In Gulf, It Was Unclear Who Was in Charge of Rig<date>Published: June 5, 2010</date><text>NEW ORLEANS — Over six days in May, far from the familiar choreography of Washington hearings, federal investigators grilled workers involved in the Deepwater Horizon disaster in a chilly, sterile conference room at a hotel near the airport here.The six-member panel of Coast Guard and Minerals Management Service officials pressed for answers about what occurred on the rig on April 20 before it exploded. They wanted to know who was in charge, and heard conflicting answers. They pushed for more insight into an argument on the rig that day between a manager for BP, the well’s owner, and one for Transocean, the rig’s owner, and asked Curt R. Kuchta, the rig’s captain, how the crew knew who was in charge. “It’s pretty well understood amongst the crew who’s in charge,” he said. “How do they know that?” a Coast Guard investigator asked. “I guess, I don’t know,” Captain Kuchta said. “But it’s pretty well — everyone knows.” Looking annoyed, Capt. Hung Nguyen of the Coast Guard, one of the chief federal investigators, shook his head. The exchange confirmed an observation he had made earlier in the day at the hearing. “A lot of activities seem not very tightly coordinated in the way that would make me comfortable,” he said. “Maybe that’s just the way of business out there.” Investigators have focused on the minute-to-minute decisions and breakdowns to understand what led to the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon, killing 11 people and setting off the largest oil spill in United States history and an environmental disaster. But the lack of coordination was not limited to the day of the explosion. New government and BP documents, interviews with experts and testimony by witnesses provide the clearest indication to date that a hodgepodge of oversight agencies granted exceptions to rules, allowed risks to accumulate and made a disaster more likely on the rig, particularly with a mix of different companies operating on the Deepwater whose interests were not always in sync. And in the aftermath, arguments about who is in charge of the cleanup — often a signal that no one is in charge — have led to delays, distractions and disagreements over how to cap the well and defend the coastline. As a result, with oil continuing to gush a mile below the surface in the Gulf of Mexico, the laws of physics are largely in control, creating the daunting challenge of trying to plug a hole at depths where equipment is straining under more than a ton of pressure per square inch. Tad W. Patzek, chairman of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas, Austin, has analyzed reports of what led to the explosion. “It’s a very complex operation in which the human element has not been aligned with the complexity of the system,” he said in an interview last week. His conclusion could also apply to what occurred long before the disaster. Exceptions Are the Rule Deepwater oil production in the gulf, which started in 1979 but expanded much faster in the mid-1990s with new technology and federal incentives, is governed as much by exceptions to rules as by the rules themselves. Under a process called “alternative compliance,” much of the technology used on deepwater rigs has been approved piecemeal, with regulators cooperating with industry groups to make small adjustments to guidelines that were drawn up decades ago for shallow-water drilling. Of roughly 3,500 drilling rigs and production platforms in the gulf, fewer than 50 are in waters deeper than 1,000 feet. But the risks and challenges associated with this deeper water are much greater. “The pace of technology has definitely outrun the regulations,” Lt. Cmdr. Michael Odom of the Coast Guard, who inspects the rigs, said last month at a hearing. As a result, deepwater rigs operate under an ad hoc system of exceptions. The deeper the water, the further the exceptions stretch, not just from federal guidelines but also often from company policy. So, for example, when BP officials first set their sights on extracting the oily riches under what is known as Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico, they asked for and received permission from federal regulators to exempt the drilling project from federal law that requires a rigorous type of environmental review, internal documents and federal records indicate. As BP engineers planned to set certain pipes and casings for lining the well in place in the ocean floor, they had to get permission from company managers to use riskier equipment because that equipment deviated from the company’s own design and safety policies, according to internal BP documents obtained by The New York Times. And when company officials wanted to test the blowout preventer, a crucial fail-safe mechanism on the pipe near the ocean floor, at a lower pressure than was federally required, regulators granted an exception, documents released last week show.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/opinion/04uhlmann.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Prosecuting Crimes Against the Earth<date>Published: June 3, 2010</date><text>Ann Arbor, Mich.“IF our laws were broken ... we will bring those responsible to justice,” President Obama pledged on Tuesday, in announcing an investigation of the events leading to the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. His words may have been, in part, political damage control; efforts to contain the spill remain dire. But federal prosecutors have been working behind the scenes for weeks to determine whether BP, Transocean (the owner of the rig) and Halliburton (the company that did the cementing job on the deep-ocean well) should be charged with crimes. Now, it’s up to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to ensure that the legal response to the calamitous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is better than the emergency response. If the spill had resulted from a hurricane or lightning strike, or if it had been an unavoidable accident — an equipment failure that happened without warning — it wouldn’t warrant criminal prosecution. Increasingly, however, it appears that there was negligence or worse in the events leading to the explosion of the rig. News reports have described warning signs that went unheeded and deviations from standard industry practice: Gas was seeping into the well. The blowout preventer was leaking. Concerns were raised about the well casing. There were signs of trouble with the cement in the well. Mud circulation was limited. A final concrete plug was not properly installed. And when disaster struck, the blowout preventer failed. Prosecutors must examine all witness statements, internal documents and any physical evidence that remains after the explosion. But if the news articles are accurate, the Justice Department should bring criminal charges against BP, and possibly Transocean and Halliburton, for violations of the Clean Water Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act — the same charges brought in the Exxon Valdez case. Exxon ultimately paid a criminal fine of $125 million, the largest ever for an environmental crime. In this case, though, a fine of that size may not satisfy the many people who are outraged by the gulf spill. The public expects felony charges and multibillion-dollar fines. All three of the environmental laws that may have been broken provide for criminal penalties, but only the Clean Water Act includes felony charges. For the government to prove a felony violation of the act it would need to demonstrate that the defendant knew oil would be discharged into United States waters. A felony violation can be easy to prove when a business dumps waste into a river, but it’s harder in the case of an oil spill. No one thinks BP, Transocean or Halliburton intended to spill oil into the gulf. But given good evidence, the government could argue that the companies cut corners or deviated so much from standard industry practice that they knew a blowout could happen. Or, the government could argue that, even if the initial gusher involved only negligence (a misdemeanor under the Clean Water Act) each additional day represents a knowing violation. Both approaches are untested, because there have been so few oil spill cases — but the gulf disaster warrants trying aggressive strategies. Ultimately, the public would like to see oil company executives brought up on felony charges, leading to jail time that might inspire more careful drilling in the future. But only those directly involved in misconduct can be charged with crimes, and it is likely that executives of BP, Transocean and Halliburton played no such personal role in the disaster. Faced with these challenges, the Justice Department must find out whether BP or the other companies misled the government about the integrity of the well, or the amount of oil gushing from it. This could be the basis for charges of felony obstruction of justice against the companies and individuals involved. The Justice Department’s case against BP will be strengthened by the company’s history of criminal violations, which offer evidence of a culture that puts profits before the environment and worker safety. After a 2005 explosion at its Texas City refinery, which killed 15 workers, BP pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act by failing to maintain a safe facility. It also pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act by having corroded pipelines that caused oil spills in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay in 2006. Criminal prosecution cannot restore the gulf or end the suffering of the people who live along its shores. But it could ensure just punishment. And it would make it more likely that the companies involved would pay all claims for damage to the gulf coast, because the $75 million cap on liability, set by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, does not apply in criminal cases. Most important, criminal prosecution would send a clear message that an environmental disaster of this magnitude cannot be allowed to happen again.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/opinion/03thu1.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Reckoning in the Gulf<date>Published: June 2, 2010</date><text>The criminal and civil investigations announced by the Justice Department this week into the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are clearly necessary.The spill, the worst in United States history and growing more damaging by the day, cries out for accountability and appropriate punishment. Attorney General Eric Holder did not name specific targets, but BP, Transocean — the rig operator — and other important subcontractors like Halliburton are obvious candidates. Justice’s investigation will run parallel to an inquiry by a special commission appointed by President Obama to discover the causes of the disaster, assess the performance of federal oversight agencies and recommend ways to prevent similar calamities. The White House must take special care that both are allowed to do a complete job. Even though their missions are different — the Justice Department mainly concerned with lawbreaking, the commission with safety — overlap is inevitable. Both, for instance, will be talking to many of the same witnesses from government and industry. Unlike the Justice Department, the commission does not have subpoena powers. Congress should grant that power if only to make sure that witnesses from an industry that is accustomed to going its own way actually show up. As Mr. Holder knows, the legal journey will be long and arduous. Exxon did not finally settle up for damages related to the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill — in addition to the billions it paid in cleanup costs — until a Supreme Court decision in 2008. BP is responsible for containing the gulf spill and cleaning it up, but the fines it must ultimately pay, as well as compensatory damages to injured parties, will depend in part on the whether the company can be shown to have broken the law. One relevant law is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, enacted after the Exxon Valdez spill, which imposes monetary penalties for every barrel of spilled oil — even if negligence is not found, but more if it is. Another is the Clean Water Act, which carries both civil and criminal penalties for polluting waterways. BP could also be found negligent under the Marine Mammal Protection Act because it failed to obtain necessary federal permits to drill in areas inhabited by endangered whales. In addition, Mr. Holder said he would investigate potential liability under the Migratory Bird Act Treaty and the Endangered Species Act, which provide penalties for injury and death to wildlife and bird species. Exxon agreed in 1991 to pay $100 million to settle criminal charges under the various statutes, and later paid $1 billion in federal and state civil damages and $500 million in punitive damages. Senator Barbara Boxer, who was pressing Mr. Holder to act, raised one more ominous possibility: that BP may have made false and misleading statements to federal authorities in the 2009 exploratory drilling plan it submitted to the Minerals Management Service. The plan asserted that the company had “proven equipment and technology” to respond to a blowout. Given the ad hoc nature of BP’s response, Ms. Boxer has suggested, that assertion now seems misleading or even false. There are extraordinarily tough times ahead for the gulf and the region’s residents. That BP will also suffer does not trouble us in the least.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28brooks.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Drilling for Certainty<date>Published: May 27, 2010</date><text>In the weeks since the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the political debate has fallen into predictably partisan and often puerile categories. Conservatives say this is Obama’s Katrina. Liberals say the spill is proof the government should have more control over industry.But the real issue has to do with risk assessment. It has to do with the bloody crossroads where complex technical systems meet human psychology. Over the past decades, we’ve come to depend on an ever-expanding array of intricate high-tech systems. These hardware and software systems are the guts of financial markets, energy exploration, space exploration, air travel, defense programs and modern production plants. These systems, which allow us to live as well as we do, are too complex for any single person to understand. Yet every day, individuals are asked to monitor the health of these networks, weigh the risks of a system failure and take appropriate measures to reduce those risks. If there is one thing we’ve learned, it is that humans are not great at measuring and responding to risk when placed in situations too complicated to understand. In the first place, people have trouble imagining how small failings can combine to lead to catastrophic disasters. At the Three Mile Island nuclear facility, a series of small systems happened to fail at the same time. It was the interplay between these seemingly minor events that led to an unanticipated systemic crash. Second, people have a tendency to get acclimated to risk. As the physicist Richard Feynman wrote in a report on the Challenger disaster, as years went by, NASA officials got used to living with small failures. If faulty O rings didn’t produce a catastrophe last time, they probably won’t this time, they figured. Feynman compared this to playing Russian roulette. Success in the last round is not a good predictor of success this time. Nonetheless, as things seemed to be going well, people unconsciously adjust their definition of acceptable risk. Third, people have a tendency to place elaborate faith in backup systems and safety devices. More pedestrians die in crosswalks than when jay-walking. That’s because they have a false sense of security in crosswalks and are less likely to look both ways. On the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, a Transocean official apparently tried to close off a safety debate by reminding everybody the blowout preventer would save them if something went wrong. The illusion of the safety system encouraged the crew to behave in more reckless ways. As Malcolm Gladwell put it in a 1996 New Yorker essay, “Human beings have a seemingly fundamental tendency to compensate for lower risks in one area by taking greater risks in another.” Fourth, people have a tendency to match complicated technical systems with complicated governing structures. The command structure on the Deepwater Horizon seems to have been completely muddled, with officials from BP, Transocean and Halliburton hopelessly tangled in confusing lines of authority and blurred definitions of who was ultimately responsible for what. Fifth, people tend to spread good news and hide bad news. Everybody wants to be part of a project that comes in under budget and nobody wants to be responsible for the reverse. For decades, a steady stream of oil leaked out of a drill off the Guadalupe Dunes in California. A culture of silence settled upon all concerned, from front-line workers who didn’t want to lose their jobs to executives who didn’t want to hurt profits. Finally, people in the same field begin to think alike, whether they are in oversight roles or not. The oil industry’s capture of the Minerals Management Service is actually misleading because the agency was so appalling and corrupt. Cognitive capture is more common and harder to detect. In the weeks and hours leading up to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, engineers were compelled to make a series of decisions: what sort of well-casing to use; how long to circulate and when to remove the heavy drilling fluid or “mud” from the hole; how to interpret various tests. They were forced to make these decisions without any clear sense of the risks and in an environment that seems to have encouraged overconfidence. Over the past years, we have seen smart people at Fannie Mae, Lehman Brothers, NASA and the C.I.A. make similarly catastrophic risk assessments. As Gladwell wrote in that 1996 essay, “We have constructed a world in which the potential for high-tech catastrophe is embedded in the fabric of day-to-day life.” So it seems important, in the months ahead, to not only focus on mechanical ways to make drilling safer, but also more broadly on helping people deal with potentially catastrophic complexity. There must be ways to improve the choice architecture — to help people guard against risk creep, false security, groupthink, the good-news bias and all the rest. This isn’t just about oil. It’s a challenge for people living in an imponderably complex technical society.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D6113BF934A15756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=halliburtoncompany">BP OFFICIALS TOOK A RISKIER OPTION FOR WELL CASING<date>Published: May 27, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON -- Several days before the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, BP officials chose, partly for financial reasons, to use a type of casing for the well that the company knew was the riskier of two options, according to a BP document. The concern with the method BP chose, the document said, was that if the cement around the casing pipe did not seal properly, gases could leak all the way to the wellhead, where only a single seal would serve as a barrier. Using a different type of casing would have provided two barriers, according to the document, which was provided to The New York Times by a Congressional investigator. Workers from the rig and company officials have said that hours before the explosion, gases were leaking through the cement, which had been set in place by the oil services contractor, Halliburton. Investigators have said these leaks were the likely cause of the explosion. The approach taken by the company was described as the ''best economic case'' in the BP document. However, it also carried risks beyond the potential gas leaks, including the possibility that more work would be needed or that there would be delays, the document said. BP's decision was ''without a doubt a riskier way to go,'' said Greg McCormack, director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas at Austin. Several other engineers agreed with Mr. McCormack's assessment of the BP document. Andrew Gowers, a spokesman for BP, said that there was no industry standard for the casing to be used in deepwater wells and that the approach by the Deepwater Horizon had not been unusual. ''BP engineers evaluate various factors for each well to determine the most appropriate casing strategy,'' he said. The role of financial and time pressures in the rig blast is one focus of a series of hearings by the Coast Guard and the Minerals Management Service that began Wednesday in Kenner, just outside New Orleans. Douglas H. Brown, the chief mechanic for the Deepwater Horizon, testified Wednesday that he witnessed a ''skirmish'' on the rig between a BP well site leader and crew members employed by Transocean, the rig's owner, the morning of the blast. Mr. Brown said the disagreement followed BP's decision to replace heavy drilling fluid with lighter saltwater before the well was sealed with a final cement plug. ''Well, this is how it's going to be,'' the BP official said, according to Mr. Brown. Mr. Gowers declined to answer questions about workers' accusations or about whether cost may have factored into the company's decision to use the casing system it chose for the Deepwater Horizon. BP executives will probably face tough questioning about cost-cutting measures on Thursday when they testify before the House Committee on Natural Resources. As more details come to light about the events that led to the explosion, investigators are trying to determine which decisions and incidents -- or combination of them -- may have led to the accident, which killed 11 workers. For example, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia and the chairman of the committee, said BP executives would face questions about why they let workers from Schlumberger, a drilling-services contractor, leave the morning of the accident without conducting a special test on the quality of the cement work. Engineers have described these tests, called cement bond logs, as an important tool for ensuring cement integrity. The decision about the casings will also come up during the hearings. Professor McCormack said that while the type of casing that BP chose to use was more expensive in the short term, it was ultimately the more cost-effective and versatile alternative because it would have allowed the company to more easily drill deeper in the same hole if they decide to do so later. But, the BP records explain, the casing chosen by the company may also cause problems if drilling mud or cement is lost or pushed away from the well into porous rocks as it is pumped.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/us/26rig.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Panel Suggests Signs of Trouble Before Rig Explosion<date>Published: May 25, 2010</date><text>In the hours before the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded last month in the Gulf of Mexico, there were strong warning signs that something was terribly wrong with the well, according to a Congressional committee that was briefed on the accident by executives from BP.Among the red flags, the panel said, were several equipment readings suggesting that gas was bubbling into the well, a potential sign of an impending blowout. Investigators also noted “other events in the 24 hours before the explosion that require further inquiry,” including a critical decision to replace heavy mud in the pipe rising from the seabed with seawater, possibly increasing the risk of an explosion. The new information, released Tuesday night in a memorandum addressed to members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, confirmed many of the committee’s own findings from a review of documents and from statements and testimony given at Congressional hearings over the last two weeks. The memorandum provides the most detailed accounting of the events and decisions made aboard the Deepwater Horizon before the accident on April 20 that took 11 lives and caused a so-far unchecked torrent of oil to pour into the gulf, and comes as BP prepared an ambitious “top kill” procedure in a new effort to stop the leak. The findings are preliminary, and most come from BP, which owns the lease on the well and has at hearings pointed fingers at other companies for the problems on the rig, including Transocean, the rig’s owner. In a statement late Monday, Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, said, “A number of companies are involved, including BP, and it is simply too early — and not up to us — to say who is at fault." Although one-sided, the account of procedural and equipment failures offers one road map for federal investigators as they try to determine who is ultimately responsible for the accident. As part of the investigation, they are also looking at the role of regulatory agencies. Some of those who survived the explosion, including managers from BP and Transocean, are expected to testify at hearings in Louisiana to be held by the Coast Guard and the federal Minerals Management Service, beginning Wednesday. The testimony may help clear up some of the uncertainties about the day of the accident, including who was making the decisions. But the new information from BP — combined with past testimony by executives, analysis of documents by The New York Times and interviews with independent drilling experts — is beginning to paint a picture of a complex operation that went awry just as it was drawing to a close. Drilling logs from the Deepwater Horizon suggest that shortly after midnight on the morning of the explosion, attention had turned to temporarily plugging and capping the well so the rig could disconnect and move to another job. Halliburton, the contractor hired by BP to provide cementing services, had spent the past several weeks cementing each new segment of the well into place. Halliburton was also responsible for plugging it. BP and Congressional investigators have raised questions about the cementing, suggesting that the seal might have been faulty and failed to keep gas from rising up in the well. According to BP, the cement work took longer than normal, and there were concerns that the quality of the cement might have been compromised by contamination with mud. However, in testimony before Congressional hearings, Halliburton executives have said that the company adhered strictly to the specifications provided by BP for the cementing of the well. BP’s investigation, the memorandum said, also indicated that there might have been problems with the blowout preventer — the stack of valves and rams on the seafloor designed to seal off the well in the event of an emergency — at least five hours before the explosion. A sharp fall in fluid levels in the riser pipe that connects the well to the rig suggested that one of the seals in the preventer was leaking. The memo from the House committee, which is led by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, also shed more light on a series of important tests conducted that day to determine whether the cement was holding. Four hours before the explosion, an early pressure test was performed incorrectly and produced unacceptable results. The test was repeated and there was an “indicator of a very large abnormality,” BP’s investigator told the committee, adding that workers might have made a “fundamental mistake” in ignoring it. Shortly before 8 p.m., two hours before the explosion, workers were “satisfied” that the test was successful, according to BP’s investigation. The decision was then made to begin withdrawing the drilling mud, a cocktail of clay, water and minerals used to keep downward pressure on the powerful fountain of oil and gas trying to push its way up out of the tapped reservoir. Philip W. Johnson, an engineering professor at the University of Alabama and a specialist in petroleum engineering, said in an e-mail message that with normal pressure test readings indicating a good seal on the casing and the temporary cement plug, it is not unusual to displace the mud with seawater before the cement job is finished to get a cleaner surface for the cement to adhere to. “But without a good pressure test, it would be reckless to displace,” he said. Congressional investigators and news accounts have suggested that the decision to begin removing drilling mud was a subject of intense discussion — and perhaps even disagreement — among engineers working on the rig that day. Executives from both Transocean and BP have said in testimony before Congress that they were unfamiliar with the details of that debate. But the hearings this week in Louisiana — which will include testimony from the top managers on the rig from BP and Transocean — may provide a clearer picture of the day’s deliberations. In the final hour before the explosion, after the crew had begun withdrawing the mud, there were more signs that the well was going out of control, the memo said. They included a sharp increase in fluid coming from the well, even when the pumps were shut down — an indication, drilling experts say, of a “kick,” a surge in pressure from oil and gas deep down in the well. If not controlled, such a kick can lead to a full-scale blowout, and that is exactly what happened at roughly 9:49 p.m.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/science/18robot.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Far From the Ocean Floor, the Cleanup Starts Here<date>Published: May 17, 2010</date><text>HOUSTON — The cables dangling from the ceiling panels said it all.This was not just another generic workroom in an office building at a sprawling campus of the oil company BP. Or rather, this was no longer just another room. Like many others on the building’s third floor, it had been hijacked by engineers and technicians working to stop the gush of oil from a well in the Gulf of Mexico. “This was never wired for computers,” said Kent Wells, a BP executive, pointing to the cables that led to laptops on tables around the room. “We did it the second night in.” That would be the second night after an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill ship in the Gulf of Mexico. The disaster killed 11 rig workers and caused a torrent of oil to rush from the wellhead 5,000 feet below, which it has been doing nonstop for nearly four weeks. Since then, Mr. Wells, who when not in crisis mode is responsible for BP’s onshore gas-production business, has been overseeing the underwater work to at least contain the oil and, preferably, to seal the well soon, rather than wait several months for the drilling of a relief well that would do the job. The subsea efforts are being brainstormed and coordinated here, in space normally used for training and for managing the company’s operations during hurricanes. About 500 people are involved — 200 of them working the night shift. The hastily wired room, for instance, was where a team of engineers worked on plans to attempt a “top kill,” perhaps by the end of this week, to stop the leak by pumping heavy drilling mud into the well. A few doors down, another room was occupied by BP’s version of air-traffic controllers, only they were coordinating the movements of drill rigs and support ships on the surface at the well site, 130 miles southeast of New Orleans. Other project teams that are working on containing the oil as it leaks underwater had some success over the weekend, when a special tube inserted into a leaking pipe began siphoning some oil to a ship on the surface. Only about 60 percent of the workers are BP employees; the rest come from some of the company’s competitors — Exxon engineers have been working on the top-kill project, for instance — from the military and government laboratories, and from the companies directly involved in the disaster. Executives of BP and of those companies, including Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon, and Halliburton, which had finished sealing the well with cement 20 hours before the explosion, pointed fingers at one another at a Congressional hearing last week, but here peace reigned. “In here you’ve got Halliburton, Transocean and BP all working together,” Mr. Wells said. “What goes on in Washington, you would never know down here.” A darkened room called the hive is the focus of much of the activity, because it is here where many of the plans and procedures drawn up by the various teams, and approved by a unified command in Louisiana, are carried out. Ordinarily set up as a kind of 3-D theater that uses geophysical data to help visualize the location of potential oil and gas deposits, the hive has been taken over by controllers involved with the robotic submersibles that are the only means of working at 5,000 feet down, where water pressures are some 150 times that of normal atmospheric pressure. The technicians in the room do not directly control the submersibles, known as remotely operated vehicles, or R.O.V.s. Rather, they plot out their every move, and instructions are conveyed to ships above the well site, where pilots carry out the actions with the aid of video cameras on each submersible. The real-time video is also fed back to the Houston control room. Each support ship operates two R.O.V.s, which are tethered by cables that supply 30,000 volts of electricity and communication and video lines. “At one point, we had 16 R.O.V.s,” Mr. Wells said. “But the most I’ve seen working at any one time is 12.” By normal deepwater drilling standards, even 12 is an extraordinary number, and choreographing the movements, both of the R.O.V.s and their support ships, can be difficult. Over the weekend, Mr. Wells said, two submersibles were grappling with the tube that had been inserted into the large damaged pipe to route some of the oil to the surface. “When the R.O.V.s were holding it, they kind of got mixed up a bit and it popped out,” he said Sunday. It was later re-inserted successfully. Most oil-industry R.O.V.s have two arms — one with five functions designed for grabbing and holding, and the other with seven functions that can do the finer work of manipulating objects. In addition to the camera and lights, they have an open box in front that support workers fill with tools and other equipment. Mr. Wells said that he really came to appreciate the skill of the R.O.V. pilots during the early days of the disaster, when he and others were trying to figure out how to activate rams on the blowout preventer, the huge stack of equipment on the seabed that failed to seal the well as designed. “It was unbelievable what people did down there,” he said. “Those R.O.V. guys, they were reaching in and disconnecting hoses with a wrench. And I’m talking about reaching through other hoses.” Those efforts were largely unsuccessful, however, which is why the focus is now on the top-kill method of pumping heavy mud through the blowout preventer into the well. It may be preceded by a so-called junk shot, in which materials like golf balls and bits of rubber would be injected into the preventer to bridge gaps in the rams and stop or sharply reduce the flow of oil. Both techniques have required much work over the past few weeks by R.O.V.s to remove certain pipes on the blowout preventer and install new pipes and equipment on the seafloor. And when the techniques are attempted, R.O.V.s will be in place, opening special valves as needed. But even seemingly simple plumbing tasks are complicated in the extreme cold and high pressure at 5,000 feet, particularly if more than one R.O.V. is involved. Mr. Wells described one recent bit of work, in which it took three R.O.V.s working together to clamp a hose atop the blowout preventer. Pat Campbell, a well-control expert who is working with BP on the project, said that R.O.V. pilots were learning a lot from the out-of-the-ordinary work. He had recently been testing equipment for the project in Lafayette, La., and met with some of the pilots. “They were very helpful to us because they could describe things that would be difficult for them to do with an R.O.V.,” he said. “But maybe there was a solution to how we could make that less difficult.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/us/politics/15obama.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Obama Vows End to ‘Cozy’ Oversight of Oil Industry<date>Published: May 14, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — President Obama on Friday angrily assailed the finger-pointing among the three companies involved in the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as a “ridiculous spectacle,” even as his own administration came under criticism for failing to do enough to prevent an environmental calamity.In remarks during an appearance in the Rose Garden, Mr. Obama also criticized what he called the “cozy relationship” between the government and the oil industry that has existed for decades, even into his own administration. He acknowledged that federal agencies had failed to ensure that safety and environmental standards were being met and announced a thorough review of the oversight process. “I will not tolerate any more finger-pointing or irresponsibility,” he said. “This is a responsibility that all of us share.” The president’s comments reflected impatience by the White House over BP’s failure to stop the leaking of oil into the gulf, and alarm that growing public ire could soon overwhelm the administration. White House officials have been meeting daily about how to respond to the spill, but amid reports that the administration may have been hasty in issuing drilling permits to BP and other oil companies, Mr. Obama summoned top cabinet officials to the Oval Office on Friday to discuss how to increase the government’s response. As environmental groups criticized the administration’s record on drilling, Democrats tried to take steps Friday to prevent the issue from causing even more damage in an election year. The Democratic National Committee sent an e-mail message to reporters trumpeting an article in The Atlantic Monthly that cast the administration’s response to the oil spill in a favorable light compared with President George W. Bush’s response to Hurricane Katrina. Most Democrats have refrained from directly criticizing the White House’s response to the spill, even as the calls for fundamental reform of regulation of offshore drilling have grown louder. But with each day the spill is not contained, and with new estimates that it may be many times larger than the government has said, the peril is rising for the administration. Next week, top administration officials, including the cabinet officers directly in charge of the response, will appear before several Congressional committees — and the questions, and possible blame, could shift from the companies to the administration. In the gulf, BP technicians were preparing the latest of several efforts to plug the leaking well and siphon off some of the oil. BP planned to try to insert a tube into the open end of the drilling riser, the source of the biggest leak. A second intervention, a so-called top hat, is already on the seabed, waiting to be maneuvered over the biggest leak in case the insertion pipe fails. A relief well is being drilled to block the leaking well. Officials said it had reached 9,000 feet below the ocean surface, about halfway to the planned intersection point with the original well. Government officials have approved the use of chemical oil dispersants deep underwater after several tests and consultation with scientists, according to Rear Adm. Mary Landry of the Coast Guard, the top commander on the scene. She also said that the weather forecast for the next few days was favorable, so operations to skim and burn oil from the surface would resume. Mr. Obama reiterated that he intended to break up the beleaguered federal Minerals Management Service, which oversees offshore drilling, “so that the part of the agency which permits oil and gas drilling and collects royalties will be separate from the part of the agency in charge of inspecting oil rigs and platforms and enforcing the law.” That way, Mr. Obama said, “there’s no conflict of interest, real or perceived.” David Rothkopf, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration, said that Mr. Obama was trying to walk a fine line between capitalizing on populist anger over the oil spill and alienating the business community, which he needs for his jobs agenda. “I think one of the risks associated with his rhetoric on the spill is that it hardens the divide between the Democratic Party and the business community,” Mr. Rothkopf said. “And that’s something that while it seems to be in the spirit of the moment now, could have serious ramifications come election time.” That, he said, could result in money from corporate America going to the Republican Party. Even as Mr. Obama outlined the government’s latest actions in response to the spill, his administration was coming under fire for allowing the minerals service to continue with business as usual in granting the permits even after Mr. Obama came to office vowing to clean it up. Environmentalists and proponents of greater restrictions on offshore oil drilling questioned, for instance, Mr. Obama’s decision to expand offshore oil drilling — announced in March — before first tackling the close relationships between government and industry at the agency.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/us/14spill.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Western Senators Propose Ban on Pacific Drilling<date>Published: May 13, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The political ripples from the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster spread in the capital on Thursday as six West Coast senators proposed a permanent ban on drilling in the Pacific and another group tried to raise oil company liability in a spill to $10 billion from the current $75 million.The move by senators from California, Oregon and Washington, all Democrats, was largely symbolic because there are no plans at present to open the West Coast to drilling. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, withdrew a modest plan for new offshore drilling shortly after the gulf accident. The liability measure was pushed by Senators Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, Democrats of New Jersey, and Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, who said the current limit represents a small fraction of the likely damage from the BP spill in the gulf. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, a strong proponent of offshore drilling, blocked their bill, saying it would discourage all oil exploration. Ms. Murkowski is sponsoring a separate bill to raise oil taxes by a penny a barrel to increase the federal spill response fund. The Democrats said they would try again to enact the change in liability law. The Obama administration has said it would like to see the liability limit increased, but has not said by how much. The three companies involved in the current spill — BP, the lease owner; Transocean, which owned the drilling rig; and Halliburton, which performed the critical final sealing operation — have traded accusations of responsibility in a prelude to a likely legal battle over costs. Transocean moved on Thursday to contain its financial exposure from the rig explosion and collapse, which killed 11 workers and has already cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and cleanup expenses. Transocean, based in Switzerland, filed a petition in federal court in Houston to limit its liability to $26.7 million under an 1851 liability law that was devised to protect American ship owners facing competition from foreign-flagged vessels. In a statement, the company said it “believes this step is necessary to protect the interests of its employees, its shareholders and the company.” Transocean also said it wanted to consolidate all the lawsuits it is facing in one court, and establish a single fund from which “legitimate claims may be paid.” Also on Thursday, Ken Salazar, the Interior secretary, took a step toward a planned reorganization of the troubled Minerals Management Service, the agency responsible for regulating the safety and environmental practices of offshore oil drillers, as well as promoting oil exploration and collecting royalties from it. Mr. Salazar, who announced earlier in the week that he intended to separate the agency’s two functions, named two senior department officials to begin planning for the breakup of the minerals agency and creation of its successors. He said the goal of the reorganization was to strengthen safety and environmental enforcement and to end the sometimes-too-close relationship between government officials and regulated companies. “We have a responsibility to ensure that the operation and oversight of offshore operations are following the law, protecting the workers and guarding against future incidents and spills,” Mr. Salazar said in a letter to Congressional leaders seeking their opinions on the proposed overhaul. BP, which has assumed responsibility for the bulk of claims arising from the spill, announced that the cost of responding to the disaster so far had amounted to an estimated $450 million, about $100 million more than the estimate earlier in the week. The company said in a filing to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that the tab included money it had given to Gulf Coast states and the federal government for their responses. The costs also include efforts to contain the spilling crude oil, continuing work to drill a relief well and settlements. So far 6,700 claims have been filed, of which about 1,000 have already been paid, according to the company statement. In the gulf, efforts continued to stop the oil flowing from the damaged well, as BP said it was moving forward with several strategies to try to contain the spill, including inserting a tube into the broken drilling pipe to draw the oil out. A two-ton containment device called a top hat has been lowered to the seafloor and could be installed over the leaking well and will be deployed “within the next few days,” the company said. Officials said they might augment this effort, the second attempt to put an improvised cover over the well, by using a new technique that would involve inserting a slim tube into the well’s broken riser pipe, at the point where it is gushing oil. The tube would then siphon the crude to a tanker at the surface. That technique could be ready to try on Friday. The six-inch-diameter pipe, which has already been lowered to the seafloor, was originally going to be attached to the small containment dome designed to sit over the leak. But Bill Salvin, a BP spokesman, said officials were still concerned about hydrates, crystal structures that form when gas and water mix at high pressures. The rapid accumulation of hydrates is what prevented the much larger containment dome from working last weekend. Robotic vehicles will work overnight to insert the pipe into the riser. If that does not work, officials will try the top hat. BP is also continuing to work on other options.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/us/13q-n-a.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">The Price and Who Pays: Updates From the Gulf<date>Published: May 12, 2010</date><text>An explosion and fire on a drilling rig on April 20 left 11 workers missing and presumed dead. The rig sank two days later about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast. Since then, attempts to shut off the flow of oil streaming into the Gulf of Mexico have been unsuccessful and the search continues for a cause and for ways to prevent such blowouts in the future. Questions persist about who will be liable for damage from the spill and the risks to local wildlife. Following is an updated oil spill primer. A previous Q. and A. can be found at nytimes.com/national.Q Who is liable for the cleanup costs and damage from the spill? A Under a 1990 federal law, the primary leaseholder of the well, BP, is responsible for picking up the lion’s share of the cleanup costs. Anadarko Petroleum and Matsui Oil Exploration together own 35 percent of the lease, and they would pay that share of expenses. The law requires BP and the other leaseholders to pay an unlimited amount in direct cleanup costs. Their liability for other damage, such as ruined fisheries and lost tourist revenue, is legally capped at $75 million, although the company says it is willing to pay claims beyond that. Above the cap, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, financed by a tax on oil companies, is supposed to pick up the tab, up to a total of $1 billion. Craig Bennett, the director of the Coast Guard’s National Pollution Funds Center, said that as of Wednesday morning, BP had received 6,414 claims, mostly from fishermen for lost wages and damage to their boats. He said the company had paid out $2.5 million so far, and “they have not denied any claims yet.” On Wednesday, President Obama proposed legislation to create a variety of emergency programs to advance money to people affected by the spill, bolster the trust fund through a higher tax on oil companies and raise the overall spending limit to $1.5 billion per accident. Separate legislation already introduced would raise a company’s cap on liability to $10 billion. If it is found that BP was grossly negligent or broke federal safety regulations, there is no limit to what it must pay. Insurance companies are likely to pay some costs, and BP’s contractors could also face claims. Those contractors include Transocean, the rig’s operator; Halliburton, the company responsible for cementing the well; and Cameron International, the maker of the blowout preventer, a device designed to shut off a well. Q How much could all these costs add up to? A Estimates vary greatly, especially because oil continues to gush from the well and most of it has not yet reached shore. Morningstar, an investment research firm, has estimated that the environmental cleanup, payments to businesses like hotels that have suffered losses and other regulatory and legal liabilities could exceed $4 billion. According to the Insurance Information Institute, companies with exposure to liabilities are insured for losses totaling about $1.4 billion. Q Will taxpayers end up paying the bill? A BP says the leaseholders will pay cleanup costs and all legitimate damage claims. The Obama administration says it is determined to make BP pay the entire cost of the accident. The company earns billions of dollars in profits every year, so even a multibillion-dollar tab would not cripple it. “The U.S. government will seek to recoup every penny that it can from BP and its partners in the Deepwater Horizon project,” predicted Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute. “There will be no tax dollars whatsoever that subsidize the payment insurers will make to parties involved in the Deepwater Horizon project.” Q A number of sea turtles and dolphins have been found dead along the gulf coast. Is this related to the spill or the use of chemical dispersants being used to clean up the area? A So far, the deaths of 18 birds, 6 dolphins, and 87 sea turtles have been reported to the authorities as possibly related to the spill. It is normal for a certain number of animals to wash up dead on beaches. This time of year, for example, dolphins can run into trouble when they come into shallower waters to have their calves. In the case of sea turtles, Dave Westerholm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that there was no external evidence of oil on the animals but that full autopsies had not yet been completed. As for the dolphins, Jane Lubchenco of NOAA said the government was still in “the discovery phase.” Q How much dispersant has been used so far? A More than 400,000 gallons of dispersant have been applied to the spill, already far exceeding the volume of chemicals used to control other spills in the United States. “I think it’s fair to say that when it comes to this volume, we’re in uncharted waters,” said Lisa P. Jackson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/us/13spill.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">BP Says Leak May Be Closer to a Solution<date>Published: May 13, 2010</date><text>After days of deepening gloom, BP and two Obama administration officials suggested on Wednesday that the company was closer to a solution that might halt the seemingly uncontrollable oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.The officials said engineers and scientists at BP’s command center in Houston had drafted plans to work on and around an underwater blowout preventer, a massive safety device that is designed to seal an oil well in an emergency but failed to do so after the explosion at the rig on April 20. The oil giant has “increasing confidence that we can intervene directly in the B.O.P. at acceptably low risk,” a BP spokesman, Andrew Gowers, said. Successive efforts to plug the spill over the past three weeks have failed. Sent by President Obama to Houston, Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar met with top engineers and scientists at the BP command center for several hours on Wednesday. “Things are looking up,” Dr. Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics, told reporters after the meeting. “Progress is being made.” He cautioned that the situation was still not under control and declined to detail the reasons for his optimism. But when pressed, he said, “I’m feeling more comfortable than I was a week ago.” In Washington, a House subcommittee investigating the disaster raised the possibility that BP wrapped up work on the oil rig even though a seal at the top of the well had failed a pressure test a few hours before the explosion. Representatives also suggested that a hydraulic leak may have disabled the blowout preventer. Yet as patches of oil washed ashore on a barrier island in Louisiana over 60 miles west of the Mississippi, a BP official said equipment was being put in place on the seabed for three intervention options that potentially could stop the spill within weeks rather than months. He said a decision would be made, most likely by Sunday, on whether to proceed with any of them. Work would begin a few days later, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject. He said 10 robotic submersibles were carrying out the preparations 5,000 feet under the gulf’s surface in the meantime. As the oil company that rented the drilling rig, BP is one of the parties responsible for stopping and cleaning up the spill. One option it has undertaken for halting the gush of oil is drilling relief wells that could be used to plug the damaged well with cement, but that will take several months. Engineers have described three other approaches that could stop the leak: a so-called junk shot that would clog the blowout preventer with materials including shredded tires and golf balls; adding a second blowout preventer atop the first and using it to shut the flow; or cutting the collapsed riser pipe and installing a valve that would do the same thing. The junk shot would be followed by a “top kill,” the pumping of heavy drilling mud into the well to overcome the pressure of the rising oil. The official said a junk shot might be used first even if another option was chosen because it could further restrict or stop the flow of oil and make the other repairs easier and safer. Installing a valve or a second blowout preventer, he said, would keep the well under control until a relief well was finished and heavy mud and cement could be pumped in to seal it permanently. The BP official said the material for the junk shot would be pumped from a ship on the surface through new pipe down to the blowout preventer, which the submersible robots have been working on for several days. Officials noted that these kinds of approaches had never been tried at such depths and that they could fail — just as a plan to use a large containment dome to capture some of the oil failed over the weekend. The junk shot technique was used successfully in the Kuwaiti oilfields in the 1991 Persian Gulf war. But those wells were on land and, even in harsh desert conditions, could be repaired by people, not by robots working in extremely cold water at a pressure of 2,300 pounds per square inch. But the BP official said pressure data made engineers hopeful that undertaking the work would not make the leak worse. That data was obtained from above the blowout preventer and below it, and the difference in readings showed that the blowout preventer is partly closed and actually restricting the flow. At the same time, gamma-ray inspection of the device showed that it “has external integrity,” the official said. Engineers had been concerned that if the device was damaged, working on it might make the leak worse. The data from below the blowout preventer became available Sunday through a bit of serendipity, the official said: a robotic submersible suddenly started receiving a signal from a wireless gauge down in the well. BP also said Wednesday that it had lowered a containment box known as a “top hat” to the sea floor. A far smaller device than a containment dome that failed over the weekend, it could be connected by the end of the week, the company said. In Washington, a House subcommittee interrogated executives of the four companies at the heart of the accident: BP, which owns the well; Transocean, which provided the drilling rig and much of the manpower; Halliburton, which provided the cement to seal the well; and Cameron, which provided the blowout preventer. “This catastrophe appears to have been caused by a calamitous series of equipment and operational failures,” said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. “If the largest oil and oil service companies in the world had been more careful, 11 lives might have been saved and our coastlines protected.” Information released by the committee was contradictory on a key point: whether the well had failed a pressure test hours before the blowout. Mr. Waxman said in an introductory statement that a test conducted in the afternoon appeared to show that the well was not tightly sealed and that natural gas was flowing into it. But on Tuesday, he said, BP lawyers told the committee that additional tests had been performed that day and that at 8 p.m., two hours before the explosion, company officials determined that well operations could proceed. Those operations included removing a heavy substance called drilling mud from the pipe leading down to the well, and replacing it with sea water, which is lighter and would have made a blowout more likely if the well were not properly sealed. For the second day, officials from the Coast Guard and Minerals Management Service continued grilling their own officials at a public hearing about the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon. On Wednesday, the Obama administration proposed a $118 million package of actions to combat the gulf oil spill, most of it to be paid for by BP, including unemployment benefits for fishermen put out of work and food aid for those hurt by the spill.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/us/12interior.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">U.S. to Split Up Agency Policing the Oil Industry<date>Published: May 11, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Tuesday proposed breaking up the agency responsible for both policing the oil industry and acting as its partner in drilling activities, seeking to end a decades-old relationship between industry and government that has proved highly profitable — and some say too cozy — for both.The administration has been under pressure to address weaknesses in federal oil regulation since the BP well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico three weeks ago. On Tuesday, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he planned to cut the agency that oversees the industry, the Minerals Management Service, in two. One office would be responsible for public safety and environmental enforcement and the other in charge of leasing and revenue collection. Details of the proposal are still being worked out. “The job of ensuring energy companies are following the law and protecting the safety of their workers and the environment is a big one,” Mr. Salazar said, “and should be independent from other missions of the agency.” Some in Congress and outside groups expressed skepticism that the organizational change alone would end what they called perverse incentives leading to rushed safety reviews and a regulatory system that largely allows the industry to police itself. As lawmakers weighed the bureaucratic reshuffling, tens of thousands of gallons of crude oil continued to pour into the gulf, threatening hundreds of miles of coastline. BP executives said they were pursing multiple lines of attack but conceded that they still were days or weeks from even a partial solution. Decades of law and custom have joined government and the oil industry in the pursuit of petroleum and profit. The Minerals Management Service brings in an average of $13 billion a year. Under federal law, even in the case of a major accident, the company responsible for the oil well acts in concert with government in cleanup activities and can help put out information about the response effort. Shortly after the gulf spill, government agencies and BP set up a joint information center and a Web site detailing remediation efforts. In this case, the communications effort, which includes the information center, based in a Shell-owned training and conference center in Robert, La., consists of roughly 65 employees, 10 of whom work for BP, Coast Guard officials said. As the administration scrambled to respond to the unfolding environmental and economic disaster in the gulf, two Senate committees opened hearings into the cause of the April 20 accident. Executives of the three main companies involved in the spill — BP, Transocean and Halliburton — took turns pointing the finger at others for the failures of the systems designed to prevent a major blowout, even as they cautioned that the cause of the explosion was not yet known. In their first testimony since the spill, top executives of BP, which owns the well; Transocean, which owned the drilling rig and did much of the work; and Halliburton, which provided various services, including cement work on the drill hole, all sought to shift blame. “As a responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act, we will carry out our responsibilities,” said Lamar McKay, president and chairman of BP America. But he added that Transocean “had responsibility for the safety of the drilling operations.” Steven L. Newman, president and chief executive of Transocean, said that the accident had to have arisen from elements of the work done by other companies. “Were all appropriate tests run on the cement and the casing?” he asked, apparently implicating Halliburton. Tim Probert, chief of health, safety and environment for Halliburton, said that all work on the casing by his company was carried out “as directed by the well owner,” meaning BP. The ranking Republican minority member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told them to stop the finger-pointing. “I would suggest to all three of you that we are all in this together,” she said. If this spill leads to a cutoff of offshore drilling, Ms. Murkowski said, “not only will BP not be out there, but the Transoceans won’t be out there to drill the rigs and the Halliburtons won’t be out there cementing.” Several senators complained of what they said was the Minerals Management Service’s lax enforcement of safety and environmental standards, saying that regulators regularly rubber-stamped drilling plans that lacked detailed environmental assessments. Senator Barbara Boxer, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said that the agency had granted BP an exemption from filing an environmental impact statement for the well that blew up, accepting company assurances that the chances of a major spill were remote. Such waivers are routinely granted when an impact statement has already been filed for a wider drilling area, but some environmentalists contend that a statement should be filed for each well.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/opinion/12wed1.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Industry Doesn’t Step Up<date>Published: May 11, 2010</date><text>Who is to blame for last month’s catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico? The other guy. At least that’s what three oil executives, predictably and cynically, told a Senate hearing on Tuesday.The Obama administration and Congress are going to have to press a lot harder to figure out what went wrong and what must be changed — including how the industry needs to be regulated — to ensure this never happens again. There is no question about the scale of the destruction. The blowout on a deep-water drilling rig has already dumped nearly 3.5 million gallons of oil into the gulf, and the companies involved have yet to figure out how to stop it. If left unchecked, the spill will almost certainly inflict terrible damage on Louisiana’s coastline and its fishing industry, and possibly other gulf states. The hearings produced almost none of the answers needed. The BP America chairman, Lamar McKay, blamed a malfunctioning blowout preventer installed by Transocean, the operator of the drilling rig. Transocean’s boss, Steven Newman, said the problem may have been a mishandling of the cement that is supposed to keep gas from escaping up the well pipe to the surface. Tim Probert, a president of Halliburton, which was responsible for the cement, suggested that his company was only following instructions from BP. Round and round the blame game went — the “liability chase,” Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey called it. The only sign of progress for the day — there was not any in the gulf — came from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. He announced that the administration intended to split the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling into two parts — one to award drilling leases and collect fees and royalties (worth $13 billion a year) and the other to inspect oil rigs and write and enforce safety regulations. He argued that the move would eliminate conflicts of interest both “real and perceived.” The tales of how the agency, the Minerals Management Service, was corrupted by industry in the Bush years (employees took gifts, steered contracts to favored clients and engaged in drugs and sex with oil company employees) are legendary. Mr. Salazar has taken steps to change that culture. Only now, after this disastrous spill, are we learning how even when the agency’s regulators tried to do their jobs they were repeatedly rolled or rebuffed by industry. There have been widespread reports, for instance, that the Minerals Management Service had asked industry for more backup systems for the blowout preventers but then accepted industry’s assurances that the devices were virtually foolproof. There also have been reports that some agency officials wanted to subject the BP project to a complete environmental impact review but, in the end, accepted BP’s assurances that a huge oil spill was unlikely. The agency clearly failed to press industry to modernize the equipment it uses to combat spills. The technology on display in the gulf — the booms, skimmers and chemical dispersants — seems largely unchanged from the days of the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989. We will not know what went wrong this time until the Interior Department and Congress finish their investigations. What we do know is that the country deserves a far more transparent, far less self-serving response from BP and its subcontractors. We are also waiting to hear Mr. Salazar’s plans for building a robust and impartial regulatory system, one able to ride herd on a large and lucrative industry that cannot be trusted to police itself.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/us/11hearings.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Nitrogen-Cement Mix Is Focus of Gulf Inquiry<date>Published: May 10, 2010</date><text>In seeking to narrow the possible causes of the drilling disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, government investigators are focusing on the role of a tricky type of cement used in sealing the lower section of the oil well.Halliburton, the contractor for the cementing job on the Deepwater Horizon well that blew on April 20, used a type of nitrogen-charged cement to close off the bottom of the well, 13,000 feet below the sea bed. The nitrogen gas was blended into regular cement to make a substance that was puffier and lighter than the cement generally used in oil drilling. Experts said this type of cement can form a stronger bond in certain types of rock, but is also more difficult to use than standard cement, requiring great care in mixing and application. A supervisor on the rig has said he had not seen nitrogen cement used before in the deepest part of a well, and investigators are examining whether it contributed to the catastrophic explosion that killed 11 workers and caused a continuing oil leak estimated to exceed 200,000 gallons a day. Starting on Tuesday, three Congressional committees and an administration panel in Louisiana will begin separate hearings to try to determine what caused the accident and who was responsible, with several other panels to follow this month. The initial focus of the investigation will be on the companies operating the well — BP, Halliburton and Transocean, the owner of the floating drilling platform that sank after the blowout. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is looking into the novel cementing procedure, an aide said, as well as the failure of the device that was supposed to seal the well after the initial blowout and the adequacy of BP’s emergency plans. The inquiry will broaden in coming weeks to examine whether the government was lax in responding to the crisis or had failed to exercise effective safety and environmental oversight of the oil industry. The cement issue is seen as especially important because it could point the way to the root cause of the accident. “It was something that I had never seen them do during this stage in the well,” said one of the supervisors on the rig, Dennis Dewayne Martinez. “I wasn’t really sure what the deal was with the nitrogen, cementing the well with nitrogen, but I knew it was different to me.” A senior BP executive said Monday that while his company was ultimately the responsible party, the actual drilling and cementing were done by Transocean and Halliburton, which could be found liable for some of the billions of dollars in cleanup and damage costs. The most fundamental question about the Deepwater Horizon accident is why a well that had been cemented shut 20 hours earlier, and had passed tests showing that the cement would hold, suddenly started spewing gas and oil. Steven Newman, chief executive of Transocean, said in testimony prepared for Congress and released late Monday that “the one thing we know with certainty is that on the evening of April 20, there was a sudden, catastrophic failure of the cement, the casing or both.” Mr. Newman added, “Therein lies the root cause of this occurrence; without a disastrous failure of one of those elements, the explosion could not have occurred.” From that initial problem, a cascade of failures followed. Workers on the rig somehow missed the buildup of pressure inside the well, even though keeping a close eye on that is the most important safety requirement of their jobs. Once natural gas roared from the well and set off explosions, the rig workers’ efforts to activate a last-ditch device to seal the well failed, as have subsequent efforts to activate it by robot. The inquiries are likely to focus on the maintenance and condition of this device. Similar devices, known as blowout preventers, are used in drilling projects all over the world. “It’s really important to get to the bottom of this,” said John Hofmeister, the former president of the Shell Oil Company. By mid-April, after months of work, the Horizon had drilled far beneath the sea bed, striking a robust oil field for BP and its minority partners, Anadarko and Mitsui Oil Exploration. The crew’s orders were to seal the well so BP could return later. The most critical step was cementing the bottom of the well. Workers have said BP and Halliburton chose the special foamed cement, made with nitrogen. After the accident, nitrogen tanks were found floating in the gulf. Even with regular cement, a well must be sealed with care so bubbles, cracks or holes do not compromise the cement. “If you pump cement in and it’s too liquid, if you’ve got any migration of gas or fluids, this can cause a problem,” said Dave Wilson, a retired specialist in oil well construction. “The gas will channel through the cement. That’s a weak point.” Industry reports say foamed cement is harder to use than regular cement. Once successfully placed, the cement must be allowed to dry before other work can proceed. Drillers have a term for that wait — “WOC time,” for waiting on cement — and with rigs like the Horizon costing more than $20,000 an hour to operate, the big oil companies try to minimize it.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/us/08rig.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Workers on Oil Rig Recall a Terrible Night of Blasts<date>Published: May 7, 2010</date><text>NEW ORLEANS — Nearly 50 miles offshore at the big oil rig floating on a glassy-calm sea, a helicopter landed early on the morning of April 20, carrying four executives from BP, the oil company. The men were visiting the Deepwater Horizon to help honor the crew for its standout safety record.The rig workers were buzzing for another reason. They were nearly done with the latest job. It had been a little tricky, but it was nothing they could not handle. As night fell, Micah Joseph Sandell, 40, was in the small cab of his crane, three stories above the bustling deck. Two floors down from the helipad, men in red coveralls waited for dinner in a hall lined with gold safety plaques. Eugene Dewayne Moss, a 37-year-old crane operator, realized he needed to tear himself away from a movie to get ready for his overnight shift. “I thought, Oh man, I’ve got to go,” Mr. Moss recalled. “I got up, turned my TV off.” Seconds later, a thundering explosion rocked the rig, the beginning of a terrifying night for the men who would survive one of the most harrowing disasters in the history of the oil business. All over the ship, men snapped into action. Sleeping workers leapt from their beds. Then came a second explosion, even louder than the first. They later struggled to describe it — a tornado of fire, a nuclear bomb, a jet engine exploding. But a half-dozen rig workers interviewed this week all agreed on one thing, recalling that moment: “We all were sure we were going to die,” said Dennis Dewayne Martinez, 30, a supervisor on the rig. The Deepwater Horizon was one of the most sophisticated drilling rigs on the planet. Commissioned in 2001, the ship, 396 feet from stem to stern, could park in the water, lock onto satellites to measure an exact position and shoot water out of a series of thrusters to maintain that position. Even with waves crashing against the keel, the rig could steady itself for the precision work of sending drill pipes more than six miles down, dead straight, through the ocean floor and deep into the earth’s crust. Only the year before, the Horizon had set a world record by punching through 35,000 feet of water and rock — nearly seven miles — in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a well called Tiber for BP, the oil giant once known as British Petroleum. This time, the Horizon was drilling an exploratory well about 47 miles off the Louisiana coast, in a stretch of the sea floor known as Mississippi Canyon Block 252. BP and some partners had paid the federal government $34 million for the lease, and the Horizon crew had celebrated when they found oil there. But the Horizon was a drill ship, not a production vessel, so the workers had been told to cap the well for later use and move on to the next job. Up on the bridge that April night, the officers were keeping close watch on the Damon B. Bankston, a 260-foot cargo ship that was pumping special drilling mud through a hose from the rig. The job of sinking the well had gone relatively smoothly — extending the well, pipe by pipe, until it punched through to the oil below. Then the crew shoved a final long stretch of pipe deep into the reservoir. Trouble With Gas Buildup As the job unfolded, however, the workers did have intermittent trouble with pockets of natural gas. Highly flammable, the gas was forcing its way up the drilling pipes. This was something BP had not foreseen as a serious problem, declaring a year earlier that gas was likely to pose only a “negligible” risk. The government warned the company that gas buildup was a real concern and that BP should “exercise caution.” At one point during the previous several weeks, so much of it came belching up to the surface that a loudspeaker announcement called for a halt to all “hot work,” meaning any smoking, welding, cooking or any other use of fire. Smaller belches, or “kicks,” had stalled work as the job was winding down. By mid-April, the crew was in the mop-up stages of the operation. The day before the blast, workers from Halliburton, the oil services contractor, had finished one of the trickiest tasks in building a well: encasing it in cement, with a temporary plug of cement near the bottom of the pipe to seal the well. The Halliburton workers used a less common technique for the cement, whipping nitrogen gas into it to create a kind of mousse. This type of cement, if used correctly, forms a tighter seal, but it is trickier to handle. Still, all in all, it had been a pretty routine job for the Horizon. “Almost there,” said one supervisor as he left the 11 a.m. daily meeting on April 20. “We’re almost done, baby!” Some of the men had heard they might even get a bonus for finishing ahead of deadline. Explosive Fury It happened so fast. Just before 10 p.m., the crew was using seawater to flush drilling mud out of the pipes. Suddenly, with explosive fury, water and mud came hurtling up the pipes and onto the deck, followed by the ominous hiss of natural gas. In seconds, it touched some spark or flame.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/science/earth/07questions.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Clarifying Questions of Liability, Cleanup and Consequences<date>Published: May 6, 2010</date><text>On the evening of April 20, the oil rig Deepwater Horizon exploded about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and injuring 17 more. Two days later it sank in 5,000 feet of water.Crude oil soon began streaming out of a broken pipe attached to a well a mile below sea level. Within days much of the nation was transfixed by a frantic effort by BP and the federal government to plug the leaks and contain a massive spill threatening the gulf coastline and the ocean itself. As the crisis has unfolded, confusion has soared about the oil spill’s gravity, the potential effects on coastal residents, the risks to wildlife and who will foot the costs of the cleanup. Following is an oil spill primer. Q : Who owned the oil rig? A : The nine-year-old rig was owned by Transocean, a giant Swiss offshore drilling contractor. It had been leased to BP for roughly $500,000 a day. Q : Who is legally responsible for the spill? A : BP and Transocean have been named by the Coast Guard as “responsible parties,” which means they must cover all cleanup costs, including those incurred by the Coast Guard and other government employees. They will also have to compensate people and businesses for things like property damage, lost business revenue and harm to ecosystems. BP’s liability bill is capped at $75 million and Transocean’s probably at $65 million, but those caps could be lifted if the companies were found to have acted with gross negligence or to have broken rules that led to the spills. Or the government could rule that the spill involves more than one incident, which would mean higher caps. And three senators have introduced legislation to raise the $75 million cap to $10 billion. Cameron, the company that manufactured a “blowout preventer” that failed to function after the explosion, and Halliburton, which performed drilling services like cementing, could in turn face claims from BP or Transocean. Third parties like fishermen could sue the responsible parties or companies like Cameron and Halliburton. The companies’ insurers face claims, too. Q : How much will the cleanup cost? A : It depends on how much hits shore. Exxon spent $3.4 billion in cleanup costs, fines and compensatory payments for the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989. But even far smaller spills can be costly; when the freighter Cosco Busan hit the Bay Bridge near San Francisco in 2007 and spilled 50,000 gallons of fuel, the cleanup cost $70 million. Q : How big is the spill? A : Using spotter planes, buoys and other techniques, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that by Friday, the spill will measure 240 miles east to west and about 100 miles north to south. Yet the pattern is hardly symmetrical — more like an egg dropped on the floor — and the density of the oil differs widely. Some of the oil has evaporated, some has sunk to the bottom and some has been burned. NOAA has not estimated the total amount of oil spilled. But the spill has been unfolding for more than two weeks at an estimated rate of 210,000 gallons a day; a highly speculative estimate would be 3.3 million gallons so far. Q : How close is the oil to the coast? Will it spread to Florida and the Atlantic Coast? A : That’s one of the hardest questions to answer. Oil from this spill could hit hundreds of miles of coastline — but might not. On Thursday, the oil hit Freemason Island, a Louisiana bird sanctuary. Given the pattern of winds and currents, more areas along the gulf are likely to be hit — anywhere from Louisiana to Florida — but whether many will be drenched in thick concentrations remains an open question. Likewise, currents will eventually carry some oil out of the gulf and into the Atlantic Ocean, but it is hard to predict when and how much. NOAA publishes daily forecasts at www.deepwaterhorizon.noaa.gov. Q : Is this the worst oil spill ever? When did we last see one of this magnitude? A : Two giant spills have occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused a spill of eight million gallons, mostly from onshore storage tanks that chiefly contained oil products, not crude. In 1979-80, the Ixtoc 1 well blowout caused 140 million gallons to flow into the Bay of Campeche in Mexico. Ixtoc did not cause major onshore damage. Katrina did, but the human costs of the devastation largely masked the effects on wildlife and ecosystems. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez dumped 10.8 million gallons of much heavier crude very near the beaches of Prince William Sound. If the current gulf leak is estimated at 210,000 gallons a day, it would take several weeks for the spill to reach the size of any of these. But in sheer volume, all of these spills are dwarfed by the oil that flowed when retreating Iraqi troops blew up oil terminals and wells in Kuwait in early 1991: more than 300 million gallons. Q : What is being done to plug the leaks? A : Robots operated by BP and supervised by the Coast Guard used underwater cutting tools this week to shear off the ragged end of a broken pipe, attach a valve to the new end and then close it. On Thursday, a 100-ton steel funnel, four stories high, arrived at the scene. The idea is to lower it onto the sea floor on top of the well and collect all the oil from the opening at the top. If that fails, the fallback is a “relief well” drilled at an angle to intercept the one that is leaking. But that will take months. Q : How can they stop the oil from spreading? A : Fishing boats are towing booms that collect floating oil, but when the waves and winds are high, the oil slops over. Q : Are plants, animals and ecosystems threatened?</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/us/04spill.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">On Defensive, BP Readies Dome to Contain Spill<date>Published: May 3, 2010</date><text>This article is by Ian Urbina, Justin Gillis and Clifford Krauss.BP spent Monday preparing possible solutions to stem oil leaks from an undersea well off the Louisiana coast, and fending off new accusations about its role in the widening environmental disaster. Crews were building a containment dome, a 4-story, 70-ton structure that the company plans to lower into place over one of the three leaks to catch the escaping oil and allow it to be pumped to the surface. The company was also planning to install a shutoff valve at the site of one of the leaks on Monday, but the seas were too rough, delaying that effort. Heavy winds damaged miles of floating booms laid out in coastal waters to protect the shoreline from the spreading oil slick, which appeared to be drifting toward the Alabama and Florida coasts and the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana’s southern tip. On Monday, lawyers representing environmental groups, workers from the oil rig and fishermen who have been hurt by the leak leveled fresh accusations against BP, as well as Transocean and Halliburton. BP leased the rig from Transocean. Halliburton was providing several services on the rig, including cementing, which is a method of sealing the well to control pressure from the oil and gas beneath. At least one worker who was on the oil rig at the time of the explosion on April 20, and who handled company records for BP, said the rig had been drilling deeper than 22,000 feet, even though the company’s federal permit allowed it to go only 18,000 to 20,000 feet deep, the lawyers said. BP strongly denied the claim that it was drilling deeper than was allowed. “The allegation surrounding the permitted depth is factually incorrect,” said Andrew Gowers, a BP spokesman. Mr. Gowers said that the rig was permitted to drill to 20,211 feet and that it drilled to 18,360 feet. Another worker familiar with the rig told the lawyers that the company had chosen not to install a deep-water valve that would have been placed about 200 feet under the sea floor. Much like blowout preventers, devices that are meant to seal leaks, this valve could have served as a cutoff of last resort in explosions, the lawyers said. “The company took their chances in not having the valve so they could save money,” said Mike Papantonio, one of the lawyers representing the shrimpers and fishermen. Mr. Gowers declined to comment on that claim except to say that the investigation was continuing and that it was too early to speculate. A Halliburton spokeswoman, asked Monday about suspicions that gas was allowed to build up in the well bore, said that it was a matter that still needed to be investigated. A Transocean spokesman said the company was still investigating. More than a half-dozen workers who were on the rig at the time of the explosion told the lawyers that the rig operator had seemed to be rushing to finish and detach from the well — a possible factor that could have contributed to the explosion. However, the lawyers, including Mr. Papantonio from Florida, and Daniel Becnel and Ronnie Penton from Louisiana, said that all the facts were not known and speculation was rampant. Meanwhile, Doug Suttles, BP’s chief operating officer, said the containment dome would be placed above the largest leak and then pipes would pump the oil from the ruptured well to a drill ship waiting on the surface. “This has been done in shallow water but it’s never been done in deep water before,” he said. The company was trying other methods, including drilling a relief well and installing a shutoff valve, to deal with the other two leaks. After a weekend of stormy weather, officials said that the clear forecasts for the coming week would make their work much easier. The explosion that sank the drilling rig came less than a day after workers finished pumping concrete into the well, a step toward closing it off temporarily. BP planned to return to the well later to set up a permanent rig and start producing oil. Encasing a well in concrete is one of the most critical aspects of oil drilling, and presents many risks. The concrete involved is highly specialized. It needs to be blended and stirred properly. It also must be pumped down into the well so that it comes out the bottom and oozes back up around the well casing, forming a tight seal. The concrete work apparently did not achieve a complete seal, and natural gas started seeping into the well in the late stages, the lawyers said. But idling a rig to address such a problem can cost huge sums. The lawyers said that supervisors either missed or ignored the signals and proceeded with the job. When workers released the last valves that were holding back the natural gas that had built up inside the well, the gas shot up the pipe and sprayed into the drilling rig, igniting the fireball that caused the deaths of 11 workers, injured others and sank the rig, the lawyers said. BP and Halliburton declined to comment on the accusations. On Monday, industry experts also began offering their own theories for the explosion’s cause. In an investment note Monday, FBR Capital Markets hypothesized that multiple shortcomings and errors were most likely responsible for the accident. FBR’s analysts echoed the contention from lawyers that a bad cement job could have been one of the problems. “Our current theory is that incomplete isolation by the cement allowed a buildup of annular pressure, which contributed to a casing collapse,” said a report that was co-written by Robert MacKenzie, a former cement engineer in the oil industry. He added that the blowout preventer, or BOP, then “was unable to seal the well due to an obstruction too thick for the BOP to crush/shear, such as a tool joint or drill pipe.” The report said it could find no fault with Halliburton, but “we believe less clarity is available surrounding the operation of the rig and thus believe that Transocean may be faced with a larger overhang of investor worry.” Ken Arnold, an engineer and former Shell executive who has spent 40 years in the industry, speculated that the explosion was likely caused by a combination of errors, both mechanical and human. A temporary plug has to be placed at the bottom of the well. And the concrete, once poured, must be allowed to set long enough to harden properly. “It could have been a problem with the cement plug,” he said, “meaning it could have been when they tested it, they did not test it properly. Or that the gas took a circuitous path and went around the cement plug.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/world/middleeast/07sanctions.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">U.S. Enriches Companies Defying Its Policy on Iran<date>Published: March 6, 2010</date><text>The federal government has awarded more than $107 billion in contract payments, grants and other benefits over the past decade to foreign and multinational American companies while they were doing business in Iran, despite Washington’s efforts to discourage investment there, records show.That includes nearly $15 billion paid to companies that defied American sanctions law by making large investments that helped Iran develop its vast oil and gas reserves. For years, the United States has been pressing other nations to join its efforts to squeeze the Iranian economy, in hopes of reining in Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Now, with the nuclear standoff hardening and Iran rebuffing American diplomatic outreach, the Obama administration is trying to win a tough new round of United Nations sanctions. But a New York Times analysis of federal records, company reports and other documents shows that both the Obama and Bush administrations have sent mixed messages to the corporate world when it comes to doing business in Iran, rewarding companies whose commercial interests conflict with American security goals. Many of those companies are enmeshed in the most vital elements of Iran’s economy. More than two-thirds of the government money went to companies doing business in Iran’s energy industry — a huge source of revenue for the Iranian government and a stronghold of the increasingly powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a primary focus of the Obama administration’s proposed sanctions because it oversees Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. Other companies are involved in auto manufacturing and distribution, another important sector of the Iranian economy with links to the Revolutionary Guards. One supplied container ship motors to IRISL, a government-owned shipping line that was subsequently blacklisted by the United States for concealing military cargo. Beyond $102 billion in United States government contract payments since 2000 — to do everything from building military housing to providing platinum to the United States Mint — the companies and their subsidiaries have reaped a variety of benefits. They include nearly $4.5 billion in loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that underwrites the export of American goods and services, and more than $500 million in grants for work that includes cancer research and the turning of agricultural byproducts into fuel. In addition, oil and gas companies that have done business in Iran have over the years won lucrative drilling leases for close to 14 million acres of offshore and onshore federal land. In recent months, a number of companies have decided to pull out of Iran, because of a combination of pressure by the United States and other Western governments, “terrorism free” divestment campaigns by shareholders and the difficulty of doing business with Iran’s government. And several oil and gas companies are holding off on new investment, waiting to see what shape new sanctions may assume. The Obama administration points to that record, saying that it has successfully pressed allied governments and even reached out directly to corporate officials to dissuade investment in Iran, particularly in the energy industry. In addition, an American effort over many years to persuade banks to leave the country has isolated Iran from much of the international financial system, making it more difficult to do deals there. “We are very aggressive, using a range of tools,” said Denis McDonough, chief of staff to the National Security Council. The government can, and does, bar American companies from most types of trade with Iran, under a broad embargo that has been in place since the 1990s. But as The Times’s analysis illustrates, multiple administrations have struggled diplomatically, politically and practically to exert American authority over companies outside the embargo’s reach — foreign companies and the foreign subsidiaries of American ones. Indeed, of the 74 companies The Times identified as doing business with both the United States government and Iran, 49 continue to do business there with no announced plans to leave. One of the government’s most powerful tools, at least on paper, to influence the behavior of companies beyond the jurisdiction of the embargo is the Iran Sanctions Act, devised to punish foreign companies that invest more than $20 million in a given year to develop Iran’s oil and gas fields. But in the 14 years since the law was passed, the government has never enforced it, in part for fear of angering America’s allies. That has given rise to situations like the one involving the South Korean engineering giant Daelim Industrial, which in 2007 won a $700 million contract to upgrade an Iranian oil refinery. According to the Congressional Research Service, the deal appeared to violate the Iran Sanctions Act, meaning Daelim could have faced a range of punishments, including denial of federal contracts. That is because the law covers not only direct investments, such as the purchase of shares and deals that yield royalties, but also contracts similar to Daelim’s to manage oil and gas development projects.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/world/middleeast/14rebuild.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">U.S. Companies Join Race on Iraqi Oil Bonanza<date>Published: January 13, 2010</date><text>BAGHDAD  A wave of American companies have been arriving in Iraq in recent months to pursue what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar bonanza of projects to revive the country’s stagnant petroleum industry, as Iraq seeks to establish itself as a rival to Saudi Arabia as the world’s top oil producer.

Go to the Blog » Related Suicide Attack Kills 7 in Iraq Inside Government Compound (January 14, 2010) Since the 2003 American-led invasion, nearly all of the biggest reconstruction projects in Iraq have been controlled by the United States. But many rebuilding contracts are expected to be awarded as soon as this month for drilling hundreds of new wells, repairing thousands of miles of pipeline and building several giant floating oil terminals in the Persian Gulf, and possibly a new port. The contracts will be administered either directly by the Iraqi government or as part of Baghdad’s oversight of international oil companies that have signed agreements during the past few months to develop the country’s most promising oil fields. There are misgivings, however, about Iraq’s ability to adequately monitor contracts that could total $10 billion over the next five years. The concerns have been heightened by the prominent role expected to be played by American companies that have been criticized in the past by United States government auditors and inspectors for overcharging by hundreds of millions of dollars, performing shoddy work and failing to finish hundreds of crucial projects while under contract in Iraq. Among the companies that have started sending workers and equipment to the country or have plans to are Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Weatherford International and Schlumberger, all Houston-based oil-services companies, and several construction and engineering giants, including KBR, Bechtel, Parsons, Fluor and Foster Wheeler. Halliburton and its former subsidiary KBR, as well as Bechtel and Parsons, have been singled out for criticism by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction for their previous work in Iraq. The new contracts will put the companies into direct contact with an Iraqi government that has frequently acknowledged its own challenges in dealing with corruption and cronyism, and that has a lack of experienced managers, adequate enforcement and efficient auditing systems. The companies deny intentional wrongdoing in their dealings in Iraq and say that their experience there and in other oil-producing countries in Central Asia gives them an advantage. “KBR has historic experience on previous oil and gas production projects ranging from Azerbaijan to Kazakhstan,” Heather Browne, KBR’s director of corporate communications, wrote in an e-mail response to questions. “Our pursuit of additional contracts in the region is based on this experience in addition to KBR’s work on Project RIO (Restore Iraq Oil).” During a conference call with industry analysts in October, David J. Lesar, Halliburton’s chief executive, said that he had visited Iraq and that the company was already doing a limited amount of work on oil wells there. “I think you see everybody trying to establish a base there, and we’re no exception,” Mr. Lesar said. “Clearly, a great future there and one we will participate in  in a big way.” But others questioned the Iraqi government’s capacity to police the companies. “These are for-profit concerns and they are trying to make as much money as they can,” said Pratap Chatterjee, former executive director of an anticorruption group, CorpWatch, and author of a recent book about Halliburton. “What the Iraq government needs is a good system of transparency and accountability, and for someone who knows what they’re doing to oversee the work. Otherwise, they are going to be taken for a ride.” During the past several months, Iraq has signed 10 production contracts with international oil companies as it tries to increase its oil output from a relatively static 2.4 million barrels a day to as much as 12 million barrels a day within six years. Officials said they hoped to drill at least 430 oil wells during the next two years. The planned work will require new pipelines, including as many as three undersea lines, floating terminals, water treatment facilities, pump stations, oil storage tanks, power plants and possibly a new Persian Gulf port that might be needed to handle the increased oil exports. There will also be a need for new housing, roads and schools, and workers will need to remove unexploded ordnance from oil fields and shipping lanes, transport massive oil rigs and use extraordinary amounts of concrete and steel to reinforce the wells. While American oil companies have enjoyed only modest success in winning oil development deals in Iraq, the numerous contracts signed in recent months have created an enormous backlog of work that leaves Baghdad with limited alternatives to Halliburton and the other American companies that dominate the oil industry services sector. “Iraq has little choice,” said Joost R. Hiltermann, deputy program director for the Middle East and North Africa with the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that aims to prevent deadly conflicts. “It is desperate to increase its revenues, almost all of which derive from the sale of oil. But the government has little capacity to monitor the many companies that will be involved in rehabilitating its ailing oil industry, or indeed its own operations. This is a recipe for massive corruption, but for Iraqi policy makers the cost will be worth it, given the expected massive returns.” Government officials maintain, however, that Iraq’s system of checks and balances will help it avoid the mistakes made by the United States. “There are procedures where if a company breaches a contract or makes errors, they will be blacklisted from working in Iraq,” said Dr. Sabah A. Shibeeb al-Saidi, chief of the Ministry of Oil’s legal and commercial department in the petroleum contracts and licensing directorate. “But if they are not blacklisted we will deal with them. We expect oil services companies to do many things in Iraq.” Neither Halliburton nor KBR is on the Iraqi government blacklist, and Mr. Saidi and other senior Iraqi government officials interviewed said they had never heard of either those companies or of other American ones that have become household names in the United States because of their work in Iraq. Halliburton’s former subsidiary, KBR, which was once run by former Vice President Dick Cheney, has won contracts worth more than $24 billion since the start of the war, giving it vast responsibility for reinvigorating Iraq’s oil sector. Among many other criticisms of the company’s performance in Iraq, Pentagon auditors found that KBR had overcharged the government by more than $200 million. Duraid Adnan contributed reporting.

Lesar, Halliburton’s chief executive, said that he had visited Iraq and that the company was already doing a limited amount of work on oil wells there. “I think you see everybody trying to establish a base there, and we’re no exception,” Mr. Lesar said. “Clearly, a great future there and one we will participate in  in a big way.” But others questioned the Iraqi government’s capacity to police the companies. “These are for-profit concerns and they are trying to make as much money as they can,” said Pratap Chatterjee, former executive director of an anticorruption group, CorpWatch, and author of a recent book about Halliburton. “What the Iraq government needs is a good system of transparency and accountability, and for someone who knows what they’re doing to oversee the work. Otherwise, they are going to be taken for a ride.” During the past several months, Iraq has signed 10 production contracts with international oil companies as it tries to increase its oil output from a relatively static 2.4 million barrels a day to as much as 12 million barrels a day within six years. Officials said they hoped to drill at least 430 oil wells during the next two years. The planned work will require new pipelines, including as many as three undersea lines, floating terminals, water treatment facilities, pump stations, oil storage tanks, power plants and possibly a new Persian Gulf port that might be needed to handle the increased oil exports. There will also be a need for new housing, roads and schools, and workers will need to remove unexploded ordnance from oil fields and shipping lanes, transport massive oil rigs and use extraordinary amounts of concrete and steel to reinforce the wells. While American oil companies have enjoyed only modest success in winning oil development deals in Iraq, the numerous contracts signed in recent months have created an enormous backlog of work that leaves Baghdad with limited alternatives to Halliburton and the other American companies that dominate the oil industry services sector. “Iraq has little choice,” said Joost R. Hiltermann, deputy program director for the Middle East and North Africa with the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that aims to prevent deadly conflicts. “It is desperate to increase its revenues, almost all of which derive from the sale of oil. But the government has little capacity to monitor the many companies that will be involved in rehabilitating its ailing oil industry, or indeed its own operations. This is a recipe for massive corruption, but for Iraqi policy makers the cost will be worth it, given the expected massive returns.” Government officials maintain, however, that Iraq’s system of checks and balances will help it avoid the mistakes made by the United States. “There are procedures where if a company breaches a contract or makes errors, they will be blacklisted from working in Iraq,” said Dr. Sabah A. Shibeeb al-Saidi, chief of the Ministry of Oil’s legal and commercial department in the petroleum contracts and licensing directorate. “But if they are not blacklisted we will deal with them. We expect oil services companies to do many things in Iraq.” Neither Halliburton nor KBR is on the Iraqi government blacklist, and Mr. Saidi and other senior Iraqi government officials interviewed said they had never heard of either those companies or of other American ones that have become household names in the United States because of their work in Iraq. Halliburton’s former subsidiary, KBR, which was once run by former Vice President Dick Cheney, has won contracts worth more than $24 billion since the start of the war, giving it vast responsibility for reinvigorating Iraq’s oil sector. Among many other criticisms of the company’s performance in Iraq, Pentagon auditors found that KBR had overcharged the government by more than $200 million.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio KBR Inc Go to your Portfolio » Mr. Stanley, 65, had been chief executive of KBR, Halliburton’s large engineering and construction unit, until December 2003. Halliburton cut off all ties with him in 2004 after he was accused of secretly enriching himself by as much as $5 million in the payment and kickback scheme. KBR was spun off from Halliburton last year. Some of the payments were made while Vice President Dick Cheney was Halliburton’s chief executive, but neither he nor Halliburton has been accused of being part of the scheme. Under a plea agreement entered in United States District Court in Houston, Mr. Stanley admitted that he authorized the hiring of two consulting companies to pay bribes to several Nigerian government officials while KBR entered into four contracts with a Nigerian liquefied natural gas company whose largest shareholder was the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Mr. Stanley pleaded guilty to paying $132 million to one consulting company and more than $50 million to the other. He said that he intended that the fees would be used to bribe Nigerian government officials. Mr. Stanley also admitted that he had received $10.8 million in kickbacks from a consultant he had hired. Under his plea agreement, Mr. Stanley faces a prison sentence of seven years and payment of $10.8 million in restitution. The plea agreement said that Mr. Stanley and other unidentified executives “met with three successive holders of a top-level office in the executive branch of the government of Nigeria” to ask them to designate representatives with whom to negotiate bribes to Nigerian officials. The payments were made between 1995 and 2004 while KBR was working in a consortium with three companies from Japan, France and Italy. Mr. Stanley had been KBR’s senior representative on the joint venture’s steering committee for the project. “Today’s plea demonstrates that corporate executives who bribe foreign government officials in return for lucrative business deals can expect to face prosecution,” said Matthew Friedrich, an acting assistant attorney general. Mr. Stanley’s lawyer, Larry R. Veselka, said his client “entered into these agreements voluntarily.” He added, “Mr. Stanley has been cooperating with the government and will continue to cooperate with the government.” Mr. Veselka declined to say whom Mr. Stanley might identify to federal prosecutors for their involvement in the bribery scheme, but he said his client would answer all questions fully. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a related civil action, charged Mr. Stanley on Wednesday with violating the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The payments began before Halliburton absorbed KBR through the acquisition of its parent company, Dresser Industries, in 1998, but they overlapped. Vice President Cheney retired from his position at Halliburton in 2000 and has not been connected to the case. Mr. Stanley continued to serve as a consultant at KBR after he left as chairman, until he was fired in 2004 by Halliburton along with another executive suspected of being involved in the scheme. Diana Gabriel, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, said in an e-mail statement, “Halliburton has not yet reviewed the plea agreement, so it would be premature to comment.” Halliburton found its association with KBR, formerly known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, an embarrassing diversion from its primary business as an oil services company, until it spun off the company. KBR has faced numerous investigations into the mishandling of contracts, valued at billions of dollars, for housing, feeding and fueling United States troops and government officials in Iraq.

Their meeting will not have anything to do with Iraq’s national sovereignty, but instead will involve slicing up billions of dollars in work for the defense contractors that support the American military’s presence in the country. For the first time since the war began, the largest single Pentagon contract in Iraq is being divided among three companies, ending the monopoly held by KBR, the Houston-based corporation that has been accused of wasteful spending and mismanagement and of exploiting its political ties to Vice President Dick Cheney. Yet even as the Pentagon begins to pull apart the enormous KBR contract, critics warn that the new three-company deal could actually result in higher costs for American taxpayers and weak oversight by the military. In fact, under the new deal, KBR and the two other companies could actually make more than three times as much as KBR has been paid each year since the war began. Last month the Pentagon awarded the companies pieces of a new contract to provide food, shelter and basic services for American soldiers, a 10-year, $150 billion deal that stretches far beyond the final days of the Bush administration. KBR will still get a sizable chunk of the business, but now it will have to share the work with Fluor Corporation and DynCorp International. Army officials and executives of the three companies are planning to meet in the next few weeks to start the complex process of breaking up KBR’s sprawling operations in Iraq. KBR, previously a subsidiary of Halliburton, once headed by Mr. Cheney, has collected more than $24 billion since the war began. It has 40,000 employees in Iraq and 28,000 more in Afghanistan and Kuwait. But KBR has come under fire from Congress and Pentagon auditors for complaints ranging from making more than $200 million in excessive charges, including meals never served to soldiers, to delivering unsafe water to American troops to doing little to prevent sexual assaults of its female employees, often by their KBR co-workers. Army officials acknowledge that they were under intense pressure from Capitol Hill to give KBR some competition, yet leading Democratic lawmakers and other critics say the new contract will merely paper over the fundamental problems that stem from the Pentagon’s heavy dependence on outside contractors in Iraq. “This is just another verse in the same old song,” said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota who is one of the leading Congressional critics of KBR and other major defense contractors. “It appears to me that this is a broken process.” Critics also say they doubt that the new contract will result in significant cost savings or better services for soldiers in Iraq. The Army has built into the deal the potential for larger profits for the contractors than existed under the prior contract, and it plans to outsource much of the management and oversight of the contractors to yet another company, Serco Inc., for $59 million. “This new contract sounds good, they are splitting it up, but there are serious flaws, including what looks like outsourcing oversight,” said Dina Rasor, an investigator and co-author of a book about contracting in Iraq. “And the size of the contract is enormous. When you think of these big, multibillion-dollar defense contracts and contractors, you think of companies like Lockheed, and you can see their big airplane plants. But what is KBR doing for all this money? They are slinging hash, washing laundry.” Army officials said that they would not be able to actually shift work from KBR to the other companies until late this year, meaning that the change would be under way just as Americans are choosing a new president. The Army officials said the huge new multiyear contract for Iraq would not commit any new presidential administration to paying billions of dollars to defense contractors for services in Iraq if the new president decided to withdraw American troops. It is not clear how the Pentagon will try to untangle KBR’s operations in Iraq to share them with DynCorp and Fluor. Lee Thompson, the executive director of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, as the program is called, said the Army would first try to split work in Kuwait among the three companies, and would then move on to Afghanistan and Iraq. Even if the United States remains in Iraq long term, the contract could ultimately cost much less than $150 billion over 10 years, Mr. Thompson said. But after being caught off guard by the scale of the spending at the start of the war, the Army is building in a cushion this time, he said. Army officials have been working for two years to undo KBR’s monopoly on business in Iraq. As the war dragged on much longer than anticipated, the Army’s initial, pre-invasion decision to grant Halliburton a no-bid contract for Iraq emerged as a sensitive political issue for the Bush administration because of Mr. Cheney’s connections to the company. Army officials realized they had to bring in some other companies. “It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out we were getting beat up by the Hill,” Mr. Thompson said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in World »WASHINGTON  Sometime soon, a group of American corporate executives and military leaders will quietly sit down and divide Iraq into three parts.

Army officials realized they had to bring in some other companies. “It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out we were getting beat up by the Hill,” Mr. Thompson said. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/opinion/09fri2.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">The Lucrative Art of War<date>Published: May 9, 2008</date><text>Congress is finally moving to shut one of the more egregious forms of Iraq war profiteering: defense contractors using offshore shell companies to avoid paying their fair share of payroll taxes.

Two-thirds of Iraq’s G.D.P. and almost all its government revenue come from the oil sector. Without an agreed system for sharing oil revenues, there is no Iraq, just a collection of armed gangs fighting for control of resources. Well, the legislation Mr. Bush promised never materialized, and on Wednesday attempts to arrive at a compromise oil law collapsed. What’s particularly revealing is the cause of the breakdown. Last month the provincial government in Kurdistan, defying the central government, passed its own oil law; last week a Kurdish Web site announced that the provincial government had signed a production-sharing deal with the Hunt Oil Company of Dallas, and that seems to have been the last straw. Now here’s the thing: Ray L. Hunt, the chief executive and president of Hunt Oil, is a close political ally of Mr. Bush. More than that, Mr. Hunt is a member of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a key oversight body. Some commentators have expressed surprise at the fact that a businessman with very close ties to the White House is undermining U.S. policy. But that isn’t all that surprising, given this administration’s history. Remember, Halliburton was still signing business deals with Iran years after Mr. Bush declared Iran a member of the “axis of evil.” No, what’s interesting about this deal is the fact that Mr. Hunt, thanks to his policy position, is presumably as well-informed about the actual state of affairs in Iraq as anyone in the business world can be. By putting his money into a deal with the Kurds, despite Baghdad’s disapproval, he’s essentially betting that the Iraqi government — which hasn’t met a single one of the major benchmarks Mr. Bush laid out in January — won’t get its act together. Indeed, he’s effectively betting against the survival of Iraq as a nation in any meaningful sense of the term. The smart money, then, knows that the surge has failed, that the war is lost, and that Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia. And I suspect that most people in the Bush administration — maybe even Mr. Bush himself — know this, too. After all, if the administration had any real hope of retrieving the situation in Iraq, officials would be making an all-out effort to get the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to start delivering on some of those benchmarks, perhaps using the threat that Congress would cut off funds otherwise. Instead, the Bushies are making excuses, minimizing Iraqi failures, moving goal posts and, in general, giving the Maliki government no incentive to do anything differently. And for that matter, if the administration had any real intention of turning public opinion around, as opposed to merely shoring up the base enough to keep Republican members of Congress on board, it would have sent Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Iraq, to as many news media outlets as possible — not granted an exclusive appearance to Fox News on Monday night. All in all, Mr. Bush’s actions have not been those of a leader seriously trying to win a war. They have, however, been what you’d expect from a man whose plan is to keep up appearances for the next 16 months, never mind the cost in lives and money, then shift the blame for failure onto his successor. In fact, that’s my interpretation of something that startled many people: Mr. Bush’s decision last month, after spending years denying that the Iraq war had anything in common with Vietnam, to suddenly embrace the parallel. Here’s how I see it: At this point, Mr. Bush is looking forward to replaying the political aftermath of Vietnam, in which the right wing eventually achieved a rewriting of history that would have made George Orwell proud, convincing millions of Americans that our soldiers had victory in their grasp but were stabbed in the back by the peaceniks back home. What all this means is that the next president, even as he or she tries to extricate us from Iraq — and prevent the country’s breakup from turning into a regional war — will have to deal with constant sniping from the people who lied us into an unnecessary war, then lost the war they started, but will never, ever, take responsibility for their failures.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/technology/08online.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Keeping Piracy in Perspective<date>Published: September 8, 2007</date><text>THE Motion Picture Association of Americas home page this week showed a big picture of Batman swooping out of the sky, wings outstretched. The Magic of the Movies, the caption read.

Profit climbed to $1.53 billion, or $1.62 a share, from $591 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier, the company, based in Houston, said yesterday. Excluding the $933 million gain on the sale of KBR and a $49 million gain on the sale of an investment, the company earned 60 cents a share, up from 47 cents in the 2006 quarter. Revenue rose 20 percent, to $3.74 billion. Halliburtons growth in overseas business helped push earnings past expectations, said Dan Pickering, an analyst at Pickering Energy Partners in Houston. The company was expected to earn 56 cents a share excluding the gains, the average of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company has said the Eastern Hemisphere will contribute half of its revenues in the coming year, and the chief executive, David J. Lesar, moved to Dubai in May to head international operations.

The latest conviction in the cases related to the scheme came yesterday, when a former Houston-based executive for an air-freight carrier hired by KBR pleaded guilty in federal district court to dispensing bribes and then lying to federal investigators. The executive, Kevin Andre Smoot, 43, of The Woodlands, Tex., served as a managing director for Eagle Global Logistics Incorporated, a carrier that received a subcontract from KBR to ship the freight. The guilty plea by Mr. Smoot is the second by an Eagle executive in the case. But the papers describing his plea indicate that investigators believe at least one more Eagle employee and five KBR employees, all so far unnamed, were also involved. Mr. Smoot alone admitted to delivering bribes, called gratuities in the legalistic language of the court papers, to the employees of KBR on some 90 occasions between 2002 and 2005. At the core of the case is a contract that KBR, previously known as Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root, won before the war to supply the American military with food, fuel, housing and other necessities. The value of the contract soared with the Iraq invasion, and has so far paid KBR some $20 billion. The company hired Eagle in a subcontract to fulfill part of that mission, carrying military goods from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Baghdad. But the scheme by the Eagle executives began in November 2003 when a plane operated by a rival carrier, DHL, was struck by a missile and landed in Baghdad with its left wing in flames. The Eagle executives used that incident to charge a fraudulent “war-risk surcharge” of 50 cents for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of freight on its own flights, the papers say. Between November 2003 and July 2004, Eagle made 379 flights as part of the subcontract, charging some $13.3 million  an amount that included $1.1 million in overcharges. It is not clear whether KBR knew of the overcharging scheme, but the papers say that Mr. Smoot and an Eagle subordinate delivered nearly $34,000 in gratuities to KBR employees “to obtain or reward favorable treatment” in connection with the contract. According to the papers, the gratuities included “meals, drinks, golf outings, tickets to rodeo events, baseball and football games and other entertainment items.” A spokeswoman for KBR, Heather L. Browne, said in a statement yesterday that the company “in no way condones this behavior.” “We are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation of this matter and will continue to do so,” Ms. Browne said. The guilty plea by Mr. Smoot was announced yesterday by Rodger A.

It turns out that Al Gore is a die-hard fan, but when the series finale loomed in early June, he and his wife, Tipper, had to be on a plane for an appearance in Istanbul. So Mr. Gore, now better known as the star of An Inconvenient Truth than as the former vice president of the United States, called Brad Grey, the chairman of Paramount whose studio distributed his documentary, for a favor. Mr. Grey is also an executive producer of The Sopranos, from his previous incarnation as a Hollywood manager. Could Mr. Gore get an advance copy of the final episode, he wanted to know? No way, said Mr. Grey. Ive turned down everyone whos asked, he recalled telling Mr. Gore. That episode was the holy grail, and he couldnt risk it being leaked. But after a night of tossing and turning, Mr. Grey had a change of heart. On the Sunday of the finale, he had a Halliburton-made steel case, containing a copy of the episode, delivered to the tarmac where Mr. Gores plane sat in Chicago. The case was locked with a code (some might call it a lockbox). Mr. Gore could not open it until the plane was in the air, when he was instructed to call Mr. Greys office for the numeric code. Mr. Gore sent Mr. Grey a photo of himself trying to pry open the case, which Mr. Grey now keeps on his desk. And unlike that final episode, this story had a postscript. After the tale of Mr. Gores special delivery made the rounds of Hollywood political circles, the Republican candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani called Mr. Grey, a longtime friend, to complain.

The official, Sherry Williams, a Halliburton vice president and corporate secretary, said the company had consulted several law firms in 1995 after sanctions were imposed on Iran. Officials of the company, which recently announced it was moving its chief executive from Houston to Dubai and establishing a corporate headquarters there, determined that it was legal for independent foreign subsidiaries of United States companies to do business there, she said. “We have followed U.S. law,” she said. “We will continue to follow U.S. law.” Although the three Democratic senators on hand repeatedly suggested broader concerns than strict legality should have prompted the company to halt its business in Iran, Ms. Williams expressed no regret for the firm’s work there. From 1995 to 2000, Vice President Dick Cheney was Halliburton’s chairman; at the time he spoke out against sanctions on Iran. Halliburton announced recently that it had completed its outstanding contracts in Iran and was leaving the country, fulfilling a promise it made in 2005 to wrap up its work there. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat who has helped lead the investigation into the company’s work in Iran, said Halliburton effectively financed terrorism by doing business there. “Companies that help terrorist states generate revenues that are helping fund terrorist operations,” he said. “It’s that simple.” Senator Byron L. Dorgan, chairman of the Senate subcommittee that convened the hearing, was similarly blunt. “Was there any discussion about whether from a values standpoint doing business through a foreign subsidiary with a prohibited country like Iran was in fact helping the terrorists?” he asked Ms. Williams. Ms. Williams said she was “not a part of those discussions.” She cited an array of factors driving the decision to leave Iran, including the difficulty of working in the country and diminishing business there. Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said he was incredulous that the reasons did not include “anything to do with patriotism or anything to do with the values that I think our country holds dear.” In 2004, the Department of Justice began an investigation of the company’s work in Iran, which Ms. Williams said she believed was continuing. Federal law generally prohibits United States companies from doing business with countries, like Iran, that are on a State Department list as sponsors of terrorism. But a gap in the law when it comes to Iran allows foreign subsidiaries of American corporations to do business there as long as they operate independently. Halliburton’s work in Iran was carried out under the name of a subsidiary registered in the Cayman Islands with headquarters in Dubai: Halliburton Products and Services Limited. Mr. Lautenberg has introduced legislation to close the loophole for foreign subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Mr. Brown and Mr. Dorgan have introduced a bill to prohibit the awarding of government contracts to any company doing business with state sponsors of terrorism. The senators pressed Ms. Williams about whether Halliburton’s subsidiary in Iran was truly independent of the parent company, citing a “60 Minutes” report in 2004 that found the Cayman Islands address for the subsidiary was little more than a mail drop and that in Dubai it shared office space, phone and fax lines with a division of Halliburton. But Ms. Williams said the Cayman Islands registration was “perfectly appropriate under the law.” She noted that Halliburton itself was registered in Delaware, even though it has no offices there. As for the Dubai office, she said that work for the subsidiary actually took place at a different location. Even the telephone number for the subsidiary listed in the phone book “is actually incorrect,” she said. She described the address visited by “60 Minutes” as a “registration office” that the subsidiary used when it was changing its names at one point. But Mr. Lautenberg produced documents from an Iranian oil subsidiary that were addressed to the Halliburton subsidiary at the same address in Dubai, which he said cast doubt on her statements. William C. Thompson Jr., the New York City comptroller who runs several city pension funds that invest in Halliburton, has pressed vigorously in the past few years for the company and others to stop doing business in Iran. “Unfortunately, it’s become clear over a period of years that while things may be legal, it doesn’t mean that they are ethical,” he said at the hearing. “And I believe that unless you close the loophole, companies will continue to attempt to do business in backdoor fashions.” More Articles in Washington »WASHINGTON, April 30  A Halliburton executive, facing withering criticism from Democratic lawmakers during a Senate hearing on Monday about the company’s business dealings in Iran, insisted that the firm had not broken any laws.

Halliburton estimated first-quarter earnings, excluding items, of about 49 cents to 54 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had expected profit of 59 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company’s shares fell $1.90, or 6 percent, to $30.50.

Galvanized by the record profits at energy companies, this city, the center of the countrys energy industry, has shaken off the effects of the Enron implosion six years ago and is enjoying its strongest resurgence in more than 20 years, business officials and real estate developers say. Some energy companies are expanding and putting up new buildings. Others, like Citgo, Schlumberger and Halliburton, have moved their headquarters to Houston. Oil and natural gas companies have helped reduce office vacancy rates to 15 percent, a five-year low, according to Grubb &amp; Ellis, a real estate company. Job growth is double the national average  97,400 jobs were created in 2006. The National Association of Realtors says the housing market in Houston is one of the strongest in the country. The increase in the oil business has made Houston, said Randall Davis, a Houston condominium developer. It feels a touch like the 1980s  everyone is out, the restaurants are full, the bars are full.

In 2006, it handled 1.6 million 20-foot containers, up 29 percent from 2003. At the Texas Medical Center, hospitals and universities are investing billions in new facilities. Residential and mixed-use developments are going up downtown. The Houston economy has been growing since 2004, when energy companies started investing more in big-ticket projects and hiring thousands of employees to run them. Before that, oil companies had been hesitant to pour more into exploration and production, because they had lost millions in the past when oil and natural gas prices collapsed. There was always a real reluctance to buy into the commodity cycle, said Robert W. Gilmer, vice president and senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Those fears are long gone. Real estate investors, enticed by rising rents and occupancy rates, are returning. Over the last five years, sale prices for office buildings in Houston have climbed by 34 percent, to an average of $129 a square foot in 2006, according to Real Capital Analytics, a national research and consulting firm. Compared with other large cities nationwide, like Chicago and San Francisco, where prices average $191 and $338 a square foot, respectively, Houston is still a relative bargain. The office investment market has taken off, said Ariel Guerrero, Texas research and client services manager at Grubb &amp; Ellis in Houston. If you look at the price per pound, theres still value. Brookfield Properties, a New York-based real estate investment trust, seems to think so. Last October, Brookfield became the biggest landowner in downtown Houston when it joined with the Blackstone Group to buy Trizec Properties for $8.9 billion in cash and debt. The deal gave Brookfield eight buildings in Houston, for a total of 7.4 million square feet. Although the merger included properties nationwide, Richard B. Clark, the chief executive of Brookfield, said Houston was one of the deals attractions. (Almost a quarter of Brookfields portfolio is energy-related.) Chevron signed a lease shortly afterward for one of the buildings  the 1.2-million-square-foot tower that used to be Enrons headquarters  and plans to move in this year. The lease, Brookfield says, was the biggest in the country since 2000 and lowered the availability rate for Class A space downtown. In the fourth quarter, the rate dropped six percentage points, to 12 percent, according to Grubb &amp; Ellis. This confirms our belief its a strong market, Mr. Clark said. I think our timing is good, fundamentals are improving and tenants have confirmed that theyre growing. Brookfield is banking that Houston will grow even more. It is considering putting up a new office tower downtown, Mr. Clark said, but is holding off until the availability rate for Class A office space drops below 10 percent. He said he expected it to reach that point within a year. Encouraged, developers have started building again. In the fourth quarter, 2.4 million square feet of office space was under construction, more than double the amount in the third quarter. For the first time in years, developers are building without a signed tenant, though most projects are typically smaller than 500,000 square feet. Nowhere is the growth more apparent than in the citys Energy Corridor. Straddling Interstate 10 west of downtown, the area  home to companies like BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Citgo  has become one of the strongest real estate markets in the city. Occupancy rates are at 92 percent, the highest in the city, and rents average $19.26 a square foot, according to Grubb &amp; Ellis. When occupancy rates reached the mid-90-percent range and there were no blocks of space, we said, Hey, maybe its time to build,  said Aaron Thielhorn, a principal at Trammell Crow in Houston. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Real Estate »HOUSTON  The good times are back.

Occupancy rates are at 92 percent, the highest in the city, and rents average $19.26 a square foot, according to Grubb &amp; Ellis. When occupancy rates reached the mid-90-percent range and there were no blocks of space, we said, Hey, maybe its time to build,  said Aaron Thielhorn, a principal at Trammell Crow in Houston. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/business/13halliburton.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Halliburton Office Move Is Criticized<date>Published: March 13, 2007</date><text>HOUSTON, March 12  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and other leading Congressional Democrats sharply criticized Halliburton on Monday for relocating its chief executive to Dubai, suggesting it was possibly part of an effort to dodge American taxes and investigations. Skip to next paragraph Related Halliburton Moving C.E.O. From Houston to Dubai (March 12, 2007) Halliburton, an oil services company based here, said it would remain legally incorporated in the United States, and that the transfer of David J. Lesar, its chairman and chief executive, was merely a response to the growing business opportunities in the Middle East and nearby areas. But that did not stop many powerful Democrats from expressing skepticism about the motives behind the move, arguing that it may presage a wholesale move of Halliburton’s corporate headquarters out of the United States and not merely for business reasons. They vowed to hold hearings on the matter and jumped at the opportunity to link the move to Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the company from 1995 to 2000. They also sought to revive charges that the company mishandled, through its military contracting subsidiary, hundreds of millions of tax dollars in Iraq. “I think it’s disgraceful,” Senator Clinton, who is running for president, told a news conference in the Bronx, “that American companies are more than happy to try to get no-bid contracts, like Halliburton has, and then turn around and say, ‘But you know, we’re not going to stay with our chief executive officer, the president of our company, in the United States anymore.’ ” Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, added: “I want to know, is Halliburton trying to run away from bad publicity on their contracts?” Wall Street analysts said any tax implications of the move are unclear, especially since Halliburton will continue to have a large corporate office in Houston and will remain one of the leading oil services companies in North America. It also was not clear the extent to which Mr. Lesar would gain any personal tax benefits by moving to Dubai. Melissa Norcross, Halliburton’s manager of public relations, strongly disputed the charges of Congressional Democrats in an e-mail message. “These assumptions and suppositions are absolutely untrue and unfounded,” she wrote. “Halliburton is, and will remain, a U.S. corporation, incorporated in Delaware, with its principal executive office in Houston, Tex. As such we anticipate absolutely no tax benefits from this decision.” She stressed that while Mr. Lesar was moving to Dubai, “all other executive officers reside in Houston with no plans for relocating outside of the United States.” An aide to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that Mr. Waxman was “thinking about and likely” would hold hearings on the tax and investigative implications of the move. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, “This is a company that has been under unfavorable scrutiny and this will increase that fivefold, so why would they do it?” Mr. Schumer predicted that Congress would take a hard look at the move, adding: “What kind of tax or regulatory laws are they trying to circumvent? They didn’t just do this on a whim. They could easily focus more on the Middle East without doing this kind of change.” The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the company over allegations of improper dealings in Kuwait and Nigeria as well as Iraq. In her e-mail message, Ms. Norcross stressed that Halliburton’s work in support of government programs in the Middle East is being performed by its KBR unit, which is being spun off as a separate entity. “Halliburton will continue to be forthcoming with information regarding KBR’s 60-year history of work for the U.S. military,” she wrote. “Halliburton and KBR are complying with numerous requests for information and look forward to providing facts regarding KBR’s work as Congress fulfills their important oversight responsibilities.” Halliburton has been the Pentagon’s largest private contractor in Iraq and a lightning rod for criticism of the Bush administration’s failures in prosecuting the war. It has been subject to a variety of investigations over suspicions it mishandled billions of dollars in contracts to build bases, serve food and provide other support to the American presence since the invasion in 2003. The harshest criticism so far has come from Senator Clinton at her news conference. “Does this mean they’re going to quit paying taxes in America?” she asked. “Is this going to affect the investigations that are going on? Because we have a lot of evidence about their misuse of government contracts and how they have cheated the American soldier, cheated the American taxpayer. They have taken money and not provided the services.” Many Wall Street analysts and economists said Halliburton’s move, while unusual, made some sense from a business standpoint since most future energy drilling and construction activity would take place in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. “Expect more oil-related companies to do the same,” said A. F. Alhajji, an energy economist at Ohio Northern University in Ada, Ohio. “Dubai is the most dynamic, vibrant and globalized city in the world.” More Articles in Business »HOUSTON, March 12  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and other leading Congressional Democrats sharply criticized Halliburton on Monday for relocating its chief executive to Dubai, suggesting it was possibly part of an effort to dodge American taxes and investigations.

Related Press Release From Halliburton (halliburton.com) The company will maintain its existing corporate office here as well as its legal incorporation in the United States, meaning that it will still be subject to domestic laws and regulations. Although the announcement of the new Dubai arrangement took many by surprise, Halliburton said that the move was part of a strategy announced in mid-2006 to concentrate its efforts in the Middle East and surrounding areas, where state-owned oil companies represent a growing source of business. Halliburton, which was led by Vice President Dick Cheney from 1995 to 2000, is currently in the process of spinning off KBR, its military contracting unit, to focus on its business of drilling wells and maintaining fields for oil companies. The company did not say what implications the Dubai development might have for its military contracts. Lea Anne McBride, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, referred questions about the companys plans to Halliburton. The Dubai announcement, which Halliburton made at a regional energy conference in Bahrain, comes at a time when the company is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations of improper dealings in Iraq, Kuwait and Nigeria. Halliburton has also agreed to pay billions of dollars in settlements in asbestos litigation. Halliburton would not elaborate on Sunday on what the shift of its top executive might mean for some of the issues it faces. The move seemed to raise questions about whether Halliburton might gain tax advantages or other benefits. A Halliburton spokeswoman, Melissa Norcross, referred inquiries to the companys press release, saying in an e-mail message, The C.E.O.s job is global by nature. He will continue to remain attentive to our shareholders, clients and employees around the world. Ms. Norcross added, As companies usually refer to the C.E.O.s office as the corporate headquarters, thats what we are doing. Basing the C.E.O. in Dubai to focus on our Eastern Hemisphere growth makes good business sense, as it is the center of our Eastern Hemisphere operations and a global business hub. We will maintain our companys legal registration in the United States and we are not leaving Houston. The mayor of Houston, Bill White, was notified by telephone shortly before Halliburton made the announcement, according to a spokesman, Frank Michel. We dont expect it will have a big impact on employment here, Mr. Michel said. We point out that Houston continues to be the center for the international oil and gas business. Having a corporate headquarters is different than it used to be, Mr. Michel added. Executives spend a lot more time on airplanes, and we understand that. He noted that Schlumberger, one of Halliburtons top competitors, maintains offices in both Paris and Houston. On the face of it, the decision to move Mr. Lesar abroad appears to point mainly to how the epicenters of the energy business are moving from the mature fields of North America to the younger fields of the Middle East and Africa. It also underscores the arrival of Dubai as a center for energy deal-making and commerce, a role once solidly filled by Houston. My office will be in Dubai, and I will run our entire worldwide operations from that office, said Mr. Lesar, who holds the titles of chairman, chief executive and president, at a conference in Manama, Bahrains capital. The Eastern Hemisphere is a market that is more heavily weighted toward oil exploration and production opportunities. Growing our business here will bring more balance to Halliburtons overall portfolio. Halliburton is incorporated in Delaware and its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Reuters reported that Mr. Lesar said Halliburton would like to list its shares on an exchange in the Middle East, which it could do while maintaining its listing in New York. Halliburton reported a record $2.3 billion in profit last year and continues to be the dominant oil-field service company in North America, where it generates 60 percent of its operating income. Over the last several years, an increasing amount of Halliburtons business has shifted to places like Kuwait, Russia, Libya, Australia, Vietnam, and west and central Africa. And, mirroring trends in the energy business, its customer base is shifting from traditional Western oil companies to national oil companies in developing countries. Some analysts who follow Halliburton said they did not think the relocation of Mr. Lesar reflected anything more than changes in the energy business. They are moving to the center of the Eurasian-African hemisphere and thats where the bulk of the work is going to be in the future, said Barbara Struck, an analyst with Energy Intelligence Group, a research firm. She said she doubted the company was trying to evade laws in the United States. Halliburton has suffered several years of negative headlines, many having to do with its administration of a $16 billion deal to support American military operations in Iraq. Halliburtons KBR subsidiary has been the subject of a number of investigations for mishandling billions of dollars of housing, food and fuel contracts for American troops and government officials operating in Iraq. Halliburton began spinning off KBR last year. During Mr. Cheneys tenure as chief executive, Halliburton bought a company that saddled it with asbestos claims. The company has agreed to pay nearly $5 billion in settlements. Despite its recent problems, Halliburton posted record revenue, net income and margins last year. Perhaps the biggest winner could be Dubai itself, one of seven emirates in the United Arab Emirates confederation, which has sought to establish itself as a regional commercial center on par with Singapore and Hong Kong.

Skip to next paragraph The Reach of WarGo to Complete Coverage » Readers’ Opinions Forum: The Transition in Iraq The Army has said that its contracts with Halliburton, which has a five-year, $16 billion deal to support American military operations in Iraq, generally barred the company and its subcontractors from using private armed guards. But in a statement, Halliburton disagreed with the Armys interpretation and suggested that there was nothing to prohibit Halliburtons subcontractors from hiring such guards. The announcement came during a hearing of the House Government Oversight Committee that included emotional testimony about the killing of four Blackwater employees in Falluja, Iraq, in 2004. In an e-mail message made public in the hearing and written only hours before the four were killed, another Blackwater worker told the company to end the smoke and mirror show and provide its employees in the war zone with adequate weapons and armored vehicles. I need ammo, the worker, Tom Powell, said in an e-mail message dated March 30, 2004, to supervisors at Blackwater, which is based in North Carolina. I need Glocks and M4s  all the client body armor you got, he wrote. Guys are in the field with borrowed stuff and in harms way. Mr. Powell said he had requested heavily armored vehicles from the beginning, and from my understanding, an order is still pending. Why? I ask, he added. The next day, a mob in Falluja attacked a supply convoy that was being guarded by Blackwater employees and killed four guards, later stringing up two of the mutilated, charred bodies from a bridge. The men were riding in vehicles that were only lightly armored, and their families have claimed in a lawsuit against Blackwater that the company failed to provide basic protective equipment. Blackwaters general counsel, Andrew G. Howell, told the House panel on Wednesday that the company, which also had a State Department contract to provide security services, believed that it had had an appropriate number of armored vehicles in Iraq. He said, We have not skimped on equipment  no sir. The panel is investigating Blackwater and the work of other large American military contractors in Iraq. In the dispute with Halliburton, the Army insisted repeatedly to Congressional investigators last year that it could find no evidence that Blackwater had been hired by Halliburton and its subcontractors in Iraq for security. But in a letter dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, Army Secretary Francis J.

They said the five have been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey in a scheme that involved the theft of millions of dollars of Iraq reconstruction money and the awarding of contracts to Philip Bloom, who doled out the bribes. The officials said the agency in charge of Iraqi reconstruction lost more than $3.6 million because of the corruption scheme that began in December 2003 and lasted two years. Mr. Bloom, who has already pleaded guilty, received more than $8.6 million in rigged contracts, the officials said. They said more than $500,000 was smuggled into the United States. They stole the money in Iraq and then smuggled vast sums into the United States to support lavish lifestyles, said Mark W. Everson, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner. The 25-count indictment charged Col. Curtis Whiteford, Lt. Col. Debra Harrison and Lt. Col. Michael Wheeler, and two civilians, Michael Morris and William Driver. Colonel Whiteford was once the second-most senior official in the Coalition Provisional Authority for the South Central Region in Iraq, while Colonel Harrison was its acting comptroller. Colonel Wheeler was an adviser for Iraqi reconstruction projects. Mr. Driver is married to Colonel Harrison. Mr. Morris, who was living in Romania, was accused of helping Mr. Bloom funnel money to the military officials. More Articles in Washington »WASHINGTON, Feb. 7  The Army announced during a House oversight committee hearing on Wednesday that it would withhold $19.6 million from the Halliburton Company after recently discovering that the contractor had hired the company Blackwater USA to provide armed security guards in Iraq, a potential breach of its government contract. Skip to next paragraph The Reach of WarGo to Complete Coverage » Readers’ Opinions Forum: The Transition in Iraq The Army has said that its contracts with Halliburton, which has a five-year, $16 billion deal to support American military operations in Iraq, generally barred the company and its subcontractors from using private armed guards. But in a statement, Halliburton disagreed with the Armys interpretation and suggested that there was nothing to prohibit Halliburtons subcontractors from hiring such guards. The announcement came during a hearing of the House Government Oversight Committee that included emotional testimony about the killing of four Blackwater employees in Falluja, Iraq, in 2004. In an e-mail message made public in the hearing and written only hours before the four were killed, another Blackwater worker told the company to end the smoke and mirror show and provide its employees in the war zone with adequate weapons and armored vehicles. I need ammo, the worker, Tom Powell, said in an e-mail message dated March 30, 2004, to supervisors at Blackwater, which is based in North Carolina. I need Glocks and M4s  all the client body armor you got, he wrote. Guys are in the field with borrowed stuff and in harms way. Mr. Powell said he had requested heavily armored vehicles from the beginning, and from my understanding, an order is still pending. Why? I ask, he added. The next day, a mob in Falluja attacked a supply convoy that was being guarded by Blackwater employees and killed four guards, later stringing up two of the mutilated, charred bodies from a bridge. The men were riding in vehicles that were only lightly armored, and their families have claimed in a lawsuit against Blackwater that the company failed to provide basic protective equipment. Blackwaters general counsel, Andrew G. Howell, told the House panel on Wednesday that the company, which also had a State Department contract to provide security services, believed that it had had an appropriate number of armored vehicles in Iraq. He said, We have not skimped on equipment  no sir. The panel is investigating Blackwater and the work of other large American military contractors in Iraq. In the dispute with Halliburton, the Army insisted repeatedly to Congressional investigators last year that it could find no evidence that Blackwater had been hired by Halliburton and its subcontractors in Iraq for security. But in a letter dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey said that additional investigation showed that Blackwater had provided private security guards for a Halliburton subcontractor, ESS Support Services, a construction and food services business, and that the costs were not itemized in the contracts or invoices prepared by ESS. The Army is continuing to investigate this matter and we are committed to providing full disclosures of the results of our investigations to the committee, he wrote to the chairman of the oversight committee, Henry A.

This highly lucrative world quietly ballooned by 86 percent -- to $377 billion annually -- during the first five years of the Bush administration, according to Congressional estimates. Outsourced spending, on Iraq, Katrina and other bonanzas, has grown twice as fast as other discretionary spending, according to Representative Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the oversight and reform committee. Mr. Waxman is fairly itching to finally map the waste, fraud and abuse in private contracting that went largely ignored by the previous Republican Congress. Taxpayers should wish him well. In a preliminary glimpse, 118 contracts worth $745 billion were found by government auditors to be rife with questionable award procedures, mismanagement, overcharging and skimpy to nonexistent oversight. Full inquiries and public hearings are vital if the rich and shadowy world of privatization is ever to be plumbed for the scandal it is nurturing. Taxpayers have only a vague notion of what's gone on, mainly through reporting on the fantastic good fortune of Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney's former company, whose contracts increased a whopping 600 percent across five years as the Iraq war costs cascaded. Not incidentally, privatization has been a cash cow in stirring campaign donations from successful contractors. According to one recent audit reported in The Washington Post, among 49 privatized contracts, three out of five were awarded noncompetitively, lacked oversight, and raised questions of legality. What's been going on out there? This question cries out for an answer from the new Congress.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/world/africa/13algeria.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Qaeda-Linked Group Claims Algerian Attack<date>Published: December 13, 2006</date><text>PARIS, Dec. 12  The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, an Al Qaeda-linked terrorist organization in Algeria that grew out of the country’s bloody civil war, claimed responsibility for the attack on Sunday on employees of a Halliburton affiliate near the capital, Algiers. The bomb attack killed an Algerian driver in a convoy transporting the workers, nine of whom were wounded, including four Britons and one American. It was the first attack on Westerners in the country since the group kidnapped 32 European tourists near the Libyan border in 2003. One tourist died and the others were released for a large ransom. In a communiqué posted Tuesday on the Internet, the group, known by its French initials, G.S.P.C., said its “holy warriors” had carried out the attack near the wealthy suburb of Bouchaoui, west of Algiers. The attack followed several warnings by the group that it would single out American interests in the region. The Halliburton affiliate, Brown &amp; Root-Condor, is a joint venture between a Halliburton subsidiary, KBR, and the Algerian state-owned oil company, Sonatrach. It is involved in several projects in Algeria, including the enlargement of military air bases near the southern desert town of Tamanrasset and near the northeastern town of Bou Saada. The United States military is working with the countries of the Sahel region, the impoverished southern fringe of the Sahara, to shore up border controls and deny sanctuary to suspected terrorists. The enlarged bases will be available for use by the American military in the event of operations in North Africa, American military and Algerian officials have said. G.S.P.C., which is believed to have between 500 and 600 fighters, splintered in 1998 from the Armed Islamic Group, or G.I.A., which fought a brutal decadelong civil war after the Algerian military canceled parliamentary elections in early 1992, when it was clear that an Islamist party would win. That party has been banned from participating in politics since then. In forming the G.S.P.C., its leaders had intended to refocus attacks on the Algerian military after the unwieldy and decentralized G.I.A. became embroiled in a terrorist campaign against civilians that included cutting the throats of women and children. But the splinter group has become increasingly radical as its leadership has changed. In 2003, the G.S.P.C. leader, Nabil Sahrouai, issued a statement aligning the group with “Osama bin Laden’s jihad against the heretic America.” In a video released in September, Mr. bin Laden’s second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, said Al Qaeda had joined forces with the Algerian group to “crush the pillars of the crusader alliance.” Despite the Algerian government’s successive offers of amnesty, which have drawn in most of the country’s former Islamist fighters, the group has remained active, particularly in the mountainous Berber region of Kabylia, east of Algiers, and along the country’s unmarked border with Mali. Algerians have become accustomed to periodic ambushes against the country’s military patrols. Just last month, seven members of Algeria’s security forces were killed and 13 wounded in skirmishes east of the capital. But the group’s attacks have spread south as well. In June 2005, the fighters took credit for a deadly raid against a Mauritanian military camp, killing 15 Mauritanian soldiers. European counterterrorism officials say the group has trained fighters in the Sahara and sent many to Iraq and Chechnya. The group is fighting for an Islamic state ruled by Shariah law in Algeria and eventually across North Africa. But there is increasing concern that its attacks could spread to Europe. In September, France’s counterterrorism force issued a statement calling the group “one of the most serious threats” currently facing the country. After Mr. Zawahri endorsed the group and mentioned France as a target for attacks, the French prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, said the country faced a “real and permanent” threat. G.S.P.C. links have been found elsewhere in Europe. Last month, the Italian police arrested three members of an Islamist cell that authorities said had provided millions of dollars to the group. Sunday’s attack came as a convoy carrying the Brown &amp; Root-Condor employees returned to the Sheraton Hotel in Bouchaoui, where they live. A bomb destroyed a security vehicle at the head of the convoy, killing its driver, while the attackers opened fire on a bus that was following with the employees. While Algeria has sought to convince the world that its civil war is over, even those Islamists who have accepted the offers of amnesty warn that the fighting will continue until they are allowed to participate again in the political process. “When you leave a small fire burning, it can spread,” the G.I.A. founder, Abdelhak Layada, said during an interview in June. Hassan Hattab and Moktar ben Moktar, both G.S.P.C. leaders, were once fighters under his command.

The military said the Marine Corps CH-46 Sea Knight troop transport helicopter, with 16 people aboard, was flying over Lake Qadisiya, near Haditha, on Sunday when it began to experience mechanical difficulties. The pilots lowered the twin-rotor aircraft in a controlled maneuver and guided it to the waters edge, according to Lt. Col. Josslyn L. Aberle, a military spokeswoman in Baghdad. The mechanical failures were not caused by an enemy attack, officials said. In the minutes after the accident, 12 of the people on board were accounted for, and the body of one marine was recovered from the water. The bodies of the three other victims were recovered in the lake on Monday during an intensive search that included air, amphibious and diving teams, officials said. Citing a continuing investigation, military officials declined to explain how the victims ended up in the water. Sunni Arab officials said Monday that a bombing of a Sunni Arab mosque in the northern Baghdad neighborhood of Hurriya on Sunday had shattered its blue dome. The building, the Nidaa Allah Mosque, was empty during the afternoon attack, and the explosion caused no casualties, according to a local cleric, Said Ahmed Mohammad. For several months, Shiite death squads have been waging a bloody campaign of violence and intimidation in Hurriya to drive Sunnis from the mixed neighborhood, Sunni officials say. The Nidaa Allah Mosque was one of four Sunni mosques in Hurriya that came under attack during a wave of reprisals by Shiite gunmen after a series of car bombings on Nov. 23 killed more than 200 people in Sadr City. According to Mr. Mohammad, the mosques imam and his family abandoned the mosque on Nov. 25 and it had sat empty since then. In a photograph of the sandstone-colored mosque taken Sunday and distributed by the American military, only a jagged fragment of the dome remained, like a broken eggshell, pocked with holes from automatic gunfire. In Falluja, two civilians were killed and two wounded when a gun battle erupted Monday between Sunni insurgents and an American military patrol in the Nazal district of the city, a local police official said. A bomb exploded Monday in the southern Baghdad neighborhood of Dora, killing a child and wounding two civilians, an Interior Ministry official said, and at least 52 bodies were found dumped around the capital. In Rock Island, Ill., the director of operations for a Saudi company that operates dining facilities for American troops in Iraq and Kuwait was sentenced Friday in the Federal District Court for the Central District of Illinois to 51 months in prison for his involvement in a kickback scheme, according to a news release issued by a federal prosecutors office there. In the scheme, Mohammad Shabbir Khan, operations director of the Tamimi Global Company, paid kickbacks to an employee of Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Services to secure two dining subcontracts valued at $21.8 million, the statement said. A United States district judge also ordered Mr. Khan to pay a fine of $10,000 and restitution to the United States government of $133,860, the amount he paid the Kellogg Brown &amp; Root employee, the statement said. The judge also sentenced the former Kellogg Brown &amp; Root employee, Stephen Lowell Seamans, to 12 months in prison for his role in the scheme, the statement said. Mr. Seamans was also ordered to pay restitution of $380,130 for that and another kickback scheme, according to the statement. Qais Mizher contributed reporting.

What if there are two separate investigations? Or three?Next week, we will get an answer to an even more daunting question. Can KBR Inc., as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root is now known, raise half a billion dollars from investors even though four Justice Department investigations are pending, as well as an inquiry by the British government? KBR is now a subsidiary of Halliburton, the oil services giant. In recent years, it has lost money on most of its operations, but has made that up with profit from its work for the American and British governments in the Middle East, mostly in Iraq. One of the criminal investigations stems from KBR’s Iraq contracts, with a grand jury looking into issues of fraud in purchasing supplies for the government. Another inquiry is investigating possible overcharges for work that KBR did for the United States in the Balkans from 1996 to 2000. If this deal were being sold by a real estate agent, the ad might read “motivated seller.” Rarely has any major company been clearer about its desire to be free of a subsidiary. Whether or not the offering finds buyers, Halliburton plans to distribute its remaining shares in KBR to Halliburton shareholders. Why the desire to get out? David Lesar, Halliburton’s chief executive, called KBR a drag on the parent company’s profits. But reading the prospectus raises at least two other possible explanations. One is liability concerns. The other is more psychological. The legal problems that could be most important serve as a reminder of a deal gone awry. That deal was Halliburton’s $7.7 billion 1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries. Engineered by Dick Cheney, then Halliburton’s chief executive, the merger accomplished a major strategic goal, making Halliburton the world’s largest provider of oil field services. But Halliburton’s due diligence failed to either uncover or appreciate the importance of some significant issues. There were asbestos liabilities, which ended up forcing some Halliburton units into bankruptcy and cost the parent company billions. Halliburton also failed to notice what it now says may have been illegal behavior overseas at Kellogg, a Dresser subsidiary that is now part of KBR. It says that there appears to have been bribery of Nigerian officials for years in connection with contracts there and that similar behavior may have occurred elsewhere. The Justice Department is investigating possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act, and Britain has a similar inquiry. While looking into those charges itself, Halliburton found evidence that Kellogg “may have engaged in coordinated bidding with one or more competitors on certain foreign construction projects, and that such coordination possibly began as early as the mid-1980’s,” KBR says in its prospectus. That is the subject of the final federal investigation, and of some foreign inquiries as well. Halliburton began unloading parts of Dresser soon after Mr. Cheney became the vice president of the United States in 2001, and while some Dresser operations have been integrated into Halliburton, the disposal of KBR would remove a major reminder of that deal. That it will have taken more than eight years is a reminder of how long an ordeal can result from a big decision made with poor information. It also may save Halliburton a lot of money. If there are to be antitrust penalties, they will be KBR’s sole responsibility. “We may,” warns the prospectus, “not have the liquidity or funds to address those losses.” All this makes it appear that the underwriters will have earned their fees if they can sell shares in the range of $15 to $17 that the company is seeking. That is well above the $10.70 that Halliburton estimates it paid for its shares. The underwriters may hope that investors will focus more on hopes for profits from liquefied natural gas facilities, an area in which KBR is a leader, and less on historic figures. KBR’s business in Iraq, while it has produced a criminal inquiry, has been profitable, in part because the government has given the company high marks that entitle it to additional payments. “We have been awarded 58 ‘excellent’ ratings out of 70 total ratings,” KBR states. This week’s elections, which left Democrats with the power to lead Congressional investigations, could create more headlines and headaches for KBR. But if all the existing investigations do not worry investors, why should a few more be of any concern?</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/07/world/middleeast/07contracts.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Cost of Taking Fuel to Iraq Is Questioned in New Audit<date>Published: November 7, 2006</date><text>A Halliburton subsidiary charged the Iraqi government as much as $25,000 per month for each of as many as 1,800 fuel trucks that were to deliver gasoline to Iraq after the 2003 invasion, but the trucks often spent days or weeks sitting idle on the border, says a report released yesterday by an auditing agency sponsored by the United Nations. The agency said in a statement that the auditing firm it hired had found that some of the contract costs that had been questioned earlier seemed to be justified. But the agency said the findings raised new questions about hundreds of millions of dollars billed by the company under a $2.4 billion contract that the Army awarded on the eve of the conflict to KBR, the Halliburton subsidiary formerly known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root. The new audit gives the first detailed picture of how the company incurred many of those costs. The audit said the Kuwaiti government had set the price of its gasoline at $1.13 a gallon. But with the delivery charges, the effective cost of the gas was calculated to be much higher, about $8 a gallon, according to a participant in a meeting in Paris last week at which the audits were presented to the auditing agency and the Iraqi government. Questions have been raised about the contract since 2003, when it first became public that the contract had been awarded without competitive bidding. Pentagon auditors challenged more than $200 million of KBRs charges under the contract as potentially excessive or unjustified, and the agency designated by the United Nations to oversee Iraqs vast oil revenues later recommended that the United States might have to repay some or all of that money to Iraq. The Army later decided that most of those costs were justified by the peculiar nature of the contract and the wartime conditions in which the company was operating and decided to reimburse KBR for them. The new audit, commissioned by the oversight agency, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board of the Development Fund for Iraq, contains a mixed message for KBR and the American officials who administered its contracts in Iraq. The audit firm, Crowe Chizek, based in Chicago, agreed that in the wartime conditions of Iraq, the Army was justified in reimbursing KBR for the original $200 million in disputed costs. But the monitoring board said Crowes detailed findings on how KBR came up with $1.4 billion in charges on the contract between May 2003 and March 2004 raised new questions on hundreds of millions of dollars more. In the chaos after the invasion, the contract was divided into various work orders that called for services like fuel deliveries and the repair of Iraqi oil infrastructure. The audit found, for example, that in an $871 million work order for delivering fuel to Iraq, just $112 million was actually spent on the fuel itself  gasoline, kerosene and liquid petroleum gas. But $694 million was paid to a Kuwaiti subcontractor, primarily for fuel transportation, the audit says. The audit lays out a prime reason for those costs. KBR leased a fleet of tanker trucks from a well-connected Kuwaiti company, Altanmia, at a cost of up to $25,575 a month for each truck irrespective of the number of deliveries to Iraq, the audit says. Because of deteriorating security in Iraq  and apparently because of severe limits on the number of armed escorts the Army could provide  KBR was able to run only two fuel convoy runs per month from Kuwait to Iraq and back, the audit says. That meant that from 200 to 1,800 trucks racked up charges as they sat idle for long stretches on the border. The audits were posted Monday on the agencys Web site with no formal announcement. KBR and the agency seem to come to diametrically opposite conclusions on the significance of the audit. Melissa Norcross, a Halliburton spokeswoman, said in a statement that the findings showed that KBR faced the challenge and fulfilled this mission at a fair and reasonable cost, since Crowe concluded that the Armys decision to reimburse much of the originally disputed $200 million was justified under the circumstances. These latest findings by an independent auditing firm provide additional validation of what KBR has said all along, Ms. Norcross said. Ms. Norcross declined to respond to questions about whether the company agreed with Crowes detailed findings on the contract for leasing the tanker trucks. But those sections of the reports were clearly front and center for the monitoring agency, which pointed out in its own statement that transportation costs were very high, in some cases as much as 86 percent of the total contract costs. The monitoring board said those findings caused it to question the reasonableness of these costs and the adequacy of the administration of contracts. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in International »A Halliburton subsidiary charged the Iraqi government as much as $25,000 per month for each of as many as 1,800 fuel trucks that were to deliver gasoline to Iraq after the 2003 invasion, but the trucks often spent days or weeks sitting idle on the border, says a report released yesterday by an auditing agency sponsored by the United Nations.

Its mission — to rebuild power, water and sewage plants — wasn’t accomplished: Baghdad received less than six hours a day of electricity last month, and much of Iraq’s population lives with untreated sewage and without clean water. But Bechtel, having received $2.3 billion of taxpayers’ money and having lost the lives of 52 employees, has come to the end of its last government contract.As Bechtel goes, so goes the whole reconstruction effort. Whatever our leaders may say about their determination to stay the course complete the mission, when it comes to rebuilding Iraq they’ve already cut and run. The $21 billion allocated for reconstruction over the last three years has been spent, much of it on security rather than its intended purpose, and there’s no more money in the pipeline. The failure of reconstruction in Iraq raises three questions. First, how much did that failure contribute to the overall failure of the war? Second, how was it that America, the great can-do nation, in this case couldn’t and didn’t? Finally, if we’ve given up on rebuilding Iraq, what are our troops dying for? There’s no definitive way to answer the first question. You can make a good case that the invasion of Iraq was doomed no matter what, because we never had enough military manpower to provide security. But the lack of electricity and clean water did a lot to dissipate any initial good will the Iraqis may have felt toward the occupation. And Iraqis are well aware that the billions squandered by American contractors included a lot of Iraqi oil revenue as well as U.S. taxpayers’ dollars. Consider the symbolism of Iraq’s new police academy, which Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, has called “the most essential civil security project in the country.” It was built at a cost of $75 million by Parsons Corporation, which received a total of about $1 billion for Iraq reconstruction projects. But the academy was so badly built that feces and urine leak from the ceilings in the student barracks. Think about it. We want the Iraqis to stand up so we can stand down. But if they do stand up, we’ll dump excrement on their heads. As for how this could have happened, that’s easy: major contractors believed, correctly, that their political connections insulated them from accountability. Halliburton and other companies with huge Iraq contracts were basically in the same position as Donald Rumsfeld: they were so closely identified with President Bush and, especially, Vice President Cheney that firing or even disciplining them would have been seen as an admission of personal failure on the part of top elected officials. As a result, the administration and its allies in Congress fought accountability all the way. Administration officials have made repeated backdoor efforts to close the office of Mr. Bowen, whose job is to oversee the use of reconstruction money. Just this past May, with the failed reconstruction already winding down, the White House arranged for the last $1.5 billion of reconstruction money to be placed outside Mr. Bowen’s jurisdiction. And now, finally, Congress has passed a bill whose provisions include the complete elimination of his agency next October. The bottom line is that those charged with rebuilding Iraq had no incentive to do the job right, so they didn’t. You can see, by the way, why a Democratic takeover of the House, if it happens next week, would be such a pivotal event: suddenly, committee chairmen with subpoena power would be in a position to investigate where all the Iraq money went. But that’s all in the past. What about the future? Back in June, after a photo-op trip to Iraq, Mr. Bush said something I agree with. “You can measure progress in megawatts of electricity delivered,” he declared. “You can measure progress in terms of oil sold on the market on behalf of the Iraqi people.” But what those measures actually show is the absence of progress. By any material measure, Iraqis are worse off than they were under Saddam. And we’re not planning to do anything about it: the U.S.-led reconstruction effort in Iraq is basically over. I don’t know whether the administration is afraid to ask U.S. voters for more money, or simply considers the situation hopeless. Either way, the United States has accepted defeat on reconstruction. Yet Americans are still fighting and dying in Iraq.

And tucked away in a huge military authorization bill that President Bush signed two weeks ago is what some of Mr. Bowens supporters believe is his reward for repeatedly embarrassing the administration: a pink slip. The order comes in the form of an obscure provision that terminates his federal oversight agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, on Oct. 1, 2007. The clause was inserted by the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee over the objections of Democratic counterparts during a closed-door conference, and it has generated surprise and some outrage among lawmakers who say they had no idea it was in the final legislation. Mr. Bowens office, which began operation in January 2004 to examine reconstruction money spent in Iraq, was always envisioned as a temporary organization, permitted to continue its work only as long as Congress saw fit. Some advocates for the office, in fact, have regarded its lack of a permanent bureaucracy as the key to its aggressiveness and independence. But as the implications of the provision in the new bill have become clear, opposition has been building on both sides of the political aisle. One point of contention is exactly when the office would have naturally run its course without a hard end date. The bipartisan opposition may not be unexpected given Mr. Bowens Republican credentials  he served under George W. Bush both in Texas and in the White House  and deep public skepticism on the Bush administrations conduct of the war. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who followed the bill closely as chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, says that she still does not know how the provision made its way into what is called the conference report, which reconciles differences between House and Senate versions of a bill. Neither the House nor the Senate version contained such a termination clause before the conference, all involved agree. Its truly a mystery to me, Ms. Collins said. I looked at what I thought was the final version of the conference report and that provision was not in at that time. The one thing I can confirm is that this was a last-minute insertion, she said. A Republican spokesman for the committee, Josh Holly, said lawmakers should not have been surprised by the provision closing the inspector generals office because it was discussed very early in the conference process. But like several other members of the House and Senate who were contacted on the bill, Ms. Collins said that she feared the loss of oversight that could occur if the inspector generals office went out of business, adding that she was already working on legislation with several Democratic and Republican senators to reverse the termination. One of those, John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Bowen was making a valuable contribution to the Congressional and public understanding of this very complex and ever-changing situation in Iraq. Given that his office has performed important work and that much remains to be done, Mr. Warner added, I intend to join Senator Collins in consulting with our colleagues to extend his charter. While Senators Collins and Warner said they had nothing more than hunches on where the impetus for setting a termination date had originated, Congressional Democrats were less reserved. It appears to me that the administration wants to silence the messenger that is giving us information about waste and fraud in Iraq, said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government Reform. I just cant see how one can look at this change without believing its political, he said. The termination language was inserted into the bill by Congressional staff members working for Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and who declared on Monday that he plans to run for president in 2008. Mr. Holly, who is the House Armed Services spokesman as well as a member of Mr. Hunters staff, said that politics played no role and that there had been no direction from the administration or lobbying from the companies whose work in Iraq Mr. Bowens office has severely critiqued. Three of the companies that have been a particular focus of Mr. Bowens investigations, Halliburton, Parsons and Bechtel, said that they had made no effort to lobby against his office. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in International »Investigations led by a Republican lawyer named Stuart W.

Skip to next paragraph The Reach of War Go to Complete Coverage » Related Fighting Split, U.S. and Iraq Renew Vow to Work for Peace (October 28, 2006) Readers’ Opinions Forum: The Transition in Iraq The contracts awarded to the company, KBR, formerly named Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, are for housing, food, fuel and other necessities for American troops and government officials in Iraq, and for restoring that countrys crucial oil infrastructure. The contracts total about $20 billion. The oversight agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, said KBR had refused to disclose information as basic as how many people are fed each day in its dining facilities and how many gallons of fuel are delivered to foreign embassies in Iraq, claiming that the data was proprietary, meaning it would unfairly help its business competitors. Although KBR has been subjected to a growing number of specific investigations and paid substantial penalties, this is the first time the federal government has weighed in and accused it of systematically engaging in a practice aimed at veiling its business practices in Iraq. The allegations come at a critical time for the company, as Halliburton is trying to spin off the subsidiary. And in July, the Army announced that it would terminate KBRs largest contract with the government, and the company says that it will compete to regain some of that business when the government calls for new bids. Proprietary information is protected by the so-called federal acquisition regulations, known as FAR. But the agency said KBR routinely stamped nearly all of the data it collects on its work as proprietary, impeding not only the investigations into the companys activities but also things as simple as managerial oversight of the work. The use of proprietary data markings on reports and information submitted by KBR to the government is an abuse of the FAR and the procurement system, says a memo released yesterday by the special inspector general. As a result, the memo said, KBR is not protecting its own data, but is in many instances inappropriately restricting the governments use of information that KBR is required to gather for the government. The specific examples cited by the inspector general are taken from an $18 billion contract called the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, informally known as Logcap, under which KBR provides food, fuel, housing, recreational facilities and laundry and other services to American troops, government officials and other contractors in Iraq. A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Cathy Mann, did not dispute the companys extensive use of the proprietary label but said, KBR has included proprietary markings on the majority of its data and property in support of its government contracts for the U.S. Army for at least the last decade. That assertion could not immediately be confirmed with the Army. But in its memo, the inspector generals office said that during the course of its investigation, both Pentagon auditors and Army contracting officers had shared serious concerns about the practice. And a statement released late yesterday by the Army Sustainment Command in Rock Island, Ill., said that it had implemented corrective actions relative to the concerns raised in the memo. Ms. Mann added that KBR believed that the use of proprietary markings in work for the United States government is not only encouraged, but required by federal laws restricting the disclosure of American trade secrets abroad. With the release of the new memo, that argument is unlikely to gain much traction with members of Congress, federal investigators and the numerous critics who have been calling for access to information on KBRs work in Iraq almost since the invasion ended. The arrogance is astounding on the part of KBR, said William L. Nash, a retired Army major general who is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an expert on postconflict zones. Its time for Congress to step in, because this has just gone too far. Reaction to the memo on Capitol Hill also revealed that the issue of KBRs performance and investigations of its work are increasingly causing concern on both sides of the political aisle. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in International »A Halliburton subsidiary that has been subjected to numerous investigations for billions of dollars in contracts it received for work in Iraq has systematically misused federal rules to withhold basic information on its practices from American officials, a federal oversight agency said yesterday. Skip to next paragraph The Reach of War Go to Complete Coverage » Related Fighting Split, U.S. and Iraq Renew Vow to Work for Peace (October 28, 2006) Readers’ Opinions Forum: The Transition in Iraq The contracts awarded to the company, KBR, formerly named Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, are for housing, food, fuel and other necessities for American troops and government officials in Iraq, and for restoring that countrys crucial oil infrastructure. The contracts total about $20 billion. The oversight agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, said KBR had refused to disclose information as basic as how many people are fed each day in its dining facilities and how many gallons of fuel are delivered to foreign embassies in Iraq, claiming that the data was proprietary, meaning it would unfairly help its business competitors. Although KBR has been subjected to a growing number of specific investigations and paid substantial penalties, this is the first time the federal government has weighed in and accused it of systematically engaging in a practice aimed at veiling its business practices in Iraq. The allegations come at a critical time for the company, as Halliburton is trying to spin off the subsidiary. And in July, the Army announced that it would terminate KBRs largest contract with the government, and the company says that it will compete to regain some of that business when the government calls for new bids. Proprietary information is protected by the so-called federal acquisition regulations, known as FAR. But the agency said KBR routinely stamped nearly all of the data it collects on its work as proprietary, impeding not only the investigations into the companys activities but also things as simple as managerial oversight of the work. The use of proprietary data markings on reports and information submitted by KBR to the government is an abuse of the FAR and the procurement system, says a memo released yesterday by the special inspector general. As a result, the memo said, KBR is not protecting its own data, but is in many instances inappropriately restricting the governments use of information that KBR is required to gather for the government. The specific examples cited by the inspector general are taken from an $18 billion contract called the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, informally known as Logcap, under which KBR provides food, fuel, housing, recreational facilities and laundry and other services to American troops, government officials and other contractors in Iraq. A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Cathy Mann, did not dispute the companys extensive use of the proprietary label but said, KBR has included proprietary markings on the majority of its data and property in support of its government contracts for the U.S. Army for at least the last decade. That assertion could not immediately be confirmed with the Army.

Skip to next paragraph Reach of WarGo to Complete Coverage » Multimedia Graphic Where the Money Went Readers’ Opinions Forum: The Transition in Iraq The report provided the first official estimate that, in some cases, more money was being spent on housing and feeding employees, completing paperwork and providing security than on actual construction. Those overhead costs have ranged from under 20 percent to as much as 55 percent of the budgets, according to the report, by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. On similar projects in the United States, those costs generally run to a few percent. The highest proportion of overhead was incurred in oil-facility contracts won by KBR Inc., the Halliburton subsidiary formerly known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, which has frequently been challenged by critics in Congress and elsewhere. The actual costs for many projects could be even higher than the estimates, the report said, because the United States has not properly tracked how much such expenses have taken from the $18.4 billion of taxpayer-financed reconstruction approved by Congress two years ago. The report said the prime reason was not the need to provide security, though those costs have clearly risen in the perilous environment, and are a burden that both contractors and American officials routinely blame for such increases. Instead, the inspector general pointed to a simple bureaucratic flaw: the United States ordered the contractors and their equipment to Iraq and then let them sit idle for months at a time. The delay between “mobilization,” or assembling the teams in Iraq, and the start of actual construction was as long as nine months. “The government blew the whistle for these guys to go to Iraq and the meter ran,” said Jim Mitchell, a spokesman for the inspector general’s office. “The government was billed for sometimes nine months before work began.” The findings are similar to those of a growing list of inspections, audits and investigations that have concluded that the program to rebuild Iraq has often fallen short for the most mundane of reasons: poorly written contracts, ineffective or nonexistent oversight, needless project delays and egregiously poor construction practices. “This report is the latest chapter in a long, sad and expensive tale about how contracting in Iraq was more about shoveling money out the door than actually getting real results on the ground,” said Stephen Ellis, a vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense in Washington. “These contracts were to design and build important items for oil infrastructure, hospitals and education, but in some cases more than half of the money padded corporate coffers instead,” he said. Although the federal report places much of the burden for the charges squarely on the shoulders of United States officials in Baghdad, the findings varied widely over a sampling of contracts examined by auditors, from a low of under 20 percent for some companies to a high of over 55 percent. One oil contract awarded to a joint venture between Parsons, an American company, and Worley, from Australia, had overhead costs of at least 43 percent, the report found. One contract held by Parsons alone to build hospitals and prisons had overhead of at least 35 percent; in another, it was 17 percent. The lowest figure was found for certain contracts won by Lucent, at 11 percent, but the report indicates that substantial portions of the overhead in those cases could not be determined. The report did not explain why KBR’s overhead costs on those contracts  the contracts totaled about $296 million  were more than 10 percent higher than those at the other companies audited. Despite past criticism of KBR, the Army, which administers those contracts, has generally agreed to pay most of the costs claimed by the company. Melissa Norcross, a spokeswoman for KBR, said in a written reply to questions, “It is important to note that the special inspector general is not challenging any of KBR’s costs referenced in this report.” “All of these costs were incurred at the client’s direction and for the client’s benefit,” she said, referring to the Army Corps of Engineers, which is in charge of the oil contract. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in International »Overhead costs have consumed more than half the budget of some reconstruction projects in Iraq, according to a government estimate released yesterday, leaving far less money than expected to provide the oil, water and electricity needed to improve the lives of Iraqis.

Delays and cost overruns led to its cancellation. Whether because the political stakes in Iraq have risen with the approach of the November elections, or simply because of the scope of the problems, Mr. Bowens testimony set off outrage on both sides of the political aisle on a topic  reconstruction failures  that previously was mostly in the sights of Congressional Democrats. So when they get the construction right, something else goes wrong? said Representative John M. McHugh, Republican of New York, referring to cost and schedule problems that had plagued many projects. Wow  thank you, Mr. McHugh said, seemingly speechless for a moment after Mr. Bowen answered in the affirmative. Work by two of the other largest contractors in Iraq  Bechtel and KBR, which was formerly known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root and is a subsidiary of Halliburton  also came in for severe criticism during the lengthy hearing. The problems with Iraq reconstruction have become notorious enough that protesters engulfed Cliff Mumm, president of the Bechtel infrastructure division, as he emerged onto the street and tried to hail a taxi after his testimony before the House Government Reform Committee. Eviction notice for Bechtel and its subsidiaries! a protester shouted through a megaphone.

Before his testimony, Mr. Bowen made available copies of an inspection report on one of the 13 substandard projects, a $72 million police college in Baghdad where plumbing work was so poor that the pipes burst, dumping urine and fecal matter throughout the colleges buildings. The Washington Post reported on some of those problems on Thursday. Earnest O. Robbins II, a Parsons vice president, struggled to explain how tests could have missed such fundamental problems, in which the pipes were often not joined by proper fixtures but simply set end to end and fastened with concrete. How could the tests not reveal these massive, massive problems? asked Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland. I have some conjectures and thats all it would be, Mr. Robbins said, and that is, it took a while of use for this to manifest itself, for the fittings to come loose or whatever. The industry witnesses also fired back at their Congressional questioners, pointing out that their work generally met with the approval of government entities that were supposed to be overseeing the work. Mr. Mumm, of Bechtel, brought a hush to the room when he listed 24 Iraqi employees on the hospital project who had been killed by local militias or insurgents, greatly slowing the work. The Iraqi site manager was murdered, the site engineers daughter was kidnapped and they summarily marched out our mechanical contractor and murdered 12 of them, Mr. Mumm said. Democrats spent much of the day connecting the reconstruction effort, which has cost an estimated $30 billion to $45 billion in Iraqi and American financing, to the wider effort in Iraq. This debacle is not just a waste of taxpayers funds, and it doesnt just impact the reconstruction, Representative Henry A.

The allegations now form the basis of a lawsuit that families of the dead, along with several truckers wounded in the same incident, have brought against the subsidiary, KBR, formerly known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root. While an array of lawsuits, criminal investigations and Congressional inquiries have accused KBR and its subcontractors with overcharging and other purely financial offenses, this is the first case to assert that the company put its employees lives at risk in the service of profit. The company denied the accusations and said the United States military, not KBR, was responsible for the security of its convoys. KBRs priority has always been the safety and security of its employees, regardless of where they work around the world, Cathy Mann, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. She declined to comment on the specific allegations leveled by the truckers on April 9, 2004, the day of the attack, which took place just as the main insurgency was breaking out in Iraq. That day, as deadly as it was, has been lost in the memory of most Americans as the tally of deaths rises in Iraq. But it gained some notice because one truck driver in the convoy, Thomas Hamill, who was captured by insurgents and later escaped, wrote Escape in Iraq: The Thomas Hamill Story, a popular book recounting his experience. In contrast to Mr. Hamill, who characterized the attack as a surprise, the drivers who testified Monday, Edward Sanchez and Sean Larvenz, said there had been ample warning that an attack was under way at a dangerous intersection near the Baghdad airport. The truckers were civilians recruited by KBR to drive in convoys supplying American troops as part of the companys enormous logistics contract with the Army. Under the contract, the company has been paid more than $15 billion to perform jobs like delivering food and fuel to troops around the world since 2001. The Army recently said it planned to restructure the contract. Just after 9 a.m. on April 9, Mr. Larvenz said, he was leading trucks from a base south of Baghdad toward the intersection when they were attacked by small-caliber weapons, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. As the convoys civilian leader, Mr. Larvenz ordered that the trucks turn around and retreat, he told the committee, which is led by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. Mr. Larvenz said he warned KBR officials over his communication system that the area was under attack. I specifically stated that no convoy should be dispatched to that area, because of the hostilities, he said. I believed that if convoys went through that area, we would lose employees that day. But Mr. Sanchez said that later that day his own convoy, carrying fuel, was dispatched to the area anyway, apparently because fuel stocks were low at the airport. Mr. Sanchez said that just five Humvees guarded a convoy that stretched over miles. By midday, Mr. Sanchezs convoy was being fired on from both sides and he had taken a bullet in the back and shrapnel in the neck. He heard one man shouting: Im hit! Im hit! and another screaming, Im burning! on his radio. Somehow he made his way to a Humvee, where a wounded soldier handed him an M-16 rifle. Although Mr. Sanchez had never fired one before, he found himself shooting at insurgents in a gun battle that lasted more than an hour. In an interview, Mr. Dorgan said he did not know how credible the truckers allegations were, but called them a useful thing to explore. A lawyer for the truckers, T. Scott Allen, presented documents that he said showed that the company later offered to nominate the truckers for a civilian medal if they signed paperwork releasing KBR from any legal liability. The company denied that accusation.

She declined to comment on the specific allegations leveled by the truckers on April 9, 2004, the day of the attack, which took place just as the main insurgency was breaking out in Iraq. That day, as deadly as it was, has been lost in the memory of most Americans as the tally of deaths rises in Iraq. But it gained some notice because one truck driver in the convoy, Thomas Hamill, who was captured by insurgents and later escaped, wrote Escape in Iraq: The Thomas Hamill Story, a popular book recounting his experience. In contrast to Mr. Hamill, who characterized the attack as a surprise, the drivers who testified Monday, Edward Sanchez and Sean Larvenz, said there had been ample warning that an attack was under way at a dangerous intersection near the Baghdad airport. The truckers were civilians recruited by KBR to drive in convoys supplying American troops as part of the companys enormous logistics contract with the Army. Under the contract, the company has been paid more than $15 billion to perform jobs like delivering food and fuel to troops around the world since 2001. The Army recently said it planned to restructure the contract. Just after 9 a.m. on April 9, Mr. Larvenz said, he was leading trucks from a base south of Baghdad toward the intersection when they were attacked by small-caliber weapons, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. As the convoys civilian leader, Mr. Larvenz ordered that the trucks turn around and retreat, he told the committee, which is led by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. Mr. Larvenz said he warned KBR officials over his communication system that the area was under attack. I specifically stated that no convoy should be dispatched to that area, because of the hostilities, he said. I believed that if convoys went through that area, we would lose employees that day. But Mr. Sanchez said that later that day his own convoy, carrying fuel, was dispatched to the area anyway, apparently because fuel stocks were low at the airport. Mr. Sanchez said that just five Humvees guarded a convoy that stretched over miles. By midday, Mr. Sanchezs convoy was being fired on from both sides and he had taken a bullet in the back and shrapnel in the neck. He heard one man shouting: Im hit! Im hit! and another screaming, Im burning! on his radio. Somehow he made his way to a Humvee, where a wounded soldier handed him an M-16 rifle. Although Mr. Sanchez had never fired one before, he found himself shooting at insurgents in a gun battle that lasted more than an hour. In an interview, Mr. Dorgan said he did not know how credible the truckers allegations were, but called them a useful thing to explore. A lawyer for the truckers, T. Scott Allen, presented documents that he said showed that the company later offered to nominate the truckers for a civilian medal if they signed paperwork releasing KBR from any legal liability. The company denied that accusation.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/world/middleeast/09contract.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">Iraq Contractor Inflated Costs, Lawsuit Alleges<date>Published: September 9, 2006</date><text>A former employee of a Halliburton subsidiary claims that she was fired for revealing to her managers that the company was charging the government fraudulently inflated costs for military facilities it ran in Iraq, according to court papers unsealed yesterday. At bases in Anbar Province, the desert homeland of Iraqs bitter Sunni-led insurgency, company employees faked head counts to inflate its charges for operating recreational and dining facilities, and led a relatively lavish lifestyle by appropriating food and equipment meant for the troops, the papers charge. The suit in federal court by the former employee, Julie McBride, is the second corporate whistleblower case to emerge from Iraq. In the first, a jury found the security company Custer Battles guilty of inflating invoices by $3 million, but the case is now going to appeal after a judge held up the settlement. A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Cathy Mann, said that there had been no wrongdoing by the subsidiary, KBR, formerly known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root. The claims included in this lawsuit clearly demonstrate a complete misinterpretation of facts as well as a lack of understanding of KBRs contractual agreements with its customer, the U.S. Army, Ms. Mann said in a written statement. Ms. Mann said that the companys charges to the government did not depend on head counts and that KBR employees were contractually entitled to use the food and recreational equipment at camps in Iraq, just as the troops were. Those assertions were disputed by a lawyer in the case, Alan Grayson, of Grayson &amp; Kubli in McLean, Va., the same firm that represented whistleblowers in the Custer Battles case. He asserted that the KBR employees enjoyed indulgences ranging from cases of soda and tubs of food to big-screen TVs and exercise equipment. The case is being brought under the False Claims Act, which allows the government to collect triple any damages that a jury might award. The law allows Ms. McBride, as a whistleblower, to collect anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of that assessment if her case is successful. Ms. McBride was not immediately available for comment, but Mr. Grayson said that she is a former lawyer who has two children and now lives in Los Angeles.

Yet even as the talk from Caracas and Washington grows more hostile and the countries seem to be growing ever farther apart, trade between Venezuela and the United States is surging. Venezuelas oil exports, of course, account for the bulk of that trade, as the country remains the fourth largest oil supplier to the United States. Pulled largely by those rising oil revenues, trade climbed 36 percent in 2005, to $40.4 billion, the fastest growth in cargo value among Americas top 20 trading partners, according to WorldCity, a Miami company that closely tracks American trade. But American companies are also benefiting, as Venezuelas thirst for American products like cars, construction machinery and computers has steadily grown, rising to $6.4 billion last year, from $4.8 billion a year earlier. The new growth comes even as Mr. Chávez has done his best to try to redirect his nations trade toward what he considers more likeminded nations. He has formed a new socialist trade agreement with Cuba and Bolivia. A few Chinese cars can now be glimpsed in showrooms here. Iranian tractors are rolling off a new assembly line. And a Russian company plans to open a Kalashnikov rifle factory soon. Washington has moved to halt American weapons sales to Venezuela, for what it says is a lack of cooperation in combating terrorism, as Mr. Chávez deepens ties with countries like Iran. But while the leaders in Washington and Caracas may regard each other with distaste, there is little getting around the fact that the appetite for trade in both nations belies those differences. Especially when it comes to oil, the economies remain mutually dependent. Some say the ties have left the two nations entangled to a degree that political or ideological disputes would have a hard time undoing. The U.S. has been Venezuelas principal trading partner for a century, said Robert Bottome, editor and publisher of Veneconomía, the countrys leading business newsletter. Its not easy to dismantle such a relationship, though that is probably Chávezs ultimate desire. Venezuela moved in that direction on Tuesday, with its national oil company saying it had agreed to sell its stake in a Houston refinery for more than $1.3 billion in cash. Still, the trade numbers illustrate a widening gulf between Mr. Chávezs increasingly anti-American speeches, aimed at revving his political base, and the needs of Venezuelas otherwise freewheeling economy. For instance, non-oil exports to the United States climbed 116 percent in the first three months of the year, according to the National Statistics Institute. Venezuela also maintains close ties to Wall Street banks, with Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse advising the governments of Venezuela and Argentina on their coming sale of $2 billion of bonds. The growth in economic ties has touched several sectors, even if political tensions have left American companies generally hesitant to call attention to their good fortune or to offer detailed comments on their operations. Regulatory filings show that Venezuelas economy, which grew 9.6 percent in the first half of the year, is lifting profits for many American companies. Most delicately, oil services companies like Halliburton, an emblem of the Venezuelan governments distaste with American foreign policy, are at the forefront of the deepening interdependence. Theres rhetoric and theres business, said an official with the United States Commerce Department who closely follows trade with Venezuela, and asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of relations between the countries. The Venezuelans cant produce their oil without our equipment. Its as simple as that. With 10 offices and 1,000 employees in Venezuela, Halliburton recently won a contract to assist Petrozuata, a venture between Venezuelas national oil company and ConocoPhillips, in extracting oil from fields in eastern Venezuela. Melissa Norcross, a Halliburton spokeswoman in Houston, declined to comment specifically on activities in Venezuela, but noted that the company had operated in the country for more than 50 years. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in International »CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 15  Capitalism will lead to the destruction of humanity, President Hugo Chávez said this month in a speech in Vietnam, during an overseas tour that included stops in Iran and Belarus.

Other blogs latched onto the July 20 item, Lamont aides alerted reporters and soon it had found its way into local newspapers, tempering Mr. Liebermans attack. This was one example of how the Lamont campaign tried to harness the energy, anger and muckraking zeal of an expanding network of blogs in its effort to unseat Mr. Lieberman, the three-term senator. Dozens of liberal and antiwar bloggers, some of them from across the country but many others in Connecticut, have rallied to Mr. Lamonts cause. In their blogs  a frequent publication of personal thoughts and Web links, often done chronologically  they file daily posts attacking, investigating or just tweaking Mr. Lieberman while spreading a pro-Lamont message. And Mr. Lamont has tried to make the most of their embrace. His Web site links to 17 friendly blogs, and his consultants communicate daily with as many as 150 bloggers who offer advice, pass on intelligence, encourage campaign contributions and sometimes leave their computers long enough to pester Mr. Lieberman at campaign events. But the results for Mr. Lamont have not always been what his campaign would have wanted. This week, the blogger who broke the news of Mr. Liebermans Halliburton stock posted a doctored image of the senator in blackface on The Huffington Post, stirring an outcry and prompting an embarrassed Lamont campaign to ask her to remove it. Lieberman supporters seized on the image, pointing out that the blogger, Jane Hamsher, has been closely involved in the Lamont campaign, even driving the campaign manager on Monday to New York for Mr. Lamonts appearance on The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. This blogging exemplified the risks posed by what has become the new frontier in campaign warfare. Yesterday, the Daily Kos blog, which supports Mr. Lamont, contained numerous comments about the blackface incident, including a complaint about how well-intentioned bloggers can disrupt a campaign. The message said: We need folks to talk, on message, to voters. Its not glamorous, but its important. Unfortunately, blogging is sort of becoming a way for these somewhat lazy people to think they can join in on defining a campaigns message. For all the pros and cons, the influence of bloggers has become such an article of faith that most serious candidates hire consultants to create blogs and coordinate with other bloggers. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York recently hired Peter Daou, who worked for Senator John Kerrys presidential campaign in 2004, as a blog adviser to facilitate and expand her relationship with the blogging community, as Mr. Daou described it on his own blog, The Daou Report. Mr. Liebermans campaign has never had a major blogging component, and it seems to have been blindsided by the vehemence of the blogger juggernaut. A former Lieberman aide now volunteering for the campaign, Dan Gerstein, helped create a pro-Lieberman blog, and last month the senators campaign created an anti-Lamont Web site, MeetNed.com, that contains criticisms of Mr. Lamont. In coalescing around a political neophyte like the 52-year-old Mr. Lamont, liberal bloggers, some of whom cut their teeth on Howard Deans presidential campaign in 2004, are channeling anger over the Iraq war, President Bush and Republican control of Congress into an attack on Mr. Lieberman, 64, who has been relentlessly caricatured as an embodiment of the Washington establishment. While the blogger uprising has clearly helped throw the Lieberman campaign off balance, its ultimate role in deciding the primary is far from certain. The bloggers are mostly amplifying grievances that threatened Mr. Lieberman long before the appearance of online detractors with names like Spazeboy and Nedheads. It is not clear how many voters in Connecticut pay attention to the bloggers efforts. Web traffic statistics showed that on a recent Monday afternoon, only one out of 100 visitors to Firedoglake, one of the bigger national blogs following the primary, was from Connecticut.

Tomas van Houtryve for The New York Times Mr. Ehrmann in front of a portrait of King Gyanendra of Nepal Mayor Pierre Dumont is not so sure. Its humanly intolerable, ugly, dramatic, with its images of destruction, he said. Whatever you think, for me its not art, its a provocation. Mr. Ehrmann, 44, is a businessman-turned-artist who over the last seven years has poured his soul, his religious and worldly convictions and roughly $5 million into the transformation of a 17th-century stone house into a complex work of art that he calls The Abode of Chaos. He became wealthy after founding an online service for determining the cost of art objects and through other ventures. Together with artists from several countries, Mr. Ehrmann, who occupies the house with his two Great Danes, Saatchi and Reuters, has painted the two-story house and the wall around it black and arrayed them with giant black-and-white portraits of noted personalities, including eight popes, as well as President Bush and Osama bin Laden. The garden is strewn with sculptures, mainly by Mr. Ehrmann, including a crashed helicopter, a wrecked oil truck marked Halliburton and a model of the jagged steel remains of the World Trade Center. A reproduction of an oil platform perches on the roof, which is draped with camouflage netting. Mr. Ehrmann, who is married and has two children, began the project in 1999 as a kind of monument to his eclectic religious beliefs, which range from Roman Catholicism to alchemy. Hence the popes, but also numerous salamanders, an animal sacred to the alchemists, cut in steel and affixed to the walls of the building.

Together with artists from several countries, Mr. Ehrmann, who occupies the house with his two Great Danes, Saatchi and Reuters, has painted the two-story house and the wall around it black and arrayed them with giant black-and-white portraits of noted personalities, including eight popes, as well as President Bush and Osama bin Laden. The garden is strewn with sculptures, mainly by Mr. Ehrmann, including a crashed helicopter, a wrecked oil truck marked Halliburton and a model of the jagged steel remains of the World Trade Center. A reproduction of an oil platform perches on the roof, which is draped with camouflage netting. Mr. Ehrmann, who is married and has two children, began the project in 1999 as a kind of monument to his eclectic religious beliefs, which range from Roman Catholicism to alchemy. Hence the popes, but also numerous salamanders, an animal sacred to the alchemists, cut in steel and affixed to the walls of the building.

The changes, described in draft contracting documents on Army Web sites, await final Pentagon approval, said Linda K. Theis, a spokeswoman for the Army Field Support Command in Rock Island, Ill., which oversees the contract. But they have already received extensive review and are moving through the upper echelons of the Army, she said. If the plans are carried through, Halliburtons contract will end, and the tasks it does will be divided among as many as four companies. One company will be an umbrella for planning and oversight, and the others will compete for the actual job orders  things like building camps and delivering fuel in war zones. The Army said it hoped this approach would foster competition and lower the risks of having one large contractor in charge of critical military programs. Critics of the exclusive, no-bid contract, including Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, say it has allowed Halliburton to charge unreasonably high costs for some work. They have often pointed to the deal with Halliburton, which was led by Dick Cheney before he quit to become vice president, as an example of cronyism by the Bush administration in awarding lucrative contracts. Halliburton has dismissed those criticisms, and the Army has largely upheld its claimed costs for its work. Much of the criticism has been over work and billing by KBR, the Halliburton subsidiary once known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root.The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Halliburtons contract would be ended. Melissa Norcross, a Halliburton spokeswoman, called the proposed changes neither unusual nor unexpected, because earlier versions of the logistics contract had gone through the same process. The Halliburton contract could have run for 10 years, but the Army has the option of ending it after an annual review. Ms. Theis said that when Halliburtons logistics contract was awarded, the Army expected that it would be worth around $100 million over 10 years. But that was before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq scattered the American military, with its vast logistical requirements, around the world. When asked what role the widespread criticism of Halliburtons work had played in generating the proposed changes, the Army replied, None. The shift was driven only by the surging logistics needs of the American military, the Army said. But Frederick D. Barton, co-director of the postconflict reconstruction project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he doubted that the waves of criticism could have been missed in the Armys reviews. Because so much work went to one company for so long, the Army might have a hard time finding others with the capacity to carry the load now, he said. There are not competitors with warehouses full of talent sitting around waiting for this assignment, Mr. Barton said.

Specialist Mike Moriarty is filming his squad leader, Staff Sgt. Kevin Shangraw, as they bounce along in a Humvee. He asks his leader for his take on the broader mission, and Sergeant Shangraw comes straight off the dome with a government-issue rationale. "Well, I think it's a fantastic opportunity for the Iraqis to establish a new history in the country and be able to be a free and democratic society, which in turn should stabilize the whole Middle East and create a freer and more stable earth as we know it." "Tell me how you really feel," an unseen Specialist Moriarty prompts. Sergeant. Shangraw waits a beat as the bleak landscape flies by in the window before answering. "Then, after that happens, maybe we can buy everybody in the world a puppy." It is mordantly effective filmmaking. "The War Tapes" has the stock characters of any war movie  the gung-ho guy, the wiseacre, the bookish one  but the fact that they are actually fighting the war not only gives them a perspective on events most of us are seeing through a straw, but also a ferocious credibility. The movie is less diatribe than a vérité tour of the vagaries of war in general and this one in particular. (Much of the unit's mission involves guarding convoys of supply trucks from Halliburton, driven by highly paid civilians.) "The War Tapes" is one of a rash of current documentaries feeding appetites for information and coverage beyond traditional channels of information. "An Inconvenient Truth," a filmed version of former Vice President Al Gore's slide show on global warming, has turned the most boring of issues  and public personalities  into an entertainment. "Who Killed the Electric Car?", a whodunit about the death of electric vehicles in California, landed with enough impact that the Smithsonian removed its only electric vehicle from display last week. "The Road to Guantánamo," a hybrid of documentary and feature techniques, seemed to neatly prefigure the recent events at the prison. THE current surge in politically inflected documentaries seems like a mashed-up, digital version of the 1960's, when books like "Silent Spring," "Unsafe at Any Speed" and "The Other America" came out of nowhere to define public debate. Those interested in advancing specific points of view these days are picking up the 800-pound pencil of filmmaking, in part because digital technology has made it easier to deliver complicated political messages in a visual narrative. But the cluster of serious, point-of-view documentaries may also represent something else, a coup d'etat on the status quo. Just as those big books of the 60's took on the elites of the day (chemical companies, Detroit engineers) these films betray a disaffection with their postindustrial counterparts (Hollywood, the traditional news media) for filling theaters with brain-dead blockbusters and neglecting important stories. "Documentaries used to explore issues, but there has been an extraordinary explosion of political advocacy," said Sheila Nevins, president of documentary films at HBO. "I don't think the evening news is doing a good job of expressing the confusion about the state of the world, and this is a soapbox that a lot of people are turning to." Michael Moore, whose "Fahrenheit 911," and "Bowling for Columbine" set the template for the new political documentary, believes there are two reasons we are seeing these films in theaters. "Mainstream media, especially The New York Times, has failed to cast a skeptical eye on those in power," he said. "The other reason is that Hollywood has not done the job of producing interesting films of substance. If journalism isn't doing the job and fiction isn't doing the job, nonfiction has stepped in with compelling characters, good stories and important films." Sgt. Zack Bazzi, one of the stars and battlefield auteurs of "The War Tapes," said the war he fought in (and probably will again) is the one he saw in the documentary, which was directed by Deborah Scranton. "The strongest message of the film is that you have three primary characters who have very different views of the war who do their jobs to the best of their abilities with no regrets," he said, speaking by cellphone from Vermont. Suddenly, gunfire erupted in the background. "That isn't real. Those are blanks," he said, explaining that he had volunteered for a few days to assist in training a unit that was on its way to Iraq. "No film or book is going to capture the exact reality of a war, but this film comes as close as any I have seen," he said, moving away from the explosions. "This is another vehicle to relay the message and help bridge the current disconnect people feel with the war. It helps civilians be better citizens, to not confuse the war with the warrior." The current impulse to fight back by picking up a camera is generally considered a liberal reflex  there are very few politically conservative documentarians. But much of the most bracing work comes from people who were not ideologues to begin with.

Bowen Jr. was looking puffy and exhausted after three days of fighting an intestinal bug he had picked up in Baghdad. Now, wearing a flak vest in 100-degree heat, he was almost two hours into his inspection of an American-financed project to build a prison on a bleak and cloudless patch of desert in southern Iraq. Skip to next paragraph The Reach of War Go to Complete Coverage » Multimedia Slide Show: Keeping Contractors Honest in Iraq Readers’ Opinions Forum: The Transition in Iraq But as the inspector general for the United States' reconstruction effort in Iraq, Mr. Bowen, 48, was trying to extract a few more nuggets of information from this dusty outpost near Nasiriya. His face flushed and his hair matted to his scalp with sweat, he wanted to know why the Parsons Corporation, a construction giant that he has repeatedly excoriated, had left just two American contractors to oversee 800 Iraqi workers swarming the site. "We've got 2 contractors and 10 security guards," said Mr. Bowen with a sidelong glance at the heavily armed contingent trailing him through the project, which he had already discovered was months behind schedule and would be less than 20 percent the size called for in the original design. His office has also criticized what it considers overblown security fears at some sites. Mr. Bowen has surprised some with his investigative zeal. He formally leads the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, whose roughly 160 auditors, engineers, inspectors and administrative staff members have been assigned the mission of uncovering fraud, waste and abuse in a $45 billion reconstruction program that is widely perceived as a failure. He believes it is still too early to pass judgment on the program, but more than anything his office has vividly shown that when it comes to assessing and improving the creaky infrastructure of Iraq, half the battle is won simply by showing up. Unlike many American reconstruction officials, Mr. Bowen and his staff members routinely leave the security of Baghdad's fortified Green Zone to visit the project sites. His engineers open the doors on electrical panels and check that the wires are carrying electricity. His auditors read receipts and see if the figures add up. As a consequence, the audits and inspections carried out by Mr. Bowen's office provide the clearest available picture of a rebuilding program so obscured by the fog of war and the miasma of official news releases that even the managers in charge often seem unclear on what has really been achieved. The office has issued 97 audit and inspection reports, many of them sharply critical, while starting 177 investigations that have led to at least five arrests and two convictions of Americans on fraud and other charges. Seventy to 80 of those investigations remain open. What emerges is a tableau of incompetence, greed and disastrous planning tempered by a slate of well-run projects that Mr. Bowen's reports are careful to highlight. "He's over there taking a look at the facts and reporting them back accurately to those of us who are in one way or another involved in various responsibilities in this mission to restore democracy to Iraq," said Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee. "Very definitely he's having an impact," Mr. Warner said. However that impact is gauged, it has very much emerged from the close-up view of reconstruction in Iraq. During a recent inspection of a $6 million renovation of a train station in Baghdad, Andrew Griffith, an engineer in Mr. Bowen's office, and Kevin O'Connor, one of his auditors, peered at all the new equipment: the pumps, the control panels, the stacks of emergency batteries. At one point Mr. Griffith closely questioned an Iraqi engineer on the electrical capacity of a row of new circuit breakers, while Mr. O'Connor photographed the serial numbers on a shiny new air-conditioning unit. Mr. O'Connor said the information would help determine if the expensive units were receiving the right voltage. Brian Flynn, an assistant inspector general in the office, said a bit fewer than half of the visits turned up no major problems with management or execution. Some suspect that tough inspections like these might have made a difference had they been carried out from the beginning, particularly in catching corrupt Americans. "He gives us a solution for this problem, because we cannot prosecute those cases," said Rathi al-Rathi, who heads the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity and is essentially Mr. Bowen's counterpart here. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in International »SOUTHERN DHI QAR PROVINCE, Iraq  Stuart W.

His face flushed and his hair matted to his scalp with sweat, he wanted to know why the Parsons Corporation, a construction giant that he has repeatedly excoriated, had left just two American contractors to oversee 800 Iraqi workers swarming the site. "We've got 2 contractors and 10 security guards," said Mr. Bowen with a sidelong glance at the heavily armed contingent trailing him through the project, which he had already discovered was months behind schedule and would be less than 20 percent the size called for in the original design. His office has also criticized what it considers overblown security fears at some sites. Mr. Bowen has surprised some with his investigative zeal. He formally leads the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, whose roughly 160 auditors, engineers, inspectors and administrative staff members have been assigned the mission of uncovering fraud, waste and abuse in a $45 billion reconstruction program that is widely perceived as a failure. He believes it is still too early to pass judgment on the program, but more than anything his office has vividly shown that when it comes to assessing and improving the creaky infrastructure of Iraq, half the battle is won simply by showing up. Unlike many American reconstruction officials, Mr. Bowen and his staff members routinely leave the security of Baghdad's fortified Green Zone to visit the project sites. His engineers open the doors on electrical panels and check that the wires are carrying electricity. His auditors read receipts and see if the figures add up. As a consequence, the audits and inspections carried out by Mr. Bowen's office provide the clearest available picture of a rebuilding program so obscured by the fog of war and the miasma of official news releases that even the managers in charge often seem unclear on what has really been achieved. The office has issued 97 audit and inspection reports, many of them sharply critical, while starting 177 investigations that have led to at least five arrests and two convictions of Americans on fraud and other charges. Seventy to 80 of those investigations remain open. What emerges is a tableau of incompetence, greed and disastrous planning tempered by a slate of well-run projects that Mr. Bowen's reports are careful to highlight. "He's over there taking a look at the facts and reporting them back accurately to those of us who are in one way or another involved in various responsibilities in this mission to restore democracy to Iraq," said Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee. "Very definitely he's having an impact," Mr. Warner said. However that impact is gauged, it has very much emerged from the close-up view of reconstruction in Iraq. During a recent inspection of a $6 million renovation of a train station in Baghdad, Andrew Griffith, an engineer in Mr. Bowen's office, and Kevin O'Connor, one of his auditors, peered at all the new equipment: the pumps, the control panels, the stacks of emergency batteries. At one point Mr. Griffith closely questioned an Iraqi engineer on the electrical capacity of a row of new circuit breakers, while Mr. O'Connor photographed the serial numbers on a shiny new air-conditioning unit. Mr. O'Connor said the information would help determine if the expensive units were receiving the right voltage. Brian Flynn, an assistant inspector general in the office, said a bit fewer than half of the visits turned up no major problems with management or execution. Some suspect that tough inspections like these might have made a difference had they been carried out from the beginning, particularly in catching corrupt Americans. "He gives us a solution for this problem, because we cannot prosecute those cases," said Rathi al-Rathi, who heads the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity and is essentially Mr. Bowen's counterpart here. 1 2Next Page »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/opinion/27thu1.html?ref=halliburtoncompany">The Iraqi Oil Pipeline Fiasco<date>Published: April 27, 2006</date><text>The Bush administration's promise that Iraq's reconstruction could be paid for with the country's own oil revenues was one of the many false assertions and assurances that ushered in the invasion.

A few weeks later, after the project had burned up all of the $75.7 million allocated to it, the work came to a halt. The project, called the Fatah pipeline crossing, had been a critical element of a $2.4 billion no-bid reconstruction contract that a Halliburton subsidiary had won from the Army in 2003. The spot where about 15 pipelines crossed the Tigris had been the main link between Iraq's rich northern oil fields and the export terminals and refineries that could generate much-needed gasoline, heating fuel and revenue for Iraqis. For all those reasons, the project's demise would seriously damage the American-led effort to restore Iraq's oil system and enable the country to pay for its own reconstruction. Exactly what portion of Iraq's lost oil revenue can be attributed to one failed project, no matter how critical, is impossible to calculate. But the pipeline at Al Fatah has a wider significance as a metaphor for the entire $45 billion rebuilding effort in Iraq. Although the failures of that effort are routinely attributed to insurgent attacks, an examination of this project shows that troubled decision-making and execution have played equally important roles. The Fatah project went ahead despite warnings from experts that it could not succeed because the underground terrain was shattered and unstable. It continued chewing up astonishing amounts of cash when the predicted problems bogged the work down, with a contract that allowed crews to charge as much as $100,000 a day as they waited on standby. The company in charge engaged in what some American officials saw as a self-serving attempt to limit communications with the government until all the money was gone. And until Mr. Sanders went to Al Fatah, the Army Corps of Engineers, which administered the project, allowed the show to go on for months, even as individual Corps officials said they repeatedly voiced doubts about its chances of success. The Halliburton subsidiary, KBR, formerly Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, had commissioned a geotechnical report that warned in August 2003 that it would be courting disaster to drill without extensive underground tests. "No driller in his right mind would have gone ahead," said Mr. Sanders, a geologist who came across the report when he arrived at the site. KBR defended its performance on the project, and said that the information in the geotechnical report was too general to serve as a warning. Still, interviews by The New York Times reveal that at least two other technical experts, including the northern project manager for the Army Corps, warned that the effort would fail if carried out as designed. None of the dozen or so American government and military officials contacted by The Times remembered being told of the geotechnical report, and the company pressed ahead. Once the project started going bad, senior American officials said, an array of management failures by both KBR and the Corps allowed it to continue. First, some of those officials said, they seldom received status reports from the company, even when they suspected problems and made direct requests. "Typically when you manage a project, you have people who can tell you that you've got so much of your project finished and this much money that has been spent," said Gary Vogler, a senior American official in the Iraqi Oil Ministry. "We couldn't get anything like that." Some warnings did in fact make their way to senior officials who could have stopped the project, said Donna Street, a Corps engineer who examined correspondence on the project after it failed. But neither the Corps nor the company seemed to act on them, Ms. Street said. "It seems to me that there was pretty much an absence of anything," she said. "The reports went out. The questions were asked.

The report, prepared for a frequent critic of Halliburton, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, was based on previously undisclosed correspondence and performance evaluations from 2004 and 2005. The documents show that the government's contracting officers became increasingly frustrated as they tried to penetrate what they considered to be inaccurate or misleading progress reports and expense vouchers filed by the subsidiary, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root. In August 2004, one of the officers wrote to the company that "you have universally failed to provide adequate cost information as required." A few months later, after the company was served with a "cure notice," in which the government threatened to terminate the contract if performance was not improved, or "cured," another officer said he was writing "in sheer frustration with the consistent lack of accurate data." Kellogg Brown &amp; Root's second contract, awarded in January 2004 for rebuilding oil infrastructure in southern Iraq, has a maximum value of $1.2 billion. A company spokeswoman, Melissa Norcross, said that the report was "as devoid of context as it is new information" and that many of the issues raised by the contracting officers had been resolved. The company, Ms. Norcross said, was forced to work with an ever-shifting cast of oversight organizations and at least 15 government contracting officials. "With each change, the company adjusted to meet the needs of its customer," she said, "all while operating in an extremely hostile war zone." But Mr. Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the report showed that the company had "actually done a worse job under its second Iraq oil contract than it did under the original no-bid contract." William L. Nash, a retired Army general who is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an expert on post-conflict zones, said the unusually revealing documents laid bare "a microcosm of all the ills" of the Iraq rebuilding effort. "This a continuing example of the mismanagement of the Iraq reconstruction from the highest levels down to the contractors on the ground," he said. The second contract was not terminated after the cure notice, and contracting officers later noted improvements in some areas. But the company received what appeared to be a rebuke when it was given nothing out of a possible $7.9 million in socalled award fees for its first year of work on the contract. The award fees are incentives given by the government to reward good performance. An award fee given for a later period, roughly the first half of 2005, was about 20 percent of the maximum, which Mr. Nash, who has been involved in determining such fees, described as extraordinarily low. Both Kellogg Brown &amp; Root contracts called for things like repairing oil wells and pipelines, installing power generators at oil facilities and importing fuel to Iraq. The first contract, worth $2.4 billion, generated enormous controversy after Pentagon auditors questioned more than $200 million in fuel delivery costs. Critics like Mr. Waxman called the challenged costs overcharges, a description rejected by the company, which claimed a measure of vindication last month when the Army overruled the auditors and reimbursed nearly all of the delivery charges. The new report, which says that Pentagon auditors have questioned $45 million of the $365 million in reviewed costs, may revive the battle. A spokesman for the Defense Contract Audit Agency confirmed the figures. Responding to the numbers, an official with Kellogg Brown &amp; Root said, "Audits are part of the normal contracting process, and it is important to note that the auditors' role in the process is advisory only." But what are likely to be seen as the most striking portions of the report are those that cite the variously stern, heated and even anguished language of contracting officers trying to bring the company to heel. "As I have said in numerous meetings, KBR's lack of cost containment and funds management is the single biggest detriment to this program," one officer, Maj. Michael V. Waggle, wrote in the cure notice. He noted that the company had listed an impossibly high cost overrun of $436,019,574 on one job, charges of $114,308 for an oil spill cleanup that failed to remove any oil and another set of tasks in which the overruns were 36.9 percent of all costs. The slides used in presentations during the deliberations of the board that determined the first award fee are almost equally eye-catching. On one slide, covering the company's success at meeting its planned schedules, a section labeled "Strengths" bears only the notation "N/A," presumably meaning no answer or not applicable.
