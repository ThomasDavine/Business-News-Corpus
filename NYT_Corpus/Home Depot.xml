The company raised its earnings forecast for the full year. Home Depot said its profit rose to $1.36 billion, or 86 cents a share, from $1.19 billion, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected net income of 83 cents a share, according to FactSet.

Still, the company, the country’s largest retail chain, reported that net income had increased 5.7 percent because of what it called “strong expense management,” among other things. Retail analysts said results reported over the last week by a broad cross section of retailers — including Macy’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and Kohl’s — suggested that whatever happened with consumer spending, the retail sector was better equipped to cope than it was when the recession hit. Among the lessons learned, said Bradley Thomas, a retail analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, are keeping inventories lean, using marketing dollars strategically and quickly marking down slow-moving items so they do not have to be priced later at rock-bottom clearance prices. “Companies are doing more with less,” Mr. Thomas said. “The downside risk is not as great as it was in 2008.” The slate of results reported on Tuesday showed varied sales numbers. Saks Fifth Avenue had a large same-store sales increase of 15.5 percent for the quarter. Home Depot’s sales were strong; the discount retailer T. J. Maxx had a good sales quarter; and Wal-Mart said its same-store sales in the United States had declined by 0.9 percent. All four retailers posted profits better than Wall Street had expected, and all except Saks raised their full-year profit projections. In explaining the results, retail executives said that although the economy was volatile, they had been through ups and downs like this before. “If we do experience a prolonged downturn, we’ll approach it in the same way we did in the past, focusing on controlling what we can control: expenses, capital spending and inventory,” Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, told investors Tuesday. He said Saks was better positioned than in 2008 because of “carefully controlled” inventory, a stronger balance sheet, decreased capital spending and the closure of seven full-line stores in the last year and a half. Retailers of all stripes said they had not yet seen outsize effects among shoppers from the recent stock market swings, but the higher-end retailers expressed greater confidence about sales in the future than did the lower-end ones. “Our August comp sales are in line with our comp sales forecasts for the fall season,” Mr. Sadove said. He added that full-price selling was now more prevalent than it had been before the recession, and that he expected that trend to continue. Mr. Sadove’s comments echoed those last week from executives at Nordstrom and Macy’s, which owns the higher-end Bloomingdale’s. Like Saks, both companies posted strong sales and higher-than-expected profits. Both also raised their profit outlook for the year. At Nordstrom, full-price items are also selling well, even as prices climb, executives said. And at Macy’s, nonsale items were also big sellers, and “our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the optimism we feel about the direction of the business, as well as realism about the macroeconomic environment,” Karen M. Hoguet, the chief financial officer, said. Macy’s said it had its best second quarter in more than a decade. At the lower end of the retail world, the mood has been more subdued. At Wal-Mart, executives said Tuesday that shoppers were under as much economic pressure as ever, and that the job market was now worrying them even more than high gas and food prices. “They’re trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons,” Michael T. Duke, the chief executive, said. Those worries among customers contributed to the continuing slide in same-store sales, but Wal-Mart posted a higher-than-expected profit nonetheless. Net income at the company increased to $3.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, a penny better than analysts had projected. Its revenue rose 5.4 percent to $109.3 billion. In addition to “strong expense management,” Mr. Duke said, Wal-Mart was getting inventory levels under control, while better sales at Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart’s international division also contributed to the healthier bottom line. Wal-Mart said its full-year profit should be higher than expected, at $4.41 to $4.51 a share, versus the $4.35 to $4.50 guidance it had previously given. That again seemed to be based on expense controls and growth overseas and at Sam’s, not on strong domestic sales. “Negative headlines don’t help consumer sentiment at any level of income, but our customer, also just from a job perspective and a real income perspective, is really stretched,” Charles M. Holley Jr., the chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters. “The unemployment is actually a lot higher for people who have less education and had less income to begin with — it’s much more severe as you go down the economic scale.” At Kohl’s, which caters to shoppers who are generally better off than those at Wal-Mart, Kevin Mansell, chairman and chief executive, said he was not happy with the sales. Kohl’s profits, though, beat expectations. Kohl’s same-store sales were lower than the 2 to 4 percent increase the retailer had projected, coming in at 1.9 percent. Yet the retailer nevertheless posted a 17 percent increase in profit, which it attributed to controlling expenses, stocking more profitable private brands, and keeping inventory levels modest. Dillard’s, another midrange chain, said last week that its profit for the quarter more than doubled from a year before, rising to $17.6 million from $6.8 million a year before. Same-store sales rose 6 percent for the quarter. Over the last couple of years, Dillard’s has closed stores and reduced its inventory. J. C. Penney posted a quarterly profit of $14 million, or 7 cents a share, last week, about what analysts expected. Penney noted it was cutting $50 million from expenses.Even as worries grow about another economic downturn, major retail companies continue to report strong earnings, thanks to tough lessons from the recession.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/once-scorned-compact-fluorescents-are-advancing/?ref=homedepotinc">Once-Scorned Light Bulbs Are Advancing<date>August 11, 2011, 2:41 pm</date><text>In my Pragmatist column in Thursday’s Home section, I describe the latest advancements in energy-efficient light bulbs in response to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, part of which takes effect next January. EcoSmartA 100-watt-equivalent C.F.L. marketed by EcoSmart. Much of that discussion focuses on so-called C.F.L.’s, or compact fluorescent light bulbs. While they have improved in recent years, the technology continues to be hampered by worries about its environmental impact in landfills because C.F.L.’s contain mercury. Environmentally minded consumers who hope to shave a few dollars from their electric bills by using C.F.L.’s can take solace in the fact that some groups consider C.F.L.’s greener than the bulbs they replace. In 2008, for instance, the Natural Resources Defense Council published a paper suggesting that C.F.L.’s do less environmental harm than standard incandescent bulbs. For example, C.F.L.’s require one-quarter the energy from coal-fired power plants that incandescents do, the council wrote. If all consumers changed to C.F.L.’s, the group argued, those plants would send less pollution into the air. The council’s paper cites research by the Northeast Waste Management Officials’ Association into toxic waste levels from C.F.L.’s. If you choose to buy fluorescents, you’ll still need to dispose of your old C.F.L.’s properly when they die or break. Home Depot and Lowe’s both accept C.F.L.’s for recycling, and you can find more information about disposal locations, among other topics, here. Safety, of course, is another issue, since light bulbs are so easy to break. The amount of mercury contained in a C.F.L. is roughly equivalent to the amount of ink on the tip of a ballpoint pen and about one-fifth the amount in a watch battery, the council’s paper says. But the bulbs can leak mercury vapor when broken, so ventilation is important when cleaning a broken bulb, the council says in its paper. Some manufacturers now produce C.F.L.’s with protective coating; the EcoSmart Shatter-Resistant C.F.L. is one example. So for those proceeding with caution on C.F.L.’s, the light is now green.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/opinion/15bogle.html?ref=homedepotinc">The Supreme Court Had Its Say. Now Let Shareholders Decide.<date>Published: May 14, 2011</date><text>Valley Forge, Pa. SHOULD Home Depot’s board report each year on the company’s political policies and spending? In a groundbreaking vote at the company’s June 2 annual meeting, Home Depot’s shareholders will have the chance to vote on a nonbinding resolution of support for the company’s policies on, and future plans for, political contributions. The vote was made possible because the Securities and Exchange Commission rightly decided in March to allow proxy proposals that require public companies to permit their shareholders to weigh in on their political spending. This means that, notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision last year that laws limiting corporate political contributions violate constitutional free speech principles, the game is far from over. Shareholders — not self-interested corporate managers — should, and can, decide policies on corporate political contributions. What makes this strengthening of shareholder rights particularly important is that over the past 50 years control of corporate America has shifted from individual stockholders to institutional stockholders. But these institutional investors have been unwilling to challenge political activities by corporate boards, even when those activities are not in their shareholders’ interests. Our nation’s money managers now hold 70 percent of all shares of American corporations, compared to a mere 8 percent in the 1950s, giving them absolute voting control. To be sure, these money-management agents are duty-bound to represent their principals — mutual-fund shareholders, for instance — but have not always honored this responsibility. In fact, for decades, with a handful of exceptions, the participation of our institutional money managers in corporate governance has been limited, reluctant and unenthusiastic. Perhaps they feared angering clients whose pension and thrift funds they manage — that is, the very corporations whose shares fill their investment portfolios. It is an obvious conflict of interest, however often denied. To make matters worse, most of our large institutional money managers are themselves owned by giant United States and global financial conglomerates. The shares of those conglomerates, in turn, are held in their own portfolios. I don’t expect this web to be easily untangled. And yet I believe that, in the wake of the Supreme Court case, known as Citizens United, the institutional investor community has an obligation to act. Institutional investors should insist that the proxy statement of each company in which they invest contain the following: “Resolved: That the corporation shall make no political contributions without the approval of the holders of at least 75 percent of its shares outstanding.” Such a “supermajority” requirement is necessary because of the inevitably wide range of views that characterize any shareholder base. As it happens, 75 percent is halfway between a simple majority and the standard (under Delaware corporate law) that requires a unanimous shareholder vote to ratify a gift of corporate assets other than for charitable purposes. For all its faults, the Citizens United ruling upheld the disclosure requirements of the campaign financing law, and I had hoped full disclosure might limit corporate contributions. But in fact, corporations are able to exploit provisions in the law governing nonprofit groups to make lavish political contributions without disclosure, making it easier than ever for cash to subvert our political system. Action to limit contributions at the corporate level is therefore urgent. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself put the onus on shareholders to control corporate political giving. In his opinion for the majority in Citizens United, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy predicated the First Amendment right of free speech on the ability of shareholders to ensure that the speech reflects their views rather than diverting corporate assets for the benefit of executives. He suggested that any abuse could be corrected by shareholders “through the procedures of corporate democracy.” In the Home Depot case, which was brought by NorthStar Asset Management, a Boston money manager, a vigilant S.E.C. has allowed our shareholders to take that first step toward democracy. The critical battle over political spending by corporations has now been joined. For the first time, the financial institutions that now control corporate America will have to stand up and be counted: the ballots are before them, and they will have to vote yes or no, or abstain. While mutual funds, our largest holders of stocks, are now required to publicly report how they voted during the year, pension funds are not; they should be. Fortunately, the Home Depot shareholders aren’t alone: similar proposals are also included in the proxy votes now being solicited by Citigroup, I.B.M., Charles Schwab, Prudential, JPMorgan Chase and others. From this modest beginning, I hope a groundswell will develop that will give corporate owners a say not only over political contributions, but many other policies — executive compensation being the most obvious example. The outcome of these votes this proxy season will be a powerful indication of whether our money managers are observing their fiduciary duty and putting the interest of the small investors and pension funds that are their clients before their own. America’s institutional investors must stand up to the Supreme Court’s misguided decision and bring democracy to corporate governance, recognize conflicts that arise from the interlocking interests of our corporate and financial systems, and take that first step along the road to reducing the dominant role that big money plays in our political system.

They are adding bar codes to certain products that give potential buyers on-the-spot access to product reviews and ratings, how-to guides and videos. This will gradually expand across a greater range of products in the thousands of stores across the country as the huge home improvement retailers, which have been hit by the poor economy, seek to prompt consumers to undertake repairs or renovations they have been delaying. For now, garden plants sold at Home Depot and Lowe’s have bar codes on each plant tag that enable customers with smartphone scanners to check out whether the plant, for example, grows in low light or needs frequent watering. This is the season when stores sell millions of garden plants, which are an important segment of the business. At Lowe’s, for example, nursery sales, which also include trees and flowers, were 4 percent of the chain’s total $48.8 billion sales in the fiscal year ended Jan. 28.  Chris Gerhard, a home gardener and real estate broker in San Antonio, says mobile bar codes have greatly improved her gardening outcomes. “Those little plastic tags on plants always had minimal information,” she said of her purchases at her local Home Depot. “Now, with the bar codes, you can scan them and figure out immediately what is going to grow in the sun, when to plant and how far apart to place plants. “That’s great for me because in this climate you can fry things to a crisp, and I have. This helped me know exactly what would work on my front porch and back patio without wasting a lot of time and money.” Home Depot also has placed codes on its outdoor patio sets and is running a 30-second bar code commercial nationwide on cable and network television. It is also experimenting with newspaper circulars carrying bar codes that instantly link to a video about its new line, Martha Stewart Living Kitchens. In the video, Ms. Stewart discusses the various styles of kitchen cabinets, counters and other items that are available, and invites customers to make an in-store appointment with a Home Depot kitchen designer. Tom Sweeney, director of online strategy for homedepot.com, said the bar code pilots are about extending the company’s “anytime, anywhere” marketing strategy. “We are testing this out on specific product categories,” he said, of mobile bar codes, “but it’s too early to understand how, and whether, customers will use this technology.” “Large-ticket items, for example, require research, so there may not be an immediate purchase even with the information at the customer’s fingertips,” he said. Roger Marquis, a marketing expert who blogs about bar codes, questioned whether Home Depot or Lowe’s were giving their customers a useful experience that would prompt them to routinely scan codes and induce them to buy. “A lot of marketers look at bar-code technology as a silver bullet to engage customers,” he said. “There’s a disconnect. They are not giving enough information about what bar codes are, and not integrating the technology into their marketing strategies. If the user doesn’t have a worthwhile experience, then they aren’t going to scan codes, and the technology will die on the vine.” Lowe’s has taken steps, like building a mobile version of its Web site, to make information more accessible to customers, said Gihad Jawhar, vice president of lowes.com. The company introduced the readable tags last November for its poinsettias and fresh-cut trees, directing customers to its plant guide with instructions on care, including how much water, fertilizer and light to supply.  This spring, the trees in containers sold at Lowe’s garden centers began carrying tags that could be scanned to view a two-minute how-to video on the specifics of tree planting, including what soil to buy. One of the main reasons for container tree returns is unsuccessful planting, said a Lowe’s spokeswoman, Colleen Carbott. Lowe’s is using Microsoft tag technology — colorful squares — which looks different from the black-and-white checked quick-response codes at Home Depot. “We also have a star rating system on our product pages with user-generated content that is to be accessed by customers,” Mr. Jawhar noted. Lowe’s will not place the bar codes on items like a bag of cement, he said, but plans to place them on products that lend themselves to how-to information. Mike Wehrs, chief executive of Scanbuy, the mobile bar code platform that works with Home Depot, said more than 25 million people in the United States already had the ability to scan with their mobile phones. He expects the number to increase as more people acquire smartphones. “Mobile bar-code scanning experienced a 1,600 percent increase in traffic last year,” he said. Besides quick customer access, he said retailers can also choose to receive data on customer scans, including which products are scanned most and their geographical location. Customers like Keri Stevens, of Verona, Ky., already are convinced. While shopping with her three sons recently in Home Depot, one noticed a bar code on a potted cactus. An admitted “black thumb” gardener, Ms. Stevens bought it only after scanning the bar code to find out the care details. “Now we look for bar codes together,” said Ms. Stevens. “We make it a treasure hunt, and my kids see scanning bar codes as the new normal.”WHETHER it’s a piece of pipe or new kitchen cabinets, many Americans search for the right product in the aisles of home improvement stores like Home Depot or Lowe’s, trying to quickly identify what they need.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/business/media/18adco.html?ref=homedepotinc">Sears Challenges Garden Supply Rivals - Advertising<date>Published: March 17, 2011</date><text>A RETAILER struggling to fend off increasing competition is borrowing a page from the marketing playbook of products like soft drinks and soup by naming its rivals in aggressive advertising.Sears, in a campaign scheduled to begin on Sunday, will urge consumers to shop for lawn and garden products at Sears rather than Home Depot or Lowe’s. A description of the campaign on a section of the Sears Web site (sears.com/turfwars) underlines its tough-talking nature: “Sears Turf Wars, fighting the Home Depot and Lowe’s for the right to be on your lawn.” The campaign, being created by the Chicago office of Y&amp;R, has an extensive presence in new media, including Web video clips, social media and a mobile application that enables comparisons of products sold by those three retailers. “ ‘Turf Wars’ isn’t just an ad campaign,” said Martin Lee, vice president and chief marketing officer for lawn and garden products at Sears Holdings in Hoffman Estates, Ill. “It’s a marketing platform, an attitude, a statement of what we will do for our lawn and garden customers.” Sears, part of the Sears Holdings Corporation, is joining a lengthy list of marketers challenging competitors rather than using coy terms like “Brand X” or “another leading brand.” Such direct campaigns are known in the industry as comparative advertising, but they amount to the Madison Avenue equivalent of the negative advertising that is prevalent in politics. • Comparative ads typically become more commonplace when the economy is weak, on the theory that when times are tough it may pay to hit your rival harder. “We wanted to create disruptive advertising,” Mr. Lee said. “The brief to the agency was ‘shock and shatter.’ ” Among brands that have been naming names in pointed ads are Pepsi Max and Sierra Mist Natural sodas, citing, respectively, Coke Zero and Sprite; Campbell’s Select Harvest soups, tackling Progresso, which soon counterattacked; Dunkin’ Donuts, taking on the coffee sold by Starbucks; and the Chevrolet Cruze, proclaiming its superiority to the Honda Civic and the Toyota Corolla. Comparative advertising is not without its risks. One is that the intended audience may be turned off by the tactic, flagging the sponsor for unnecessary roughness. Another risk is that the novelty of hearing or seeing names of other products in ads may prevent consumers from recalling who the sponsor actually was. And comparative advertising requires “a high degree of believability about the message,” said Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys in New York, a brand and customer-loyalty consulting company. For instance, “if I tell you Kia is a match for Mercedes,” he added, “you’d be laughing your head off.” In the Brand Keys rankings of sellers of merchandise in the categories of garden care and home repair, Sears is fifth among five retailers, Mr. Passikoff said, trailing, in order, Ace, True Value, Home Depot and Lowe’s. However, the Craftsman brand, which is a focus of the new Sears campaign, does resonate with consumers on attributes like quality and value, he added. The initial television commercial in the campaign features an assertive, gravelly voiced actor named John Lacy, who has appeared in films like “Live Free or Die Hard” and “Zodiac.” He comes across more like a pitchman in a truck ad than a retail spot. Indeed, Mr. Lacy is first glimpsed inside the cab of a truck, part of a caravan delivering Sears lawn and garden products. The trucks drive past a Lowe’s store before setting up the merchandise in a parking lot near a Home Depot. “There’s a lot of home improvement centers out there,” he says, “but does paying more for less mower really improve anything? You deserve better.” Sears will “put our money where our mouth is,” Mr. Lacy says, by offering a lowest-price guarantee,” adding, “You won’t find a better deal there or there,” pointing to the Lowe’s and Home Depot stores. “It’s a turf war, ’cause your lawn is worth fighting for,” he concludes. The campaign is “purposely aggressive and provocative,” said Bob Winter, chief creative officer at Y&amp;R Chicago, part of the Y&amp;R unit of Young &amp; Rubicam Brands, owned by WPP. “It’s definitely got a little bit of bravado,” Mr. Winter said, because Sears executives “feel it’s time to show bravado.” But it does not go too far, he added: “It’s a war. But it’s a war waged with riding mowers that max out at seven miles an hour.” The tone should appeal to potential customers, Mr. Winter said, describing them as “middle-aged suburban dudes” for whom “their lawn is their ultimate form of self-expression.” The campaign is arriving as Y&amp;R Chicago takes part in a review for the Sears creative account, with spending last year, according to Kantar Media, of $459.4 million, of which $12.3 million was devoted to lawn and garden products. • Asked what it was like to produce the campaign at such a precarious time, Mr. Winter replied: “We’re focused on the future, and doing the right thing for our client, no matter what. The review aside, our challenge is to provide them with innovative creative solutions to their problems, and we’re going to continue to do that.” Mr. Lee declined to discuss the review but said, “Y&amp;R really did a great job for us on this.” The Turf Wars do not seem to be prompting Sears’s rivals to wave white flags. For example, Home Depot and a company called Scanbuy are introducing a print campaign using mobile bar codes, or QR codes, to provide information about Martha Stewart Living merchandise.A RETAILER struggling to fend off increasing competition is borrowing a page from the marketing playbook of products like soft drinks and soup by naming its rivals in aggressive advertising.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/business/24retail.html?ref=homedepotinc">Saks Sees Faster Sales Gains, but TJX Is More Wary<date>Published: February 23, 2011</date><text>Saks, the department store operator, said it expected sales to grow faster this year, while TJX Companies, a lower-price retailer, was more reserved in its predictions.Upscale Saks is coming off its best holiday season in years, as shoppers resumed spending on expensive dresses, handbags and shoes by top brands such as Marc Jacobs, Versace and Oscar de la Renta, lifting sales at established stores by 8.4 percent in its fourth quarter. Saks forecast that same-store sales, sales at stores open at least a year, would rise by a ”midsingle digit” percentage this year. In contrast, TJX, whose chains include Marshalls and T.J. Maxx in the United States and Winners in Canada, said same-store sales this fiscal year would rise by 1 to 2 percent, far below its gains in recent years. TJX shares were down 1.83 percent, to $48.81, while Saks shares fell 2.55 percent, to $11.86. TJX buys merchandise at below-wholesale prices and sells it at a discount. Many shoppers, feeling better about their finances, have begun trading back up to department stores, as the holiday sales results of Saks and Macy’s show. TJX has mitigated that by getting vendors to make products specifically for its chains. For fiscal 2012, which ends next January, TJX forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.78 to $3.93 from continuing operations on same-store sales. Saks said overall sales rose 6.8 percent, to $866.3 million, in the quarter ended on Jan. 29. TJX said same-store sales rose 2 percent and reported a better-than-expected profit for the quarter, compared with a 12 percent increase the year before. TJX said it would raise its dividend to 19 cents a quarter, a 27 percent increase. Lowe’s Companies reported weaker same-store sales than Home Depot and issued a quarterly profit forecast below analyst expectations. The forecast overshadowed Lowe’s higher-than-expected fourth-quarter results and was made after Home Depot reported strong results and raised its profit forecast for the year. Lowe’s now expects first-quarter earnings of 34 to 38 cents a share. Analysts’ average estimate was 38 cents. It expects same-store sales to be about flat and operating margin to slide 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point. Lowe’s said net income rose to $285 million, or 21 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $205 million, or 14 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts expected 18 cents a share, Thomson Reuters said. Sales rose 3.1 percent to $10.48 billion, more than analysts’ average estimate of $10.45 billion. Lowe’s said same-store sales rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Same-store sales at Home Depot rose 3.9 percent globally and 4.8 percent in the United States. New Chief at Sears Holdings Sears Holdings Corporation named a new chief executive on Wednesday, ending a three-year search. The company, which runs Sears and Kmart, said its board had elected Lou D’Ambrosio as its new chief executive and president. Mr. D’Ambrosio, 46, served as chief executive of telephone and computer software company Avaya from 2006 to 2008, before stepping down for medical reasons. Before joining Avaya, he held executive positions at I.B.M. For the last six months, Mr. D’Ambrosio has been working as a consultant to Sears’ board.Saks, the department store operator, said it expected sales to grow faster this year, while TJX Companies, a lower-price retailer, was more reserved in its predictions.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/business/08shop.html?ref=homedepotinc">Retail Executives Depart, Some After Problems With Sales<date>Published: February 7, 2011</date><text>With the holidays over, it’s open season on executives at retail companies — especially because, for the first time in three years, many cannot blame their problems on the economy.“A whole bunch of people got away with murder because the recession was a convenient excuse,” said Mark A. Cohen, a professor at Columbia Business School who ran Sears Canada in the early 2000s. “The party’s over,” he added. “The promises made were either delivered or not.” In the last few weeks, retailers have issued a spate of announcements about executives who will be leaving, including top managers at Home Depot, Kenneth Cole, Gap Inc., J. C. Penney, Lowe’s and Hot Topic. The executive shuffle is not limited to retailers, as many companies report annual results in late January and early February and review their management ranks. But retailers are so dependent on holiday sales that January and February are often the best months for a shake-up. It’s like Hollywood after the Oscars are handed out: the winners and losers are clear. “If you’re going to make a change in retail, with a nine-month lead time,” said Adrienne Tennant, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets, “this would be the time to do it.” At some companies, the changes follow big problems with sales. At the teenage-focused store Hot Topic, for instance, sales at stores open at least a year have declined for the last 21 months, while competitors like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Zumiez have posted many months of positive comparable sales. Last week, Hot Topic announcedthat Chris Daniel, who oversees its Torrid plus-size division, would leave. Changes at other companies reflect new priorities. Lowe’s, for instance, has stressed that with no end in sight to housing woes, it will focus on cost-cutting and information technology to improve profit — like technology that localizes store assortments and picks the most profitable prices. In the last few weeks, Lowe’s has replaced its chief information officer, announced that its president and chief operating officer was retiring and would not be replaced, and said it would cut 1,700 middle-management jobs, while adding several thousand part-time sales workers on weekends. And J. C. Penney, while it is expecting improved results over 2009 for fiscal 2010, which it will report later this month, has signaled that changes are coming. In late January, it said it would close six stores, exit the catalog business and appoint two activist investors, William A. Ackman and Steven Roth, to its board. Earlier in January, J.C. Penney said its chief financial officer was stepping down. Gap Inc.’s Gap division got a makeover last week, too, as it dismissed Gap North America’s president, Marka Hansen; promoted the head of the Gap Inc. outlet stores, Art Peck, to replace her; named a global chief marketing officer; replaced its ad agency; and pulled all of its global design, public relations and marketing under one roof. The Gap North America division had posted annual decreases in sales at stores open at least a year since 2005. Even in fiscal 2010, as the company’s other divisions — Banana Republic North America, Old Navy North America and International — had positive same-store sales, Gap posted a 1 percent decline, on top of a 7 percent decline from 2009. Mr. Peck said in an interview that he was well aware of the sales problems. “If you look at the changes we’ve made, we’ve clearly indicated that we’re disappointed with the sales results as well,” Mr. Peck said. “You can’t go in this business from one hit, periodically, to another,” he said. “What I’m hoping we can work toward more of is consistency.” Of course, the companies rarely say that they are dismissing someone. One explanation said an executive would take “time off and then plan the next chapter of my life” (the president of Home Depot Canada, explaining her departure, on Jan. 12). Another said two are leaving the company “to pursue other interests” (from a regulatory filing by Kenneth Cole announcing the departure of the president of its Consumer Direct division, on Jan. 25, and from Lowe’s, announcing the departure of its chief information officer, on Jan. 20). Another believed it was “the right time for a change in the organization” (Gap Inc., announcing the departure of the Gap North America president, Feb. 1). Some companies are more direct. When, on Jan. 31, Hot Topic issued a press release about Mr. Daniel’s departure, the headline was, simply, “Chris Daniel Leaves Hot Topic, Inc.” John Long, a retail strategist at the consulting firm Kurt Salmon, said the improving economy made companies assess results, and executive performance, strictly. “As companies look at their performance for 2010, it’s clear that there are some performing better than others, and that provides a better yardstick,” he said. Among the winners: Duncan Mac Naughton of Wal-Mart. In September, Mr. Mac Naughton was among four people Wal-Mart named to take over merchandising duties after six consecutive quarters of declines in same-store sales. On Jan. 28, he was promoted to chief merchandising officer for stores in the United States.With the holidays over, it’s open season on executives at retail companies — especially because, for the first time in three years, many cannot blame their problems on the economy.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/business/29home.html?ref=homedepotinc">Home Depot Adds Martha Stewart to Help Woo Women<date>Published: January 28, 2011</date><text>In the spring, Home Depot hopes to turn a woman’s fancy toward redecorating.So it is pushing curtains in the hues of “tilled soil” and paint in “cornbread,” delicate almond-colored benches with matching scalloped mirrors and rugs in colors like “Wilderstein brook trout,” all designed by Martha Stewart. To simplify shopping, almost all Martha Stewart Living products carry an icon, like a moon or a star, so a buyer can assemble a coordinating living room or match pieces for a Martha-approved bath by selecting from a single line of stickers. “Our lives today are so busy that we look for simplicity, and I think what Martha brings to this particular product category is effortless coordination,” said Robin Marino, the president and chief executive of merchandising at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. “We’ve taken some of the intimidation out of it.” This year, Home Depot is recognizing that while women may be half of its customers, it has not catered to them in ways that translate into a larger market share. Without a housing recovery to revive sales of big items or major renovation supplies, Home Depot and its competitors are promoting smaller projects this spring, during what is the major selling season for home improvement stores. And that means sprucing up departments to get female customers excited about window treatments or new colors for makeovers of existing spaces. “People are starting to spend more money again, and we need to participate in that,” said Gordon Erickson, the senior vice president for merchandising and décor at the Home Depot. “For years, we’ve always had a bad — I don’t want to say a bad reputation, it’s more that people look at our business and think it is male-oriented, dominated,” Mr. Erickson said. “Fifty percent of our customers are female. We need to offer her products that she wants.” Lowe’s, which says it has had a female focus since its beginnings, has added a line of décor products like mood lighting and chrome toilet-paper holders to appeal to women. True Value recently opened a corporate-owned store near Chicago that had wider aisles, better lighting and clear signs, part of an effort to attract women. Home Depot is trying to balance a decline in big-ticket sales, items that cost more than $900, which usually means a big project is under way. Those have been decreasing at Home Depot since the middle of 2006, as homeowners put off expensive renovations or new-home purchases. “I think they know that that piece of the business is going to be lackluster,” said Colin McGranahan, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. So they “look at the entire décor category as an area where they have some opportunities, they haven’t done as well there, their market share hasn’t been as strong, the assortment hasn’t been as good,” he said. And adding the Martha Stewart products appeals to a sector that is more stable, Mr. McGranahan said. “The consumer that’s doing better in our environment is the middle- and upper-income consumer,” he said. “They’re trying to move people up in price point, trying to have a better offer.” Yet getting women to enjoy shopping at a warehouse store can be challenging, said Nelson Barber, who studies men’s and women’s shopping habits. Home improvement stores “have been viewed as ‘very large hardware stores’ where big, burly men go to purchase their tools and supplies,” said Mr. Barber, an associate professor at the Whittemore School of Business and Economics at the University of New Hampshire, in an e-mail. “These big-box stores need to appear less hardware- and more improvement-driven in the image, and reflect more women in their messages.” This is not the first time that Home Depot has tried to figure out what women want. It has been running Do-It-Herself workshops for female customers since 2003. In the early 1990s, it opened Expo Design Centers, showrooms with fresh flowers and other feminine touches. (It closed those centers in 2009.) The Martha Stewart products are aimed at getting women who are already visiting the stores to buy more. “We’re basically taking categories and merchandise that are underperforming, and working with Martha and her design team to add Martha products, replacing things that aren’t working,” Mr. Erickson said. The Martha invasion started with patio furniture, expanded into cabinets, draperies, carpets and paint, and this spring, will extend into lighting, vanity tables and bathroom décor. The icons on the pieces are meant to spur spending across different categories, so a woman can buy paint, rugs and countertops that coordinate, increasing how much she spends for each visit. “It doesn’t make sense if we can only do part of that room,” Mr. Erickson said. “If they just bought the vanity from us, I think we failed.” “We want the whole basket — we want the complete project,” Mr. Erickson said. Though Ms. Stewart’s company still makes most of its money from publishing, about 20 percent of its revenue comes from products sold at various retailers: bedding and cookware at Macy’s, leashes and dog sweaters at PetSmart and craft supplies at Michael’s. The Martha Stewart furniture at Home Depot is an echo, in many cases, of a line that Ms. Stewart sold at Kmart, an agreement Martha Stewart ended in 2009, after saying that the retailer had let her home products “deteriorate.” Still, the Home Depot line goes beyond the Kmart version with the product coordination along with categories like cabinets. “It’s the first time we’re really able to offer a full range of home improvement and home décor products under one roof,” Ms. Marino said. Lowe’s is similarly catering to women who seek simplicity in shopping. It designed its stores with less steel and more wood tones, and “comfort zones,” areas where customers could review paint samples or plan for remodeling. Lowe’s has been expanding its Allen &amp; Roth line, which, like the Martha Stewart line, offers products in several categories, like chandeliers and clocks. “Life is very busy — with the economic situation as it has been, there’s a lot of stress,” said Melissa Birdsong, vice president of trend, design and packaging management for Lowe’s. “What we’re hearing from our customer is ‘Make it simpler for me.’ ” And make it cheaper: “Of course, budget is the big thing, so offering things and ideas for even small projects is a good way to keep people engaged with their home,” she said. Despite the stores’ efforts, female shoppers say they can still feel uneasy in the home improvement environment. Lauren Butler grew up helping her parents with home improvement projects. Since she and her husband bought a house, they have been doing projects like replacing rugs with hardwood floors and tiling the bathroom. She likes Home Depot, she said, because the clerks are friendly, and she was pleasantly surprised to find the Martha Stewart products there, especially at prices comparable to the other items sold in Home Depot. Still, she said, home improvement stores in general could make even women who are adept at home improvement feel unwelcome. “Sometimes they seem to feel like you’re just a girl, you don’t know what you’re doing, you need to get your husband in here,” said Ms. Butler, 24, who lives in Loxley, Ala. “It’s intimidating for any female to walk into a home improvement store.”In the spring, Home Depot hopes to turn a woman’s fancy toward redecorating.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/opinion/23sun4.html?ref=homedepotinc">Hallowed Ground<date>Published: January 22, 2011</date><text>In Commack, on Long Island, a little graveyard lies surrounded by chain-link fence and buried in snow.

Once Indians roamed pleasant woods here, then it was farmland, property of the well-to-do Burrs, who came from England in 1630. They tilled the soil, ran a hotel, bred horses and buried their dead near the corner of Larkfield Road and Jericho Turnpike. Then the suburbs filled in. If you asked for directions to the fabled hole in the suburban soul, you might end up here, where the emptiness has been wrapped in the tightest gauze of retail. How good, then, to find wrinkles in time that crack the asphalt’s smoothness, places where a few human dead have resisted the insult of being paved over and forgotten. Web searches turn up such stranded graveyards all over the country — Oklahoma, Georgia, Tennessee. In Lombard, Ill., near Chicago, immigrant ghosts may well haunt a mall.

As the first lady, Michelle Obama, highlights child obesity and urges regular exercise, providing play spaces is a winning cause for the food and beverage companies, which are under fire for high calorie snacks and drinks. Dr Pepper/Snapple Group pledged $15 million this month to build or fix 2,000 playgrounds over the next three years. “A fit and active lifestyle is one of our philanthropic goals,” said Tina Barry, senior vice president for corporate affairs at the company’s headquarters in Plano, Tex. “Playgrounds align with that.” In October, Kraft Foods made playground-building a centerpiece of its annual company “Delicious Difference Week.” About 1,300 employees, including the chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, built 13 playgrounds, including one in Washington Park on the South Side of Chicago, at a total cost of more than $1.4 million. Kraft, too, counts healthful lifestyles, along with ending hunger, as a top philanthropic priority. “It’s huge — getting children excited about play,” said Nicole Robinson, the vice president of the company’s charitable arm, the Kraft Foods Foundation. Kraft and other companies that provide money for playground construction say they have not studied whether their contributions increase public awareness of their brand. Corporate-financed playgrounds typically bear a plaque with the company’s name and receive a flurry of local news coverage. Kraft’s playground projects are “a huge boost to the company’s reputation, and add to its credibility,” Ms. Robinson says. • Foresters, the life insurance provider, also has opted for playgrounds, recently pledging $1.5 million to build 20 in the United States, where the company, which is based in Canada, has most of its clients. “It’s a good fit for us,” said George Mohacsi, its president and chief executive. “And we get more bang for the buck when we build a playground, we put in something that people can use daily for a decade or more.” A. Dennis White, president and chief executive of MetLife Foundation, said his company regularly finances playgrounds to promote physical fitness. The company has donated $850,000 in the last three years for 400 play spaces in the United States and Mexico. “It’s something that can be built in a day, and we like the visibility it gets in the local community,” Mr. White said. Once upon a time, playgrounds were largely the province of schools or municipalities, but with plummeting local tax revenues, they are ripe for corporate support. This dovetails with a recent study that found companies are allocating their charitable giving — whether it is goods, services or cash — more toward community needs instead of grand goals such as alleviating world hunger. Basic needs were the only categories in which corporate cash contributions increased last year, according to the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy’s annual corporate giving report, which used information from 171 major companies, including 61 of the Fortune 100. Companies financing playgrounds often work in partnership with Kaboom, a nonprofit group based in Washington, which recently drew praise from Mrs. Obama. It has a comprehensive plan to include the community and company volunteers in designing, building and maintaining play spaces. Kaboom has nearly 300 corporate partners, including Home Depot and Kimberly Clark. Darell Hammond, its chief executive, said companies need to spend $75,000 to $500,000 to create a public playground, depending on whether the floor is rubberized. Companies are drawn to the idea because “playgrounds bring the community together,” Mr. Hammond said. “It’s almost a new town square.” Other companies work with nonprofit organizations like Shane’s Inspiration or Boundless Playgrounds, to create play areas that are accessible to disabled children. This fall, CVS worked with the Pepsi Refresh Project to give $70,000 to construct the playground proposal from the public that had won the most votes on the project’s Web site. A Fort Wayne, Ind., playground proposal was selected and will be built in 2011, said Eileen Howard Dunn, senior vice president for community relations for CVS Caremark. CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., has spent $3 million in recent years to finance 65 playgrounds around the country, and has pledged to build 10 more next year as part of its $25 million “All Kids Can” initiative to help disabled children. With charitable cash in shorter supply, companies are encouraging employees to volunteer. The corporate philanthropy committee report found that in the last three years, 20 percent more companies offer paid time during the workday for employees to volunteer. • Companies devoting resources to building playgrounds, which typically are in areas that are home to a concentration of their employees, say that worker engagement and satisfaction are important considerations in choosing the playground option. “Employees who participate feel a sense of community whether they participate for the one day or for the six months of planning,” Ms. Robinson, of Kraft, said. “And any company really receives a halo.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/business/17shop.html?ref=homedepotinc">Wal-Mart Profit Rises, but Same-Store Sales Fall<date>Published: November 16, 2010</date><text>The tepid economic recovery does not seem to be extending to many of Wal-Mart’s customers in the United States, lower-income consumers who are not yet spending. The nation’s largest retailer reported Tuesday that sales in its American stores open at least a year, a crucial measure of retail health, had declined for the sixth consecutive quarter.Net income at Wal-Mart Stores rose 9.3 percent, to $3.44 billion, or 95 cents a share, in the third quarter, which ended in October, because of international growth and cost-cutting. Revenue rose 2.6 percent, to $101.95 billion. The earnings were in line with analysts’ estimates; revenue came in slightly below what analysts had expected. In the United States, where revenue dropped 1.3 percent in Wal-Mart stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales, executives said that they were continuing with changes like increasing the number of items for sale, adding more $1-and-under products and underselling competitors. Still, visits to Wal-Mart’s American stores declined from a year ago, as did the average price paid at checkout, Wal-Mart executives said. “They’re focused on necessities and being practical with how they spend their money,” Charles M. Holley Jr., executive vice president for finance, said of customers in a call with reporters. “We still see what we call the paycheck cycle, where you see the spikes in comps the day or two after a payroll check,” or after shoppers receive government payments, he said. “It’s every bit as pronounced as we’ve seen it.” This summer, Wal-Mart made management changes at its United States division, putting Bill Simon in charge and replacing the head of merchandising. Mr. Simon has been increasing the inventory Wal-Mart carries, adding back merchandise that had been removed to present a less cluttered look. “Last year we probably played our cards a little bit too close to the vest on inventory, and may have missed out on some sales — we’re trying to avoid that here in the fourth quarter,” Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, Thomas M. Schoewe, said Tuesday. As a result, inventory was up 6.5 percent in the third quarter in Wal-Mart’s American stores, compared with the period a year ago. Mr. Schoewe said Wal-Mart was being more aggressive about having enough goods in stock for holiday shoppers. And Mr. Schoewe and Mr. Holley said that while the stores would have low prices, particularly on basics and practical gifts, they did not expect reduced profit margins in the fourth quarter. Wal-Mart executives have said that they expect positive same-store sales in the fourth quarter, though in the earnings report, the company said the range could be from a decline of 1 percent to an increase of 2 percent. Mr. Schoewe said in the call with reporters that the focus should be on the midpoint of that range, growth of 0.5 percent. While Wal-Mart cited economic pressures for the slow United States results, Craig Johnson, president of the consulting firm Customer Growth Partners, argued that competitors like the Aldi discount chain, dollar stores like Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, and Wal-Mart’s own Sam’s Club division all grew in the third quarter. “Blaming the economy doesn’t work,” Mr. Johnson said in an e-mail. “Wal-Mart U.S. has clearly been knocked back on its heels by the competition.” In a bright spot in its American operations, the company showed growth in same-store sales of food, where Wal-Mart has added back more items than in any other category, Mr. Simon said. He cited marshmallows and pie filling as examples. International stores continue to be a sales driver for Wal-Mart, with sales rising 9.3 percent, to $26.92 billion. Wal-Mart Mexico and Brazil had particularly strong performances. Shares of Wal-Mart closed up 31 cents, or 0.57 percent, at $54.26, as investors were apparently encouraged by the company’s fourth-quarter guidance. Home Depot also reported earnings on Tuesday, beating analysts’ expectations on profit by 3 cents. The retailer, citing cost-cutting, said its earnings rose 21 percent, to $834 million, or 51 cents a share, from $689 million, or 41 cents a share. Analysts had expected profit of 48 cents a share. Total revenue was $16.6 billion, up 1.4 percent. Its same-store sales in the United States rose by 1.5 percent. But as with Wal-Mart in the United States, Home Depot said its average ticket — the average amount paid at checkout — was down, and consumers weren’t buying many expensive items. Purchases under $50, which make up about 20 percent of the company’s American business, rose 2.7 percent from the same period last year. But purchases of $900 and up, also about 20 percent of the business, fell 3.4 percent. “That, in many cases, is our pro customer,” the chief financial officer, Carol B. Tomé, said in an interview. “That’s all demand-driven, and if demand is soft,” the bigger sales will decline. “Clearly, the basic repair business is good, and it has been good — those are the tickets that are $50,” she said. Over all, store traffic, measured by the number of transactions, rose 2.5 percent, but the average amount per transaction decreased by 0.8 percent. Home Depot raised its earnings guidance for the full year to $1.94 a share, from $1.90. But with the housing market still shaky, “we still think this presents a picture of continued pressure in our market,” Francis S. Blake, the chairman and chief executive, said in a call with analysts. Shares of Home Depot rose 32 cents, or 1 percent, to $31.71. “While investors will be pleased with the solid operating performance, it is difficult to see much improvement in the home improvement sector,” a Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company analyst, Colin McGranahan, wrote in a note to clients. At the luxury end of the consumer sector, Saks posted a big increase in profit, as overall sales rose and it depended less on slashing prices. Its third-quarter net income was $36.3 million, or 20 cents a share, and included a $26.7 million gain related to the reversal of certain estimated income tax reserves deemed no longer necessary. Excluding this gain, Saks would have recorded net income of $9.7 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with $6.3 million or 4 cents a share, Sales rose 4.3 percent, to $658.8 million. Its same-store sales rose 5.7 percent, with women’s categories, including dresses, shoes, apparel and fashion jewelry, performing well.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/debt-be-proud/?ref=homedepotinc">Debt Be Proud<date>September 10, 2010, 9:50 am</date><text>Big bond offerings from Hewlett-Packard and Home Depot swelled U.S.investment-grade debt issuance to its highest weekly total since May 2008, Thomson Reuters data shows. There have been 35 investment grade offerings this week totaling $33.7 billion in debt, the most since the week of May 11, 2008, Thomson Reuters says. And this has been a holiday-shortened week. It is no mystery why American corporations are borrowing as much as they can: extraordinarily low interest rates and an uncertain outlook for the economy. Graham Bowley of The New York Times reported that non-financial companies were holding $1.8 trillion in liquid assets as of the first quarter of the year, up from $1.5 trillion a year earlier, when the financial crisis was still fresh. And such hoarding will have economic consequences, Mr. Bowley noted: Economists complain that apart from a few notable corporate acquisitions that were financed largely with pent-up cash, many businesses are sitting on their money rather than spending it. For now, that would seem to undermine the purpose of low interest rates, which is to get companies and consumers spending again. The boom in corporate bonds could go for some time, Mark Gongloff of The Wall Street Journal reported. With the stock market weak and Treasury yields unattractive, more companies may be tempted to come to market. “Investors definitely have more money than companies need,” said Patrick Sporl, a senior portfolio manager at American Beacon Advisors, told the Journal. That will be a boon for underwritiers. JPMorgan Chase is the leading underwrite for United States investment grade debt so far this year, handling 195 offerings with a total proceeds of $73.3 billion, Thomson Reuters says. Still, investment-grade issuance in the United States totals $478.8 billion so far this year, down 5 percent in the same period a year ago, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Who designed the plantings in the British Garden in Hanover Square, which Queen Elizabeth II formally dedicated on July 6? Was it Prince Charles? A. No member of the royal family had a hand in deciding what to plant in the garden, Rodney Johnson, vice chairman of the British Memorial Garden Trust, said in an e-mail. However, the garden’s designers, Isabel and Julian Bannerman, two award-winning British landscape architects, are best known for their work for the Prince of Wales, including designing the gardens on Charles’s estate at Highgrove, Gloucestershire. The Hanover Square garden, shown at right, was influenced by their work at Highgrove, Mr. Johnson said. Lynden B. Miller, the director of the Conservatory Garden in Central Park, oversaw the planting of the British Garden in preparation for the grand opening. She and Ronda M. Brands, her partner in their firm, Lynden Miller Public Garden Design, chose “tough plants for tough places,” Mr. Johnson said. Most of the plants and shrubs are present in Britain and are reminiscent of a British garden border. The garden was designed as an expression of Anglo-American friendship and to honor the 67 British citizens who were killed on 9/11. Ground was broken in 2005, and Prince Charles, who is officially its royal patron, dedicated its center stone that November. Charles’s son Prince Harry officially named the park in 2009. The plants include hydrangea, rhododendron, azalea, foxglove, holly and yew. And Mrs. Miller intentionally placed 67 Nandina shrubs, commonly known as heavenly bamboo, that weave through the garden bed to represent each one of the British subjects. Tunnel, Piece by Piece Q. Several years ago, a Second Avenue subway tunnel was begun, only to be abandoned when funds ran out. Where is this original tunnel? And does it connect to the current dig? A. The Second Avenue subway was first proposed in 1929. The start-and-stop nature of the long-delayed tunnel can be confusing. Here’s a summary by Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority: Three sections of tunnel were completed in the 1970s. They are located under the Bowery between Chatham Square and Canal Street, and under Second Avenue between 99th and 105th Streets, and 110th and 120th Streets. Phase 1 of the four-phase Second Avenue subway construction project is now under way. When Phase 1 is completed, it will carry passengers as far north as 96th Street from 63rd Street, where the new tracks will join the existing subway system. The empty northbound trains will need to travel beyond 96th Street for temporary storage and to relay into position for their next run. For that, they’ll use tracks that will be built in the 1970s-era tunnel between 99th and 105th Streets. The two other sections of tunnel from the 1970s will be put to use as further phases of the subway are built. Not the Usual Orange Q. What did the Home Depot on 23rd Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas used to be? The building’s facade is old and ornate and looks nothing like that chain’s regular stores. A. The building at 28-40 West 23rd Street, where Home Depot opened in 2004, used to house showrooms and offices of Hasbro, the toy company. Located in a landmark Chelsea district, the building was once Stern’s department store; it was built in 1878 and expanded through the 1890s. Disappearing Judges Q. Judge Crater is still missing. Were there any other New York judges who have mysteriously disappeared? A. Justice Joseph Force Crater, 41, was a Tammany judge with an eye for showgirls. On Aug. 6, 1930, he bought a theater ticket, cashed two checks for about $5,000, had dinner in Manhattan with friends, stepped into a taxi, waved goodbye and rode into history. His disappearance is still New York City’s most famous missing-judge case. (It is officially open, but inactive.) But it isn’t the only one. On Dec. 12, 1829, John Lansing Jr., 74, a retired justice of the State Supreme Court and former mayor of Albany, was on a Lower Manhattan pier, preparing to return to Albany for the holidays. He had left the City Hotel in Lower Manhattan to mail some letters and, according to a Lansing family genealogy, was last seen walking toward the Albany steamboat. Justice Lansing was a wealthy landowner upstate, a member of an aristocratic family, who had served in the Revolution and had been an anti-Federalist delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. History remembers him perhaps most vividly for presiding at a sensational murder trial in 1800 in which both Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr were counsels for the defense. Levi Weeks was acquitted of killing Elma Sands, whom he had courted and whose body had been found in a well, after Justice Lansing told the jury he did not think there was enough evidence for a conviction. Judge Crater, on the other hand, was most famous just for disappearing. Watch Your Step Q. What are the most dangerous streets for pedestrians in New York City? A. Anyone interested in the subject of pedestrian accidents in the city should look at the City Department of Transportation’s new Pedestrian Safety Report and its supplemental online information. While the report, which examined more than 7,000 pedestrian accidents, did not rank specific streets, focusing instead on dangerous intersections, it did describe the most dangerous type of street: “Arterial streets (typically wide signalized streets that carry high volumes of traffic) account for about 60 percent of pedestrian fatalities but only 15 percent of the total road network.” In addition, pedestrian accidents on such streets are deadlier than those on other streets, the report found. The arterials, which have few limits to traffic access and are often two-way, tend to go through dense residential and retail areas, commonly following bus and subway routes, and get a lot of pedestrian traffic. Wider streets are more dangerous, the report found. “Within Manhattan, a disproportionate number of pedestrian crashes occurred on major two-way streets,” the report said, naming Canal, 14th and 125th Streets, Park Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard as examples. Three of the four intersections with the greatest number of serious or fatal pedestrian accidents from 2002 to 2006 were in the Bronx, the report found. The four were Grand Concourse at East 167th Street, with 10 fatal or severe pedestrian crashes; West Fordham Road at University Avenue (8 crashes); East Broadway at Forsyth Street in Manhattan (8); and East Fordham Road at Webster Avenue (7).

Both Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot posted second-quarter profits on Tuesday that beat analyst estimates, and both slightly raised their full-year earnings guidance for the year. Yet their results suggested that American consumers were not spending as much as had been expected. “Both of them managed to get to earnings through something besides sales,” said David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets. “I think things are getting worse, not better, for consumers.” Meanwhile, the luxury department store Saks reported a second-quarter loss that was lower than anticipated because it sold more items at full price. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said that its strategy of aggressive discounts had not worked as well as it had hoped. Sales at stores open at least a year in the United States, a crucial indicator known as same-store sales, fell for the fifth consecutive quarter. That steady decline means those stores are in worse shape than they were at the heart of the recession. Wal-Mart said that the spate of discouraging news prompted it to rethink strategies that it had tried to persuade customers to begin spending again, including deep price cuts. Net income at Wal-Mart rose 3.6 percent, to $3.6 billion, or 97 cents a share, from $3.47 billion, or 89 cents a share, in the second quarter a year ago. That beat the 96 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. “Even though we had some fairly dramatic price reductions, those reductions weren’t enough to drive the traffic we had hoped for,” the chief financial officer, Thomas M. Schoewe, said in a conference call. “The customer’s under pressure, and that’s the main reason why the rollbacks didn’t work as well as we had hoped.” Spending patterns at Wal-Mart suggest its customers have been hit particularly hard by the recession. Mr. Schoewe said the company saw spending that moved in tandem with paycheck cycles, with customers buying more as soon as their paychecks were cashed, and little as those paychecks ran out. Mr. Strasser of Janney said that Wal-Mart’s shifting strategies indicated the retail giant was “a little bit lost” in navigating the economic downturn. “They’re operating their business, quite frankly, not very well at the moment,” he said. The company is putting some items it had cut back into stock, after customers expressed frustration at losing those options. And at about two-thirds of its stores in the United States, it is adding promotional merchandise back into the middle and sides of its main aisles, which it had cleared in an effort to declutter the stores. Sales at Wal-Mart rose about 2.8 percent, to $103 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected $105.3 billion. The retailer raised its full-year earnings estimates to a range of $3.95 to $4.05 a share, up from $3.90 to $4.00. Over all, net sales for the quarter increased 2.8 percent from a year earlier, driven by international growth. At Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer, plans for a rebound went a bit off course as the economy faltered. The company has lowered its sales forecast growth for the year to 2.6 percent, from 3.5 percent. “Customers are looking for value,” said Carol B. Tomé, chief financial officer and executive vice president of corporate services, in an interview. She said that although the company expected store visits to be up in the second half, it did not expect them to be spending much more per visit. Home Depot reported that its earnings rose 6.8 percent from the second quarter a year ago, to $1.19 billion, or 72 cents a share, mostly because of cost-cutting and slightly more foot traffic in stores. Analysts had forecast earnings of 71 cents a share. Home Depot raised its earnings guidance for the year to $1.90 a share, from $1.88, but lowered its sales forecast, reflecting a weaker-than-expected recovery. Home Depot began to see a slight improvement from last year in same-store sales in the United States, which increased 1 percent from a year ago, the third consecutive quarterly increase. At Saks, which had sold many of its luxury offerings at deep discounts in late 2008 and early 2009, the company decided to stock fewer items to get consumers buying them at full price again. Saks’s loss in the quarter was $32.2 million, or 21 cents a share, an improvement from the $54.5 million it had lost a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a loss of 17 cents a share. Its sales increased 5.1 percent, to $593 million, and same-store sales increased 4.6 percent from a year earlier. “We’ve seen a substantial increase in our full-price selling,” the chairman and chief, Stephen I. Sadove, said in an interview. “If they know there’s only two size 5 shoes and two size 7 shoes left and you better buy it or there may not be any more available, it starts training behavior that if you wait for it to go on sale there’s a good chance it may notbe there.” Saks has also been asking designers to offer “good-better-best” products to meet shifting spending habits, so even a high-end brand would offer a range of prices. “A large number of thebest designers have been very proactive in offering, within their brand, good-better-best price points,” Mr. Sadove said. Saks said it would close Saks Fifth Avenue stores in Mission Viejo, Calif., and Plano, Tex.; in July, it closed three other stores.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/led-bulb-edges-below-20/?ref=homedepotinc">LED Bulb Edges Below $20<date>August 11, 2010, 6:09 pm</date><text>This week, Home Depot fired a new marketing salvo in what is expected to be a broader national effort to get home customers to adopt LED lighting. The Home Depot A 40-watt-equivalent bulb sold online at Home Depot. The retail giant began selling some light bulbs in its highly energy-efficient lineup at a surprisingly affordable price of just under $20 online. Bricks-and-mortar stores will follow in September. While $20 hardly sounds like a deal at first blush, such bulbs are expected to last as long as 30 years. Not long ago, such bulbs were not expected by most experts to cost less than $30 until 2012. That’s the year, of course, when a federal law takes effect requiring that all bulbs sold in the United States be 30 percent more efficient than current incandescent bulbs. Even with improvements, incandescent bulbs are not expected to meet those standards, so many manufacturers are working on pushing their LED bulbs. Unlike compact florescent bulbs, which have been unpopular with consumers because of the pallid light they cast, some newer LED bulbs are closer to the warmth and brightness of the regular incandescent. Home Depot says it is actively encouraging consumers to compare. Home Depot is working with a Florida manufacturer, the Lighting Science Group, that also does contract work with National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Other manufacturers like the light bulb colossus General Electric have their own entrants in the affordable LED market. A company spokeswoman said that the bulbs, which are sold under the EcoSmart label, are already so popular with consumers that they are having trouble keeping them in stock.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/nyregion/18knives.html?ref=homedepotinc">Manhattan Stores Accused of Selling Illegal Knives<date>Published: June 17, 2010</date><text>At least 14 retail stores in Manhattan — including major retailers like the Home Depot, Eastern Mountain Sports and Paragon Sports — have been selling illegal knives, District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said on Thursday.But under agreements reached with the district attorney’s office, seven of the stores removed illegal knives from their shelves, agreed to forfeit profits they made from selling those knives over the past four years and agreed to finance a campaign to educate the public about illegal knives, Mr. Vance said. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to bring criminal charges against the companies. The agreements came after an operation months long in which investigators from the district attorney’s office were able to buy 43 illegal knives, Mr. Vance said. “Clearly, there are a number of stores and individuals who have been brazenly and knowingly violating the law in this area,” Mr. Vance said at a news conference, where he was joined by Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, and Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. “What makes these knives so dangerous is the ease with which they can be concealed and brandished,” Mr. Vance said. The knives generally fall into one of two categories: switchblades and gravity knives. On a switchblade, the blade pops out at the simple flip of a switch; with gravity knives, the blades come out by a simple flick of the wrist. Carrying either of those kinds of knives is a crime under New York State law, prosecutors said. A spokesman for Home Depot, Stephen Holmes, said the company did not know that the knives were illegal in New York. As soon as prosecutors contacted the company, it immediately removed the knives from its two Manhattan stores and is removing them from all locations in the state, the spokesman said. “These are common knives,” Mr. Holmes said, adding that contractors and homeowners often used them “for various home-improvement projects.” “We simply didn’t know that they were being used for any other purpose,” he said. At least seven stores accused of selling illegal knives to investigators have not entered into agreements with the district attorney’s office, but Daniel R. Alonso, Mr. Vance’s chief assistant, said he expected that all of them would ultimately cooperate. Mr. Vance said he expected the forfeitures by the stores to total nearly $1.9 million. Just more than half of that money will go to the city, 10 percent to the state and the rest to law enforcement agencies, he said. So far, more than 1,300 knives have been surrendered to his office, Mr. Vance said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/realestate/commercial/09chain.html?ref=homedepotinc">Cape Cod Residents Keep the Chain Stores Out<date>Published: June 8, 2010</date><text>PROVINCETOWN, Mass. — It was a family-owned T-shirt shop that sent Barbara Rushmore on a mission to ban chain stores from this quaint and quirky seaside town.“Cuffy’s came to town and demolished the business of many who designed and made their own shirts in their stores,” said Ms. Rushmore, a self-described gadfly who has also championed town bans on pay toilets and cigarette vending machines. Though Cuffy’s has just two locations, both on Cape Cod, it is known for its Wal-Mart-like low prices: A recent sale at its Provincetown branch, opened in 2007, offered three hooded sweatshirts for $9.99. Its success with tourists here was instant. “It occurred to me that, as bad as that is, imagine if we got a Burger King or McDonald’s?” Ms. Rushmore said. Stores like that would threaten the many independently owned businesses in town, she said, and compromise Provincetown’s small-town New England charm. She drafted an amendment to the town’s zoning bylaw aimed at discouraging chain stores, or “formula businesses,” as they are legally termed. It would do this by requiring them to obtain both a permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals and site plan approval from the Planning Board. Residents approved the amendment at the annual town meeting in April by a vote of 91 to 24, well above the two-thirds majority required. It immediately became law, though it can still be overturned by the state attorney general, Martha Coakley, whose decision is due by July 13. The antichain store movement has been gaining momentum across the country for years, with towns like McCall, Idaho; Port Townsend, Wash.; Ogunquit, Me.; and Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., enacting laws that restrict such businesses. The ordinances work in one or a combination of ways: by requiring formula businesses to be approved for permits on a case-by-case basis, by not allowing such businesses to open at all in certain defined districts, by capping the number of chains allowed in the town, or by requiring chains to meet certain conditions. Such laws are typically motivated by concerns about independent stores not being able to compete economically with large corporations, and about creative communities becoming homogenized and losing their appeal. “Let them in, and you could wind up killing the goose that laid the golden egg,” said Stacy Mitchell, author of “Big-Box Swindle” (Beacon Press, 2006), and a staff member at the New Rules Project in Minneapolis, which advocates in favor of independently owned businesses and tracks local laws restricting chains across the country. In the area of Cape Cod and nearby islands, Nantucket restricted chain stores in its downtown in 2006, and since then the villages of Barnstable and Centerville and the towns of Dennis and Chatham have followed suit. In April, the state attorney general approved the bylaw in Chatham, where two residents championed the cause after a Dunkin’ Donuts opened in 2009. “The people in town were appalled,” said one of those residents, Norm Pacun, a retired lawyer. Along with Gloria Freeman, Mr. Pacun examined 50 similar bylaws around the country before presenting their own via petition, with 300 signatures, at a town meeting. “It was a combination of aesthetics and an attempt to retain the historic identity of this town,” Mr. Pacun said. The impulse to ban chain stores is not new, said Richard C. Schragger, a professor at the University of Virginia law school. In the 1930s the rapid expansion of Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company grocery stores gave rise to taxes on chains to prevent unfair competition. But today’s movement, as Mr. Schragger sees it, has different motivations. “In the ’30s, it was about economic protectionism,” he said. “Today it’s about aesthetics, traffic, things like that — particularly in resort communities or in communities with a lot of wealth.” In her Provincetown bylaw, Ms. Rushmore said an influx of chain stores would “have a negative impact on the town’s economy” as well as its “historical relevance” and “unique character.” It names the entirety of Provincetown as a Formula Business Regulated District, and then lays out the defining characteristics of a such a business, which must be one of 10 or more branches worldwide. In addition, a “formula business” would have to meet at least three of several criteria, including having a standardized menu or array of merchandise, and requiring standardized uniforms or signage. The town’s pre-existing formula stores — Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Marc by Marc Jacobs and Stop &amp; Shop currently among them — are grandfathered in. Although regulations like Provincetown’s would seem to raise concerns about restricting commerce, Mr. Schragger said they were legal if they were couched in terms of land-use or zoning, which local governments had the power to regulate. “So if it’s a land-use ordinance, a challenge based on the commerce clause of the Constitution will probably fail,” he said. “What these ordinances do is limit these businesses,” Ms. Mitchell said. “The laws don’t say ‘Starbucks can’t open,’ which would violate the Constitution. What they say is that Starbucks would have to create a unique coffee shop that wouldn’t be recognized as Starbucks. And, in general, this is a high enough hurdle to keep them out.” Opinions of the Provincetown bylaw among local business owners have been mixed. “If suddenly Home Depot and McDonald’s were to come in, it would be a different place. So I’m there in spirit,” said Frank Vasello, the owner of a deli called Relish as he wiped down a display case on a recent afternoon. “But I voted no. It didn’t feel quite right to me. I’m concerned about the capriciousness of it. And the idea that I’m going to regulate away competition makes no sense.” Also of two minds was Howard Burchman, an innkeeper, a homeless-policy consultant and the chairman of the local planning board, which had formally recommended that the vote on this issue be delayed until more research could be done. “It’s a challenging situation,” he said. “Provincetown is a unique community district. If we have homogenization of the district, we end up losing the reason why people want to come here. But there is a difference between preserving that district and establishing protectionist barriers. And I think that’s what this bylaw does.”PROVINCETOWN, Mass. — It was a family-owned T-shirt shop that sent Barbara Rushmore on a mission to ban chain stores from this quaint and quirky seaside town.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/business/economy/19shop.html?ref=homedepotinc">Wal-Mart Posts Slower Growth as Luxury and Home Goods Rebound<date>Published: May 18, 2010</date><text>It was an encouraging start to the year for a broad swath of the nation’s retailers. Major chains like Home Depot and Saks reported earnings on Tuesday that suggested the beginnings of a rebound in categories hit hard by the recession, like home improvement and luxury goods.At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores, a winner amid the downturn as consumers sought low prices, reported sluggish growth at its stores in the United States. Retailing analysts said that as the economy recovered, consumers who flocked to Wal-Mart in the depths of the recession were shifting some of their spending to other chains. “Did we lose some of the customers that we picked up before?” Thomas W. Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters. “Possibly yes.” But Mr. Schoewe said a more meaningful reason for the chain’s 1.4 percent sales decline at stores open at least a year was that gas prices were up more than 40 percent from last year — which prevented Wal-Mart’s core customers from shopping as often and spending as much. Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer and a barometer of American spending habits, said that, despite broader signs of economic recovery, the poorest American consumers remained under pressure. Wal-Mart cited as one example its customers’ use of food stamps, which it said was up significantly over last year. “More than ever, our customers are living paycheck to paycheck,” Mr. Schoewe said. “They’re very concerned about their own personal finances.” Even so, Wal-Mart’s earnings climbed about 10 percent thanks to strong international growth and cost cuts. “The low-income consumer appears to be the last coming out of the recession,” said Bill Dreher, a senior research analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. “But despite this sluggishness, the company showed an impressive earnings performance.” For the three months that ended April 30, Wal-Mart made a profit of $3.32 billion, or 88 cents a share, up from $3.02 billion, or 77 cents a share, last year. Sales for the quarter, the first of Wal-Mart’s fiscal year, increased 6 percent, to $99.1 billion. Sales at United States stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, declined 1.4 percent from a year ago. While high unemployment and gas prices were a drag on Wal-Mart’s domestic results, there were other factors. One was that the company stopped carrying some brands to streamline the appearance of its shelves. In a recorded call, Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s United States operations, said the company was restoring some of those brands, including 300 grocery items. “If we made some mistakes, we’ll correct those,” Mr. Schoewe said. “We’ll listen to the customer, and we’ll do the right thing.” Weak sales of discretionary merchandise, particularly apparel, which has been a trouble spot for the company, also dampened the results. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., said it also faced stiff competition during the quarter. To set itself apart, the company is offering more price reductions, which it calls “rollbacks.” Whether they are effective will not be known until the next reporting period. Wal-Mart shares rose 1.85 percent on Tuesday, to close at $53.71. Also on Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation’s biggest home improvement retailer, said that for the three months ended May 2, it made a profit of $725 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with a profit of $514 million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago. Sales for the quarter, the first of Home Depot’s fiscal year, increased 4.3 percent from a year ago, to $16.9 billion. Same-store sales rose 4.8 percent. Same-store sales in the United States increased 3.3 percent — the first quarter of growth since the end of 2005. Sales grew in almost every Home Depot region, even Florida and California. Every department had sales growth, too. Home Depot, which is based in Atlanta, attributed much of its growth to sales of seasonal goods like fertilizer, landscaping tools, grills and lawn mowers. While the results beat analysts’ expectations, executives tempered their enthusiasm. Sales of higher-priced discretionary items, like special-order kitchens, were soft. And while professional business — goods bought by contractors and builders — is improving, it is still weak. Transactions for receipts of $900 and more, which represent about 20 percent of Home Depot’s sales, were down 1.4 percent in the quarter. In the United States, the average receipt for the quarter declined 1.3 percent, to $52.01. Home Depot shares fell 2.42 percent on Tuesday, to close at $34.73. Another sector on the upswing is luxury goods. Saks, the upscale chain, posted a profit of $18.8 million, or 11 cents a share, for the three months that ended May 1, in contrast to a loss of 5.1 million, or 4 cents a share, last year. Sales for the quarter, the first of Saks’s fiscal year, were $667.4 million, compared with $624.3 million last year. Same-store sales rose 6.1 percent from a year ago. Saks’s shares fell 4.28 percent on Tuesday, to close at $8.94. Stephen I. Sadove, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said the results exceeded his expectations and that Saks, which is based in New York, was shifting gears “from defense to offense.” While luxury sales are not what they were at the peak of the boom, Saks said its customer traffic was higher, more merchandise was being sold at full price, and sales of clothing, handbags, shoes and jewelry were strong. “I feel very good about the outlook for the sector,” Mr. Sadove said Tuesday. “A year and a half, two years ago, people were asking ‘Is luxury dead? Will people ever pay full price again?’ What we’ve learned this year, certainly this last quarter, is that they’re paying full price, they’re responding to the concept of scarcity and they love brands.” Other retailers that reported earnings on Tuesday included Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, the upscale apparel store for teenagers, and TJX Companies, which owns discounters, including TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods. For the three months ended May 1, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch posted a loss of $11.8 million, or 13 cents a share. Last year it lost $59.2 million, or 68 cents a share. During the recession, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ceded market share to lower-priced clothing retailers. TJX, which thrived as consumers traded down for name-brand bargains, made a profit of $331 million, or 80 cents a share, for the three months ended May 1, compared to $209 million, or 49 cents a share, a year ago.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/us/08brfs-EXMAYORFACES_BRF.html?ref=homedepotinc">Louisiana: Ex-Mayor Faces Charges<date>Published: May 7, 2010</date><text>The state’s ethics board is charging former Mayor C.

Tuesday’s ruling by the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan affirmed a lower court’s findings in favor of Sears; its billionaire chairman, Edward Lampert; and the onetime Kmart chief executive Julian Day, Reuters reported. Mr. Lampert got a controlling stake in Kmart and became chairman when the retailer emerged from bankruptcy in 2003. Kmart then bought the former Sears Roebuck &amp; Company in 2005 to create Sears Holdings, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill. In the class-action lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that Kmart deliberately understated the value of its real estate assets by several billion dollars to give Mr. Lampert and Mr. Day a chance to acquire Kmart shares at less than their true worth. They said that when Kmart then sold some of the real estate to Home Depot and Sears Roebuck, its shares soared, giving it more ammunition to buy Sears.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image David McNew/Getty Images A Home Depot in Burbank, Calif. Lowe's and Home Depot had better-than-expected profits. Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Lowe's Cos Go to your Portfolio » Home Depot and Lowe’s, the nation’s largest home improvement retailers, posted better-than-expected earnings this week. They said that they did not have to turn to discounts as much as they did last year, and that some customers splurged on higher-priced goods and services like carpet installations. Of Home Depot’s top 40 markets in the United States, all but two showed year-over-year improvement in the most recent reporting period. Some markets in California and Florida, among the states hit hard by the recession, even had sales growth at stores open at least a year, a barometer of retail health. Frank Blake, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call on Tuesday that there was “cause for optimism in 2010,” though he described it as a transitional year, not a year of robust growth. “Calling the year ‘transitional’ doesn’t sound very exciting,” Mr. Blake said, “but we have been waiting for this transition for a long time.” For the three months that ended Jan. 31, Home Depot had a profit of $342 million, or 20 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $54 million, or 3 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 0.3 percent, to $14.6 billion, which executives attributed to store closings. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 1.2 percent  the first increase in years. Also, Home Depot increased its quarterly dividend for the first time since 2006. On Monday, Lowe’s posted a profit of $205 million for the three months that ended Jan. 29, or 14 cents a share, compared with $162 million, or 11 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales increased 1.8 percent, to $10.2 billion. Same-store sales declined 1.6 percent, but that was still the best performance in more than three years. Robert A. Niblock, the chairman and chief executive of Lowe’s, said during a conference call that the results suggested “that the worst of the economic cycle is likely behind us.” Yet while consumers appear to be taking on more discretionary home improvement projects, retailers are still under pressure. Mr. Blake underscored that the housing industry remained stressed, mortgage defaults continued to increase and unemployment was high. Mr. Niblock of Lowe’s noted that the industry was still contending with “the psychological impact of consumers wondering when home prices will finally bottom.” Indeed, Home Depot’s professional business  merchandise typically bought by builders and contractors  was weak, though the rate of decline was not as bad as in previous months. The company’s worst-performing categories included lumber, hardware, electrical goods and other high-priced construction-related categories. Lowe’s, too, said sales to its commercial business customers were soft. Both Home Depot and Lowe’s said that the average amount spent at their cash registers declined from figures in the period a year earlier, though that was not exactly bad news. “It’s still down, but down a lot less,” Carol Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said in an interview on Tuesday. “We were very pleased with that.” Sales in Home Depot’s most recent reporting period were driven by the kitchen and bath, paint, flooring and plumbing categories as well as its international businesses. Sales in maintenance and do-it-yourself repair categories continued to be strong. So were simple décor-related categories like ceramic tile, carpet, paint, faucets and bath fixtures. Transactions of $900 or more, which represent about 20 percent of Home Depot’s sales in the United States, declined less than 1 percent. As Craig Menear, Home Depot’s executive vice president for merchandising, put it: that is “a significant improvement compared to double-digit declines in previous quarters in 2009.” He attributed the improvement to consumers snapping up values in Home Depot’s appliances, water heaters and windows categories. Lowe’s said sales of flooring, cabinets and countertops were strong, a sign that consumers were willing to take on more costly projects. Both companies said their results were also helped by cost cuts. Analysts who study the home improvement industry predict a slow recovery. Mike Baker, a research analyst with Deutsche Bank, noted in a research report that the biggest threat to the sector’s recovery “is another leg down in housing, particularly as government stimulus factors dissipate.” Both Home Depot and Lowe’s predicted business would pick up toward the end of the year. For 2010, Home Depot expects earnings of $1.79 a share, and a same-store sales increase of 2.5 percent. Lowe’s said that for the year it expects earnings of $1.30 to $1.42 a share, and a same-store increase of 1 to 3 percent. Shares of Home Depot rose 43 cents on Tuesday, to $30.75; Lowe’s fell 26 cents, to $22.81.

Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Lowe's Cos Go to your Portfolio » Home Depot and Lowe’s, the nation’s largest home improvement retailers, posted better-than-expected earnings this week. They said that they did not have to turn to discounts as much as they did last year, and that some customers splurged on higher-priced goods and services like carpet installations. Of Home Depot’s top 40 markets in the United States, all but two showed year-over-year improvement in the most recent reporting period. Some markets in California and Florida, among the states hit hard by the recession, even had sales growth at stores open at least a year, a barometer of retail health. Frank Blake, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call on Tuesday that there was “cause for optimism in 2010,” though he described it as a transitional year, not a year of robust growth. “Calling the year ‘transitional’ doesn’t sound very exciting,” Mr. Blake said, “but we have been waiting for this transition for a long time.” For the three months that ended Jan. 31, Home Depot had a profit of $342 million, or 20 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $54 million, or 3 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 0.3 percent, to $14.6 billion, which executives attributed to store closings. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 1.2 percent  the first increase in years. Also, Home Depot increased its quarterly dividend for the first time since 2006. On Monday, Lowe’s posted a profit of $205 million for the three months that ended Jan. 29, or 14 cents a share, compared with $162 million, or 11 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales increased 1.8 percent, to $10.2 billion. Same-store sales declined 1.6 percent, but that was still the best performance in more than three years. Robert A.

Despite a history of backing a few big names like Home Depot and Staples, American venture capitalists parked less than 1 percent of their money in retail over the past decade, with retail investments totaling $331.7 million in 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data. But now venture capitalists, who typically invest in start-ups, are backing companies that make retail technology. They seem to be betting that retailers, facing shaky growth prospects and fragile market shares, will seek these technologies. During the last decade, new retail technologies centered around helping retailers measure the efficiency of their online advertising. Now, retailers are looking to boost the efficiency of their overall operations. Venture capitalists speaking at a National Retail Federation conference on Wednesday said they have invested in advanced technologies that address concerns like merchandise loss and theft, as well as computer programs that help allocate goods between stores and optimize price markdowns. “E-commerce has been the stepchild to advertising technology in last five to seven years, and you’re seeing that flip because of the Great Recession,” said Neeraj Agrawal, a general partner at Boston-based Battery Ventures. Given their interest in new retail-oriented tech, venture capitalists are unlikely to pour money into old-fashioned stores. “We like capital efficiencies so we don’t particularly like bricks and mortar stories,” said Howard Morgan, a partner at First Round Capital and a former president of tech company incubator Idealab. With heavy cash outlays and consumers who continue to move online, traditional retail can’t offer the same returns that the technology and biotechnology companies usually favored by venture capitalists can, said Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association. In fact, there are few funds left that still invest in traditional retailers at all. One example is Highland Consumer Fund, managed by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples. Investors instead are turning to online retailers, though they say the current crop is far more sophisticated than the cohort that yielded online pet store Pets.com, which imploded soon after a high-profile initial public offering a few years ago. For example, Battery Ventures pointed out that it has invested in Dallas-based clothier J. Hilburn, which sells custom men’s shirts, but has no stores, and First Round has backed online retro clothing store Modcloth. Despite two successful initial public offerings in the fall — by discount retailer Dollar General and teen apparel chain rue21, both backed by private equity firms — the venture capitalists don’t expect a slew of V.C.-backed retail I.P.O.’s. But the investors say that hasn’t kept them from investing, betting that the I.P.O. market will improve eventually. An I.P.O. and the sale of a company are two methods used by venture capitalists to get returns on their investments. “We’re looking five years out so we’re investing now because we do believe the exit environment is going to get better,” Mr. Morgan said, referring to the I.P.O. market.

''I am calling on Congress to provide new temporary incentives for Americans to make energy-efficiency retrofit investments in their homes, and we want them to do it soon,'' Mr. Obama said at his appearance in Alexandria, Va. He elicited a laugh from workers at the store when he added that ''insulation is sexy stuff.'' The White House says the retrofitting program will be similar to the Cash for Clunkers program, which offered rebates for trading in used vehicles for more-fuel-efficient ones. Mr. Obama wants Congress to look into consumer rebates for households that make energy-efficient upgrades to their homes. He said homeowners could get back their investments in energy efficiency in two to three years. ''What we want to do is create incentives that stimulate consumer spending because folks buy materials from home improvement stores like this one,'' Mr. Obama said, adding that such purchases would also spur job growth.

The retailer said it saw improvement in regions hit hard by the housing crisis. Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, said its profit declined 8.9 percent, but executives said that business had improved in areas hardest hit by the housing crisis, including Arizona, California and Florida. Some 36 of Home Depot’s top 40 markets performed better. Though the average transaction at the cash register declined 7.1 percent from last year, to $51.89, the rate of decline slowed from the previous quarter. For the three months ended Nov. 1, Home Depot earned $689 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $756 million, or 45 cents a share last year. Revenue fell 8 percent, to $16.36 billion. “There is still a great deal of pressure in the housing and home improvement markets,” Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Indeed, the chain’s weakest categories were goods typically used by professional builders  plywood, lumber, concrete, gypsum, electrical and millwork. And transactions for goods of $900 and above, which represent a fifth of Home Depot’s United States sales, fell about 10 percent, though that was less of a decline than in previous quarters. The most robust categories continued to be tied to do-it-yourself repair and small remodeling projects  paint, plumbing, flooring, garden, building materials, and kitchen and bath. Sales of items used for décor updates, like vinyl flooring and special-order carpet, were also strong. So were sales of products related to energy efficiency, as consumers hunted for ways to save money. Sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, declined 6.9 percent from the period a year ago. Same-store sales for United States stores fell 7.1 percent. The company gained market share, outperforming its main rival, Lowe’s. Shares declined 2.39 percent, or 66 cents, to close at $26.99. Also on Tuesday, Target, the most upscale of the nation’s discount chains, posted a profit after eight quarters of declines. For the three months ended Oct. 31, Target earned $436 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with $369 million, or 49 cents a share in the period a year ago. Revenue rose 1.1 percent, to $15.3 billion, but same-store sales declined 1.6 percent. “We’re very pleased with our third-quarter earnings performance,” Gregg W. Steinhafel, Target’s chairman and chief executive said in a news release. Target’s credit card segment profit increased to $60 million, up from $35 million last year, because of better portfolio performance. Saks, the luxury department store, also broke free from the trend of earnings declines, posting a modest profit, mainly because it controlled expenses. Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, said in a conference call that the environment “appears a bit more stable and predictable” and that in the long run, he was “confident luxury will rebound.” Customer traffic declined by low single digits, up from double-digit declines. And the average purchase at the cash register was flat to up slightly. In recent months Saks has cut its inventory to be in line with lower demand, and the chain introduced more affordably priced and exclusive merchandise to appeal to the new frugal-minded consumer. For the three months ended Oct. 31, Saks made a profit of $1.9 million, or a penny a share, in contrast to a loss of $43.7 million, or 32 cents a share, last year. Same-store sales declined 10.1 percent year-over-year. Revenue declined 8.5 percent, to $631.4 million, from $690.3 million a year ago. While the company said sales remained weak, certain categories  women’s designer sportswear, jewelry and some accessories  began to perform better. Shares of Saks rose 4.06 percent on Tuesday, or 26 cents, to close at $6.67. More good news on Tuesday came from TJX Companies, which owns chains including TJ Maxx and Marshall’s and has been on a tear as consumers seek out bargains. The chain posted record sales and earnings for the three months that ended Oct. 31. For the third quarter, the company had a profit of $348 million, or 81 cents a share, up 40 percent from last year. Same-store sales rose 7 percent from the period a year ago, and customer traffic was robust. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $5.24 billion.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times Customers visiting the 18-acre, $500 million Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market for cheap, name-brand shopping. A gargantuan mall right out of the heartland  or perhaps just Westchester and Queens  has set up shop in an area once known for arson, crime and an eight-story jail. And the mall comes with all the must-have accessories, like Home Depot, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Such was her exhilaration at the neighborhood’s new options that Keila Rivera, 32, a home health aide who lives a 10-minute walk away, visited the mall, at East 149th Street and River Avenue, every day for a week. She bought a Whirlpool washing machine at Home Depot; school supplies for her children, Rafael, 13, and Salsina, 12, at Staples; and clothes and pillowcases at Target. At BJ’s, she picked up bushels of food and cleaning supplies for her patient. “You only have to go inside, and you can find anything,” she said, eating some wings in BJ’s cafe. The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, as the three-block-long, orange-tinged mall is known, may be the maraschino cherry topping a revival of Mott Haven and other neighborhoods of the South Bronx that began more than two decades ago. Acres of abandoned or fire-gutted buildings and weed-strewn lots have been filled in with new suburban-style houses or rebuilt apartment buildings. Only a handful of empty lots remain, city officials say. “It says the Bronx is getting better and better,” said Tawanda Lewis, 36, who was shopping for school supplies with her sons, Wayne, 14, and Keyon, 9. But to her and the thousands of shoppers flocking to Gateway as more of the stores open, the mall is more than a symbol. It is a brass-tacks source of, well, brass tacks  and thousands of other necessities and frills, an enclosed emporium for cheap, name-brand shopping that the South Bronx has long been without. And it has lots of parking  2,800 spaces  that eases the strain of acquisition. Shoppers like Antonio Segarra, 58, an unemployed security guard, and his wife, Carmen Delgado, were leaving BJ’s, their baskets brimming with low-price bulk: a box of 150 Glad tall kitchen garbage bags for $7.99, a 25-pound bag of rice for $9, three packs of Hebrew National hot dogs for $6. “You can’t go wrong, man,” Mr. Segarra said. “We’re low income, and we can get pretty nice quantities of merchandise.” As they were waiting for Antonio Jr. to pick them up by car, Mr. Segarra acknowledged going a little overboard in spending $508. But he figured he would be able to stock his apartment for many months to come. The couple said there was a dearth of supermarkets and clothing stores near them, and the few that were there seemed more expensive than the shops at the mall. “They think we live in a rich area,” Ms. Delgado said. The 18-acre mall, which cost $500 million and will have a million square feet of shopping, occupies what was once the Bronx Terminal Market, which sprouted in the 1920s and at its heyday housed scores of fruit and vegetable vendors. In its final years, it had two dozen merchants, and its landlord was mired in court battles with the city. Hoping to transform an eyesore as well as the shuttered Bronx House of Detention, the Bloomberg administration offered tax breaks to a developer, the Related Companies, and paid for demolition. As part of the deal, Related, which built a successful, similar mall in once-blighted East New York, Brooklyn, agreed to transfer waterfront land to the city for a park.

So it does hurt. But on the other side, it brings more people to the area.” Rashid Ahmed, manager of Kidstop Clothing, said business had declined about 5 percent, but added that it might not last long. “We sell hip-hop clothing,” he said. “They sell Nikes and Guess.” Mr. Segarra said the mall should give the local economy a boost, particularly because so many workers lived nearby. “It’s good for everybody,” he said. “People who work here get paid, and they’ll shop here, too. That’s what you want. You want the money to stay in the community.” In fact, the mall is drawing shoppers from outside the community. Tracey Reed, 34, a lawyer, and her husband, Sean, 40, a financial manager, who live across the river in Harlem, were looking for a leveling tool and other hardware at Home Depot.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times Customers visiting the 18-acre, $500 million Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market for cheap, name-brand shopping. A gargantuan mall right out of the heartland  or perhaps just Westchester and Queens  has set up shop in an area once known for arson, crime and an eight-story jail. And the mall comes with all the must-have accessories, like Home Depot, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Such was her exhilaration at the neighborhood’s new options that Keila Rivera, 32, a home health aide who lives a 10-minute walk away, visited the mall, at East 149th Street and River Avenue, every day for a week. She bought a Whirlpool washing machine at Home Depot; school supplies for her children, Rafael, 13, and Salsina, 12, at Staples; and clothes and pillowcases at Target. At BJ’s, she picked up bushels of food and cleaning supplies for her patient. “You only have to go inside, and you can find anything,” she said, eating some wings in BJ’s cafe. The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, as the three-block-long, orange-tinged mall is known, may be the maraschino cherry topping a revival of Mott Haven and other neighborhoods of the South Bronx that began more than two decades ago. Acres of abandoned or fire-gutted buildings and weed-strewn lots have been filled in with new suburban-style houses or rebuilt apartment buildings. Only a handful of empty lots remain, city officials say. “It says the Bronx is getting better and better,” said Tawanda Lewis, 36, who was shopping for school supplies with her sons, Wayne, 14, and Keyon, 9. But to her and the thousands of shoppers flocking to Gateway as more of the stores open, the mall is more than a symbol. It is a brass-tacks source of, well, brass tacks  and thousands of other necessities and frills, an enclosed emporium for cheap, name-brand shopping that the South Bronx has long been without. And it has lots of parking  2,800 spaces  that eases the strain of acquisition. Shoppers like Antonio Segarra, 58, an unemployed security guard, and his wife, Carmen Delgado, were leaving BJ’s, their baskets brimming with low-price bulk: a box of 150 Glad tall kitchen garbage bags for $7.99, a 25-pound bag of rice for $9, three packs of Hebrew National hot dogs for $6. “You can’t go wrong, man,” Mr. Segarra said. “We’re low income, and we can get pretty nice quantities of merchandise.” As they were waiting for Antonio Jr. to pick them up by car, Mr. Segarra acknowledged going a little overboard in spending $508. But he figured he would be able to stock his apartment for many months to come. The couple said there was a dearth of supermarkets and clothing stores near them, and the few that were there seemed more expensive than the shops at the mall. “They think we live in a rich area,” Ms. Delgado said. The 18-acre mall, which cost $500 million and will have a million square feet of shopping, occupies what was once the Bronx Terminal Market, which sprouted in the 1920s and at its heyday housed scores of fruit and vegetable vendors. In its final years, it had two dozen merchants, and its landlord was mired in court battles with the city. Hoping to transform an eyesore as well as the shuttered Bronx House of Detention, the Bloomberg administration offered tax breaks to a developer, the Related Companies, and paid for demolition. As part of the deal, Related, which built a successful, similar mall in once-blighted East New York, Brooklyn, agreed to transfer waterfront land to the city for a park. The mall promised 2,500 retail jobs, and it has been good for freelance peddlers and car services, too. Dozens of food carts station themselves outside the mall as if it were nearby Yankee Stadium on game day. A line of gypsy cabs await the emerging, weighed-down crowds.

Chains Adjust to Smaller Projects<date>Published: August 21, 2009</date><text>In prerecession days, home improvement projects were usually grand, expensive overhauls of kitchens and bathrooms.

Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Phyllis LeDosquet is repainting her kitchen to save money before she moves to a new apartment. She says she is saving $200. In this economy, home improvement projects consist of painting the walls and replacing the jiggly toilet handle. “I’m not doing any major projects anymore,” Steve Miller said as he shopped for putty knives this week at a Lowe’s in a suburb of Chicago, “but just fixing what I’ve got.” For months, Mr. Miller, 51, had been planning to give his kitchen and bathrooms a face-lift. “Then the economy got bad, and I don’t want to run up any more credit,” he said. While the recession has caused consumers to pull the plug on exorbitant renovations, it has ignited a resurgence of small, do-it-yourself repair and maintenance projects. The trend has been so noticeable at Lowe’s and Home Depot that those home-improvement chains are taking steps to adjust. Lowe’s has added more staff to popular do-it-yourself departments, like paint and hardware. Home Depot also beefed up its paint department, adding new products like an all-in-one paint and primer, and a Rust-Oleum paint variety that promises to cover more surface area for the money. Unwilling to part with their dollars for glossy new cabinets and granite countertops, consumers are buying only what they need to keep their homes in good condition: plumbing parts, paint, hardware, flooring. And they are buying garden and lawn goods  fertilizer, birdseed, lawn mower and grill repair parts  for their backyards, where many penny-pinchers have spent their summer vacations. “Certainly we’re seeing a shift away from the professional to the do-it-yourself,” said Michael Souers, a retailing analyst with Standard &amp; Poor’s Equity Research. He added that the renovations consumers were putting off today might be put off indefinitely, because homeowners are unable to refinance or get credit lines secured by their home equity. At Home Depot, participation in the company’s free weekly do-it-yourself workshops has spiked, especially sessions about tile, floors and paint. In May, registration for the chain’s quarterly “do-it-herself” workshop for women who want to be handier was up 30 percent compared with last year. Home Depot does not track attendance at its weekly workshops, “but anecdotally we have consistently heard from stores that participation has been way up,” said Jean Niemi, a spokeswoman for the company. These days, shoppers are not just walking out of stores with free pointers, they are walking out after spending less than the cost of a pizza. The other day, Phyllis LeDosquet, a professor in the education department of Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, spent $9 in a Lowe’s store. “I’m painting my kitchen myself and saving $200,” said Ms. LeDosquet, 54, whose landlord asked her to paint her red walls white before moving out. “I also bought putty to fix the holes in the walls.” This wave of frugality has, of course, hurt sales at the nation’s home improvement chains. In the second quarter, sales at stores open at least a year fell 8.5 percent at Home Depot and 9.5 percent at Lowe’s compared with the period a year ago. Sales of costlier merchandise (checkout tickets above $900 at Home Depot, and above $500 at Lowe’s) declined by double digits. Even sales of home appliances are weak. On Thursday, Sears Holdings reported that same-store sales at its Sears operations in the United States sank 12.5 percent, much worse than analysts expected. The company said its results were hurt by lackluster sales of appliances amid a terrible housing market. Sales increased in the second quarter in only two of the 20 product categories at Lowe’s  nursery items and paint. Larry D. Stone, president and chief operating officer of Lowe’s, told investors in a conference call this week that those were the two most popular do-it-yourself categories. Craig Menear, Home Depot’s executive vice president for merchandising, expects the do-it-yourself trend to continue through the fall. “We are providing online tools to educate customers on the importance of weatherization and simple projects like caulking,” he told investors in a conference call this week, adding that Home Depot will offer “energy- and money-saving products along with fall project know-how.” Despite recent signs of stabilization in the housing market, including a jump reported Friday in the sales of used homes, the market is still quite soft by historical standards. A survey by Lowe’s found that 40 percent of consumers have a major home improvement project that they are postponing until the economy improves. “Most people are not spending money on home remodeling,” said Michael Beaulieu, a home builder and developer in Prospect Heights, Ill. “They will fix a leaky faucet, but that’s it.” More Articles in Business »In prerecession days, home improvement projects were usually grand, expensive overhauls of kitchens and bathrooms.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » Results posted by several chains in the last week beat analysts’ low expectations, but that was largely because the stores had cut costs, not because consumers had filled up their shopping carts. Second-quarter earnings declined year over year at Home Depot, Target, Lowe’s, Nordstrom, and Macy’s. Saks, Dillard’s, J. C. Penney and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch posted losses. And Wal-Mart, one of the most resilient chains in this economy, reported results that were about the same as last year. A notable exception was TJX, which owns big-box discount chains, including T. J. Maxx, and reported record second-quarter sales and earnings. Discounters continue to fare better than their midtier competitors as consumers trade down and buy only essentials. That trend, of course, has been especially troubling for luxury retailers. Saks, the upscale department store, said Tuesday that its year-over-year loss widened. For the three months ended Aug. 1, Saks lost $54.5 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $32.7 million, or 24 cents a share, for the period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, sank 15.5 percent. To cope, Saks cut costs, shrank its inventory and made changes to its merchandising and marketing strategies. Nowadays the chain’s emphasis is on value and exclusivity. In an example of retailers’ new plans to get consumers shopping again, Saks is introducing a private label men’s clothing collection and expanding its Off Fifth outlet business. “Growing Off Fifth makes even more sense in this environment as customers focus on value,” Stephen I. Sadove, the chairman and chief executive of Saks, said in a call with investors on Tuesday. “There’s less than 10 percent overlap between Saks Fifth Avenue and Off Fifth customers. So we’re essentially reaching an entirely different customer base with these stores.” In addition to opening more Off Fifth stores, Saks plans to fill them with more merchandise made exclusively for the stores, rather than fashions from earlier seasons. The new private label menswear collection will be in Saks Fifth Avenue stores this month. Until now, Saks’s private label program included mostly sweaters and other basics, Ronald L. Frasch, Saks’s president and chief merchandising officer, told investors on Tuesday. The chain is also working with its existing designers and brands to add new products at lower prices. Target, the chain known for chic design at low prices, has also been tweaking its strategy, offering more grocery items to lure struggling consumers. The chain said on Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings fell 6.3 percent compared with the period a year ago, though that was better than analysts expected. For the three months ended Aug. 1, Target earned $594 million, or 79 cents a share, down from $634 million, or 82 cents, last year. Sales fell 2.7 percent, to $14.6 billion. Jason Asaeda, a retailing analyst with Standard &amp; Poor’s Equity Research, told investors in a research note to buy Target stock because the chain is “strengthening its business with a growing assortment of value-priced consumables.” Home Depot, the big home-improvement retailer, reported a 7 percent earnings decline for the quarter on Tuesday, also better than analysts’ expectations. The chain has focused on offering customers new repair and maintenance items, which they have been buying instead of higher-priced discretionary goods. “This is the second consecutive quarter of positive transactions for tickets under $50,” Craig Menear, Home Depot’s executive vice president for merchandising, told investors in a conference call. For the three months ended Aug. 2, Home Depot earned $1.1 billion, or 66 cents a share, down from $1.2 billion, or 71 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Sales for the quarter fell 9.1 percent, to $19.1 billion, compared with last year. Same-store sales declined 8.5 percent for the quarter. Bucking the trend, TJX, which owns T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores, reported on Tuesday its best-ever second quarter earnings. For the three months ended Aug. 1, the company made a profit of $262 million, or 61 cents a share, up 27 percent from last year when the company earned 48 cents a share. Same-store sales rose 4 percent. “Our extreme values on exciting brands and fashions continue to resonate with consumers and drive extraordinary increases in customer traffic counts,” Carol Meyrowitz, the company’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. More than a dozen retailers plan to report their earnings results in the coming days. But analysts are not expecting many of them to repeat the performance of TJX. Ken Perkins, president of the research company Retail Metrics, expects the nation’s stores to turn in a ninth consecutive quarter of declines. And the weak sales trends are likely to continue into the third quarter.

Slurpees are a distant second. Skip to next paragraph Your Money GuidesCredit and Debit Cards » Add to Portfolio Wal-Mart Stores Inc Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » But as more customers use plastic to pay for even small purchases like these, she has watched a growing share of her revenue vanish in a stream of credit and debit card fees that retailers say raise the price of goods and sharply lift the cost of doing business. Merchants across the nation, from powerhouses like Wal-Mart and Home Depot, to gas stations, mom-and-pop restaurants and 7-Eleven, have spent years unsuccessfully fighting the biggest of these costs, known as an interchange fee, which generates an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion in income annually for banks that issue credit cards. But after Congress passed a law last month to protect consumers from excessive fees and interest on credit cards, merchants are mounting a fresh offensive. This time, they believe the momentum in Washington has turned in their favor. Legislation is winding its way through Congress, a government audit has been ordered and petitions are surfacing in hundreds of convenience stores, including Ms. Orzano’s 7-Eleven, encouraging customers to voice their opposition to the fees. “Congress sort of already illustrated the willingness to take on the credit card companies and the big banks,” said Keith Jones, a lobbyist for 7-Eleven. “We just feel like the job is half done.” And while large and small banks often clash on political agendas, they have formed a united front, joined by payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, to prepare for a furious battle on Capitol Hill. With profit from credit cards likely to diminish because of the new laws, they are determined not to absorb another major hit. “It’s a big deal to them, and they would be fully engaged in it,” said Kenneth J. Clayton, senior vice president for card policy at the American Bankers Association. Every time a consumer uses plastic, about 2 percent to 3 percent of the charge goes to banks and payment networks, which price the fee differently in different countries. Of that, the interchange fee is paid to the cardholder’s bank, and at roughly 1.8 percent of each purchase in the United States, according to June report by J.P. Morgan, it is the largest and most controversial of these costs. But retailers may have a tough time convincing Congress that consumers would benefit if the effective interchange rate, which has increased slightly in recent years, is dialed back. Many other countries, including Israel and Australia, have required banks that issue cards to reduce the fee. Yet there is little evidence that the savings were passed along. In Australia, where regulators required banks to cut the interchange rate for Visa and MasterCard purchases to 0.5 percent from 0.95 percent, the banks offset their loss by reducing rewards programs and raising annual fees, according to a 2008 report by the Government Accountability Office. A similar outcome could happen here, banks and card companies say. In response to 7-Eleven’s petition drive, MasterCard said the convenience store chain was really asking its customers “to claim that they want to pay more for their payment cards so 7-Eleven can increase its profits.” Bill Sheedy, Visa’s president for North America, added: “We really don’t think the legislation is going to move forward.” Banks say they incur substantial risk when offering credit cards, and must make enough of a return to continue to extend credit. Reducing interchange fees would cut profit at both the largest and smallest financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions, Mr. Clayton said. Of $100 charged to a Visa card, the merchant’s bank receives about $2.25, according to a hypothetical example used by J.P. Morgan in a June report. The bank forwards about $1.80  the interchange fee  to the cardholder’s bank. Both banks pay a fee to Visa, 10 cents apiece. The merchant’s bank then pays another nickel to a third-party processor and keeps the remaining 30 cents. While the fee for each purchase is small, combined credit and debit card payments at merchants have almost tripled over the last decade, to more than 58 billion swipes last year from about 20.7 billion in 1999, according to data compiled by the Nilson Report, a journal on the payment industry. Merchants say that makes their aggregate expense from the fees enormous  and there is no leverage to ratchet it down. “You’ve got to accept the card and pay whatever price the credit card companies want to charge, and by the way, they won’t talk to us about it,” said Mr. Jones, the lobbyist for 7-Eleven. At Target, for example, interchange fees represent the second-largest store-level expense, behind payroll. The costs are similarly eye-popping at Home Depot, where officials say they top the price of health care insurance for employees. “The amount of money we’re spending on interchange would put 10 associates in each of our stores,” Dwaine Kimmet, vice president of financial services for Home Depot, said at a recent conference on credit card fees. Even some government agencies have not been able to negotiate lower fees. According to a recent G.A.O. report, federal agencies paid out more than $200 million in interchange fees in 2007, the most recent year for which data was available. Some retailers simply refuse to accept certain credit cards. Costco, the nation’s largest membership warehouse chain, negotiated a lower interchange rate with American Express and does not take Visa and MasterCard in its stores. And last month, United Airlines began to force a small number of travel agencies to absorb credit card fees of 2 percent to 3 percent for ticket bookings, a trend that agents fear may distort ticket economics if other large carriers follow suit. United is not passing the fee on to consumers who book directly with the carrier. Merchants say the cost may have been justified when credit card transactions were largely done with paper, making processing far more cumbersome. But with bigger volumes and new efficiencies from technology, they argue, interchange fees are simply a cash cow for card companies that wind up lifting the costs of all goods. The credit card industry says retailers’ costs have surged simply because consumers are using plastic for purchases they would never have dreamed of a decade ago, like a cup of coffee or a Slurpee. Of course, the surge in transaction volume has been a boon for credit card companies: Visa’s stock price is around $60, and MasterCard’s is around $165. While they are down from highs hit just before the financial crisis, they are still well above the share price of card-issuing banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. Still, while legislation on interchange fees would not have stood a chance a few years ago when the economy was buoyant and banks were not under the political spotlight, the winds on Capitol Hill have shifted as public anger at banks  and credit card companies  has grown. “The target is still painted bright red on the forehead of every credit card issuer,” said Robert Hammer, a credit-card industry consultant. “It is a brutal, brutal year.” At a 7-Eleven in a blue-collar neighborhood in St. Louis, the owner, Mike Foster, is hoping the petition in his store will help convince Congress to approve curbs on interchange fees. He said he can make adjustments to curb other expenses in his store, but he cannot do anything to change interchange fees, which cost as much as much as $1,600 a month. “It keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger,” he said. “And I got zero control over it.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on July 16, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.The most profitable item at Patricia Orzano’s 7-Eleven store on Long Island is coffee. Slurpees are a distant second.

Merchants across the nation, from powerhouses like Wal-Mart and Home Depot, to gas stations, mom-and-pop restaurants and 7-Eleven, have spent years unsuccessfully fighting the biggest of these costs, known as an interchange fee, which generates an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion in income annually for banks that issue credit cards. But after Congress passed a law last month to protect consumers from excessive fees and interest on credit cards, merchants are mounting a fresh offensive. This time, they believe the momentum in Washington has turned in their favor. Legislation is winding its way through Congress, a government audit has been ordered and petitions are surfacing in hundreds of convenience stores, including Ms. Orzano’s 7-Eleven, encouraging customers to voice their opposition to the fees. “Congress sort of already illustrated the willingness to take on the credit card companies and the big banks,” said Keith Jones, a lobbyist for 7-Eleven. “We just feel like the job is half done.” And while large and small banks often clash on political agendas, they have formed a united front, joined by payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, to prepare for a furious battle on Capitol Hill. With profit from credit cards likely to diminish because of the new laws, they are determined not to absorb another major hit. “It’s a big deal to them, and they would be fully engaged in it,” said Kenneth J. Clayton, senior vice president for card policy at the American Bankers Association. Every time a consumer uses plastic, about 2 percent to 3 percent of the charge goes to banks and payment networks, which price the fee differently in different countries. Of that, the interchange fee is paid to the cardholder’s bank, and at roughly 1.8 percent of each purchase in the United States, according to June report by J.P. Morgan, it is the largest and most controversial of these costs. But retailers may have a tough time convincing Congress that consumers would benefit if the effective interchange rate, which has increased slightly in recent years, is dialed back. Many other countries, including Israel and Australia, have required banks that issue cards to reduce the fee. Yet there is little evidence that the savings were passed along. In Australia, where regulators required banks to cut the interchange rate for Visa and MasterCard purchases to 0.5 percent from 0.95 percent, the banks offset their loss by reducing rewards programs and raising annual fees, according to a 2008 report by the Government Accountability Office. A similar outcome could happen here, banks and card companies say. In response to 7-Eleven’s petition drive, MasterCard said the convenience store chain was really asking its customers “to claim that they want to pay more for their payment cards so 7-Eleven can increase its profits.” Bill Sheedy, Visa’s president for North America, added: “We really don’t think the legislation is going to move forward.” Banks say they incur substantial risk when offering credit cards, and must make enough of a return to continue to extend credit. Reducing interchange fees would cut profit at both the largest and smallest financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions, Mr. Clayton said. Of $100 charged to a Visa card, the merchant’s bank receives about $2.25, according to a hypothetical example used by J.P. Morgan in a June report. The bank forwards about $1.80  the interchange fee  to the cardholder’s bank. Both banks pay a fee to Visa, 10 cents apiece. The merchant’s bank then pays another nickel to a third-party processor and keeps the remaining 30 cents. While the fee for each purchase is small, combined credit and debit card payments at merchants have almost tripled over the last decade, to more than 58 billion swipes last year from about 20.7 billion in 1999, according to data compiled by the Nilson Report, a journal on the payment industry. Merchants say that makes their aggregate expense from the fees enormous  and there is no leverage to ratchet it down. “You’ve got to accept the card and pay whatever price the credit card companies want to charge, and by the way, they won’t talk to us about it,” said Mr. Jones, the lobbyist for 7-Eleven. At Target, for example, interchange fees represent the second-largest store-level expense, behind payroll. The costs are similarly eye-popping at Home Depot, where officials say they top the price of health care insurance for employees. “The amount of money we’re spending on interchange would put 10 associates in each of our stores,” Dwaine Kimmet, vice president of financial services for Home Depot, said at a recent conference on credit card fees. Even some government agencies have not been able to negotiate lower fees. According to a recent G.A.O. report, federal agencies paid out more than $200 million in interchange fees in 2007, the most recent year for which data was available. Some retailers simply refuse to accept certain credit cards. Costco, the nation’s largest membership warehouse chain, negotiated a lower interchange rate with American Express and does not take Visa and MasterCard in its stores. And last month, United Airlines began to force a small number of travel agencies to absorb credit card fees of 2 percent to 3 percent for ticket bookings, a trend that agents fear may distort ticket economics if other large carriers follow suit.

And that has remained the case. The era of operating easily on borrowed money is over, at least for now, for businesses as well as consumers. That in turn is changing the way companies operate, with profound effects on the economy. Unable to borrow on favorable terms, many companies have retrenched and some have gone into survival mode. But their caution has costs: Not only could it prolong the recession, but it could put them at a disadvantage to more aggressive competitors when the economy revives. While Home Depot has emerged from the credit crisis strong enough to borrow at attractive rates now, it has chosen not to do so. Mr. Blake has charted a course away from expansion, one that he holds out as a template for running a big company in postrecession America. In his view, the hard times and the less generous credit are restricting consumption and undermining the corporate expansion that drove economic growth in recent years. The best response, he decided, is to focus on Home Depot’s most profitable core business: the existing retail outlets. If Mr. Blake is right, a streamlined Home Depot will emerge stronger than its rivals. And if he is wrong, the company could risk losing its dominant position as the nation’s favored shopping destination for do-it-your-selfers as well as contractors who build and refurbish homes. In fact, Home Depot’s closest competitor, Lowe’s, is taking the opposite tack, continuing to open outlets at a brisk clip in hopes of closing the gap with its much bigger rival. Lowe’s reported a smaller decline in first-quarter earnings than analysts had expected on Monday, ahead of Home Depot’s report on Tuesday. “Expansion is risky today,” said David H. Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “but it is also a less expensive time to do so in terms of buying land and hiring labor than it will be when the economy comes back. And maybe even in today’s constrained economy, Lowe’s does not have enough outlets.” Mr. Blake had an epiphany soon after he took over the top job at Home Depot in January 2007. The collapse of Lehman Brothers was still nearly two years away. So was the credit crisis and deep recession. But housing prices had peaked, and Home Depot’s revenue had begun to fall as the enthusiasm for building and furnishing homes waned. By early spring of that year, Mr. Blake  frequently visiting the big box stores in his empire  had decided that the housing downturn was getting worse, and might bring down the economy, along with Home Depot’s revenues. “It was clear to me that this wasn’t a one-quarter issue,” he said, “but rather a much longer correction.” So he reversed, or halted, a decade of expansion. Starting in early 2007, he scaled back new store openings from one or two a week to just five for all of this year. “When we were in our growth mode,” he said in an interview, “we would do like a heat map and we would say, ‘Look, southwest Cleveland, there is no store there.’ And we would put one there. That’s over.” In short order, Mr. Blake pulled out of sideline businesses that his predecessor, Robert Nardelli, now chairman of Chrysler, had started or acquired. He sold a wholesale building supply operation, one that even marketed manhole covers to municipalities. A big Dallas store dedicated entirely to flooring was closed. So was a subsidiary whose outlets sold plants in bulk. And early this year, Mr. Blake shut the luxury Expo stores, where Home Depot had sold gleaming, expensive kitchen installations  not to do-it-yourselfers, but to wealthy consumers. “We saw that Expo would lose $80 million this year,” Mr. Blake said, “and that was hard to justify.” Some economists, like Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, argue that corporate America, unnerved by the worst recession since the 1930s, will probably avoid expansion for at least several years after the downturn ends. That certainly reflects Mr. Blake’s thinking. “For a long time, we resisted acknowledging to ourselves that the market was saturated,” he said, adding that was typical. Indeed, after years of expansion, the growth rate of new investment in the United States is less than zero. Home Depot, the nation’s second-largest retailer, after Wal-Mart, has been part of the pullback as its revenue, and profit, decline. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on May 19, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.ATLANTA  When the collapse of Lehman Brothers froze the credit markets last September, Carol Tome quickly ordered hundreds of Home Depot’s store managers to transfer all their spare cash to headquarters  literally cleaning out their registers and each store’s safe.

That paints a picture of how dramatically the entire home furnishings landscape has been affected.” Mr. Shoulberg and other analysts believe that some home furnishing companies were forced into bankruptcy because they were not doing well to begin with. “Linens ’n Things was heavily loaded down with debt and was a perennial also-ran to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,” Mr. Shoulberg said. “When times got tough, businesses that weren’t as well-run and well-positioned were the first ones hit.” Jerry Epperson, a furniture and mattress industry analyst at Mann, Armistead &amp; Epperson in Richmond, Va., said the economy was so bad that “even well-run businesses that weren’t overleveraged a year ago are overleveraged today. Business is off 20, 25 percent.” Home furnishings retailers are likely to remain vulnerable throughout the recession, said Joseph Feldman, an analyst at the Telsey Advisory Group in Manhattan who studies retail markets, because consumers no longer believe they should buy new things when what they have is adequate. “If you’ve got less in your pocket and you’re worried about putting food on the table, you’re not going to be buying new throw pillows just because Pottery Barn has a new color,” Mr. Feldman said. “Given the state of the economy, consumers are doing more with what they have.” This new reality has gripped the publishing industry as well.

That paints a picture of how dramatically the entire home furnishings landscape has been affected.” Mr. Shoulberg and other analysts believe that some home furnishing companies were forced into bankruptcy because they were not doing well to begin with. “Linens ’n Things was heavily loaded down with debt and was a perennial also-ran to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,” Mr. Shoulberg said. “When times got tough, businesses that weren’t as well-run and well-positioned were the first ones hit.” Jerry Epperson, a furniture and mattress industry analyst at Mann, Armistead &amp; Epperson in Richmond, Va., said the economy was so bad that “even well-run businesses that weren’t overleveraged a year ago are overleveraged today. Business is off 20, 25 percent.” Home furnishings retailers are likely to remain vulnerable throughout the recession, said Joseph Feldman, an analyst at the Telsey Advisory Group in Manhattan who studies retail markets, because consumers no longer believe they should buy new things when what they have is adequate. “If you’ve got less in your pocket and you’re worried about putting food on the table, you’re not going to be buying new throw pillows just because Pottery Barn has a new color,” Mr. Feldman said. “Given the state of the economy, consumers are doing more with what they have.” This new reality has gripped the publishing industry as well. In just the last three months, the magazines Cottage Living, Country Home and O at Home have folded. Now Domino, a four-year-old title that had grown to a readership of more than 800,000, has become the eighth major home design magazine to cease publication since November 2007  when Condé Nast shocked many in the industry by shuttering another of its home magazines, the 106-year-old House &amp; Garden.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/business/27depot.html?ref=homedepotinc">Home Depot to Close Design Centers and Cut Jobs<date>Published: January 26, 2009</date><text>ATLANTA  Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, said Monday that it would cut 7,000 jobs and close its smaller Expo chain as the recession continues to batter the nation’s housing market.

Skip to next paragraph Related Your Money: Preparing Your Budget for Disaster (January 17, 2009) Add to Portfolio Sprint Nextel Corp Home Depot Inc Pfizer Inc Wyeth Sprint Nextel Corporation Go to your Portfolio » On Monday alone, companies across the employment spectrum announced more than 65,000 job cuts in the United States and around the world, a stark sign that businesses are enduring a painful, protracted downturn. Monday’s toll included 20,000 cuts at Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and mining machinery; 8,000 jobs at the wireless provider Sprint Nextel; 7,000 workers at Home Depot, and 8,000 from the expected merger of the pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and Wyeth. The beleaguered automaker General Motors announced that it would cut shifts at plants in Michigan and Ohio, where the downturn has hit hardest, eliminating some 2,000 jobs. And Texas Instruments said after the market closed on Monday that it would cut 3,400 jobs or 12 percent of its work force through 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 buyouts or retirements. In Europe, the banking and insurance group ING said it would cut 7,000 jobs; the electronics company Philips, 6,000; and the steel maker Corus, 3,500 worldwide. “We’re now into the danger zone,” said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight. “It really becomes pernicious because the uncertainty increases, corporate confidence is badly battered, and you get these severe measures being taken.” President Obama cited the layoff announcements in remarks Monday morning as he urged action on an $825 billion economic stimulus package of tax cuts, emergency benefits and public spending projects. “These are not just numbers on a page,” Mr. Obama said. “As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold. We owe it to each of them and to every single American to act with a sense of urgency and common purpose. We can’t afford distractions and we cannot afford delays.” The United States economy has dropped some 2.59 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, and unemployment rose to 7.2 percent last month. Economists worry that the economy could now be losing as many as 600,000 jobs a month, and they said Monday’s layoff announcements served to underline the stricken state of the labor market. Last week, the government reported that first-time unemployment claims had risen to 589,000 for the week ending Jan. 17, tying a record high set in December. The latest job cuts  and the additional announcements likely to come in a cascading pattern as job losses through the economy cause demand to shrink further and thus lead to more layoffs mean more pain for states, as unemployment insurance claims rise and deplete state coffers. The Obama administration has proposed setting aside $43 billion to help blunt the problem and provide for new recipients of unemployment insurance and existing ones. That money is intended to raise the weekly benefits, to extend how long people can collect those payments and to cover more types of workers, like part-timers. It is largely based upon an estimate that the unemployment rate will peak at 8.3 percent in 2010. But if unemployment reaches the double-digits, as some economists expect, the funding will almost certainly not be enough, economists say. “The economy is deteriorating at a faster clip than even the most dreary forecasts had expected,” said the economist Joseph Brusuelas. “At the current trend, $43 billion will not be sufficient, should we breach 9 percent unemployment and maybe reach into the double digits.” Monday’s announcements only added to a grim parade of job cuts from Wall Street to wireless providers to computer companies to retail stores. Last week, Microsoft announced it would cut 5,000 jobs over the next year and a half; Sony in Japan and Ericcson in Sweden each announced 5,000 layoffs; and the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said it was eliminating 1,000 jobs. Carmakers in Japan, South Korea and Europe have also cut jobs in recent months as did the cellphone maker Nokia. “It steepens the whole downturn,” said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. “The magnitude of these layoffs indicates that the downturn in the labor markets seems to be accelerating.” “This is a big deal,” said Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “We’re losing jobs at an incredibly rapid rate, and even with that, I’m worried they’re accelerating. We’re seeing a much more rapid rate of layoff announcements.” Caterpillar, which has been hurt by falling orders for construction and mining machinery, said Monday morning that it would cull 20,000 workers through layoffs and buyouts. It said it would make “sharp declines” in overtime and eliminate scores of temporary and contract jobs. The company said 2009 would be one of its weakest years since World War II. “These are very uncertain times,” the chief executive, James W. Owens, said in a statement. “While it’s painful for our employees and suppliers, it’s absolutely necessary given economic circumstances. We expect to have most of the actions needed to lower employment and cost levels in place by the end of the first quarter.” “We were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices,” Mr. Owens said. The wireless provider, Sprint Nextel, said its 8,000 job cuts were part of a plan to trim labor costs by $1.2 billion, and said most of the cuts would be completed by March 31. About 850 of the job cuts are expected to come through buyouts, which will cost the company $300 million in severance costs and related expenses. “Labor reductions are always the most difficult action to take, but many companies are finding it necessary in this environment," Sprint’s chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, said. Home Depot, the country’s largest home-supply chain, said it would cut 7,000 jobs, about 2 percent of its work force, and would close its higher-end Expo Design Center business, which includes 34 stores. Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview that the company began exploring ways to save its Expo business months ago, but “as we kept looking at alternatives the business kept getting softer and softer.” With no sign of consumers cracking open their wallets anytime soon, executives simply realized, “we can’t fix it.” Stephanie Rosenbloom and Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.

A year into this recession, companies across the board are resorting to mass job cuts. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Related Your Money: Preparing Your Budget for Disaster (January 17, 2009) Times Topics: Credit Crisis — The Essentials Home Depot, Caterpillar, Sprint Nextel and at least eight other companies announced on Monday they would cut more than 75,000 jobs in the United States and around the world  a gloomy start to the workweek for employees anxious about holding their own as the economy sinks. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, is slashing its payrolls by 16 percent. Texas Instruments said late in the day that it would eliminate 3,400 jobs, or 12 percent of its work force. Jobs began disappearing in home building and mortgage operations early in the recession, then across finance and banking more generally. Now the ax is falling across large swaths of manufacturing, retailing and information technology, taking out workers from New York to Seattle. Just last week, Microsoft announced its first significant job cuts ever. Because companies like Microsoft have invested in their workers’ skills and knowledge, they usually delay major work force reductions as long as they can. But with orders for new products and services drying up and financing tight, employers are looking to shrink their costs drastically and are slashing their payrolls, anticipating a protracted decline for business in 2009. Monday’s parade of negative news comes after months of announcements from other prominent companies like Citigroup, General Electric, Nokia and Harley-Davidson. As part of its acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer said it would cut the combined workforce by 19,500 employees. On Wednesday, the tally of mass layoffs for December will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Already, the bureau says the United States economy has shed 2.55 million jobs since the recession began, pushing the unemployment rate up to 7.2 percent last month. The latest round of job cuts  and the additional rounds likely to come as these move through the economy  mean more pain ahead for states as unemployment insurance claims rise and deplete state budgets. Congress has proposed setting aside $43 billion to assist the states and to provide for new and current recipients of unemployment checks. That money is intended to increase the weekly benefit amounts; to extend how long people can collect payments; to cover more types of workers, like part-timers; and to help states distribute benefits more quickly. It is based largely on an estimate that the unemployment rate will rise to 8 to 9 percent this year even with a stimulus package, according to the proposal summary from the House Appropriations Committee. But if unemployment soars into double digits, as some economists expect, the financing may not be enough. “The economy is deteriorating at a faster clip than even the most dreary forecasts had expected,” said Joseph Brusuelas, an economist who, bucking the current job market trend, will soon start a new job at Moody’s Economy.com. “At the current trend, $43 billion will not be sufficient should we breach 9 percent unemployment and maybe reach into the double digits.” President Obama cited the layoff announcements in remarks Monday urging Congress to approve an $825 billion economic stimulus package of tax cuts, emergency benefits and public spending projects. “These are not just numbers on a page,” he said. “As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold.” Charles DiGisco, of Randolph, N.J., is one casualty of the downturn. He said he had been looking for work since Sept. 18, when he lost his job as a vice president for sales and marketing at Master Cutlery, a knife maker. He frequently hears a familiar refrain from would-be employers: “We would hire you, but we’re not hiring anybody.” His family’s monthly expenses are four times what Mr. DiGisco collects from unemployment, and he said his family was selling two of its three cars and might dispose of some stocks or dip into retirement funds to keep paying the mortgage. “It takes me 20 years to save it, and it takes me five months to go through it,” Mr. DiGisco said. While stimulus spending on public works may take some time to get going, some companies could bring back displaced workers quickly if the government initiative generated new orders. Caterpillar, for example, had announced buyouts, wage freezes and work stoppages around the holidays because of “a dramatic decline in orders,” said Jim Dugan, a spokesman for the company, based in Peoria, Ill. On Monday, the company said that a total of 15,000 permanent and temporary jobs, out of about 125,000, would have been eliminated by the end of this week, and that it would trim 5,000 more by the end of the first quarter. Should orders for earthmovers and other heavy equipment improve, which some expect as countries around the world start building bridges, highways and other public works to help create jobs, Caterpillar can recall some workers quickly. Many companies, though, may not rush to increase staffs even if business begins to pick up. Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, said downturns often motivate companies to restructure business models permanently, meaning jobs they cut now are unlikely to be replaced. “Structural change is put into overdrive because of the recession,” he said, “so who knows for sure how a company like Microsoft will fare?” Sprint Nextel, which announced Monday that it was eliminating 8,000 jobs, or roughly 14 percent of its work force, is similarly facing some tough restructuring decisions as it continues to hemorrhage subscribers. After a dismal holiday shopping season, retailers are letting employees go in droves. More than 66,600 retailing jobs were lost in December, the worst period since the late 1930s. Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, said Monday it would cut 7,000 jobs, or 2 percent of its workers. Some 5,000 cuts will come through store closings, largely of its upscale Expo chain; the rest will come from corporate support, many at its Atlanta headquarters. Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said the company had explored ways to save Expo, but “as we kept looking at alternatives, the business kept getting softer and softer.” For most of last year, relatively healthy demand for exports gave global companies like Caterpillar a cushion. But with downturns deepening across Europe and Asia, and the dollar strengthening, global demand for costlier American goods has faltered. “There really isn’t any hiding place for companies anymore,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. “The recent numbers coming in from the rest of the world are disastrous.” Jack Healy, Stephanie Rosenbloom, Louis Uchitelle and Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Kevin Moloney for The New York Times Jim Scherr, the U.S.O.C.s chief executive, says television revenue and a cash reserve will help it weather the tough economy. Interactive Schedule Olympics Tracker Review coverage of your favorite sports, day by day and event by event. Times journalists and special contributors explore the Olympics in Beijing and on the Web from every angle  the politics, the culture and the competition. The Rings RSS Feed | Atom Go to the Rings Blog » Olympics 2008Go to Complete Coverage » The U.S.O.C., one of the few national Olympic committees that does not receive any direct government money, is still financially stable and will be so in the foreseeable future, Jim Scherr, its chief executive, said in a telephone interview on Friday. “We have one of the strongest, if not the strongest, brands in the world, and we believe that we will still have the ability to achieve our domestic and international sponsorship goals,” Scherr said, adding that committees with government financing, like Britain’s and China’s, are probably having an easier time navigating in hard times. Britain, which runs a national lottery to help support athletes, subsidizes some key sports “four times more” than the United States does, Scherr said. He added that athletes in countries like France, Spain, Japan, Italy and Germany also receive more money than those in the United States because of government financing. But Scherr said the U.S.O.C. was undeterred. “Certainly, it may take a bit longer to negotiate contracts and it may take a little more effort, but we feel that we are extremely viable,” he said. Scherr added that television revenue from the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2012 Summer Games  which will be about $255 million for the U.S.O.C.  and a cash reserve of about $100 million will help the organization make it through this downturn. The U.S.O.C. is also in talks to renew sponsorship contracts with AT&amp;T and Bank of America, each of which was worth about $4 million to $5 million annually. Still, like most every other sports entity, the U.S.O.C. has been grappling to keep its sponsors, which account for 45 percent of its $150 million average annual budget. Another 15 percent comes from private donors, who are also likely to give less during a recession. Although the U.S.O.C. has signed 17 sponsors  all through at least 2012, including the personal-computer manufacturer Acer, new to the Olympic movement  it has lost some valuable support. Last week, Home Depot announced that it would not renew its 16-year sponsorship of the U.S.O.C., a contract worth about $4 million to $5 million a year. General Motors, an Olympic sponsor since 1984, left at the end of last year, concluding a contract worth about $7.5 million annually to the U.S.O.C. An Olympic sponsor since 1896, Kodak pulled out. Its share price has dropped about 65 percent in the past year. John Hancock, a sponsor since 1994, also did not renew. So far, Kellogg’s, a sponsor since 1976, and Johnson &amp; Johnson have neither announced an end to their relationship with the Olympic movement nor renewed their contracts. Anheuser-Busch returned but reduced its financial commitment. Despite those changes, some sports marketing experts say the U.S.O.C. has nothing to worry about, though the outlook for all sports sponsorships may be bleak. Peter Graham, an Olympics expert and a professor of sport and entertainment management at the University of South Carolina, said that the U.S.O.C. was resilient enough to handle the loss of companies like Home Depot. Other companies, he said, would eventually fill those vacancies, even in categories like home improvement and automotive, sectors that are currently struggling. “I think companies are interested in those sponsorships because of the global aspect of the Olympics,” he said. “When the Olympics are on, you’re going to get worldwide exposure that only the World Cup series in soccer and maybe the Super Bowl gets. No other sporting event comes close.” “The U.S.O.C. may not get the kind of money they want from each sponsor,” he added, “but I believe they will get it if they add more sponsors or categories of sponsorship.” Rob Prazmark, a marketing consultant who works with the U.S.O.C., said the Olympic brand in the United States was strong enough to handle the crisis and had weathered bad times before. After a bribery scandal involving the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games, Prazmark and others secured a long list of corporate sponsorships, despite the negative publicity. “Yes, we’re having a bit of tough times these days, but smart companies know this investment is not just for ’09,” he said. “I think companies are planning for a better economy in ’10, ’11 and ’12, when these sponsorships will still be in place. “This also might be a perfect chance for companies to jump into sponsorships, when other companies might be too financially weak to do so.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on January 12, 2009, on page D2 of the New York edition.Heading into an economically troubled year without several of its biggest and longest-standing sponsors, the United States Olympic Committee is refusing to panic.

The Rings RSS Feed | Atom Go to the Rings Blog » Olympics 2008Go to Complete Coverage » The U.S.O.C., one of the few national Olympic committees that does not receive any direct government money, is still financially stable and will be so in the foreseeable future, Jim Scherr, its chief executive, said in a telephone interview on Friday. “We have one of the strongest, if not the strongest, brands in the world, and we believe that we will still have the ability to achieve our domestic and international sponsorship goals,” Scherr said, adding that committees with government financing, like Britain’s and China’s, are probably having an easier time navigating in hard times. Britain, which runs a national lottery to help support athletes, subsidizes some key sports “four times more” than the United States does, Scherr said. He added that athletes in countries like France, Spain, Japan, Italy and Germany also receive more money than those in the United States because of government financing. But Scherr said the U.S.O.C. was undeterred. “Certainly, it may take a bit longer to negotiate contracts and it may take a little more effort, but we feel that we are extremely viable,” he said. Scherr added that television revenue from the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2012 Summer Games  which will be about $255 million for the U.S.O.C.  and a cash reserve of about $100 million will help the organization make it through this downturn. The U.S.O.C. is also in talks to renew sponsorship contracts with AT&amp;T and Bank of America, each of which was worth about $4 million to $5 million annually. Still, like most every other sports entity, the U.S.O.C. has been grappling to keep its sponsors, which account for 45 percent of its $150 million average annual budget. Another 15 percent comes from private donors, who are also likely to give less during a recession.

But bellwether chains in each sector of the industry turned in similarly dismal results Tuesday, another sign that shoppers of all types have gone into hiding. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » In separate telephone conferences with investors, Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, and Saks, the high-end department store chain, said their sales fell sharply in the most recent reporting period. That is consistent with other recent results in the retailing industry, and if the trend continues, even the nation’s discount retailers could find themselves in trouble. Home Depot, hit hard by the trouble in the housing market, has been struggling for a while. By contrast, the slowdown at Saks, which is more likely to sell a mink coat than a miter saw, highlights the spreading distress in retailing. “The malaise of retail has moved onto another subsector of retailing,” said Bill Dreher, a senior retailing analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. “It started with home improvement retailers and has worked its way through restaurants, moderate department stores, and is now affecting luxury department stores, with Saks, Nordstrom and Neiman posting disappointing results and struggling to keep up with the rate of change in their environments.” If things worsen, warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam’s Club could be next. “If times get really tough, people start trading down from warehouse stores to dollar stores,” Mr. Dreher said. Saks lost $42.8 million, or 31 cents a share, for the three months that ended Nov. 1, compared with a profit of $21.6 million, or 14 cents a share, for the period a year ago. (The loss included $10.6 million of expenses related to the shuttering of its unprofitable Club Libby Lu, a chain catering to girls.) Sales at stores open at least a year, an indicator of retail health, fell 11.5 percent for the period compared with a sales gain of 11.4 percent for the same period last year. Even at the Saks store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan  which usually outperforms the rest of the chain  sales were softer as New Yorkers reeled from banking problems, layoffs and the plummeting value of their portfolios. “I don’t think anybody’s doing well in this environment,” Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, said during the telephone conference. Certainly not Saks’s competitors: as previously reported, for the period ending Nov. 1, sales at stores open at least a year were down 11.1 percent at Nordstrom and 14.5 percent at Neiman Marcus. Analysts say the rate of sales declines at luxury department stores has accelerated quickly. And Saks, for one, is having trouble controlling its inventory. The company is canceling some orders and returning others, as well as taking markdowns to lure shoppers. “Clearly, our consumer doesn’t feel wealthy,” Mr. Sadove said. At Home Depot, profit for the three months that ended Nov. 2 was $756 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $1.09 billion, or 60 cents a share, for the period a year ago. Even so, that was better than Wall Street expected. Sales at stores open at least a year declined by 8.3 percent, compared with a drop of 6.2 percent a year ago. As with other retailers, big-ticket sales at Home Depot continued to suffer. Special-order kitchens, for instance, were down nearly 30 percent compared with last year. Only one of Home Depot’s departments  building materials  had sales growth, though it was largely driven by demand for hurricane repair materials. Kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, lumber and flooring were the weakest categories. Plumbing, hardware and gardening had sales declines, though they outperformed the company’s average sales. At Saks, women’s apparel was the weakest-performing department. Women’s shoes and handbags, which Saks said had “explosive growth” last year, were also soft. Cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry, men’s contemporary sportswear and men’s shoes were relatively stronger. The company’s Internet business had sales growth, though it was much slower than in previous months. One problem all luxury retailers are contending with is that lead times to buy inventory are long  usually six to nine months, according to Mr. Sadove. That means many clothing retailers are stuck with orders they placed early this year, when the economic situation still looked reasonably bright. Home Depot is lucky in this regard. “Only about 13 percent of our products are imported,” said Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer. “That gives us a little more nimbleness in terms of adjusting the inventory.” Neither Saks nor Home Depot was optimistic about the near future, and both retailers said they plan to slow store growth and offer compelling sales. Saks said it is ordering 15 percent less merchandise for spring 2009. “Retailers have been setting a cautious tone all along, but now that cautious tone is extending on into next year,” said John D. Morris, an analyst with Wachovia. “One could argue this is positive. They’re viewing life beyond the holiday.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 19, 2008, on page B3 of the New York edition.Of all the categories in American retailing, high-end clothing and home improvement could not be more different.

Emilio Flores for The New York Times Ellie Kay provides financial advice at Wal-Mart. While it might seem counterintuitive for stores to teach shoppers to cut their spending, several chains have concluded that providing such knowledge can spur loyalty and keep customers from trading down to cheaper competitors. So the Stop &amp; Shop grocery chain is offering “affordable food summits” where consumers are taught how to lower their grocery bills. Home Depot offers classes on how to cut energy bills. And Wal-Mart Stores hired a “family financial expert” who has used online chats to teach several thousand shoppers how to save money for college, whittle away debt and sell a house. As the stores see it, they are filling a vacuum. Once upon a time, schools taught survival skills like how to feed a growing family cheaply and run a household on a tight budget. But in an era of prosperity, easy credit and changing social norms, many of those classes were revised to focus on more up-to-date topics. “There’s an entire generation that’s never really had to know how to stretch the value of a dollar,” said Ellie Kay, who doles out financial advice for Wal-Mart. Indeed, it has been a quarter-century since the nation suffered a severe recession. During the boom years, few people seemed interested in shopping on a shoestring. Even working-class families dined at restaurants. Many ordinary grocery stores inched their way upscale, aspiring to emulate places like Whole Foods Market and Dean &amp; DeLuca. Now, with the economy on the decline, families are being squeezed, prompting a return to basics. People are flocking to wholesale clubs and discount stores, trading down to cheaper products, buying store-brand items and making fewer shopping trips. Some 71 percent of consumers are cooking at home more often and eating less often at restaurants, according to figures from the Food Marketing Institute, which conducted an online survey of more than 2,000 shoppers. The institute also found that 67 percent of consumers were buying fewer luxury foods and 58 percent were eating more leftovers. As Ms. Kay put it: “Saving money is the new black.” Unapologetically, retailers are tailoring their money-saving classes to women, saying they base their decision on surveys showing that women control the food budget in most families. “We have to be interested in what moms are interested in,” said Stephen Quinn, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Wal-Mart, which recently introduced a television advertising campaign centered on mothers sharing savings advice. Grocery chains see their role as teaching consumers how to whip up low-cost meals. The stores have long offered recipes and shopping tips, of course, but nowadays they are adopting a relentless focus on value. On its Web site, Hy-Vee, a supermarket chain in the Midwest, offers ways to feed a family of four for $8 or less. To make pork chop dinner, Hy-Vee recommends four pork chops, one package of apple sauce, some frozen vegetables and “Hy-Vee 5 cheese Texas toast.” Total cost: less than $2 a person. Stop &amp; Shop has been holding food conferences in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Economists, educators and food bank executives are offering advice about surfing the Internet for coupons, sticking to a shopping list, cooking larger portions and freezing leftovers, unplugging appliances when they are not in use and driving more slowly to conserve gas. “We’re educating people,” said Jim Dwyer, executive vice president of strategy and business development for Stop &amp; Shop. “Even in a tough economic time, there’s an opportunity to still put the right food in front of your family.” The retailers say their advice is neutral, not specific to any store  but they are always careful to point out money-saving items that their stores carry. The idea is to earn the gratitude of customers and ensure that when they do spend money, some of it will be with the store that sponsored the class. Many grocery chains are nearly as in the dark as their customers about how to operate in a down economy. Unlike in past downturns, traditional grocers face new competitors that are peeling off some of their customers: dollar stores, huge discount retailers and drugstores that are adding grocery items. “They are facing a different set of competitive and consumer dynamics,” said Willard Bishop, who runs a supermarket consulting firm that bears his name. “So what they are trying to do is provide value and get credit for the value they are providing.” Neil Z. Stern, a retail consultant at McMillanDoolittle in Chicago, said smarter grocery stores were finally telling consumers how much cheaper it was to buy groceries than to eat at restaurants. Consumers need to be reminded that $150 in groceries may represent six or seven meals, he said. “‘You mean I can put chicken cacciatore and potatoes on the table for $3.50 a person? Well, that’s cheaper,’” he said. “Things like that are implicit in going to a supermarket, but it’s never been explicit.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 14, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.Home economics, that lost art in which generations of students learned to keep a household going on a tight budget, is making a comeback.

Blank retired from Home Depot in 2001, he was 58 years old, a powerfully built, energetic man with a young family and a billion-dollar fortune. Skip to next paragraph The Trials of Arthur Blank Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » Twenty-two years earlier, he co-founded Home Depot with his friend Bernard Marcus, which they built into a retail chain that trailed only mighty Wal-Mart in revenue. In 1997, Mr. Blank succeeded his co-founder as chief executive; by 2001, he was beginning to think about retirement. His departure was hastened, however, when the Home Depot board decided it just had to have Bob Nardelli, who had lost the General Electric “bake-off” to Jeffrey Immelt. Guys like Arthur Blank, “with an insatiable desire to succeed,” as one of his executives described him to me  don’t just ride off into the sunset. That’s not how they’re wired. They need new mountains to conquer. And if they’re rich enough, the mountain they often choose is the sports business. John Henry, a wealthy commodities trader, owns the Boston Red Sox. Malcolm Glazer, who made his fortune in food processing, took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when he was 67. Robert Kraft, a packaging mogul, owns the New England Patriots. Jerry Jones, Tom Hicks, Wayne Huizenga  when you think about it, the sports business in this country is dominated by self-made men looking for mountains to conquer. So perhaps it was inevitable that Mr. Blank would buy the Atlanta Falcons, his hometown National Football League team, despite its long history of mediocrity. In February 2002, he paid $545 million for the privilege. This is Mr. Blank’s seventh season as the Falcons’ owner. He has had some small successes on the field  the playoffs in 2002, and a run to the conference championship game in 2004. But let’s face it: his Falcons aren’t exactly the Patriots of the South. They are still a so-so team, with only two winning seasons since Mr. Blank bought the team. He’s on his fourth coach. And then there was last season, Mr. Blank’s “annus horribilis.” With its star quarterback, Michael Vick, in the prime of his career, the Falcons decided to hire a coach from the college ranks, Bobby Petrino, who specialized in offense and quarterbacks. The idea was that if the Falcons were going to make a Super Bowl run, they needed to do it soon, before the team had to be rebuilt. Mr. Blank gave Mr. Petrino a five-year, $24 million contract. Within weeks of Mr. Petrino’s hiring, however, Mr. Vick was accused of running an illegal dog-fighting operation at his farm in Virginia, the details of which were sordid in the extreme. He pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 23 months in prison. Without a decent quarterback, Atlanta went 4-12  as the Vick imbroglio tormented the team the entire season. Mr. Petrino, meanwhile, was a bust. He also turned out to be a liar, denying to Mr. Blank that he was about to bolt for the University of Arkansas  and then doing precisely that 24 hours later. “I felt like I’d been kicked in the stomach,” Mr. Blank says now. As I watched the Falcons debacle unfold last season, I wondered how it could be that someone so good at one business seemed so inept at another. Was this a case of someone whose skills were so oriented to the retail trade that they couldn’t translate to a different kind of business? Was the learning curve just too big? What exactly was the problem? On the eve of the new N.F.L. season, I went to Atlanta to find out.  “Before I bought the team, Robert Kraft told me that I was going to be surprised to discover that football is much more similar to business than not,” Mr. Blank said. He was sitting in a comfortable chair in his home office, his shoes off, his feet tucked up on the seat of his chair. He continued: “And I found that that was mostly true. I have the same sort of relationship with our associates as I did at Home Depot.” (“Associates” is Home Depot-ese for “employees.”) “And you have to listen to your customers  which in this case are the fans.” Up to a point, he’s right. Football is a business, after all, and entrepreneurs like Mr. Blank often instinctively know how to improve it. Dick Sullivan, a Falcons executive who followed Mr. Blank from Home Depot, told me that on his first day on the job, “he and I were literally looking at parking lots in downtown Atlanta.” Why? Because the fans had complained there wasn’t enough parking. The Falcons almost never sold out when Mr. Blank first took over. He did surveys to discover what the fans wanted, and set about providing it. The Georgia Dome was upgraded. He raised prices on the most expensive seats  but lowered prices on 20,000 seats. He tried to provide, as he puts it, “a great game day experience.” And it worked. The stadium not only filled up for every game, but there also was a long waiting list for season tickets. In short order, the Falcons were generating significantly more revenue than under the previous owners. But for someone like Mr. Blank, fixing the business side is the easy part. The hard part is the football. “Have you ever seen a playbook?” Mr. Blank asked me. He spread his hand wide so I could envision how thick it was. “When you see a playbook, you realize that it takes a lot to understand the game. What football executives know, I’ll never know. The best I can do on the football side is make sure we have the best people and get out of their way.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 6, 2008, on page C1 of the New York edition.When Arthur M. Blank retired from Home Depot in 2001, he was 58 years old, a powerfully built, energetic man with a young family and a billion-dollar fortune. Skip to next paragraph The Trials of Arthur Blank Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » Twenty-two years earlier, he co-founded Home Depot with his friend Bernard Marcus, which they built into a retail chain that trailed only mighty Wal-Mart in revenue. In 1997, Mr. Blank succeeded his co-founder as chief executive; by 2001, he was beginning to think about retirement. His departure was hastened, however, when the Home Depot board decided it just had to have Bob Nardelli, who had lost the General Electric “bake-off” to Jeffrey Immelt. Guys like Arthur Blank, “with an insatiable desire to succeed,” as one of his executives described him to me  don’t just ride off into the sunset. That’s not how they’re wired. They need new mountains to conquer. And if they’re rich enough, the mountain they often choose is the sports business. John Henry, a wealthy commodities trader, owns the Boston Red Sox. Malcolm Glazer, who made his fortune in food processing, took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when he was 67. Robert Kraft, a packaging mogul, owns the New England Patriots. Jerry Jones, Tom Hicks, Wayne Huizenga  when you think about it, the sports business in this country is dominated by self-made men looking for mountains to conquer. So perhaps it was inevitable that Mr. Blank would buy the Atlanta Falcons, his hometown National Football League team, despite its long history of mediocrity. In February 2002, he paid $545 million for the privilege. This is Mr. Blank’s seventh season as the Falcons’ owner. He has had some small successes on the field  the playoffs in 2002, and a run to the conference championship game in 2004. But let’s face it: his Falcons aren’t exactly the Patriots of the South. They are still a so-so team, with only two winning seasons since Mr. Blank bought the team. He’s on his fourth coach. And then there was last season, Mr. Blank’s “annus horribilis.” With its star quarterback, Michael Vick, in the prime of his career, the Falcons decided to hire a coach from the college ranks, Bobby Petrino, who specialized in offense and quarterbacks. The idea was that if the Falcons were going to make a Super Bowl run, they needed to do it soon, before the team had to be rebuilt. Mr. Blank gave Mr. Petrino a five-year, $24 million contract. Within weeks of Mr. Petrino’s hiring, however, Mr. Vick was accused of running an illegal dog-fighting operation at his farm in Virginia, the details of which were sordid in the extreme. He pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 23 months in prison. Without a decent quarterback, Atlanta went 4-12  as the Vick imbroglio tormented the team the entire season. Mr. Petrino, meanwhile, was a bust. He also turned out to be a liar, denying to Mr. Blank that he was about to bolt for the University of Arkansas  and then doing precisely that 24 hours later. “I felt like I’d been kicked in the stomach,” Mr. Blank says now. As I watched the Falcons debacle unfold last season, I wondered how it could be that someone so good at one business seemed so inept at another. Was this a case of someone whose skills were so oriented to the retail trade that they couldn’t translate to a different kind of business? Was the learning curve just too big? What exactly was the problem? On the eve of the new N.F.L. season, I went to Atlanta to find out.  “Before I bought the team, Robert Kraft told me that I was going to be surprised to discover that football is much more similar to business than not,” Mr. Blank said. He was sitting in a comfortable chair in his home office, his shoes off, his feet tucked up on the seat of his chair. He continued: “And I found that that was mostly true. I have the same sort of relationship with our associates as I did at Home Depot.” (“Associates” is Home Depot-ese for “employees.”) “And you have to listen to your customers  which in this case are the fans.” Up to a point, he’s right. Football is a business, after all, and entrepreneurs like Mr. Blank often instinctively know how to improve it. Dick Sullivan, a Falcons executive who followed Mr. Blank from Home Depot, told me that on his first day on the job, “he and I were literally looking at parking lots in downtown Atlanta.” Why? Because the fans had complained there wasn’t enough parking. The Falcons almost never sold out when Mr. Blank first took over. He did surveys to discover what the fans wanted, and set about providing it. The Georgia Dome was upgraded. He raised prices on the most expensive seats  but lowered prices on 20,000 seats. He tried to provide, as he puts it, “a great game day experience.” And it worked. The stadium not only filled up for every game, but there also was a long waiting list for season tickets. In short order, the Falcons were generating significantly more revenue than under the previous owners. But for someone like Mr. Blank, fixing the business side is the easy part. The hard part is the football. “Have you ever seen a playbook?” Mr. Blank asked me. He spread his hand wide so I could envision how thick it was. “When you see a playbook, you realize that it takes a lot to understand the game. What football executives know, I’ll never know. The best I can do on the football side is make sure we have the best people and get out of their way.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/business/20home.html?ref=homedepotinc">Home Repairs Become Focus as Consumers Feel Pinched<date>Published: August 19, 2008</date><text>Suddenly, the theme in home goods retailing is “in with the old.” Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Lowe's Companies Go to your Portfolio » With the housing market in the doldrums and inflation running at a pace unseen in nearly two decades, consumers are not buying new homes. Instead they are fixing up the ones they have, a trend that is beginning to show up in the financial reports of retailers. “Consumer’s wallets are being pinched,” said Carol B. Tomé, chief financial officer and executive vice president for corporate services at Home Depot. “Customers are moving away from discretionary projects and are spending money on small repair projects.” Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer and a bellwether for the industry, reported a 24 percent decline in profit in its second quarter on Tuesday, though it beat Wall Street estimates. Some of its best-performing categories were related to home repair, like plumbing and goods for the kitchen and bath. “Plumbing is as basic as it can get in terms of repair,” Ms. Tomé said. “It outperformed the company average.” Michael Souers, a specialty retail analyst with Standard &amp; Poor’s Equity Research, was not surprised that people were fixing toilets rather than remodeling. “It doesn’t cost as much,” he said, referring to repairs, “and consumers can afford those, and especially with the boost the stimulus checks brought.” Frank Blake, chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, said Tuesday in a conference call with investors that about $300 million in sales was probably related to the government stimulus package. Home Depot does not break out sales by category, though it said plumbing outperformed its overall same-store sales figure, or sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of retail health. Home Depot’s same-store sales for the three months ending Aug. 3 fell 7.9 percent. (Adjusting for a shift in the company’s fiscal calendar this year would put that figure at a decline of 7.2 percent.) Both Home Depot and Lowe’s, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, acknowledged that consumers had shied away from costly discretionary items. “During the quarter we continued to see soft demand in cabinets and countertops, and fashion plumbing,” Larry D. Stone, president and chief operating officer of Lowe’s Companies, said in a conference call with investors on Monday. Sales of repair and maintenance products, on the other hand, were solid. Home goods retailers know all too well that getting a consumer to buy a new kitchen is nearly impossible these days. Instead Home Depot expanded its offering of low-priced items across the store, a tactic it said it thought made more sense than limited-time blowout sales. “We were less promotional over all compared to last year,” Craig Menear, Home Depot’s executive vice president for merchandising, said Tuesday in a conference call with investors, “and consciously focused on eliminating margin-eroding promotions.” Ms. Tomé said transactions for $25 and under were down “a lot less” than items over $600. David Strasser, a Banc of America Investment Services analyst, said this was an industrywide trend. “The bifurcation between low ticket and high ticket has become more dramatic,” he said. In addition to making necessary repairs, consumers  bracing for higher fuel prices this winter  are also trying to save money by making their homes more energy-efficient. “This is a trend we expect to continue into the third quarter,” Mr. Menear said. “Products such as weather stripping, caulk, CFL light bulbs, air circulation and pipe insulation all performed well. In the Northeast, we are already seeing strong sales in our fireplace category as customers are stocking up on pellet fuel before the cold weather arrives.” Home Depot plans to introduce more energy-efficient products like dimmable compact fluorescent light bulbs, water-saving faucets and toilets and a flush-mount programmable thermostat. The two biggest home improvement retailers are experiencing the same trends: same-store sales declines, a boost from stimulus checks, weakness in big-ticket item sales, even strong sales of pellet heaters. Home Depot reported Tuesday that profit for the three months ending Aug. 3 fell 24 percent, to $1.2 billion, or 71 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.6 billion, or 81 cents a diluted share, for the same period last year. Grim as the numbers may sound, they were better than analysts had expected. “I thought they were actually very strong,” said Mr. Souers of Standard &amp; Poor’s, “much stronger than my estimate of 63 cents a share. The Street was 61 cents.” Matthew J. Fassler, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said he expected sales at Home Depot and Lowe’s to slow further based on the historical relationship between home sales and home improvement retail sales. “From Lowe’s on Monday and Home Depot today you can see that the home sector bucked the trend that you would typically expect in the middle of a shared housing downturn,” he said. Mitch Kaiser, senior research analyst for Piper Jaffray, also liked the earnings results but said declines in same-store sales at Home Depot and Lowe’s were likely to last at least another year. Every retailer is suffering in this economy, but “they’re hurt worst,” he said. “Their products are going into a declining price asset.” Lowe’s said its profit for the three months that ended Aug. 1 decreased 7.9 percent, to $938 million, or 64 cents a diluted share, compared with $1 billion, or 67 cents a diluted share, for the same period last year. Same-store sales declined 5.3 percent for the quarter. Home Depot and Lowe’s were cautious in their forecasts for the future. Even so, as the home improvement industry consolidates, analysts, including Mr. Kaiser, say Home Depot and Lowe’s are well positioned. It is smaller home improvement retailers that are in deeper trouble. “It’s not a Home Depot versus Lowe’s industry right now,” said Mr. Strasser of Banc of America Investment Services. “They both will come out of this very well. And the longer it lasts the better and stronger they’re going to be in some respects.” He added, “Other people can’t survive.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on August 20, 2008, on page C1 of the New York edition.Suddenly, the theme in home goods retailing is “in with the old.” Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Lowe's Companies Go to your Portfolio » With the housing market in the doldrums and inflation running at a pace unseen in nearly two decades, consumers are not buying new homes.

But improper disposal of the bulbs creates a hazard, because they contain small amounts of mercury. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Alan Zale for The New York Times Paul Fariselli hung a sign Monday at the Home Depot in New Rochelle, N.Y., to promote the recycling program. All United States Home Depots will take part. Related Times Topics: Energy Efficiency Enlarge This Image Alan Zale for The New York Times Aldo DeRubeis bought compact fluorescent bulbs on Monday at the Home Depot in New Rochelle, N.Y. Sales of compact fluorescents climbed to 75 million last year for the retailer. Recycling them is about to get easier. Home Depot, the nation’s second-largest retailer, will announce on Tuesday that it will take back old compact fluorescents in all 1,973 of its stores in the United States, creating the nation’s most widespread recycling program for the bulbs. “We kept hearing from the community that there was a little bit of concern about mercury in the C.F.L.’s,” said Ron Jarvis, Home Depot’s senior vice president for environmental innovation, using the industry abbreviation for the bulbs. “And if the C.F.L.’s were in their house, how could they dispose of them?” Until now, consumers had to seek out local hazardous waste programs or smaller retail chains willing to collect the bulbs for recycling, like Ikea and True Value. Some consumers have waited for retailers like Wal-Mart to have a designated recycling day. Others bought kits to mail the bulbs to a recycling facility. The Environmental Protection Agency has been looking into putting bulb drop-off boxes at post offices, said Jim Berlow, director of the agency’s hazardous waste minimization and management division. But those plans are not final, and across most of the country, recycling the bulbs has been inconvenient at best. Industry professionals estimate that the recycling rate is around 2 percent. Home Depot’s program, which will accept any maker’s bulbs, will bring relatively convenient recycling within reach of most households. Mr. Jarvis estimated that 75 percent of the nation’s homes are within 10 miles of a Home Depot. “We’re trying to do the right thing,” he said. “Some of the things that we do are for the community and not for the bottom line.” Both Home Depot and Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer, have vigorously promoted the bulbs as part of their commitment to the environment. Wal-Mart announced in October 2006 that it wanted to sell 100 million compact fluorescents by the end of 2007. It surpassed that goal, selling 193 million bulbs to date. Wal-Mart has accepted expired bulbs at take-back events in particular markets and is exploring how to do it consistently on a national level. Wal-Mart has more than twice the number of United States stores as Home Depot. The need for a national recycling program became apparent to Home Depot as sales of compact fluorescents, which had been slow compared with sales of incandescent bulb, climbed to 75 million last year, from about 50 million in 2006. And a recycling program is likely to drive even more people to Home Depot. “We haven’t really had to develop the infrastructure” before now, said Steven Hamburg, interim director of the Center for Environmental Studies at Brown University. “The demand wasn’t there.” But lately, consumers have been getting the message  in stores, from the media and through awareness campaigns  that compact fluorescents use up to 75 percent less energy, last longer and cost less over time than incandescent bulbs. Mr. Hamburg says the average household reduces its energy budget by $12 to $20 a month using compact fluorescents. Additionally, better technology has made the bulbs’ harsh glow somewhat warmer and softer, though many people still object to it. More innovations are on the way. Home Depot has plans to introduce more dimmable compact fluorescents within the year. Mr. Hamburg and colleagues at Brown recently developed a box that absorbs mercury  so there would be no need to fret if a bulb breaks in the box. Mercury is found in other common household items like electronics, appliances and pesticides. Its vapors, however, can harm people and pollute the environment, which is why recycling is encouraged. (In some places it is against the law not to recycle the bulbs.) “We generally think using these bulbs are over all a good thing for the environment,” said Mr. Berlow of the E.P.A. “The only thing you have to be aware of is the potential for them to break.” The E.P.A. devotes pages of its Web site to cleanup instructions for broken compact fluorescents. Before even beginning to clean up a spill, consumers are advised to leave the room (along with their pets), open a window and shut off any operating air heating or cooling systems. That may seem foreboding, but experts see a greater health risk from the mercury emissions produced by coal-burning plants to power less efficient bulbs. “The avoided mercury emissions are much larger than the mercury we’re using in the bulbs,” said Mr. Hamburg of Brown, referring to compact fluorescents. Home Depot’s bulbs contain 2.3 to 3.5 milligrams of mercury, which is below the National Electrical Manufacturers Association recommendation of 5 milligrams or fewer. It is a small amount, equivalent to the volume of the steel ball in the tip of a ballpoint pen. “Most people in their home have 1,000 times more mercury literally in their thermostat, let alone thermometers,” Mr. Hamburg said.

TerraCycle’s other products are likewise “upcycled”  a compost from an old wine barrel, a handbag from drink pouches and a bird feeder that is an upside-down two-liter soda bottle. This month, OfficeMax announced it would begin carrying TerraCycle’s eco-binders and drink-pouch pencil cases. “We became the world’s first company to make everything out of trash,” Mr. Szaky said, although he is proudest of his competitive pricing, which will push sales from just under $4 million in 2007 to an estimated $8.5 million this year. “Every American wants to do the right thing for the environment, but few are willing to pay even a penny more for something that’s green.” Mr. Szaky’s emphasis on being profitable and consumer-friendly, as well as green, is what Andrea C. Levine, director of the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, calls “Green II.” In the early 1990s, she worked in the New York State attorney general’s office policing bogus claims of ecofriendliness during Green I. “There were people selling plastic forks saying they were environmentally friendly because you didn’t have to wash them,” she said. Nowadays, businesses are held to higher standards because consumers are more skeptical of claims and more aware of threats like climate change. “Environmental claims are kind of like nutritional claims,” Ms. Levine said. “Consumers can’t evaluate them themselves.” The building industry has established a ratings system as part of its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, which awards points based on green criteria. The Organic Materials Review Institute issues rulings on whether a product can call itself organic. But there are few definite rules for what a company needs to do to call itself green. Ms. Levine sees small businesses making legitimate efforts to provide information about their green efforts. “Consumers understand today that not washing plastic forks is not a serious environmental move,” she said. The absence of a standard criteria by which companies can compare claims, however, complicates the issue for businesses and their customers. Companies like PlanetTran and Dropps are trying to give an ecosheen to such historically ungreen industries as airport livery service and detergent. PlanetTran has a fleet of Toyota Prius hybrids in Boston and San Francisco that average 50 miles a gallon of gasoline  compared with under 20 for Town Cars  while Dropps puts its concentrated detergent in premeasured packages that dissolve in water. Dropps takes pains to show how using its product helps the environment. Its detergent is biodegradable and phosphate-free. But the Philadelphia-based company tests credulity with a claim that the soap could eliminate the consumption of 6.2 million gallons of diesel fuel and save 502 million gallons of water if it were used in the 25 billion loads of laundry done in the United States annually with liquid detergent. Its spokeswoman acknowledges that based on its sales, Dropps accounts for only 2 million to 4 million loads a year. PlanetTran takes a different tack, since taking public transportation would be greener than driving a hybrid car. Its founder, Seth Riney, views the service as an improvement over the public’s taking poorly maintained taxis, less expensive than using conventional limousine services and a tool for companies that want to reduce their carbon footprint. Its first large corporate account was Genzyme, a Boston biotechnology company with a green ethos. “It’s one thing to have a green business,” Mr. Riney said. “It’s another thing to help other companies to be green.” Even TerraCycle is as ungreen as its competitors in one regard: it ships its products to stores in diesel-powered trucks. Mr. Szaky makes no apologies for this. “The most sustainable concept is, ‘Don’t buy, use as few things as possible,’ ” he said. “But that’s never going to happen. We’re trying to change consumer behavior in the world’s biggest retailers.” Farshad Sayan has been changing his company’s behavior so that his customers do not have to change theirs. An Iranian immigrant, he has been in the dry-cleaning business around Boston since he was a college student in the 1970s. In the late ’90s, he decided to sell his chain of stores. With the deal set to close, he learned that the ground beneath one shop was contaminated with perchloroethylene, a common dry-cleaning solvent known as perc, which has been linked to increased risks of cancer. Several hundred thousand dollars later, the soil was clean, but the deal had collapsed. After that, Mr. Sayan dedicated himself to becoming the greenest businessman he could possibly be. Today, he operates Clevergreen Cleaners, a small chain of green dry cleaners. The dry-cleaning machine sprays clothes with DF-2000, said by some to be a more ecofriendly solvent, instead of soaking them in perc. The process is better for delicate clothes, and the solvent can be reused. His washing machines are designed to use a minimum amount of water, while the steam used in the pressing machines heats the dryers on its way up from the boiler. There are no incandescent lights. Yet Mr. Sayan has not let striving to be green hurt his reputation as a conscientious cleaner. “We didn’t want to produce a mediocre product,” Mr. Sayan said. “We wanted to be green but the best.” This highlights a quirk in Green II. It is about providing something to American consumers that is ready and affordable, but not changing their lifestyles too much. “No one wants to drive 40 miles per hour all the time, so they buy a Prius so they can drive the way they were driving and save fuel,” said Jonathan Propper, founder of Dropps. “You’ve got to give people the tools. With Dropps, they won’t have to buy all that plastic.” Those fighting for a radical solution are still marginalized. Greasecar can convert a diesel-powered car into a zero-carbon emissions vehicle for around $1,000  and do the same for a commercial truck for about $10,000. But the company’s high-water mark for sales was just over $2 million in 2006, when consumers were shocked by rising gasoline prices. Now that people have become accustomed to paying more at the pump, Greasecar’s sales have slowed. One reason is the need for a commitment: Greasecar engines run on waste oil from restaurants, which owners must process themselves.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Saks Inc., the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue stores, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday. Related Times Topics: Home Depot Inc. Times Topics: Target Corporation Home Depot, the leading home improvement retailer, and Target, the No. 2 discounter after Wal-Mart, both reported lower earnings, and warned that results for the rest of the year would be sluggish. “As gas and food prices continue to rise and housing market slows, consumers are facing increased financial pressure and reducing their spending, especially in discretionary categories,” Target’s chief executive, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said in a call with analysts. Shares of Home Depot fell $1.50, to $27.37, while Target slipped 63 cents, to $54.29. While Target and Home Depot have different business models, the weakness in consumer spending is widespread. The upscale department store owner Inc."&gt;Saks Inc. was also downbeat about prospects for the rest of this year. “I do believe that we’re in a rough economic period right now,” Saks’s chief executive, Stephen I. Sadove, said. “The consumer is operating as if we are in a recession, whether we’re technically in one or not.” Saks, which operates the Saks Fifth Avenue stores, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as markdowns pressured gross margin even though sales rose 9 percent, to $862.4 million, as consumers responded to promotions. Mr. Sadove said that higher-end consumers who crave designer brands were still willing to spend, but lower-end buyers, who represent 15 to 20 percent of Saks’s customer base, were more pressured. Target reported a 7.5 percent drop in quarterly profit as shoppers passed over clothes and jewelry in favor of basics like food. The company said profit was $602 million, or 74 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, which ended May 3, down from $651 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 71 cents a share, according to Reuters estimates. Sales, excluding credit card revenue, rose 5 percent, to $14.3 billion, bolstered by new store openings. But sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial retail gauge known as same-store sales, fell 0.7 percent. Home Depot said its profit fell 66 percent as the housing crisis hurt sales. It also took a charge to close stores and curb expansion plans. Net income fell to $356 million, or 21 cents a share, in the first quarter ended May 4, from $1.05 billion, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the charge, profit was 41 cents a share, compared with the average forecast of 37 cents. Sales fell 3.4 percent to $17.9 billion, topping estimates of $17.63 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 6.5 percent. Home Depot’s rival Lowe’s said on Monday that first-quarter profit fell 18 percent, while total sales slid 1.3 percent. It also cut its full-year earnings forecast. The Home Depot results “corroborate assessments from Lowe’s results yesterday  the sector is bumping along the bottom, lagging housing turnover by several months,” a Goldman Sachs analyst, Matthew Fassler, said in a note.

Rubenstein, co-founder and managing director of the Carlyle Group. As the subprime crisis sent deal-making into a tailspin last August, Carlyle barely saved its buyout of Home Depot’s contractor supply unit. When banks balked at lending, Carlyle increased the amount of cash it put in and persuaded Home Depot to cut the price 18 percent, to $8.5 billion. In December, unions petitioned regulators to block Carlyle’s $6.3 billion purchase of the nursing home chain Manor Care, accusing the firm of focusing on profits to the detriment of patients. Though their effort was unsuccessful, the unions continued to hound Mr. Rubenstein, demonstrating in January at the University of Pennsylvania, where he gave a speech at a private equity conference held at the Wharton School. “For the next year or so, we will be in purgatory,” he told the conference. “We will have to atone for our sins a little bit.” A few weeks later, Carlyle’s mortgage bond fund paid for the transgression of overleveraging. The Carlyle Capital Corporation defaulted on $16.6 billion of debt, after borrowing 32 times its $670 million of equity capital nine months earlier to invest mainly in AAA-rated mortgage securities. Carlyle, whose 60 funds own $81.1 billion in assets, can withstand the $150 million loss from the Carlyle Capital failure. More severe was the damage to its reputation for stellar returns  an average of more than 30 percent annually since its founding in 1987, according to the company. “They tripped, and they tripped in public,” says Paul L. Schaye, managing director of Chestnut Hill Partners, based in New York, which helps private equity firms find investments. “That hurts the brand.” Carlyle’s woes reflect those of the whole private equity industry. After low interest rates and a booming stock market fueled record deal volume in 2006 and 2007, the pace of buyouts has screeched to a halt. The subprime crisis, rising interest rates and a shrinking appetite for stock offerings have choked off the industry’s main sources of profit. As banks balked at extending credit, announced buyouts globally plummeted 63 percent in the second half of 2007 to $200.8 billion, from $542.0 billion in the first half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The slump worsened in the first quarter, when $60.7 billion of deals were announced globally, down 70 percent from $200 billion a year earlier. Carlyle’s total plummeted to just $568.6 million in the first quarter, an 86 percent drop from $4 billion a year earlier. “The Greek gods reminded us that golden ages end, and not always happily,” Mr. Rubenstein, a slender 58-year-old with silver hair and glasses, said in a talk at a private equity conference in December in Dubai, where Carlyle set up an office in 2007. Carlyle is counting on its head start in international markets to help it weather the turbulence. Mr. Rubenstein predicts that within five years, about two-thirds of the firm’s investments will be in companies outside the United States. Currently, 64 percent is in North America. Carlyle itself has been hit by the markets’ edginess. Last year it postponed plans for an initial public offering. Instead, the Mubadala Development Company, an arm of the Abu Dhabi government, bought 7.5 percent of Carlyle for $1.35 billion in September. To continue to attract investors, Carlyle needs new markets. Last year, Carlyle began raising a $750 million Middle East fund  its first  which aims at taking stakes in local family-owned companies or making buyouts.

Skip to next paragraph Look back at the Giants' Super Bowl XLII victory. The Game As It Happened The Fox Telecast Ads Take a Back Seat Prediction Challenge Results Go to The Fifth Down Blog » Enlarge This Image Tami Chappell/Reuters Lamar Campbell cleared debris from outside the Georgia Dome in Atlanta last month after a tornado tore off part of the roof. It was a year ago when dogs began to rip the Falcons apart. Then came the Razorbacks and finally a Tuna, and the team became a menagerie of misfortune. Michael Vick ended up in prison, Bobby Petrino went to Arkansas and Bill Parcells landed in Miami. By the time animal-rights picketers left town, Falcons fans had given up, the team had collapsed and the organization had redefined haplessness. And this was already a franchise without consecutive winning seasons in its 42-season history. Now, the Falcons’ owner, Arthur Blank, is trying to clean up the mess. Rebuilding would be his thing, considering he is a founder of Home Depot. He has a rookie coach, a first-time general manager and a bundle of draft picks. He also has some unexpected feelings about the possible return to Atlanta of Vick  who is serving a 23-month prison sentence in Leavenworth, Kan., for his role in a dogfighting operation. “I have not flatly ruled that out,” Blank said during an interview earlier this month at the owners’ meetings in Palm Beach, Fla. “Every emotion you could name with Michael, I felt. Betrayal, disappointment, anger, frustration. On the other hand, I do believe in second chances and people having the opportunity to come back. “Michael is working hard, going through a rehabilitation process emotionally. Hopefully, he’ll be back in the N.F.L. some day. If he comes back, he will be a great role model and be able to talk to young people about making choices.” Blank has a reputation, one agent said recently, of preferring the big splash. Bringing back Vick would certainly qualify as a cannonball, although it would also run counter to a philosophy Blank is trying to embrace after the past year’s misfortunes. When he began his coaching search after Petrino left 11 months into the job, he received a note and a phone call from the Pittsburgh Steelers’ chairman, Dan Rooney. “Be patient,” Rooney advised. Petrino had been the hot college coach when Blank quickly hired him. But Petrino proved to be aloof and incapable of adapting to N.F.L. players. After promising Blank he would stay as coach amid rumors that he was on the way out, Petrino left a day later with barely a word to his players and assistants. The team was 3-10. Soon after, Parcells spurned at the last minute an offer to be the executive in charge of rebuilding the Falcons. He accepted a similar job with the Miami Dolphins. “Forty-five years in business, and I’ve never been through a year like last year,” Blank said. “It was like torture. Every day got worse. Every day, something else came out. Between what happened with Michael and then the coach leaving, it was a very difficult year for everybody.” A few days after Christmas, Blank turned to Ernie Accorsi, the former general manager of the Giants who retired after the 2006 season. Accorsi acted as a consultant to Blank for three weeks, identifying a handful of candidates for the general manager’s job. On the list was Thomas Dimitroff, the Patriots’ director of college scouting, whom Accorsi had known for years. Dimitroff’s father had been a scout for Accorsi in Cleveland. The Patriots’ owner, Robert Kraft, whom Blank considers his closest friend and mentor in the N.F.L., also thought highly of Dimitroff. Dimitroff was soon hired, and he eventually hired Mike Smith to be the Falcons’ head coach. Smith, a former defensive coordinator for the Jaguars, was largely unknown to some N.F.L. executives despite spending years in the game. Although Dimitroff did not initially have Smith on his list, they bonded over a shared philosophy of personnel analysis when Smith returned for a second interview. Neither man was the first choice, or the biggest name, for the two jobs. “We have to preach that we have a plan,” Smith said. “That we are very systematic in how we’ll approach this. When you’re systematic, I don’t think there is a time frame on when results will come.” Blank conceded that the Falcons would have to win back fans who were split over Vick and alienated by losing. And a slow turnaround is rarely exciting. But Dimitroff was schooled by the Patriots’ Bill Belichick and Scott Pioli in the measured fiscal approach that has made that franchise so successful. Already, there is a shift in the Falcons’ culture. Dimitroff talks of comparatives and cap considerations. Smith immediately reached out to players, opening lines of communication that had been closed. Gone are players like Alge Crumpler, Warrick Dunn and DeAngelo Hall, a gifted cornerback who was unhappy in Atlanta. Now comes the hard part. The Falcons, in need of any fix after finishing 4-12, hope to resist the quick one. “Being able to come here with sound decisions, not just being lured in by that awesome athlete that walks in front of you, but realizing he might not be exact fit for the Falcons,” Dimitroff said. “This player may sell tickets, but if we all step back and realize the best way to go forward is to build from the bottom up, be consistent, getting the right people here.” Blank said he was committed to adopting the measured approach of the N.F.L.’s consistent winners of recent seasons: the Colts, the Patriots, the Eagles and the Steelers. He has traveled to look at draft prospects, which has raised eyebrows and questions among his peers about whether he is too involved in personnel decisions. He insisted that he was not, that he was invited on trips by his football staff and would leave the decisions to Dimitroff and Smith. “What we have to do is make sure this is not about splashing  you do that in water sports,” Blank said. “We have to do what our personnel department believes is best to do. You build from the foundation up. If that means we draft an offensive lineman, so be it.” Maybe the Falcons’ fortunes are starting to turn. Dimitroff won a coin flip for the third overall selection in this month’s draft. The team has six choices in the first three rounds, giving the Falcons a chance to develop a nucleus for years to come. It was at the draft last year when Vick told Commissioner Roger Goodell that he knew nothing of the dogfighting operation that had just been discovered on his property. “Only a year,” Blank said with a laugh. “It feels like 10 to me.” More Articles in Sports »The tornado that tore off parts of the Georgia Dome roof last month serves as a metaphor for the N.F.L. team that plays underneath it: The Atlanta Falcons never saw what hit them in 2007, and they were left flapping in the wind. Skip to next paragraph Look back at the Giants' Super Bowl XLII victory. The Game As It Happened The Fox Telecast Ads Take a Back Seat Prediction Challenge Results Go to The Fifth Down Blog » Enlarge This Image Tami Chappell/Reuters Lamar Campbell cleared debris from outside the Georgia Dome in Atlanta last month after a tornado tore off part of the roof. It was a year ago when dogs began to rip the Falcons apart. Then came the Razorbacks and finally a Tuna, and the team became a menagerie of misfortune. Michael Vick ended up in prison, Bobby Petrino went to Arkansas and Bill Parcells landed in Miami. By the time animal-rights picketers left town, Falcons fans had given up, the team had collapsed and the organization had redefined haplessness. And this was already a franchise without consecutive winning seasons in its 42-season history. Now, the Falcons’ owner, Arthur Blank, is trying to clean up the mess. Rebuilding would be his thing, considering he is a founder of Home Depot. He has a rookie coach, a first-time general manager and a bundle of draft picks. He also has some unexpected feelings about the possible return to Atlanta of Vick  who is serving a 23-month prison sentence in Leavenworth, Kan., for his role in a dogfighting operation. “I have not flatly ruled that out,” Blank said during an interview earlier this month at the owners’ meetings in Palm Beach, Fla. “Every emotion you could name with Michael, I felt. Betrayal, disappointment, anger, frustration. On the other hand, I do believe in second chances and people having the opportunity to come back. “Michael is working hard, going through a rehabilitation process emotionally. Hopefully, he’ll be back in the N.F.L. some day. If he comes back, he will be a great role model and be able to talk to young people about making choices.” Blank has a reputation, one agent said recently, of preferring the big splash. Bringing back Vick would certainly qualify as a cannonball, although it would also run counter to a philosophy Blank is trying to embrace after the past year’s misfortunes. When he began his coaching search after Petrino left 11 months into the job, he received a note and a phone call from the Pittsburgh Steelers’ chairman, Dan Rooney. “Be patient,” Rooney advised. Petrino had been the hot college coach when Blank quickly hired him. But Petrino proved to be aloof and incapable of adapting to N.F.L. players. After promising Blank he would stay as coach amid rumors that he was on the way out, Petrino left a day later with barely a word to his players and assistants. The team was 3-10. Soon after, Parcells spurned at the last minute an offer to be the executive in charge of rebuilding the Falcons. He accepted a similar job with the Miami Dolphins. “Forty-five years in business, and I’ve never been through a year like last year,” Blank said. “It was like torture. Every day got worse. Every day, something else came out. Between what happened with Michael and then the coach leaving, it was a very difficult year for everybody.” A few days after Christmas, Blank turned to Ernie Accorsi, the former general manager of the Giants who retired after the 2006 season. Accorsi acted as a consultant to Blank for three weeks, identifying a handful of candidates for the general manager’s job. On the list was Thomas Dimitroff, the Patriots’ director of college scouting, whom Accorsi had known for years. Dimitroff’s father had been a scout for Accorsi in Cleveland. The Patriots’ owner, Robert Kraft, whom Blank considers his closest friend and mentor in the N.F.L., also thought highly of Dimitroff. Dimitroff was soon hired, and he eventually hired Mike Smith to be the Falcons’ head coach. Smith, a former defensive coordinator for the Jaguars, was largely unknown to some N.F.L. executives despite spending years in the game. Although Dimitroff did not initially have Smith on his list, they bonded over a shared philosophy of personnel analysis when Smith returned for a second interview. Neither man was the first choice, or the biggest name, for the two jobs. “We have to preach that we have a plan,” Smith said. “That we are very systematic in how we’ll approach this. When you’re systematic, I don’t think there is a time frame on when results will come.” Blank conceded that the Falcons would have to win back fans who were split over Vick and alienated by losing. And a slow turnaround is rarely exciting. But Dimitroff was schooled by the Patriots’ Bill Belichick and Scott Pioli in the measured fiscal approach that has made that franchise so successful. Already, there is a shift in the Falcons’ culture. Dimitroff talks of comparatives and cap considerations. Smith immediately reached out to players, opening lines of communication that had been closed. Gone are players like Alge Crumpler, Warrick Dunn and DeAngelo Hall, a gifted cornerback who was unhappy in Atlanta. Now comes the hard part. The Falcons, in need of any fix after finishing 4-12, hope to resist the quick one. “Being able to come here with sound decisions, not just being lured in by that awesome athlete that walks in front of you, but realizing he might not be exact fit for the Falcons,” Dimitroff said. “This player may sell tickets, but if we all step back and realize the best way to go forward is to build from the bottom up, be consistent, getting the right people here.” Blank said he was committed to adopting the measured approach of the N.F.L.’s consistent winners of recent seasons: the Colts, the Patriots, the Eagles and the Steelers. He has traveled to look at draft prospects, which has raised eyebrows and questions among his peers about whether he is too involved in personnel decisions. He insisted that he was not, that he was invited on trips by his football staff and would leave the decisions to Dimitroff and Smith. “What we have to do is make sure this is not about splashing  you do that in water sports,” Blank said. “We have to do what our personnel department believes is best to do. You build from the foundation up. If that means we draft an offensive lineman, so be it.” Maybe the Falcons’ fortunes are starting to turn. Dimitroff won a coin flip for the third overall selection in this month’s draft.

Medical Center Gets Another $100 Million Gift<date>Published: April 16, 2008</date><text>Kenneth G. Langone, a billionaire financier and a founder of Home Depot, is giving another $100 million donation to New York University Medical Center, matching the one that he made anonymously in 1999. In return, the university plans to name the medical center the N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center, effective Wednesday. The university says that it will use the $200 million from Mr. Langone and his wife, Elaine A. Langone, to start a campaign to raise $1 billion for a new hospital pavilion. The university says it has already raised $50 million for the project. It has also hired the team of Polshek Partnership Architects/NBBJ to design the pavilion and create a master plan  a “campus road map”  to unify the buildings under the medical center’s jurisdiction on its site between First Avenue and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive south of 34th Street. Its major components include the N.Y.U. School of Medicine, the Tisch Hospital, the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine and the Hospital for Joint Diseases, which is on 17th Street at Second Avenue. The medical center also provides the staff for Bellevue Hospital Center and the Veterans Affairs Hospital nearby. N.Y.U.’s medical school is the oldest of the institutions under the medical center’s umbrella, and the Langones’ gift is the largest in the school’s 167-year history, according to the dean, Dr. Robert I. Grossman. It is also one of the largest gifts to any medical school in the United States. Last year, Weill Medical College of Cornell University received $250 million from Sanford I. Weill, a former chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, and his wife, Joan. That was on top of two $100 million gifts from the Weills, the first in 1998, the other in 2002. The renaming of the medical center means that former Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s father, Bernard, who is being treated for Parkinson’s disease, will be hospitalized in an institution that carries Mr. Langone’s name. As state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer and Mr. Langone tangled, and when Mr. Spitzer was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2006, Mr. Langone contributed to the campaign of Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive. At the time, Mr. Langone said Mr. Spitzer’s only motivation was “raw ambition for pure political gain.” The feud began when Mr. Spitzer sued Mr. Langone over the compensation package paid to Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Langone headed the exchange’s compensation committee during the years when Mr. Grasso took home his biggest payouts. Mr. Langone said on Tuesday that he had not known that Bernard Spitzer was a patient at N.Y.U. Medical Center. “It’s ironic,” he said, “but one of the reasons Mrs. Langone and I are supporting the place is they do everything they can with passion to help every person who comes in there. I hope Mr. Spitzer’s father has a successful stay, and if there’s anything I can do, I’d be happy to do that.” Unlike many large donations to colleges and universities, the Langones’ gift is unrestricted, meaning that the Langones did not dictate how the money had to be spent. But Mr. Langone has not been uninvolved in planning the medical center’s future. He was named chairman of its board nine years ago, and he said that after talking with his wife about taking on the job, “we concluded if I was going to be chairman of the place, I had to demonstrate some tangible commitment.” That led to the first $100 million. “But we wanted it done anonymously,” he said. “I didn’t want people to think I was just showing up and doing this.” Mr. Langone had no connection to the medical school until Martin Lipton, a mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer who is the chairman of the university’s board, approached him about taking on a role in leading the medical center. Mr. Langone earned a master’s degree in business administration from N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business in 1960, in an evening program that now bears his name. But he said that he and his wife were consumers at the medical center: Mrs. Langone had a hip replacement operation at the Hospital for Joint Diseases five weeks ago. “When I go through the place,” Mr. Langone said, as he does for routine blood tests, “it’s not unlike when I go into a Home Depot store.” Which is how, during a magnetic resonance imaging exam, he noticed that a light in the ceiling had burned out. “I’m laying on my back and I see a highhat where the light’s out,” he recalled. “I go, ‘We’re spending tens of millions of dollars on equipment and we can’t afford a light bulb?’ I’m a bit of a type A.” The medical center said the other gifts it had raised were $45 million from Fiona Druckenmiller, a former portfolio manager for the Dreyfus Corporation, and her husband, Stanley F. Druckenmiller, the founder of Duquesne Capital, and $5 million from Marjorie and Walter Buckley, longtime friends of the Langones. More Articles in New York Region »Kenneth G.

Campaigns for everything from cars to food to clothing have played up saving money rather than status or fashion. Now, with consumer spending slowing further  as evidenced by the lackluster retail sales data reported on Thursday, the weakest results for a March since 1995  there is a noticeable increase in pitches that are focused on value. For instance, readers of the April 14 issue of In Touch Weekly magazine will find ads for the N.Y.C. New York Color cosmetics sold by Del Laboratories (“You’re beautiful and smart ... Why pay more?”), the TreSemmé line of hair care products made by Alberto-Culver (“Curls you’ll love. A price you’ll adore”) and the $1 Spicy Chick’n Crisp sandwich sold at Burger King. “Value is a big part of the equation for fast food,” said Rob Reilly, partner and co-executive creative director at a Burger King agency, Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Miami, part of MDC Partners, which is creating commercials for a new menu item, the Cheesy Bacon B.K. Wrapper, priced at $1.39 each. “As the economy struggles, people still have to eat,” Mr. Reilly said. “You want to get into the value game, because it’s a nice way to drive traffic.” The May issue of Redbook magazine carries five ads that speak to consumers whose mind-set is recessionary. The Suave hair care range owned by Unilever asks women to “Say yes to beautiful without paying the price.” Wal-Mart promises “brand-name bras at a great price.” And Home Depot entices shoppers with an “exclusive 15 percent discount” on Bali window shades and blinds. “All the research we are doing says absolutely there is concern about the economy,” said Bill Koenigsberg, chief executive at Horizon Media in New York, an agency that works for marketers like Ace Hardware, Geico, Harrah’s and Jack in the Box. As a result, “you’ve got to tell it like it is” in ads, he said, rather than avoiding the economic elephant in the room. One advertiser that is taking that candid tack is LoJack, the maker of automotive antitheft devices. One of five commercials in a campaign that started this week addresses a subject rarely discussed in ads until now. The spot features a man describing how “the first thing” he thought of when he realized his car was missing was “how upside down I was on my car loan”  a term meaning he owed more than the car was worth. “I’d still be making payments on a car I didn’t have,” the man frets. But his car was equipped with LoJack, a stern-voice announcer reveals, so the spot has a happy ending. “We’d done interviews in Los Angeles, New York and New Jersey, big markets for LoJack, and a car dealer used the expression,” said Greg Smith, chief creative officer at the LoJack agency, the Via Group in Portland, Me. “We’d heard it, but didn’t know how much a phenomenon it was,” Mr. Smith recalled, “so we Googled ‘upside down on a loan.’ ” After learning how prevalent it is  by some estimates, a quarter of car buyers owed more on their previous cars than the resale values  a decision was made to devote a commercial to the subject. “A lot of clients don’t want to ever mention anything negative,” Mr. Smith said. “But advertising doesn’t have to be just fun and frivolous.” “When times are more uncertain,” he added, “advertising can play a role in solving problems for people.” As altruistic as that may sound, the purpose of ads that sell the idea of value is, of course, to move merchandise. For example, since Wal-Mart introduced a campaign in September with the theme “Save money. Live better,” its sales have increased faster than before  and faster than those of competitors like Target. Amid the gloomy reports from retailers on Thursday, Wal-Mart’s was a bright spot; the company also raised its profit projection for the first quarter. “We continue to get all kinds of great feedback from customers,” said Stephen Quinn, chief marketing officer at Wal-Mart in Bentonville, Ark. “A lot of research showed us how important this is to the majority of Americans.” That is why a Wal-Mart television, print and online campaign introduced on March 31, which celebrates April as “Earth Month,” goes green in two ways: saving the planet and saving money. The campaign promotes products like a $7.50 T-shirt that is made with plastic recycled from Coca-Cola bottles; mulch made from recycled tire rubber ($5.47 for a 20-pound bag); and Tide Coldwater detergent, marked down to $15.87 from $17.97. The theme of the campaign is epitomized by the headline of an ad in a 16-page booklet that will be inserted in May issues of magazines: “Earth-friendly products won’t save the Earth if they don’t save people money.” The campaign is by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. It is “safe to say,” Mr. Quinn agreed, that the campaign would not have been approved if it had not demonstrated to shoppers that green products can be bought on a budget. As for results, Mr. Quinn said, “we’re really pleased at this stage,” adding that Wal-Mart plans “new initiatives after Earth Month is over.” In a twist, some ads about the sagging economy are centered on the efforts to improve the sagging economy, notably the federal stimulus plan approved in February. A humorous campaign for AirTran Airways, by Cramer-Krasselt in Chicago, urges consumers to spend their bonus checks from the government on travel. “It’s what you and your country can do for each other,” the ads declare, paraphrasing the inaugural address of President John F.

The economy “is sputtering, but passenger demand has been steady” for the airlines, said Tad Hutcheson, vice president for marketing at the Atlanta office of AirTran Airways. “Our greatest fear is that consumers will stop buying airline tickets,” he added. “Our job is to remind them to keep buying.” More Articles in Business »Forget the fancy blandishments of Madison Avenue.

They are getting price breaks by reviving an age-old retail strategy: haggling. A bargaining culture once confined largely to car showrooms and jewelry stores is taking root in major stores like Best Buy, Circuit City and Home Depot, as well as mom-and-pop operations. Savvy consumers, empowered by the Internet and encouraged by a slowing economy, are finding that they can dicker on prices, not just on clearance items or big-ticket products like televisions but also on lower-cost goods like cameras, audio speakers, couches, rugs and even clothing. The change is not particularly overt, and most store policies on bargaining are informal. Some major retailers, however, are quietly telling their salespeople that negotiating is acceptable. “We want to work with the customer, and if that happens to mean negotiating a price, then we’re willing to look at that,” said Kathryn Gallagher, a spokeswoman for Home Depot. In the last year, she said, the store has adopted an “entrepreneurial spirit” campaign to give salespeople and managers more latitude on prices in order to retain customers. The sluggish economy is punctuating a cultural shift enabled by wired consumers accustomed to comparing prices and bargaining online, said Nancy F. Koehn, a retail historian at the Harvard Business School. Haggling was once common before department stores began setting fixed prices in the 1850s. But the shift to bargaining in malls and on Main Street is a considerable change from even 10 years ago, Ms. Koehn said, when studies showed that consumers did not like to bargain and did not consider themselves good at it. “Call it the eBay phenomenon,” Ms. Koehn said. “The recession is helping to push these seedlings to the surface,” she added. “It’s a real turnabout on the part of the buyer and the seller.” John D. Morris, an apparel industry analyst for Wachovia, said that the ailing economy was not necessarily forcing all retailers to negotiate. But he says he believes that when there is an opportunity for negotiation, the shopper has the upper hand. “This is one of the periods where the customer is empowered,” Mr. Morris said. “The retailer knows that the customer is enduring tough times  and is more willing to be the one who blinks first in that stare-down match.” While tough times give people more incentive to change their behavior, it is the wealth of information about products made available on the Internet that gives consumers the know-how to try it. People now can quickly amass information on product availability and pricing, helping them develop strategies to get the best deal. Michael Roskell, 33, a technology project manager from Jersey City, N.J., said he and a friend from high school periodically visit electronics stores. While Mr. Roskell expresses interest in buying an item, his friend acts as though he is dissatisfied with the price and threatens to leave. “We play good cop, bad cop,” Mr. Roskell said. In February, he said, the friends got $20 off a pair of $250 speakers at 6th Avenue Electronics in the New York area. Earlier, he and the same friend negotiated to buy two 46-inch high-definition Sony televisions at P. C. Richard &amp; Son, a New York-area electronics chain. List price: $4,300. Price after negotiation: $3,305.50. “My parents never did this,” Mr. Roskell said. “But once you get it, you realize there’s a whole economy built on this.” The strategy can even work when buying pants. At least it did for David Achee of Maplewood, N.J., who said he went to a Polo Ralph Lauren store in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan last month and became interested in a pair of pants on the clearance rack for $75. He told the salesperson that he had seen a similar pair on the Internet for $65, adding that he thought the pair on the rack looked worn (even though he did not really think so). He got the pants for around $50, he said. Among his other tactics, he said, he sometimes threatens to walk out of a store and go to a competitor, as he did recently to get a price break on a drum set at a music store. But, mainly, he relies on researching prices and coming armed with information  prices he finds on the Internet and in ads from competitors. “You can negotiate, but you have to do your research,” said Mr. Achee, who works for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. “When I’m bargaining, I’m bargaining with information.” Information from the Internet helped Amber Kendall, 24, and her husband, Matt, when they shopped for a camera last October. The couple, who live in Boston, found the Canon camera they wanted online for $350, then used the Internet price to bargain with Ritz Camera, where the price was $400. Then they used the Ritz Camera offer to get the same price at Microcenter, where they preferred the warranty offer. The technological influences are not just on the consumer side. Retail industry analysts said corporate retailers have begun using computer systems that let them do real-time pricing and profit analysis. Such systems tell a company what price it can set and still make money, and they illuminate the trade-off between lowering prices and raising sales volumes, said Andy Hargreaves, a retail industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. Mr. Hargreaves did a little negotiating himself recently. At Best Buy last November, he bargained down the price of a 50-inch Samsung plasma television. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »SAN FRANCISCO  Shoppers are discovering an upside to the down economy. They are getting price breaks by reviving an age-old retail strategy: haggling. A bargaining culture once confined largely to car showrooms and jewelry stores is taking root in major stores like Best Buy, Circuit City and Home Depot, as well as mom-and-pop operations. Savvy consumers, empowered by the Internet and encouraged by a slowing economy, are finding that they can dicker on prices, not just on clearance items or big-ticket products like televisions but also on lower-cost goods like cameras, audio speakers, couches, rugs and even clothing. The change is not particularly overt, and most store policies on bargaining are informal. Some major retailers, however, are quietly telling their salespeople that negotiating is acceptable. “We want to work with the customer, and if that happens to mean negotiating a price, then we’re willing to look at that,” said Kathryn Gallagher, a spokeswoman for Home Depot. In the last year, she said, the store has adopted an “entrepreneurial spirit” campaign to give salespeople and managers more latitude on prices in order to retain customers. The sluggish economy is punctuating a cultural shift enabled by wired consumers accustomed to comparing prices and bargaining online, said Nancy F. Koehn, a retail historian at the Harvard Business School. Haggling was once common before department stores began setting fixed prices in the 1850s. But the shift to bargaining in malls and on Main Street is a considerable change from even 10 years ago, Ms. Koehn said, when studies showed that consumers did not like to bargain and did not consider themselves good at it. “Call it the eBay phenomenon,” Ms. Koehn said. “The recession is helping to push these seedlings to the surface,” she added. “It’s a real turnabout on the part of the buyer and the seller.” John D. Morris, an apparel industry analyst for Wachovia, said that the ailing economy was not necessarily forcing all retailers to negotiate. But he says he believes that when there is an opportunity for negotiation, the shopper has the upper hand. “This is one of the periods where the customer is empowered,” Mr. Morris said. “The retailer knows that the customer is enduring tough times  and is more willing to be the one who blinks first in that stare-down match.” While tough times give people more incentive to change their behavior, it is the wealth of information about products made available on the Internet that gives consumers the know-how to try it. People now can quickly amass information on product availability and pricing, helping them develop strategies to get the best deal. Michael Roskell, 33, a technology project manager from Jersey City, N.J., said he and a friend from high school periodically visit electronics stores. While Mr. Roskell expresses interest in buying an item, his friend acts as though he is dissatisfied with the price and threatens to leave. “We play good cop, bad cop,” Mr. Roskell said. In February, he said, the friends got $20 off a pair of $250 speakers at 6th Avenue Electronics in the New York area. Earlier, he and the same friend negotiated to buy two 46-inch high-definition Sony televisions at P. C. Richard &amp; Son, a New York-area electronics chain. List price: $4,300. Price after negotiation: $3,305.50. “My parents never did this,” Mr. Roskell said. “But once you get it, you realize there’s a whole economy built on this.” The strategy can even work when buying pants.

Home Depot, based in Atlanta, said on Tuesday that 2008 was expected to be worse in terms of sales and profits. The outlook was even gloomier than the one given Monday by a rival, the Lowe’s Companies, which predicted improving sales on the horizon. “We think we’ve still lost share to the market,” the chief executive of Home Depot, Frank S. Blake, told analysts during a conference call. The home improvement industry has suffered as consumers pulled back on renovations in the face of declining home values. Mr. Blake, noting that last year was among the most difficult financially for Home Depot, told analysts that the company was “still too often perceived as lagging in customer service.” Home Depot said it planned to add 55 stores this year, about half as many as last year. The results for the latest quarter fell short of Wall Street expectations, and shares rose a penny to $28.83. The company said it earned $671 million, or 40 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 3, compared with a profit of $925 million, or 46 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations in the quarter were 40 cents a share, compared with 42 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting earnings of 43 cents a share in the fourth quarter. With an extra sales week, revenue in the quarter rose 1.5 percent, to $17.66 billion, compared with $17.4 billion a year earlier. Excluding that additional week, fourth-quarter sales declined 4.7 percent compared with a year ago. Revenue for fiscal 2007 declined 2.1 percent, to $77.35 billion. A spokesman, Ron DeFeo, said that was the first annual sales decline for Home Depot. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 8.3 percent in the quarter. The company’s average sales ticket declined 2.3 percent, to $54.96 in the quarter, compared with $56.27 a year ago. For all of 2007, Home Depot said it earned $4.4 billion, or $2.37 a share, compared with a profit of $5.76 billion, or $2.79 a share, for 2006. Its $77.35 billion in sales for the year compared with $79.02 billion a year earlier. Lowe’s reported Monday that its fourth-quarter profit dropped by a third.

The chain appears to be the first major American retailer to make job cuts because of a slowdown in consumer spending, but it is unlikely to be the last. J. C. Penney said Thursday that it would eliminate about 150 jobs as part of a reorganization. “We are operating in a tough economic environment, and we see that continuing into 2008,” said Ron DeFeo, a spokesman for Home Depot. Home Depot is eliminating jobs in several departments, like human resources and information technology, but the layoffs will not affect workers at the chain’s 2,200 stores, Mr. DeFeo said. The chain announced the job cuts Thursday. Laid-off workers will receive pay for 60 days. Mr. DeFeo said Home Depot was focused on investing in its stores and would try to limit budget cuts to its headquarters. Home Depot, which sells home repair and improvement items, is at the center of the housing market slump. The chain’s third-quarter profit fell 27 percent, to $1.1 billion, from $1.5 billion in the period a year ago. Behind the earnings drop was a decline in sales to $19 billion, from $19.6 billion, as demand for home-building supplies like lumber and remodeling materials like paint slowed significantly. “We thought the housing market would be soft, but we were not pessimistic enough,” Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said when the retailer announced third-quarter earnings in November. The company predicted that its 2007 earnings from continuing operations, which have not yet been disclosed, could drop as much as 11 percent a share.

Last year, he sold the legacy business, spun off the Wabco braking unit, and changed the company’s name to Trane, its signature air-conditioning brand. And just last month, he sold Trane to Ingersoll-Rand, which had itself pared down in recent months. American Standard “had three good businesses that didn’t have commonality of customers, of the way they went to market, of materials or manufacturing processes or technology,” Mr. Poses said. “We realized there just wasn’t a lot of value in keeping them together.” Corporate executives and their Wall Street counterparts are subject to fads, and they have gone through previous periods in which first broadening and then narrowing business portfolios have taken center stage. At the moment, scaling back appears to be enjoying the upper hand. Edward D. Breen, who replaced L.

Throughout the 1960s, companies like ITT and Textron bought up businesses as disparate as hotels, food and machine tools. The prevailing ideas were that a good manager can manage anything, economies of scale would always yield lower costs, and a hodgepodge of businesses was the best hedge against economic cycles. Shareholders believed all that, too, and conglomerate shares soared. Then management consultants and business schools began promulgating the idea of “core competencies”  the notion that companies should focus only on businesses that best fit their skills and distribution channels. Shareholders hopped on board and began selling conglomerate stocks, prompting many such companies (General Electric is a notable exception) to shed businesses that were not an obvious fit. Over the last few years, many companies, scrambling for new ways to increase the scale of their core businesses, broadened their definition of core competency. Citigroup was in the money business  so why not sell products to consumers, businesses and investors alike? Home Depot was already selling to small contractors via its stores, so why not serve mega-builders directly? Mr. Kozlowski, who had built Tyco into a “three-legged stool” that rested on fire detectors, medical products and electronic components, added a fourth leg, a financial company, with the idea that offering financing would help the other legs grow. Now shareholders have grown disaffected with many of these new conglomerates, too. They again recognize that they can diversify their own portfolios by buying shares of single-focus companies  or, they can simply invest in mutual funds that are by definition diversified. “There is a growing sense among investors that portfolio managers do a better job than corporate managers,” said Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, a professor of business leadership at the Columbia Business School. “So they are asking point-blank, ‘Why are you keeping these businesses together?’” Corporate chiefs are having a harder time answering that question. Many of the perceived synergies between disparate businesses never really panned out, no matter how good they looked on paper. That is the reasoning behind the growing clamor among Citigroup investors for the financial behemoth to break itself into a consumer bank, an investment bank and a brokerage firm. “Banks that want to be one-stop shops for financial transactions must realize that it takes more than a pat on the back to get stockbrokers to cross-sell loans,” said Robert H.

Not long ago, Home Depot began selling a $25 fire extinguisher that did not look like a fire extinguisher: white, smooth and resembling a countertop kitchen appliance, it is attractive enough to keep within reach, according to a sales circular. Earlier this year, the Industrial Designers Society of America came to a similar conclusion when it gave the HomeHero one of its top awards. As is typical, the organizations judges praised both functional and aesthetic qualities of the object. The write-up for the International Design Excellence Award asserted that it is less cumbersome and easier to use than a traditional fire extinguisher. Most importantly, the statement concluded, its fashion-conscious looks mean that homeowners wont want to keep the HomeHero hidden out of view, ensuring it will be in reach when seconds matter. Industrial designers are forever pointing out they are not mere stylists; doing their job well means making better things, not better-looking things. So its attention-grabbing when IDEA judges call style the most important feature of a piece of home-safety equipment. Peter Arnell, founder of the marketing and design firm Arnell Group, which created the HomeHero, certainly doesnt play down the style factor. Regular extinguishers have had the same look for a hundred years, he explains, and are so damn obtrusive, ugly and not conducive to a pleasant experience of the rest of the aesthetic of your kitchen. His firms own internal research, following the informed intuition that sparked the creation of the device, found out that if people had fire extinguishers, they didnt know where they were. So solving the ugliness problem with the extinguisher was a priority. In fact, it still is. At the moment, the firm is working on creating skins so that HomeHero owners can customize their extinguishers. Its such a good thing for people, Arnell says. Normally things in the design world are very pleasing aesthetically  but they tend not to, how can I say this, provide a bigger service to your life. The essential claim that underlies the praise for the HomeHero  aesthetics save lives  is indicative of a broader shift. Once viewed with suspicion as source of planned obsolescence, a products looks have gradually come to be seen as creating value, pleasure and even quality. (Donald A. Norman, a Northwestern University professor and author of Emotional Design and other books, has famously argued that attractive things work better.) More recently, Prasad Boradkar, who teaches design at Arizona State University and was a member of this years IDEA judging panel, says he has noticed more designers, from students to professionals, positioning style as a form of sustainability  that is, if something looks good, were less likely to throw it away. Under this theory, pure style not only dodges the critique that it causes a superfluous-consumption problem; it actually solves that problem. Of course, Boradkar adds, designers know that such claims wont be taken seriously unless they are backed with substance. Still, this is the design argument that the HomeHero fits into: that good aesthetics can make a claim on virtue. In this instance, some have wondered whether it is a good idea to reinvent the form and color of something intended to be recognized instantly in an emergency. Whats better, Arnell responds rhetorically, something that has more talk value than anything in your kitchen? Thats the newest, hottest thing that could save your family? That has a unique new shape, that is clearly the next generation of fire extinguishers? Or something that you cant see and dont know where it is? Given the amount of attention the HomeHero has received for its looks, its no surprise that Arnell says that it is selling. But so far there has been little word of real-world fire situations involving the device. (Interestingly, judges for the IDEA award, which is sponsored in part by Business Week, dont actually handle or try out award-seeking products; they simply look at images and material supplied by the entrants.) Independent data on the fire extinguisher ugliness crisis are similarly hard to come by; an extinguisher expert with the National Fire Protection Association told me she hadnt heard the issue raised before (although she added that she liked the idea of an attractive extinguisher herself). But by various estimates, nearly half of American homes have no extinguisher at all, and it seems plausible that HomeHero buyers will include members of such households. Perhaps, then, the virtue of style lies in the commotion it causes  its talk value not in the home, but in the marketplace.

Under this theory, pure style not only dodges the critique that it causes a superfluous-consumption problem; it actually solves that problem. Of course, Boradkar adds, designers know that such claims wont be taken seriously unless they are backed with substance. Still, this is the design argument that the HomeHero fits into: that good aesthetics can make a claim on virtue. In this instance, some have wondered whether it is a good idea to reinvent the form and color of something intended to be recognized instantly in an emergency. Whats better, Arnell responds rhetorically, something that has more talk value than anything in your kitchen? Thats the newest, hottest thing that could save your family? That has a unique new shape, that is clearly the next generation of fire extinguishers? Or something that you cant see and dont know where it is? Given the amount of attention the HomeHero has received for its looks, its no surprise that Arnell says that it is selling. But so far there has been little word of real-world fire situations involving the device. (Interestingly, judges for the IDEA award, which is sponsored in part by Business Week, dont actually handle or try out award-seeking products; they simply look at images and material supplied by the entrants.) Independent data on the fire extinguisher ugliness crisis are similarly hard to come by; an extinguisher expert with the National Fire Protection Association told me she hadnt heard the issue raised before (although she added that she liked the idea of an attractive extinguisher herself). But by various estimates, nearly half of American homes have no extinguisher at all, and it seems plausible that HomeHero buyers will include members of such households. Perhaps, then, the virtue of style lies in the commotion it causes  its talk value not in the home, but in the marketplace.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/21/business/21circular.html?ref=homedepotinc">Instead of Fighting Ad Leaks, Some Retailers Embrace Them<date>Published: November 21, 2007</date><text>Every year, retailers denounce the renegade Web sites that prematurely disclose leaked copies of discount-filled advertisements for the day after Thanksgiving. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A page from a leaked Home Depot circular posted on the Web site Bfads.net. Related Times Topics: Black Friday But it turns out that a big source of the leaks are the retailers themselves. This holiday season, chains large and small quietly handed over their circulars to Web sites like Bfads.net and Gottadeal.com to ensure that millions of deal-hungry shoppers see their discounts well before the day known as Black Friday, traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year. Over the past few weeks, Home Depot, Pacific Sunwear, CompUSA and OshKosh BGosh each supplied the sites with an advance copy of its ads, according to the chains and the sites owners. The unlikely alliance between stores and the insurgent Web sites, once the sworn enemy of the industry, indicates how worried retailers are about the holiday shopping season, expected to be the weakest in five years. With consumers uneasy about the economy, the only thing worse than having a retail circular leaked to the sites, it seems, is not having it leaked to the sites, whose popularity and influence have soared since they first materialized in 2003. When Bfads.net, the most popular of the Black Friday sites, did not immediately post a circular from Pacific Sunwear earlier this month, an employee at the clothing chain made clear how important the site was to the company. I havent seen our Black Friday deals on your site yet, so I am sending it again, he wrote to Bfadss founder, according to a copy of the e-mail message. Michael Brim, the founder of Bfads.net, said the outreach from retailers was definitely a change of pace from a few years ago when they all wanted to file lawsuits against us. Mr. Brim created Bfads in 2003 to compile hundreds of Black Friday discounts and other holiday circulars in one place for die-hard bargain hunters. Scores of retailers tried to block the site from publishing their ads, using cease-and-desist letters to threaten legal action. The stores complained that the early publication of the circulars  generally distributed in newspapers on Thanksgiving  gave competitors time to match the early morning deep discounts of Black Friday. In 2004, for example, Home Depot demanded that Bfads take down its Black Friday circular. Its publication, a company spokesman said at the time, could enable competing retailers to react and change their plans. But this year, Home Depot is singing a different tune, deciding to give the sites its ads. These site are popular and we know people are looking for the information, said Ron Defeo, a spokesman for the chain. And since Home Depot assumes the sites will eventually obtain the circulars, with its help or not, we want to make sure they get the accurate information. Pacific Sunwear, the teenage clothing chain, began giving its circular to the Black Friday Web sites two years ago, because we believe our customer is very dialed into the Web, said Gar Jackson, a spokesman for the retailer. John D. Morris, a senior retail analyst at Wachovia Securities, said stores sudden willingness to work with the sites is so telling about this holiday season. The gloves are off, he said, referring to efforts by the chains to lure shoppers worried about their finances. Stores are using every weapon they can to reach consumers. Brad Olson, who runs Gottadeal.com, said Web-savvy retailers now see sites like his as free advertising. For regional stores, Black Friday Web sites provide a rare chance to compete head-to-head with bigger chains. H. H. Gregg, an electronics chain with stores in the Midwest and Southeast, now sends its Black Friday circulars to the sites to reach consumers who may have never heard of the retailer. But not everyone is playing ball, especially the nations biggest discount chains. The day we see Target or Best Buy or Wal-Mart send us their ads early  that would be something, Mr. Olson said. Wal-Mart, known for dangling deep early morning discounts on the day after Thanksgiving, has no plans to send its Black Friday ads to the Web sites. In fact, lawyers for the retailer sent Mr. Olson a letter in October warning that premature publication of Wal-Marts Black Friday circular can give rise to liabilities and severe penalties. But behind the scenes, the companys relationship with the sites appears to be thawing. After Wal-Marts lawyers issued their warning, an advertising manager for the company wrote Mr. Brim, the owner of Bfads.net, to thank him for generating so much online traffic for Walmart.com  traffic that resulted from publication of leaked Wal-Mart seasonal ads. I checked out your site today and yesterday and we pulled some traffic reports  great job, Shannon Doung, associate marketing manager at Walmart.com, wrote to Mr. Brim in early November. Almost over 43,000 clicks just yesterday alone, she added. Thanks for giving us a nice write-up on your front page.

It goes from boom to doom on a daily basis. The buy-in began after Wal-Mart gave a more upbeat sales forecast and reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, soothing fears, at least for a day, that middle- and lower-income consumers were already beginning to retrench. The companys stock leaped 6.1 percent to close at $45.97. Crude oil prices also dropped sharply, down $3.45 a barrel to settle at $91.17. Oil has retreated from what once looked to many analysts like an inevitable march toward the $100 mark. It remained near its nominal record, but yesterdays dip encouraged some traders to predict that potential price pressures from rising energy costs might ease. The drop in oil prices could be the start of some relief on energy costs for consumers going into the winter months, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard &amp; Poors. Financial shares recovered after taking a beating last week, when several major banks announced new write-downs related to subprime home loans. Investors were buoyed by comforting words from top executives at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, who said they were confident their companies would emerge relatively unscathed from the subprime mess. Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldmans president, said his bank would not take more write-downs on mortgage-backed securities, sending the banks stock up 8.5 percent to $233.04 a share. Shares in JPMorgan rose 6.3 percent. Shares of Citigroup, which said it would restructure its investment banking divisions after billions of dollars in write-downs last quarter, rose 6.9 percent, to $35.90 a share. The market loathes uncertainty, and surprise write-downs by brokerage firms have shaken investors who fear a collapse in the credit market. Bank of America said yesterday that it would write down $3 billion in collateralized debt obligations in the fourth quarter, but the stock rose 5.2 percent anyway as investors hoped the company, the nations biggest consumer bank, had disclosed the last of its losses. Technology stocks also began to recover from their worst week in five years. Apple may begin marketing its popular iPhone mobile device in China next year, exciting investors who sent the companys stock up more than 10 percent, but even after the big gain it was still down 11 percent for the last five trading days. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index gained 3.5 percent, its strongest performance of the year. So with all the good news yesterday, why isnt the market breathing easier? The jurys out on all of this, said Mr. Yardeni, normally a bull.

Indeed, Home Depot lowered its annual earnings prediction in the face of the ailing housing market, a disappointing outlook that was more in line with investors expectations about housing-related business activity.

For the Tulalip tribes, a group of several tribes on this reservation about 35 miles north of Seattle, the casino was also a springboard for new real estate ventures  which in turn are helping to transform a rural area into one of Washington states fastest-growing suburbs. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Peter Yates for The New York Times Quil Ceda Village, above, has big-box stores and smaller retailers. The economic engine is Quil Ceda Village, a commercial area within the reservation, where the tribes built a 225,000-square-foot casino in 2003. The village also has a Home Depot, a Wal-Mart and more than a dozen other stores, banks and restaurants. In 2005, the tribes added Seattle Premium Outlets, a 500,000-square-foot open-air mall. A 2,300-seat amphitheater, used for performances, opened in August 2006. The vision is diversification, said John McCoy, a tribal member and the general manager of Quil Ceda Village. Hospitality and retail properties are just the beginning, said Mr. McCoy, who is also a state representative. About 1,000 of the 2,000 acres that the tribes have set aside for Quil Ceda have yet to be developed, and Mr. McCoy said he had been fielding inquiries from companies that supply Boeing and from technology companies about erecting industrial buildings. The reservation itself is 22,000 acres. The tribes are currently working on the $130 million 12-story Tulalip Hotel, which is to open next July. It will include 30,000 square feet of conference space, meant for weddings and corporate meetings; a day spa; $1 million in tribal art; and themed suites like a high tech suite featuring a 70-inch plasma TV and Xbox 360, PlayStation and Nintendo Wii game systems. There are other economic development models among Indian reservations around the country, Mr. McCoy said. We can do what were doing because of location, location, location, he said. Located 100 miles from Vancouver, British Columbia, next to a busy stretch of Interstate 5, Quil Ceda Village is in Snohomish County, the 15th fastest growing county among the nations 100 most populated counties, according to Census Bureau figures released last spring. From 2000 to 2006, the county grew by 11 percent, to 669,887 people from 606,024. Population growth was a factor in the recent decision to create a branch campus of the University of Washington in the county. The Tulalips are helping to fuel the boom, said Matt Smith, vice president of the Economic Development Council of Snohomish County. The tribes 1,000-acre industrial property is the largest undeveloped parcel under single ownership in the county, said Mr. Smith, who has spread the word to manufacturing and distribution companies. Referring to the Tulalips, he said, They can afford to be selective. Quil Ceda Village attracts about 20,000 daily visitors and brought in about $30 million in taxes last year, most of it in sales taxes, according to the Washington State Department of Revenue. The traffic streaming to and from Quil Ceda is undoubtedly part of the reason that the city of Marysville, which is across the Interstate from the reservation, has opened 800,000 square feet of retail space in the last 12 months, said Caldie Rogers, executive director of the Marysville-Tulalip Chamber of Commerce, which says that it is the only chamber in the country that is in a partnership with a sovereign nation. There is no income tax in the state, and sales tax is a primary revenue source for cities, Ms. Rogers said. In 1992, the Tulalips built their first casino, which is on the reservation but not part of Quil Ceda Village. The casino created the revenue stream that allowed us to meet important needs of membership and earmark funds for development, said Glen Gobin, a member of the board for the tribes. A second casino, at Quil Ceda Village, followed. Mr. McCoy declined to specify the casinos revenue but said the tribes had invested more than $70 million in gambling profits on roads, water, sewerage and other services at Quil Ceda. For many years, the interest rates charged to Indian tribes by lending institutions were very high, said Jonathan B. Taylor, president of the Taylor Policy Group and an affiliate of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development. Gambling has provided tribes with an internal financing source and a predictable cash flow, he said. Construction of the Tulalip Hotel is being financed by a $200 million syndicated loan led by Wells Fargo. The loan also covers a tribal administration building, which will be completed next year. Plans to add a second hotel tower are under way, and a recreational vehicle park and office building are part of the vision, Mr. McCoy said. So far, the tribes have granted ground leases to most of the developers at Quil Ceda to build the stores, but a goal is to build and manage more noncasino properties itself in the future, said Mel Sheldon, chairman of the tribes board. When we start building to spec, we will get more money, he said. The Tulalips have also called for bids to construct a bio-gas plant, estimated at about $2 million. This plant would convert methane gas from cow manure into electricity, some of which the tribes would sell to a larger utility. Production is expected to begin in 2009. Other tribes, like the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians near Phoenix, are also developing large business parks, but such development is not a widespread phenomenon, Mr. Taylor said. You have to have interstate traffic and metropolitan proximity to be as successful as Quil Ceda, he said. Michele Rothstein, a spokeswoman for the Chelsea Property Group, which manages the outlet mall, said the center attracts busloads of shoppers from Vancouver and Seattle. This area is booming, said Jon Rickert, owner of Bobs Burger and Brew, which opened in Quil Ceda Village last year. With the hotel going in, business is only going to get better. There are some regrets, like the prominence of big-box stores. Hindsight being what it is, we probably wouldnt have made the decision to put a Home Depot and Wal-Mart at the front end of the resort, said Brett Magnan, vice president of Tulalip Hotel Operations. The tribes are planning to add several high-end restaurants and other destination pieces to support the hotel, he said. Diversification is intended to improve the social and economic well-being of people on the reservation, Mr. McCoy said, adding that Quil Ceda had helped to reduce the unemployment rate on the reservation from 65 percent in 1995 to about 10 percent today. Countywide, the rate is 4.5 percent. Mr. Sheldon said, We still have a lot of catching up to do. More Articles in Real Estate »TULALIP INDIAN RESERVATION, Wash.  For many American Indian tribes, a watershed moment occurs when they open a casino, which provides a stream of steady income.

So far, the tribes have granted ground leases to most of the developers at Quil Ceda to build the stores, but a goal is to build and manage more noncasino properties itself in the future, said Mel Sheldon, chairman of the tribes board. When we start building to spec, we will get more money, he said. The Tulalips have also called for bids to construct a bio-gas plant, estimated at about $2 million. This plant would convert methane gas from cow manure into electricity, some of which the tribes would sell to a larger utility. Production is expected to begin in 2009. Other tribes, like the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians near Phoenix, are also developing large business parks, but such development is not a widespread phenomenon, Mr. Taylor said. You have to have interstate traffic and metropolitan proximity to be as successful as Quil Ceda, he said. Michele Rothstein, a spokeswoman for the Chelsea Property Group, which manages the outlet mall, said the center attracts busloads of shoppers from Vancouver and Seattle. This area is booming, said Jon Rickert, owner of Bobs Burger and Brew, which opened in Quil Ceda Village last year. With the hotel going in, business is only going to get better. There are some regrets, like the prominence of big-box stores. Hindsight being what it is, we probably wouldnt have made the decision to put a Home Depot and Wal-Mart at the front end of the resort, said Brett Magnan, vice president of Tulalip Hotel Operations. The tribes are planning to add several high-end restaurants and other destination pieces to support the hotel, he said. Diversification is intended to improve the social and economic well-being of people on the reservation, Mr. McCoy said, adding that Quil Ceda had helped to reduce the unemployment rate on the reservation from 65 percent in 1995 to about 10 percent today. Countywide, the rate is 4.5 percent. Mr. Sheldon said, We still have a lot of catching up to do.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/business/14shop.html?ref=homedepotinc">As Home Depot Fights a Weak Economy, Wal-Mart Sees a Ray of Holiday Hope<date>Published: November 14, 2007</date><text>Economic unease, from the credit markets to the gas pump, is proving a boon to the nations largest discount retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, but a bust for the biggest home improvement chain, Home Depot, as consumers start to make choices about spending this holiday season. Wal-Mart said yesterday that its profit rose 8 percent in the third quarter, and the chain raised its earnings forecast for the year. But Home Depot said its profit plunged 27 percent, and the company cut its forecast for the year. The starkly different performances suggest that American consumers, bruised by a struggling housing market and rising fuel prices, are skipping expensive purchases  from kitchen renovations to new suits  in favor of discounted merchandise. That is setting the stage for a holiday shopping season with unexpected winners and losers. Traditional powerhouses like Ralph Lauren, Nordstrom and Coach are bracing for a slowdown, as customers start to flock to budget brands like Target, Wal-Mart and Marshalls. Analysts are calling it the trade-down holiday season  a reversal from years past, when consumers had traded up to higher-end chains. David Schick, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, sees a pocketed recession that has left industries like home improvement retailing in trouble. If you sell furniture, home improvement products and building materials, Mr. Schick said, you are in a significant recession. Wal-Mart, known for its low prices, said its profit was $2.9 billion for the quarter that ended Oct. 31, as sales rose 9 percent, to $90.1 billion. The giant retailer credited strong sales of household staples like groceries and beauty products. The chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said that times are a little tougher than they were a year ago, and consumers appreciate that they can count on Wal-Mart to save them money. A year ago, Wal-Mart began an ill-fated push into higher-priced, fashionable merchandise, like 600-thread count sheets and fur-trimmed denim, which misfired with consumers. Since then, the company has returned to its original message of low prices, emphasizing basics like T-shirts and towels  and running commercials that say that the store saves the average American family $2,500 a year. Bill Dreher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said that, as a result, Wal-Mart was now well positioned for the current state of the economy. Consumers, Mr. Dreher said, are shying away from higher-priced products. Wal-Mart has benefited from cost-cutting efforts. By scheduling more store staff members at peak shopping times, like evenings and weekends, and by reducing inventory, it has improved its profit, Mr. Dreher said. Mr. Scott, in a conference call yesterday, predicted that earnings from continuing operations would be $3.13 to $3.17 a share for the year, higher than Wal-Mart had forecast in August. Shares of Wal-Mart surged yesterday, closing up $2.65, to $45.97. The outlook was less rosy at Home Depot. The chains third-quarter profit fell to $1.1 billion from $1.5 billion in the period a year ago, with its chief executive, Frank S. Blake, blaming a tough environment in the housing market. Behind the earnings dip: sales dropped to $19 billion, from $19.6 billion, as demand for home-building supplies like lumber and remodeling materials like paint has tumbled. We thought the housing market would be soft, but we were not pessimistic enough, Carol B. Tomé, Home Depots chief financial officer, said The company predicted that annual earnings from continuing operations could drop as much as 11 percent a share, a steeper fall than previously predicted. As we look at the rest of the year, Ms. Tomé said, the market will remain soft. A sluggish housing market is not the only problem for Home Depot. The chain has promised that, after years of cutting back on service, it would invest heavily in new employees and remodeling of stores. Now, that extra spending has coincided with an economic downturn. Ms. Tomé said the improvements would help Home Depot after the economy turned around, even if it hurt earnings this year. There is evidence that the investments are paying off. Mr. Schick, of Stifel Nicolaus, said his surveys show customer service had improved, if only slightly. If this means making less money in 2008 and even 2009, its worth it, Mr. Schick said. We want the company to protect its long-term brand reputation, he said. Shares of Home Depot rose 66 cents, to $29.12. With the credit market in turmoil, Home Depot said it would not rush to finish the planned $22.5 billion stock repurchase program announced in June. So far, it has bought back $10.7 billion in shares. Yesterday, the company said it would take a cautious stance on the remaining share repurchases. We are not backing away, Ms. Tomé said in an interview. But things are very different than they were in June. More Articles in Business »Economic unease, from the credit markets to the gas pump, is proving a boon to the nations largest discount retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, but a bust for the biggest home improvement chain, Home Depot, as consumers start to make choices about spending this holiday season.

Multimedia Graphic Assessing the Plans Graphic Timeline: Criticism, Then Change Graphic Broader Coverage Related Q&amp;A: The Public Face of Wal-Marts Health Care Program (November 13, 2007) Health Plans Compared Wal-Mart (pdf) Home Depot (pdf) Costco (pdf) Target (pdf) Across the country, politicians and labor groups derided the companys health plans for their high expense and bare-bones coverage. Two states, California and Maryland, even passed laws demanding, in effect, that the company spend more on employee health benefits. We want this giant to behave itself, one Maryland legislator, Anne Healey, said at the time. The giant, it turns out, was listening. All the criticism was hurting its reputation and its ability to expand. So now, after spending two years seeking advice from everyone from Bill Clinton to executives at Starbucks, Wal-Mart is overhauling its health plans. The company, according to data available for the first time, is offering better coverage to a greater number of workers. Wal-Mart, the nations largest private employer, provides insurance to 100,000 more workers than it did just three years ago  and it is now easier for many to sign up for health care at Wal-Mart than at its rival, Target, whose reputation glows in comparison. Wal-Mart has hardly become a standard-bearer for corporate America: it still insures fewer than half its 1.4 million employees in the United States. But the changes in its policies have accomplished what once seemed impossible. Many of its most ardent critics have put down their pitchforks. Andrew L. Stern, whose Service Employees International Union set up an advocacy group to attack Wal-Mart three years ago, now concedes that there is clearly a focus on covering more people. Given Wal-Marts unparalleled track record of sharply cutting prices and wringing out inefficiencies, its focus on providing more affordable health care also holds significant promise in taming what has become a runaway expense for the nation. In one sign of its success so far, the company has pushed down the price of 2,400 generic prescription drugs to $4 a month for employees, starting next year, a program that it offers, in more limited form, to its customers. Now, the chain is even considering weight-loss clinics in its 4,000 stores and is toying with the idea of selling health insurance, hoping to finally bring coverage within reach of most Americans. The companys turnabout demonstrates the power of public pressure to change even the biggest corporations like Wal-Mart, which has based its business strategy on low costs at all costs. What Wal-Mart discovered is that the chorus of critics it had long ignored or blithely rebutted had a point. We were spending a lot of energy, and we werent making any headway, said H. Lee Scott Jr., the companys chief executive, who once traveled the country defending the retailers practices. Retrospectively now I say, yes, that plan needed to be improved. For a company whose mantra is to pinch every penny, the improvements have not come without a struggle. For decades, tens of thousands of its employees were never eligible for coverage, and what was offered was too costly for a work force whose average wages amounted to roughly $20,000 a year. The cheapest plan for a family cost about $1,500 a year in premiums and required workers to pay $3,000 in medical bills before Wal-Mart began paying any of their expenses. Even fewer could afford the more than $10,000 in bills they could end up responsible for under the plan. By 2000, as Wal-Mart became the largest retailer in the country, its health insurance drew heightened scrutiny. Labor groups like the United Food and Commercial Workers, which has members in grocery chains that compete with Wal-Mart, called attention to the companys meager coverage. The evidence was compelling: Wal-Mart workers routinely showed up in large numbers on state Medicaid rolls from Georgia to Washington. Encouraged by the passage of the California law in 2003, dozens of states considered bills requiring Wal-Mart to spend more on employee health benefits. None of the laws remain on the books. In the fall of 2005, Wal-Mart made its first stab at responding to its critics, introducing a health plan with premiums as low as $11 a month. But even that attempt was undercut when, a few days later, The New York Times disclosed a company memorandum proposing ways to reduce health care spending by hiring more part-time workers and discouraging unhealthy people from working at Wal-Mart. One suggestion would have required cashiers to gather carts as exercise. A combination of embarrassment, political necessity and internal pressure led to changes inside Wal-Marts headquarters. Among those weighing in was Bill Clinton, a close Wal-Mart observer from his days as governor of Arkansas; he urged Mr. Scott to look beyond the motives of his critics and focus on making the company a better employer. In April 2006, Mr. Scott replaced M. Susan Chambers, the author of the health care memo, with a high-profile colleague, Linda M. Dillman, who ran the formidable information technology division. Ms. Dillman said the assignment gave her pause. Is this a good thing or a bad thing, she recalled asking herself. Did I make somebody mad? But she said Mr. Scott emphasized how important her task was, telling her, We need you to go make a difference in health care. Ms. Dillman began by surveying Wal-Marts workers, researching the health plans at the nations most progressive employers and reaching out to top health policy experts. The new advisers did not mince words. You can do better by your employees, Mark D. Smith, chief executive of the powerful California Healthcare Foundation, told Wal-Mart executives at one meeting. But in wide-ranging conversations with federal officials like Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and executives like Michael J. Critelli, the executive chairman of Pitney Bowes, best known for making postage meters but also a leader in employee health care, Wal-Marts executives began revising how they thought about benefits. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »For much of the last decade, the retailing behemoth Wal-Mart Stores has been associated with stingy health care as much as low prices.

And verification of a suppliers environmental claims can be difficult. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7D91138F932A35752C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=homedepotinc">CRITICAL SHOPPER; Dream Houses and Wishful Thinkers<date>Published: November 1, 2007</date><text>I DON'T own a home. I live under tenuous circumstances in a dilapidated rental apartment in Brooklyn. I still decorate with art from friends, furniture plucked from the street, and piles of books in precarious Dr. Seuss-like stacks. The Home Depot on West 23rd Street in Manhattan, a giant three-floor wedding cake of a space, can be seductive to someone like me. It's layered with everything you could possibly want in order to spruce up, renovate or maybe even build a house. You could walk around the vast space for more than an hour, as I did, and keep adding things to your personal job jar until you have enslaved yourself for the next 10 years. Not only that, you will fantasize of some future time when your credit history isn't so dubious and you have a home that needs all the available flooring, counter space, window treatments and tile. Soon, sauntering through Home Depot, you will have created a hideously gaudy Siegfried and Roy mansion in your mind. Carpets are immediately to the right as you enter. There are many choices, even intense-length shag styles and extreme colors like Mystical Night and Scented Sachet. Lighting is to the left, a glowing menagerie of wall sconces, track lighting and lamps, including a Disney plastic Tinker Bell lamp ($49.97) that would be cute if it didn't look as if it might be recalled next week for containing lead. A flex-arm lamp ($34.92) has pinwheel-shape shades in purple, pink and green, and went from tacky to kitsch and back again as I stood there looking at it. At the flooring section nearby I was dazzled by the polished stones in the Solistone decorative pebble collection. The designs have names like Rumi, White Onyx and Turkish Amberet, along with an accompanying photo of a pebble-walled bathroom in erotic midnight blue that looked suitable for the Pamela Anderson-Rick Salomon honeymoon suite in Las Vegas. If you happen to be replacing the front door of your third home, I found an aisle of grand handles and locks. The doorknobs in the Baldwin Estate collection have names of upscale areas that are strangely evocative: Kensington, Roanoke, Pasadena. The Edinburgh, a traditional gated-community-style door handle, is an evocative $688. I hung around this section to see the Manhattanites who would come to Home Depot for such a door treatment, but they never appeared. Maybe the Baldwin Estate collection is merely for show, or maybe it's finally true that New York City has become an upper-middle-class suburb. I spent a long time staring at the faucets, which are mostly in the $200 to $400 range, from traditional two-handled bathroom-sink styles to those contrived, inefficient gushing troughs you might find in an overdesigned Thai fusion restaurant. Next to this are shower heads. Most notable is a display for the VertiSpa, which has a normal apparatus along with five adjustable nozzles that shoot water vertically down your body ($279). ''Why settle for an ordinary shower?'' reads the display's tag line. Yeah, you're right, VertiSpa, why should I settle? I am so incredibly far from owning property, but the Depot was giving me fix-and-flip fantasies, a sentiment that carries a lot of weight these days. Like the rest of the country, Home Depot is feeling the effects of the subprime loan crisis. The chain reported a 14.8 percent drop in second-quarter profit this year, and this could just be the beginning. An estimated two million foreclosures are expected by 2009, with an associated property loss of $106 billion. That could mean far fewer people putting Edinburgh doorknobs on their doors. You can't help think, as you walk through this gigantic store with its optimistic orange You Can Do It banners, that you may be observing the first glimpse of a soon-to-be-bygone era when everyone thought homes were risk-free investments. The employees reflect this national nervousness as well. Some were friendly and nice, but many seemed erratic, unsure, moody. I overheard two employees talking about how they were being badly scheduled, and at the garden center, inexplicably placed in the basement where there is no direct sunlight, I watched a customer plop a large metal planter in front of an employee who was replanting a fern and heard the following exchange: Customer: ''Do you know how much this is?'' Employee: ''No.'' ''Oh. Are there other planters around that are this size?'' ''No.'' Pause. ''Are you going to get that one?'' ''Well ... if I knew how much it was, I would consider it.''</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E2D8103BF933A05753C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=homedepotinc">At Chrysler, Home Depot Still Lingers<date>Published: October 30, 2007</date><text>Robert L. Nardelli, the new Chrysler chief executive, has tried hard to sound like a ''car guy'' from the moment he landed in Detroit. He boasted at his first news conference, in August, about his well-stocked garage that included a Jeep, a Plymouth Prowler and a PT Cruiser. But in a presentation Monday at the Magazine Publishers of America conference in Boca Raton, Fla., Mr. Nardelli, who most recently ran Home Depot, talked about the auto industry in a way that suggested he was still in a home-improvement state of mind. ''I think a vehicle today has to be your most favorite room under your roof,'' Mr. Nardelli said. ''I really believe that. I mean, it has to bring you gratification, it has to be tranquil. It's incidental that it gets you from Point A to B, right?'' That might give pause to horsepower enthusiasts and design buffs who follow grilles, chrome work and spoilers. But Mr. Nardelli, who left Home Depot in January and was named to the Chrysler job in August, was clear about his perspective: ''I'm a consumer, not a designer.'' Mr. Nardelli also said in the speech, which was broadcast online, that car shoppers want gadgets. ''It has to have the latest technologies on board. It has to provide the comfort, it has to be kind of self-tutorial, on the education of it.'' An automobile also needs ''cup holders -- some for water and some for...,'' Mr. Nardelli said, but he did not finish that thought. A Chrysler spokesman, Mike Aberlich, said Mr. Nardelli's comments might have stemmed from the briefings he received from the company's marketing experts and car designers. Their research has shown that customers are placing a greater emphasis on vehicle interiors. In fact, Chrysler has frequently referred to its minivans as ''living rooms on wheels,'' he said. ''I don't know that it's new, but it's his own spin on it,'' Mr. Aberlich said. ''It's good to have that fresh perspective, and he's bringing that.''

Large numbers of Canadians cross the border in search of lower prices and greater selection at American stores. But when the Canadian dollar reached parity with American currency last week, there was a new twist: online sales now let Canadians bargain-hunt in the United States without leaving home. If early indications hold true, some of the biggest gains from the Canadian dollars strength  it settled in New York late Thursday at 99.87 cents  may be at online retailers based in the United States. Because Canadas small population compared with the United States, some 33 million versus 302 million, makes online operations less cost-effective, relatively few Canadian retailers, less than a third by some estimates, sell on the Web. That limited local competition, combined with the strong Canadian dollar and the moderate cost of expanding into Canada, make the country a tempting target for American electronic retailers. No one measures Canadian crossborder spending, virtual or otherwise, but Paulina Sazon, a direct-marketing strategist at Canada Post, said the volume of shipments through the Canadian postal services special service for American retailers increased 38 percent over the last year. A spokeswoman at UPS Canada, Christina Falcone, said her company had also registered "significant growth" as a result of the strengthened Canadian dollar. Representatives of retailers tell the same story, including those from L. L. Bean, Crate &amp; Barrel and Brookstone: all posted noticeable increases in sales to Canada in the last few months. Carolyn Beem, a spokeswoman for L. L. Bean, said double-digit growth had prompted the company to increase marketing efforts aimed at Canada and to begin advertising in this country. "We like our Canadian neighbors, and they seem to like us," Ms. Beem said. Several retailers, including Amazon.com, declined to discuss their Canadian trade, while others, like Lands End, did not respond to requests for comment. In some cases, American retailers could not say how much of their increase in Canadian sales was attributable to the weak American dollar and how much resulted from increased marketing efforts. Ms. Sazon of Canada Post said that research conducted by her office in conjunction with a retailing research firm, NPD Canada, showed strong interest among Canadian shoppers for buying online from the United States  but not from just any American retailer. According to the study, Canadians are most interested in buying clothing online from Target. But Target does not ship to Canadian customers and has no Canadian stores. Target did not respond to a request for comment on the policy. The Gap also denies Canadians special access to online shopping, but the company does operate stores in Canada. Other American retailers who court Canadian customers through the Web, including Amazon, Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, have set up separate online operations in Canada. Since shoppers on those Canada-based Web sites are not making crossborder purchases, they do not benefit directly from the weaker dollar. But they do benefit from falling prices on many American products. Although Canada and the United States share a free-trade agreement, crossborder trade is hardly free. All merchandise entering Canada is inspected by Canadian Border Services, which adds federal sales taxes, provincial sales tax (except in Alberta) and, in the case of some products made in third countries, duty. In addition, the companies transporting the packages have border handling fees of their own, which on a $300 item can exceed 40 Canadian dollars. Canada Post adds a flat fee of 5 Canadian dollars. To avoid those charges, L. L. Bean and several other companies use a Canada Post service that brings their parcels across the border in bulk rather than individually. The American retailer collects Canadian taxes at the time of the purchase and the customer is not surprised by border fees at the doorstep. The service also enables a shopper to return items to a Canadian address. U.P.S. operates warehouses in Canada that hold inventory from American online retailers, including Crown Premiums, a collectible model-car maker in Bonita Springs, Fla. Orders placed on Web sites in the United States are filled with merchandise from the Canadian warehouses. The J. C. Williams Group, Canadas leading retail consultancy, estimates that American companies account for about a third of all Canadian online shopping. Canada Post said that reached about 60 percent at the height of the shopping season last year. Jim Okamura, a senior partner in J. C. Williams, said that growing business in Canada might allow retailers to offset an increasingly saturated market. And Canada could perform another role for American retailers. For many companies, Mr. Okamura said, Canada is really being seen as the first step in a broad international expansion plan. More Articles in Business »OTTAWA, Sept. 27  The ritual has resumed, as it always does when the Canadian dollar rises against the United States dollar.

Nardelli, right, became chief of Chrysler last month, succeeding Thomas W. LaSorda, who became president. On Thursday, the tide took a surprising turn, with Toyotas highest-ranking American executive, James E. Press, being named co-president at Chrysler. It is the second high-profile hire in short order by Cerberus Capital Management, which acquired Chrysler this summer. Earlier it hired Robert L. Nardelli, the former chief executive of Home Depot and a man with no automotive experience, to be Chryslers new chief executive. The hiring of Mr. Press  the president of Toyota North America, who has four decades of experience in the auto business  was hailed as a major coup by no less than Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Automobile Workers union. Chrysler now has a top management team that is arguably the equal of those at General Motors, led by an industry veteran, Rick Wagoner, and the Ford Motor Company, which captured headlines last year when it brought in Alan R. Mulally from the Boeing Company. In hiring Mr. Press, Chryslers private owners are showing clear signs that they plan to follow through on their vow to try to revive it, counter to Mr. Gettelfingers warning this year that the new owners would probably strip and flip Chrysler. However, he has since come to endorse the new owners. Mr. Press is betting his reputation that he can carry out a turnaround at Chrysler, which lost $1.5 billion in 2006 and has lost more money this year, although Cerberus does not say how much. His departure from Toyota, where he was the only American on its corporate board, and its highest-ranking executive in North America, was a shock to industry insiders. But Mr. Press, 61, who started out at Ford in the 1960s and joined Toyota in 1970, faced ending his career essentially in an advisory role, said Jeffrey Liker, a professor of engineering at the University of Michigan and the author of The Toyota Way, which analyzed the companys operating philosophy. He had the opportunity to revive a major American company, versus being a place holder at Toyota, Mr. Liker said. I can imagine the conversation with his wife: Do I want to ease into retirement, or do I want to take on the challenge?  Chrysler can use his help. Toyota passed Chrysler last year to become the third-biggest auto company in the American market. Since then, Toyota has pushed past Ford to become No. 2, behind G.M., based largely on a lineup of cars and trucks that Mr. Press lobbied for his Japanese bosses to produce. For Mr. Press, who will serve alongside Chryslers president, Thomas W. LaSorda, one priority will be working with Chryslers dealers. Many were enraged last year when Chrysler tried to force them to take on more vehicles, including gas-thirsty trucks and Jeeps, than they could sell. A number of the dealers refused, and at one point more than 100,000 unsold vehicles sat on lots around Detroit and elsewhere. That backlog is gone and so, too, are Chryslers German owners, who sold the company to Cerberus on Aug. 3. Mr. Nardelli was hired three days later, and now Mr. Press is on board, to some dealers relief. Weve got great products, said Brent Hiday, owner of Hiday Chrysler Dodge Jeep in Bluffton, Ind., south of Fort Wayne. And I think he will get the message out and get things rolling. When he arrives at Chrysler on Sept. 17, Mr. Press will see a familiar face. Last month, the automaker hired Deborah Wahl Meyer, a vice president in Toyotas Lexus luxury division, as its new chief marketing officer. In fact, Ms. Meyer and Mr. Press are among four American Toyota executives who have left in the last year. Two longtime manufacturing executives, Dennis C. Cuneo, a senior vice president, and Gary L. Convis, who ran its North American operations as well as its plant in Georgetown, Ky., both retired, although they are serving as consultants. Toyota officials in New York insist they have plenty of bench strength and do not fear a brain drain of Americans to Detroit companies. Mr. Press was succeeded by a Japanese executive, Shigeru Hayakawa, even though Toyota has vowed to run its global operations with local managers. I wouldnt say theres any kind of premeditated process that Americans are being replaced by Japanese, said Steve Sturm, a Toyota group vice president. If anything, we defy traditional logic, and were not typecast. Mr. Press and Mr. Nardelli are the latest executives to bring management sparkle to Chrysler, which has long held a reputation as Detroits liveliest company. Indeed, Toyota and Chrysler have vastly different styles. Toyota adheres to a set of principles known as the Toyota Way, which emphasize employee involvement and continuous improvement. The principles do not change no matter which executives are in charge. Chrysler, by contrast, is more free-wheeling, and its direction generally depends on which strong-willed executive Lee A. Iacocca, Robert J. Eaton or Dieter Zetsche are past examples  is in charge. Jason Vines, vice president for corporate communications at Chrysler, would not disclose Mr. Presss compensation, but said that he, like Mr. Nardelli, was being paid based on Chryslers performance. Private equity firms typically give executives a small salary plus a stake in the company. Their income can be tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars a year, based on the firms profitability. Mr. Vines added that Mr. Press was being encouraged to bring ideas from Toyota. Were going to borrow best practices from whomever, Mr. Vines said. Were in this to win. Mr. Press, who was not available for interviews, said in a statement, I relish this new opportunity with the Chrysler team to be a part of the resurgence of a true American icon here and around the world. But he acknowledged, This was the most difficult decision I have made. Indeed, Mr. Liker said, his success or failure at Chrysler will determine Mr. Presss personal legacy. It does sound very risky to me, he said. Whether Mr. Press can have an impact at Chrysler will depend on whether theyre capable of thinking long term, whether they are capable of being customer-focused and whether they are capable of decision-making, Mr. Liker said. If theyre not capable, and hes the only voice, hell get frustrated and leave. Nick Bunkley and Mary M.

The sale was one of the first big buyouts to be renegotiated because of the recent tightening of credit and problems in the housing market. The company said it expected to earn about $7.9 billion from the transaction, which could close tomorrow. The refashioned deal cut the price, as expected, by roughly 18 percent, or $1.8 billion. Because the deal relies heavily on debt, investors and bankers have been watching closely for signs of how new limits on credit could affect other large buyouts, collectively worth nearly $400 billion, that are pending. Still, this deal is different in that the fortunes of Home Depot Supply, as the division is called, are tied closely to the housing market, which has also been weakening. After a series of negotiations to save the deal, Home Depot and the participating banks and buyout firms were all forced to put up more money to shore up the financing. As part of the amended terms, Home Depot will buy a 12.5 percent equity stake in H.D. Supply for $325 million and will guarantee a $1 billion senior secured loan from the banks. Despite the softness in the financing and residential construction markets, the terms of the H.D. Supply sale deliver shareholder value today and in the future, as we will share in H.D. Supplys upside potential, Frank Blake, the chief executive of Home Depot, said in a statement. We are now focused on our retail business. The Home Depot deal involves some of Wall Streets biggest players. The alliance buying the unit included the Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, and the banks financing the deal included Lehman Brothers, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch. Goldman Sachs advised the company on the amended agreement. First announced in June, the sale of H.D. Supply was meant to refocus Home Depot on its retailing operations. Despite its creation in 2000 by the chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, as a way to tap a new market, the division never reached the profitability executives had sought, and it underdelivered on cost savings from the retailers two businesses. But by August, the buyout firms dragged Home Depot back to the negotiating table, threatening to walk away by declaring a so-called material adverse change in the unit because of the housing markets. Though it remained unclear whether that alone could have permitted the firms to walk away without paying a $309 million breakup fee, Home Depot agreed to lower H.D. Supplys price to about $9 billion. The banks then rushed in, demanding their own concessions and initiating weeks of marathon conference calls and heated threats. Banks have sought to avoid taking on billions of dollars in loans to finance buyouts. Since the credit markets froze a month ago, firms like JPMorgan, Merrill and Lehman have been unable to resell that debt to risk-averse investors. Holding that debt on their books could pose a threat to their quarterly earnings, especially for firms like Merrill and Lehman, whose balance sheets are smaller than the big banks.

The company said it expected to earn about $7.9 billion from the transaction, which could close tomorrow. The refashioned deal cut the price, as expected, by roughly 18 percent, or $1.8 billion. Because the deal relies heavily on debt, investors and bankers have been watching closely for signs of how new limits on credit could affect other large buyouts, collectively worth nearly $400 billion, that are pending. Still, this deal is different in that the fortunes of Home Depot Supply, as the division is called, are tied closely to the housing market, which has also been weakening. After a series of negotiations to save the deal, Home Depot and the participating banks and buyout firms were all forced to put up more money to shore up the financing. As part of the amended terms, Home Depot will buy a 12.5 percent equity stake in H.D. Supply for $325 million and will guarantee a $1 billion senior secured loan from the banks. Despite the softness in the financing and residential construction markets, the terms of the H.D. Supply sale deliver shareholder value today and in the future, as we will share in H.D. Supplys upside potential, Frank Blake, the chief executive of Home Depot, said in a statement. We are now focused on our retail business. The Home Depot deal involves some of Wall Streets biggest players. The alliance buying the unit included the Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, and the banks financing the deal included Lehman Brothers, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch. Goldman Sachs advised the company on the amended agreement. First announced in June, the sale of H.D. Supply was meant to refocus Home Depot on its retailing operations. Despite its creation in 2000 by the chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, as a way to tap a new market, the division never reached the profitability executives had sought, and it underdelivered on cost savings from the retailers two businesses. But by August, the buyout firms dragged Home Depot back to the negotiating table, threatening to walk away by declaring a so-called material adverse change in the unit because of the housing markets. Though it remained unclear whether that alone could have permitted the firms to walk away without paying a $309 million breakup fee, Home Depot agreed to lower H.D. Supplys price to about $9 billion. The banks then rushed in, demanding their own concessions and initiating weeks of marathon conference calls and heated threats. Banks have sought to avoid taking on billions of dollars in loans to finance buyouts. Since the credit markets froze a month ago, firms like JPMorgan, Merrill and Lehman have been unable to resell that debt to risk-averse investors. Holding that debt on their books could pose a threat to their quarterly earnings, especially for firms like Merrill and Lehman, whose balance sheets are smaller than the big banks.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/business/28deal.html?ref=homedepotinc">Redone Home Depot Deal Not Thought Contagious<date>Published: August 28, 2007</date><text>As the deal for Home Depots wholesale supply unit was renegotiated over the weekend, a question lingered about whether the push to lower the price was a harbinger for other buyouts. Home Depot agreed Sunday to make several concessions in the sale of the unit, HD Supply, including lowering the price by $1.8 billion, to $8.5 billion, and keeping a sizable stake in the unit. The deal is expected to be completed as early as today when the paperwork is finished, people involved in the talks said last night. With the credit markets all but frozen, some investors have been fretting that anxious banks and private equity firms may try to repeat the feat with other buyouts, like those for First Data, the credit card processor, or TXU, the Texas energy giant, which are scheduled to be completed in the next two months. But fears about a rash of renegotiated or collapsed deals increasingly seem misplaced, analysts said yesterday. As investors have sifted through the $400 billion in deals that are scheduled to be completed, it appears that Home Depot may have been a special case  it had numerous idiosyncrasies that aligned to make the renegotiations possible  that and may make it less likely that other deals will follow in its path. I dont think its a paradigm change, Donna Hitscherich, a professor of finance and economics at the Columbia Business School. For one, the sale to a consortium of buyout firms that included Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice involved an asset, rather than an entire company. As a result, the parent company was able to retain an equity stake and provide financing  Home Depot will hold onto 12.5 percent and also agreed to provide $1 billion in debt financing  two crucial factors in averting the deals collapse. Also, in contrast to companies like First Data or Alltel, the rural cellphone service provider, Home Depot was not being sold  and in this case, was desperate for cash. Home Depot was counting on the sale to help finance a $250 million share buyback to lift its flagging stock. In announcing this month that it might reprice the deal, Home Depot said it was cutting the price it was offering in its buyback, and some feared that the repurchase might be withdrawn entirely if the deal fell apart. Furthermore, it took more than the implosion of the debt markets to drag Home Depot back to the table. There was the simultaneous blow of the collapsing housing market, which has sapped profits from HD Supply specifically, and from Home Depot more generally. In this case, it was the private equity firms, not the banks, that came back to the table first, despite saying that HD Supplys worsening financial condition was reason enough to walk away. It remains unclear whether the buyers actually had legal ground to walk away without paying a $309 million breakup fee. The material adverse change clause, which requires something significant to change, specifically ruled out changes affecting any or all of the wholesale distribution industries for construction and general financial or capital market conditions, including interest rates or currency exchange rates. But Home Depot could not afford to call the bluff of the private equity firms and agreed to lower the price to $9 billion. Then the banks rushed in, demanding their own concessions. Though Home Depots legal counsel, Martin Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, counseled that the first renegotiated deal did not alter the agreements with the banks, the heads of JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers indicated otherwise. Though the banks themselves could not declare that a material adverse change had occurred, they seemed to have argued that Home Depot and the private equity firms essentially admitted as much. That left an opening to press forward with their own demands. Still, the role of the material adverse change clause seems limited in most other buyouts, analysts said. It could, however, have been a factor in the deal for the Chrysler Group and may be a factor for the impending Sallie Mae buyout. Even then, crucial differences remain. Though the Chrysler deal was also a sale of a unit in a troubled industry, the negotiations among DaimlerChrysler, Cerberus Capital Management and the JPMorgan-led consortium of banks were far friendlier, as all parties admitted that the sale of the American carmaker could not go through without significant help. Hence, when the banks were unable to resell more than $12 billion in buyout-related debt in the markets, Cerberus and Daimler agreed to hold a collective $2 billion of that on their books. At Sallie Mae, the buyers  the buyout firms J. C. Flowers and Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe, and JPMorgan and Bank of America  have all but declared a material adverse change in the student lender, citing several bills circulating in Congress; the company, however, has fiercely contested those claims. Stock in Sallie Maes parent, the SLM Corporation, has fallen as much as 11 percent since the squabble was made public. But few think the buyers want to break off the deal. And some have argued that Sallie Maes clause about material adverse change is close to airtight, setting a high bar for the buyers to make their point. Like virtually any buyer, private equity firms would prefer to pay less. But absent the combination of very specific conditions, it is not clear they can doctor other deals to match the Home Depot script.

That could put a damper on the buyout boom that has been a major factor in the runup in stock prices over the last few years. Home Depots board approved the deal in principle during a meeting yesterday afternoon, people involved in the negotiations said, and the company plans to announce the transaction today. The Home Depot deal involves some of Wall Streets biggest players. The buying consortium includes the Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, and the banks financing the deal include Lehman Brothers, JPMorgan Chase and Merrill Lynch. The reworked transaction raised the curtain on the complicated relationships between investment banks and some of their biggest clients: the private equity firms who shower them with billions of dollars in fees annually. In the Home Depot negotiations, however, those normally friendly relationships quickly turned cold, as all the players eventually demanded heavy concessions from one another. By the time Home Depots board reached its agreement, some of Wall Streets most powerful executives had stepped in to personally negotiate the deal: James Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, pulled several all-nighters, ordering in pizza with his colleague, James B. Lee, a vice chairman; Richard S. Fuld Jr., the chief executive of Lehman Brothers, was sending e-mail messages from his BlackBerry at 5 a.m.; and E. Stanley ONeal, chief executive of Merrill Lynch, was taking calls on the golf course, against the clubs rules. Kenneth D. Langone, a prominent Home Depot board member and a fixture on Wall Street, found himself uncharacteristically locking horns with some of his good friends. And even John F. Welch Jr., the former General Electric chief executive, was brought in by Clayton Dubilier, where he works as an adviser. As part of the deal, each buyout firm increased the amount of equity that it will commit to the deal by $150 million each, to $800 million. In a major concession to the banks, Home Depot agreed to finance $1 billion of debt and take up to 12.5 percent of the equity in the supply company. What has emerged is a tale of bare-knuckled brinksmanship, as the three private equity buyers  Bain, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier  initially demanded concessions from Home Depot. In announcing the possible repricing of the sale earlier this month, Home Depot said it would trim the price it was offering in a stock buyback, initially worth about $22.5 billion. Even so, the buyout firms threatened to walk away from the deal, declaring that the housing markets decline had created what is known as a material adverse change. Such clauses are common in deals, allowing buyers to walk away. In this case, however, it was not clear whether the declines in the housing and credit markets qualified as deal breakers. Still, Home Depot buckled and agreed to lower the price to about $9 billion. Then the three investment banks demanded a better deal as well, setting off a marathon of conference calls as the banks threatened to walk away from their financing commitments. By balking at financing the transaction, Lehman Brothers put itself in an especially difficult position. One of Lehmans most senior bankers, Andrew Taussig, had advised Home Depot on the sale at the same time that it was also providing financing to the buying group. Suddenly, Lehman was turning around and threatening to scuttle a deal it had advised one of its most important clients to accept. Mr. Fuld, Lehmans chief executive, spent hours in person and on the phone with Home Depots management and some of its directors trying to explain the firms position. Mr. Taussig was mortified, people briefed on the negotiations said. Because of Lehmans conflicted position, Goldman Sachs was brought in as Home Depots new adviser to mediate among the private equity firms and other banks to reach a deal. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on August 27, 2007, on page A1 of the New York edition.Home Depot was forced to drop the sale price of its commercial supply business by nearly $2 billion yesterday, according to people involved in the negotiations, one of the first big buyouts to be renegotiated as a result of the recent tightening of credit and problems in the housing market.

But while stocks in general stopped their fall and even posted some gains for the week, the woes from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market continued to claim more victims among lenders. And it was far from clear whether Home Depot would be able to save the sale of its wholesale unit to a consortium of private equity firms. MORTGAGE WOES Countrywide Home Loans, the nations largest home mortgage company, received a big lift on Wednesday, when Bank of America agreed to invest $2 billion. Countrywide had been struggling in recent weeks to raise the money it needed to continue offering mortgages, stirring concerns among investors who, in turn, punished its stock. The move was widely seen as an attempt to put Countrywide on firmer footing and restore confidence in its stock. But the number of casualties among subprime lenders continued to rise, led by Lehman Brothers announcement on Wednesday that it was shutting one of its home lending units and laying off 1,200 employees. In recent weeks, several mortgage companies that specialized in risky home loans have stopped making loans, shut down or encountered other distress. While markets were calmer this week, it remains unclear whether the worst has passed for mortgage lenders. The Fed is watching for clues on whether the housing market and consumer spending are weakening before deciding whether to cut its benchmark interest rate. SLOWER GROWTH SEEN The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a relatively optimistic forecast for economic growth on Thursday, predicting that the turmoil in the stock market would not stop the overall economy from growing. But the office did lower its previous forecast for growth this year to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent. Other economists also scaled back their expectations. Even as they were trimming their forecasts, many economists warned that their predictions might still be too optimistic. DELTAS NEW CHIEF Delta Air Lines passed over two top company executives and named the former head of Northwest Airlines as its chief executive on Tuesday. Richard H. Anderson, who spent 14 years at Northwest before leaving in 2004 to become an executive vice president at the UnitedHealth Group, succeeds Gerald A. Grinstein, who announced in April that he would retire. Both Delta and Northwest filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2005 and emerged this spring. Analysts have speculated whether the two airlines would eventually merge because their route systems are complementary. With Mr. Andersons appointment, could closer ties be next? ONE STEP CLOSER Tribune Company shareholders voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to approve an $8.2 billion buyout led by Samuel Zell, the billionaire real estate developer. But the transaction has several hurdles before the deal is done. The first, and perhaps biggest, is that since the deal was struck at $34 a share, the companys stock has fallen significantly and the credit markets have been contracting, raising questions about whether Mr. Zell will be able to go ahead with his plan to turn Tribune from a public company into one owned by employees. The deal also needs the approval of the Federal Communications Commission. Analysts still expect the deal to go through, but probably with some changes to assuage investors and bankers concerns.

Still, the deal announced in June remained uncertain as the banks that committed to finance the transaction  JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch  threatened to back out, setting up a showdown that could become a harbinger amid the current credit crisis. The sale of Home Depot’s wholesale unit, which provides pipes, lumber and concrete for professional builders, is the first deal-related victim of the housing slowdown and the credit squeeze. The confluence of both problems has created an enormous headache for Wall Street, which had agreed to back dozens of huge buyouts at very attractive rates and will now very likely suffer big losses as a result. In the case of Home Depot, the deal has created a battle that pits some of Wall Street’s biggest banks against some of its biggest clients  the consortium of private equity players that includes Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Despite Home Depot’s willingness to reduce the asking price to just slightly more than $9 billion, the banks that committed to finance the transaction are worried that the dip in the housing market  and its impact on Home Depot’s wholesale unit  means they will be able to sell the debt to other investors only for a fraction of what they paid, losing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. The conversations among the banks, private equity firms and Home Depot have become heated since Wednesday, according to people involved in them, as executives from varying sides have made an assortment of not-so-thinly-veiled threats.

And the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch are all being regularly briefed on the status of the negotiations. If the banks were to walk away, they might seek to claim that Home Depot’s wholesale unit suffered what is known on Wall Street as a “material adverse change.” It is unclear, however, whether they would have grounds to make such a claim; the agreement of the banks to finance the deal specifically says that neither “changes affecting any or all of the wholesale distribution industries for construction” nor “general financial or capital market conditions, including interest rates or currency exchange rates” would constitute a material adverse change. For the banks involved, the negotiations could put their reputations at risk, some analysts have suggested. The talks are particularly embarrassing for one of Lehman Brothers’ most senior bankers, Andrew Taussig. Mr. Taussig, whom Lehman wooed from Credit Suisse in 2005, acted as an adviser to Home Depot while Lehman also committed to finance the buyers. Playing both sides of the field  advising the seller and lending to the buyers  has become almost routine on Wall Street in recent years, a practice known as staple financing. But as the Home Depot example demonstrates, it can also create real conflicts. As more deals run into trouble in the months ahead, some bankers have speculated that clients may reduce, if not eliminate, practices like staple financing. If the Home Depot deal collapses, the banks and private equity firms are likely to be hit with a number of lawsuits. Home Depot, unlike some other sellers in private equity deals, was willing to reduce the price of its wholesale unit because it is under pressure to shed assets. The company is already committed to a large stock buyback plan and was hoping to use the proceeds of the sale to finance it. More Articles in Business »Home Depot was scrambling last night to save the sale of its wholesale unit to a consortium of private equity firms, lowering its asking price by about $1.2 billion from the original $10.3 billion it agreed upon, people involved in the talks said. Still, the deal announced in June remained uncertain as the banks that committed to finance the transaction  JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch  threatened to back out, setting up a showdown that could become a harbinger amid the current credit crisis. The sale of Home Depot’s wholesale unit, which provides pipes, lumber and concrete for professional builders, is the first deal-related victim of the housing slowdown and the credit squeeze. The confluence of both problems has created an enormous headache for Wall Street, which had agreed to back dozens of huge buyouts at very attractive rates and will now very likely suffer big losses as a result. In the case of Home Depot, the deal has created a battle that pits some of Wall Street’s biggest banks against some of its biggest clients  the consortium of private equity players that includes Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Despite Home Depot’s willingness to reduce the asking price to just slightly more than $9 billion, the banks that committed to finance the transaction are worried that the dip in the housing market  and its impact on Home Depot’s wholesale unit  means they will be able to sell the debt to other investors only for a fraction of what they paid, losing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. The conversations among the banks, private equity firms and Home Depot have become heated since Wednesday, according to people involved in them, as executives from varying sides have made an assortment of not-so-thinly-veiled threats. One person involved in the talks described them as “the most expensive game of chicken you’ve ever played.” Some of Wall Street’s most senior bankers canceled their vacation plans to return to New York.

The company, which ranks second behind Home Depot in home improvement retailing, said it faced easier sales comparisons, but it still cut its full-year outlook. Earnings for the second quarter, which ended Aug. 3, rose 9 percent, to $1.02 billion, or 67 cents a share, from $935 million, or 60 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected 61 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Lowes said gross margin improved in the quarter on better management of imported products and distribution. Sales rose 5.8 percent, to $14.17 billion, aided by the opening of 26 stores. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 2.6 percent, in line with the companys expectations of a drop of as much as 3 percent. While falling sales and prices for homes and the troubles in the subprime mortgage market have pressured the home improvement sector, Lowes turned in better results than Home Depot, which said last week that quarterly earnings fell 15 percent on a 2 percent sales drop. Home Depot mentioned that they continue to lose market share but at a declining rate, said Sarah Henry, an analyst with MFC Global Investment Management in Berwyn, Pa., which owns stock in both chains. Lowes said that they have continued to gain market share. More Articles in Business »ATLANTA, Aug. 20 (Reuters)  The Lowes Companies reported a higher-than-expected second-quarter profit and a gain in market share on Monday, saying that sales trends were improving in some regions despite the soft housing market. Lowes sees pockets of strength, and I think thats a bullish signal because lots of investors feared that nobody could pinpoint the bottom of this housing market, said Stephanie Hoff, senior retail analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis.

Will the economy catch a cold? Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Sandy Huffaker/Bloomberg News Home Depot said its earnings for the year would fall because of the weak housing market, a forecast that alarmed Wall Street. Enlarge This Image Reed Saxon/Associated Press Wal-Mart has lowered prices, but the strategy has hurt its profit margins. Its quarterly earnings were below expectations. The two companies, the nation’s largest retailers and bellwethers for consumer spending, reported earnings disappointments for the second quarter and predicted an even bumpier year ahead because of higher energy costs and a sagging housing market. The sober forecasts reverberated across Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index down by nearly 2 percent, with the Dow dropping more than 200 points. Shares of both Wal-Mart and Home Depot fell around 5 percent. Home Depot also said that the proposed sale of its supply business, for $11 billion, could fall through because of trouble in the credit markets, potentially forcing the retailer to shrink a $23 billion stock buyback. Economists said the sluggish performance of the chains  Wal-Mart missed its profit forecast and Home Depot’s earnings dropped  could signal broader troubles in the economy. “It’s a red flag,” said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wachovia. “If consumer spending starts to weaken, the overall outlook for economic growth will diminish.” That, Wal-Mart executives said, is precisely what has begun to happen in its 4,000 United States stores over the last three months  even after the chain cut prices on 16,000 products this summer. “Many customers are running out of money at the end of the month,” said H. Lee Scott Jr., the chief executive of Wal-Mart. Home Depot’s chief executive, Frank Blake, described a “tough selling environment” and warned that the housing and home improvement markets would remain weak into 2008. But Wal-Mart also blamed itself, for poor clothing and home décor products. And Home Depot has alienated customers with lackluster service, making it difficult to discern how much of the slowdown was self-inflicted damage and how much was tied to larger economic forces. For the second quarter, which ended Aug. 3, Wal-Mart missed its profit estimate and those of Wall Street analysts, a rarity for the company, whose performance is generally the envy of the industry. Earnings from continuing operations were 72 cents a share, below the company forecast of at least 75 cents. Even so, sales rose 8.8 percent, to $92 billion. Net income rose 49 percent, to $3.1 billion, or 76 cents a share. But that figure included 4 cents a share in one-time gains like lower workers’ compensation claims. “Although some people will report that Wal-Mart has had record sales and earnings, our underlying operating performance this quarter was not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,” Mr. Scott said. For the year, Wal-Mart said it would earn $3.05 to $3.13 a share from continuing operations, lower than its original forecast of $3.15 to $3.23. Mr. Scott said Wal-Mart’s shoppers, who generally earn less than $40,000 a household, are “under difficult pressure economically.” He added that “the paycheck cycle is more pronounced now than ever before,” meaning that customers are left with little cash by the end of the month. Wal-Mart has lowered prices across its stores to appeal to such customers, but the strategy has hurt its profit margins. Sales of grocery items, electronics and pharmacy items rose in the second quarter, but clothing and home products  which sell at a higher profit margin  did not. Charles Grom, an analyst at JPMorgan, downgraded Wal-Mart stock yesterday, saying its second-quarter earnings were “creating a slippery slope for Wal-Mart to climb.” “Wal-Mart’s lowered outlook,” Mr. Grom wrote, “is more than just resetting the bar this morning. Rather, the company and this management has suffered a credibility blow that will take time to overcome.” Wal-Mart’s shares fell $2.35, more than 5 percent, to close at $43.82 yesterday. At Home Depot, second-quarter income fell 14.8 percent, to $1.6 billion, or 81 cents a share, compared with the quarter last year. Sales fell 1.8 percent, to $22.2 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year, a key measure in retailing, fell 5.2 percent. “The housing market remains difficult, and our performance reflects that,” said Mr. Blake, the chief executive. He noted, for example, that housing starts so far this year were down 22 percent, compared with a year ago, and existing-home sales were down 12 percent. Home Depot said its earnings for the year would fall 15 to 18 percent, confirming an earlier forecast. Nevertheless, the company will invest in its stores, giving employees bonuses and remodeling aging outlets to better compete with Lowe’s, its biggest rival. Executives said they were restructuring the deal to sell Home Depot’s supply division, a $12 billion business, to three private equity groups, which could result in a lower sales price. The original price for the division was $10.3 billion. As the home construction market has slowed, the supply business has suffered, which may explain why the buyers want to renegotiate the price. If the sale price is lowered or the deal for Home Depot Supply collapses, Home Depot said it would most likely cut back its share repurchase program, which calls for the company to buy $22.5 billion worth of company stock. Home Depot’s stock fell $1.72, or 4.9 percent, to $33.52. More Articles in Business »Wal-Mart and Home Depot sneezed yesterday. Will the economy catch a cold?

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image J. Emilio Flores for The New York Times Supporters of a Home Depot proposal to open a Sunland store wore T-shirts provided by the company at Los Angeles City Hall. Enlarge This Image J. Emilio Flores for The New York Times Nina Royal, a Home Depot opponent, at the City Hall hearing. Opponents say they have no quarrel with a big-box store, but they want a large general-merchandise retailer, one that sells socks, not sockets. They fear that an outpost of the giant home-supply chain will bring too much truck traffic and hurt Sunlands several hardware stores. But Home Depot officials and supporters of the planned store argue that the objections are a smokescreen to conceal racist fears that it would attract scores of predominantly immigrant day laborers. Ali Moderras, an expert in urban geography at the Pat Brown Institute at California State University, Los Angeles, said the Home Depot should have conducted environmental impact and traffic studies from the beginning, even though the city did not initially require the review. Market research is not enough any more, Mr. Moderras said. You really need the community support. This is a national problem. We will see more and more people waking up and objecting to some huge store popping up in their neighborhood. After more than 600 people attended a recent, and raucous, Los Angeles City Council meeting that quickly erupted in arguments over race and immigration status, the Council is considering whether to allow construction to proceed or to revoke the companys building permits and require an environmental impact and traffic study. A vote is expected by Aug. 17. Its not too often that our building permits are revoked, said a spokeswoman for Home Depot, Kathryn Gallagher. Weve been working with the city from the beginning. Home Depot has spent more than $2 million over more than two years trying to open the store on the site of a 93,000-square-foot Kmart that closed a few years ago. Ms. Gallagher emphasized that Home Depot was committed to opening it even if the review process took another year or two. At a more tempered Council meeting on Tuesday, several Latinos said in Spanish or halting English that they supported Home Depot because it would bring jobs to the area. A local contractor, Jose Yglesias, told Council members to focus their attention not on Home Depot but on solving problems of crime and drug use in Sunland. Since he moved to the area 10 years ago, Mr. Yglesias said, two of his cars have been stolen and his young son brought home crystal meth. We have a problem in our schools, Mr. Yglesias said. Theres a lot of drugs going on. There is a lot of car thieves around. Lets take care of the drugs, not Home Depot. Some local opponents countered that Home Depot has bused in Latinos to create the illusion of community support, while ignoring the sentiments of residents. They manufacture support, and they manufactured this racism thing, said Joe Barrett, a prop designer for feature films. Theyre trying to detract from the real story, and that is traffic and all their trucks. Mr. Barrett was referring to trucks delivering merchandise to the store as well as those belonging to contractors and other customers. The store is close to an elementary school and a mobile home park for the elderly. Ms. Gallagher said the company did not pay supporters to attend Council meetings but did acknowledge that it took them to and from the meeting and furnished them with Home Depot T-shirts. The Los Angeles Daily News, on its Web site, posted a memorandum leaked from a public relations firm hired by Home Depot that detailed how more than $24,000 was spent recruiting, feeding, clothing and busing crowds from Sunland, Tujunga and adjacent communities to City Hall to express support for the planned store. At a packed meeting of the Council planning committee meeting, the councilwoman representing Sunland, Wendy Greuel, urged her colleagues to revoke Home Depots building permits because its construction constituted more than a remodeling of the Kmart site because a new floor, new walls and a new ceiling had been added. The committee agreed, leading to next weeks vote by the full City Council, which could require Home Depot to scale back its plans to accommodate traffic and other concerns. John Song, a Korean-American and the owner of a hardware store in Sunland, said that for him, objections to the new store had nothing to do with race. This is going to kill my business, Mr. Song said. More Articles in National »LOS ANGELES, Aug. 10  A proposal to open a Home Depot is deeply dividing the mostly rural area of Sunland in northern Los Angeles, but not for the usual reasons. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image J. Emilio Flores for The New York Times Supporters of a Home Depot proposal to open a Sunland store wore T-shirts provided by the company at Los Angeles City Hall. Enlarge This Image J. Emilio Flores for The New York Times Nina Royal, a Home Depot opponent, at the City Hall hearing. Opponents say they have no quarrel with a big-box store, but they want a large general-merchandise retailer, one that sells socks, not sockets. They fear that an outpost of the giant home-supply chain will bring too much truck traffic and hurt Sunlands several hardware stores. But Home Depot officials and supporters of the planned store argue that the objections are a smokescreen to conceal racist fears that it would attract scores of predominantly immigrant day laborers. Ali Moderras, an expert in urban geography at the Pat Brown Institute at California State University, Los Angeles, said the Home Depot should have conducted environmental impact and traffic studies from the beginning, even though the city did not initially require the review. Market research is not enough any more, Mr. Moderras said. You really need the community support. This is a national problem. We will see more and more people waking up and objecting to some huge store popping up in their neighborhood. After more than 600 people attended a recent, and raucous, Los Angeles City Council meeting that quickly erupted in arguments over race and immigration status, the Council is considering whether to allow construction to proceed or to revoke the companys building permits and require an environmental impact and traffic study. A vote is expected by Aug. 17. Its not too often that our building permits are revoked, said a spokeswoman for Home Depot, Kathryn Gallagher. Weve been working with the city from the beginning. Home Depot has spent more than $2 million over more than two years trying to open the store on the site of a 93,000-square-foot Kmart that closed a few years ago. Ms. Gallagher emphasized that Home Depot was committed to opening it even if the review process took another year or two.

Nardellis appointment as the new head of Chrysler surprise people in the auto industry when it was announced on Monday, it shocked officials inside the auto company as well. Skip to next paragraph Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times Robert L. Nardelli, chosen by Cerberus to lead Chrysler, was last at Home Depot. As recently as Aug. 2, Chrysler officials were planning to announce on Monday that Wolfgang Bernhard would become the chairman of Chrysler, people with direct knowledge of those plans said Thursday. They asked not to be identified because the meetings were intended to be private. While the officials prepared that announcement, they did not know that Mr. Nardelli, a former executive at Home Depot and General Electric, was being courted to replace Thomas W. LaSorda as chief executive, these people said. Mr. Bernhard, most recently at Volkswagen, served as Chryslers No. 2 executive earlier this decade and advised Cerberus Capital Management, Chryslers new owner, in its negotiations with DaimlerChrysler. The deal closed last Friday. A number of news organizations, including The New York Times, reported Mr. Bernhards expected return, based on confirmation from within Chrysler. Instead, on Monday, Chrysler said Mr. Bernhard had turned down the chairmans job for family reasons, clearing the way for Mr. Nardellis appointment as both chief executive and chairman. Mr. LaSorda is now the companys No. 2 executive. A company spokesman declined to comment on Thursday on what those family reasons were. A spokesman for Cerberus had no comment. People with knowledge of the discussions involving Mr. Bernhard, however, said that Cerberus wanted him to serve with Mr. Nardelli, whose appointment they also planned to announce on Monday. They said they did not know whether Mr. Nardellis hiring ultimately played a role in Mr. Bernhards decision to turn down the position. Neither Chrysler nor Cerberus has offered more specifics about Mr. Bernhard, who told the two companies last weekend of his decision not to accept the job. On Monday, Mr. LaSorda said that the discussions with Mr. Nardelli had been under way for about two weeks and that he had offered to accept a demotion if Cerberus decided to appoint another executive in his place. Mr. LaSorda said he had had several talks with Mr. Nardelli before he accepted the Chrysler job, meaning he was one of only a few people at the company who knew Mr. Nardelli might be joining. Analysts say the credit squeeze that Cerberus faced when its bankers tried unsuccessfully to sell $10 billion in loans to finance the deal appears to have played a key role in the hiring of Mr. Nardelli. Cerberus did not comment on reports this week that bankers had pressured the company to hire an outside executive. On Wednesday, Automotive News cited speculation at an industry conference in Acme, Mich., outside Traverse City, that the problems in credit markets, which kept bankers from being able to sell $10 billion in loans meant to finance Cerberuss purchase of Chrysler, prompted financiers to push the company to find a cost-cutting specialist. The five banks involved in the deal, headed by JPMorgan Chase, decided on July 26 to finance $10 billion themselves, with Cerberus and Chrysler each carrying $1 billion. I think Cerberus panicked, said Gerald Meyers, the former president at the American Motors Corporation and an expert on crisis management. He said the problem selling the financing to investors may have prompted Cerberus to grab Mr. Nardelli now rather than give Mr. LaSorda time to get the new company turned around.

Daimlers sale of Chrysler to the private equity fund Cerberus Capital Management  for about a fifth of what it paid for it  must stand as one of the steepest markdowns in the history of corporate acquisitions. Mr. Nardelli became the symbol of excessive executive pay after he was ousted as the chief of Home Depot, following a series of blunders, but still walked away with a $210 million consolation package.

Once the nations third biggest carmaker, Chrysler fell to fifth place in July, while the share of Detroits Big Three of the American auto market fell below 50 percent. For Americans, the Big Three are more than car companies. They are symbols of the nations industrial might. To recover even a fraction of their former glory, however, they will have to convince Americans to also put their money where their hearts are.

But thats not the way some big investors see him. To them, he is a former operations whiz at General Electric who can bring new managerial discipline to Chrysler, and make the struggling Detroit automaker hum again. And so, in being named chief executive Monday at Chrysler by its new owners  the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management  Mr. Nardelli, 59, is being given the chance to try to bring off two comebacks: Chryslers, and his own. Its an amazing redemption, said Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. His challenges are enormous. Chrysler is in the midst of its fourth turnaround effort in three decades. And Mr. Nardelli is an outsider entering a complicated industry at a time when Japanese companies like Toyota and Honda are surging. But his managerial style will be less of an issue at Chrysler than at Home Depot. With Chrysler now a private company, he will not have to answer to individual shareholders, whom he angered at a 2006 annual meeting by refusing to answer any questions and by strictly limiting their time to speak, using two large digital timers. And many of Mr. Nardellis new bosses already know him well, since several executives at the private equity firm once worked at G.E. If he succeeds, Mr. Nardelli may be this centurys version of Lee A. Iacocca, who took charge at Chrysler after an embarrassing demotion at Ford Motor by Henry Ford II, and effectively turned around the company with a hard-charging style (and some help from Congress.) Mr. Iacocca, in fact, praised the hiring of another outsider, Fords Alan R. Mulally, in his latest book. Commending Fords chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., for the move last year, Mr. Iacocca wrote, Sometimes an outsiders perspective can re-energize a tired business plan. (Mr. Iacocca could not be reached for comment on Chryslers news). If Mr. Nardelli succeeds, he may earn himself another fortune. Although the details of his compensation will not be made public, he will be paid handsomely if Chrysler, whose separation from DaimlerChrysler occurred Friday, can reverse its losses. If it doesnt, he will earn very little, according to people familiar with his contract. His task, he said at a news conference here Monday, is to prove that manufacturing, and the automobile industry, is part of Americas future, not its past. At the outset, at least, Mr. Nardelli said he planned no big changes to Chryslers latest turnaround program. They got it, he said of Chrysler management, which plans to cut 13,000 jobs. If we can do it faster, if we can do it more efficiently, thats what we want to do. Mr. Nardelli acknowledged that he did not have automotive expertise, but noted his experience in dealing with industrial issues at G.E., where he had risen to run a division making power systems such as generators and turbines before leaving to join Home Depot in 2000. While Im new to Chrysler, and new to the car industry, manufacturing and transportation is a business I know, I like and I grew up in, said Mr. Nardelli. Many workers at Chrysler, where the DaimlerChrysler signs have already been taken down and the traditional five-pointed star logo has been restored, seemed to reserve judgment about their new boss. Jim Samuel, an employee since 1971, said he has some of the same worries now that he remembers having when Mr. Iaccoca came to Chrysler from Ford. You had that eerie feeling about a newcomer, Mr. Samuel said. David E. Davis, a veteran automotive journalist and founder of the Winding Road, a Web-based car magazine, said he feared for Chrysler under Mr. Nardelli, whom he predicted would bring slash and burn cost-cutting to Auburn Hills. You hate to see what this creature is going to look like when they finally get through dismembering it and putting it back together, Mr. Davis said. Though Mr. Nardelli wont have stockholders to worry about, he will have to win the support of dealers, parts suppliers and the United Automobile Workers union, with which Chrysler and the other Detroit companies just opened talks on a critical new contract. On Monday, Mr. Nardelli said he would leave responsibility for the talks to Thomas W. LaSorda, the son and grandson of Canadian labor leaders, who was Chryslers chief executive until Mr. Nardellis appointment, and will now be vice chairman and president. Mr. Nardelli has already reached out, literally, to the unions president, Ron Gettelfinger. The pair met for several hours before Mr. Nardellis appointment was announced, with Mr. Nardelli declaring him to be a wonderful individual, very engaging. Later on, Mr. Nardelli stood next to Mr. Gettelfinger before Chrysler employees, an arm slung casually around his shoulders, a rare gesture for a Detroit chief executive. Mr. Gettelfinger told workers that the U.A.W. realizes that our future is tied to the future of the new Chrysler. He added: Welcome home, Chrysler. Noel Tichy, a University of Michigan professor and expert on G.E., who has known Mr. Nardelli since 1985, called him an incredible selection. Mr. Nardelli, he said, would take a hard look at bureaucracy and redundancy. And David M. Fernelius, a dealer in Cheboygan, Mich., said he was optimistic about the companys prospects. We have good products, world-class from Chrysler now, and were hoping this new management will give us some good marketing and get the word out to the public, he said. We can tout Chrysler as an American company now. But any honeymoon could be short unless Mr. Nardelli adopts a more agreeable management approach. Critics say his style at Home Depot was heavy-handed and unforgiving: he pelted employees with constant e-mail messages at all hours, focusing on problems as minor as poor lighting in a store. He drew fire for diverting Home Depots attention from its basic home supply business in stores and creating a separate $12 billion wholesale division that failed to meet expectations and was sold soon after his ouster. Further, Mr. Nardelli became accustomed to lavish catered lunches, in contrast to Chrysler, where Mr. LaSorda frequently picks up a cafeteria tray. Mr. Nardelli, however, was hired not for his people skills but for his operational expertise, which helped Home Depot double its sales and the number of stores worldwide. At G.E., moreover, he was among three executives considered as successors for John F. Welch Jr., leaving when he failed to get the job. Mr. Nardellis lack of automotive expertise will be his biggest hindrance, said Gerald Meyers, the former president of the American Motors Corporation and an expert on crisis management. Theres nothing in his background that says he lives, breathes and loves cars, Mr. Meyers said. But Mr. Nardelli tried his best Monday to present himself as a car guy. He said he owns a PT Cruiser, a Plymouth Prowler and a Jeep, and said his love for the company dates back to high school, when his first car after graduation in 1966 was a Dodge Dart. Mr. Nardelli said Monday that his wife, Susan, sent him an e-mail message upon learning he was being courted by Cerberus for the job. It must have been fate, he said she wrote him. Our first date was in the Dodge Dart. Michael Barbaro reported from New York, Nick Bunkley from Auburn Hills and Mary M. Chapman from Detroit. More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on August 7, 2007, on page A1 of the New York edition.AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Aug. 6  When Robert L.

His task, he said at a news conference here Monday, is to prove that manufacturing, and the automobile industry, is part of Americas future, not its past. At the outset, at least, Mr. Nardelli said he planned no big changes to Chryslers latest turnaround program. They got it, he said of Chrysler management, which plans to cut 13,000 jobs. If we can do it faster, if we can do it more efficiently, thats what we want to do. Mr. Nardelli acknowledged that he did not have automotive expertise, but noted his experience in dealing with industrial issues at G.E., where he had risen to run a division making power systems such as generators and turbines before leaving to join Home Depot in 2000. While Im new to Chrysler, and new to the car industry, manufacturing and transportation is a business I know, I like and I grew up in, said Mr. Nardelli. Many workers at Chrysler, where the DaimlerChrysler signs have already been taken down and the traditional five-pointed star logo has been restored, seemed to reserve judgment about their new boss. Jim Samuel, an employee since 1971, said he has some of the same worries now that he remembers having when Mr. Iaccoca came to Chrysler from Ford. You had that eerie feeling about a newcomer, Mr. Samuel said. David E. Davis, a veteran automotive journalist and founder of the Winding Road, a Web-based car magazine, said he feared for Chrysler under Mr. Nardelli, whom he predicted would bring slash and burn cost-cutting to Auburn Hills. You hate to see what this creature is going to look like when they finally get through dismembering it and putting it back together, Mr. Davis said. Though Mr. Nardelli wont have stockholders to worry about, he will have to win the support of dealers, parts suppliers and the United Automobile Workers union, with which Chrysler and the other Detroit companies just opened talks on a critical new contract. On Monday, Mr. Nardelli said he would leave responsibility for the talks to Thomas W. LaSorda, the son and grandson of Canadian labor leaders, who was Chryslers chief executive until Mr. Nardellis appointment, and will now be vice chairman and president. Mr. Nardelli has already reached out, literally, to the unions president, Ron Gettelfinger. The pair met for several hours before Mr. Nardellis appointment was announced, with Mr. Nardelli declaring him to be a wonderful individual, very engaging. Later on, Mr. Nardelli stood next to Mr. Gettelfinger before Chrysler employees, an arm slung casually around his shoulders, a rare gesture for a Detroit chief executive. Mr. Gettelfinger told workers that the U.A.W. realizes that our future is tied to the future of the new Chrysler. He added: Welcome home, Chrysler. Noel Tichy, a University of Michigan professor and expert on G.E., who has known Mr. Nardelli since 1985, called him an incredible selection. Mr. Nardelli, he said, would take a hard look at bureaucracy and redundancy. And David M. Fernelius, a dealer in Cheboygan, Mich., said he was optimistic about the companys prospects. We have good products, world-class from Chrysler now, and were hoping this new management will give us some good marketing and get the word out to the public, he said. We can tout Chrysler as an American company now. But any honeymoon could be short unless Mr. Nardelli adopts a more agreeable management approach. Critics say his style at Home Depot was heavy-handed and unforgiving: he pelted employees with constant e-mail messages at all hours, focusing on problems as minor as poor lighting in a store. He drew fire for diverting Home Depots attention from its basic home supply business in stores and creating a separate $12 billion wholesale division that failed to meet expectations and was sold soon after his ouster. Further, Mr. Nardelli became accustomed to lavish catered lunches, in contrast to Chrysler, where Mr. LaSorda frequently picks up a cafeteria tray. Mr. Nardelli, however, was hired not for his people skills but for his operational expertise, which helped Home Depot double its sales and the number of stores worldwide. At G.E., moreover, he was among three executives considered as successors for John F. Welch Jr., leaving when he failed to get the job. Mr. Nardellis lack of automotive expertise will be his biggest hindrance, said Gerald Meyers, the former president of the American Motors Corporation and an expert on crisis management. Theres nothing in his background that says he lives, breathes and loves cars, Mr. Meyers said. But Mr. Nardelli tried his best Monday to present himself as a car guy. He said he owns a PT Cruiser, a Plymouth Prowler and a Jeep, and said his love for the company dates back to high school, when his first car after graduation in 1966 was a Dodge Dart. Mr. Nardelli said Monday that his wife, Susan, sent him an e-mail message upon learning he was being courted by Cerberus for the job. It must have been fate, he said she wrote him. Our first date was in the Dodge Dart. Michael Barbaro reported from New York, Nick Bunkley from Auburn Hills and Mary M. Chapman from Detroit.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/business/07chrysler.html?ref=homedepotinc">Ex-Home Depot Chief Taking Reins at Chrysler<date>Published: August 6, 2007</date><text>AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Aug. 6  Robert L. Nardelli, who was ousted as chief executive of Home Depot amid shareholder discontent this year over his enormous pay package, is taking on one of the most prominent jobs in corporate America: revitalizing the troubled automaker Chrysler. Skip to next paragraph Related Chrysler Announces Leadership Changes (Microsoft Word) Chryslers new owner, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, chose Mr. Nardelli because of his turnaround expertise, people with direct knowledge of the Cerberus plans said. They said he would bring fresh eyes to the carmaker, which was sold by the German automaker DaimlerChrysler after nine years of ownership because of growing losses at the United States company, which now ranks fourth in the American market, behind General Motors, Toyota and Ford Motor. For Mr. Nardelli, the appointment provides an opportunity to burnish his reputation, which was damaged by a contentious relationship with shareholders and ended with him departing with a severance package worth $210 million, some of it to offset benefits lost when he was hired from General Electric. I am very excited to be part of a team focused on re-establishing Chrysler as a standalone industry leader, with a renewed focus on meeting the needs of customers, Mr. Nardelli said in a press release. For Detroit, the hiring brings a high-profile executive to one of the most closely watched and politically sensitive automotive jobs at a critical moment for the United States auto industry, which continues to lose market share to Japanese automakers. Mr. Nardelli will be the second chief executive hired by a Detroit car company from outside the auto industry in the last year. Last fall, the Ford Motor Company hired Alan R. Mulally from the jet maker Boeing. Mr. Nardellis entire compensation package will be based on Chryslers performance; he will not be paid if the company, which lost $1.5 billion last year, does not improve, people with knowledge of his appointment said. It is not known how much he will make if he succeeds in returning Chrysler to sustained profitability. But executives at companies owned by private equity firms typically get a small ownership stake. Thus, they can be compensated generously if the business thrives. The Cerberus purchase of Chrysler and Fords hiring of Mr. Mulally, previously head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, underscores that it is no longer business as usual in Detroit. Indeed, foreign auto companies passed the three Detroit automakers in July sales to hold more than half the American market. Chrysler, which slipped to fifth place in the American market last month, behind G.M., Toyota, Ford and Honda, had already rolled out a restructuring plan last year. But more radical change may be needed at Chrysler, and indeed, at the other Detroit companies, which recently began negotiations on a new contract with the United Automobile Workers union. The outcome could determine whether the American companies stabilize or shrink even more. In buying Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler in May, the chairman of Cerberus, John W. Snow, vowed that his firm wanted to help the auto industry regain its prior strength. Despite the initial fears of union leaders that Cerberus might strip and flip Chrysler, selling it off in pieces, Mr. Snow denied that such plans were being made. Indeed, Ron Gettelfinger, the labor unions president, ultimately endorsed the deal, after initially vowing to fight private ownership. The management changes at Chrysler are expected to be announced Monday morning, when Chrysler plans to celebrate its return to American ownership and independence from Daimler AG of Germany, which bought it in 1998 for $36 billion in a trans-Atlantic attempt to form a dominant auto company. That deal closed on Friday. Mr. Nardelli replaces Thomas W. LaSorda, chief executive of the Chrysler Group. Mr. LaSorda will now serve as vice chairman and president. Like Mr. Nardellis appointment, Mr. LaSordas demotion also caught Detroit off guard. On Friday, he was listed as Chryslers chief executive in news releases announcing the deal and ceremonies to be held this morning marking the first official business day of the new Chrysler. At dawn today, Mr. LaSorda greeted Chrysler employees with handshakes outside the companys headquarters in Auburn Hills. He and Mr. Nardelli are set to attend a news conference and an event for employees later today. The appointment of Mr. Nardelli is a surprise both because of his lack of automotive experience and the circumstances under which he left Home Depot. Mr. Nardelli became chief executive at Home Depot in 2000. Under his leadership, the chain doubled its sales and the number of stores that it operated around the world. But its stock price stalled, and questions arose about his leadership and his high pay. His final months at Home Depot were tumultuous. Its not unusual when you have a change of ownership that youd have a change of management, said John Casesa, an auto analyst in New York. With this change of ownership and everything thats happening in the auto industry its reasonable to expect that a financial investor is going to have a very aggressive plan to change the business model. More than any other Detroit company, Chrysler remained dependent for too long on big sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Despite hit cars like the 300C and PT Cruiser, Chryslers sales plummeted as gas prices rose. Though it has introduced new cars this year, Chrysler has been overshadowed by companies like Toyota and Honda that are building more fuel-efficient vehicles. Last month, news organizations including The New York Times reported that Wolfgang Bernhard, a former Chrysler executive, would return to become chairman, based on information from people close to Chrysler. Mr. Bernhard had served as an adviser to Cerberus in its deal to buy Chrysler. Further, Mr. LaSorda was expected by Chrysler officials to remain as chief executive, although Cerberus had never said explicitly that he would remain. For his part, Mr. Bernhard rejected the offer to pursue other interests, people with knowledge of the situation said. Before joining Home Depot, Mr. Nardelli was a top executive at G.E. But he lost a three-way race to replace the retiring John F. Welch as chief executive. He held various management positions in G.E.s appliances, lighting and transportation systems departments. The Cerberus chairman, Mr. Snow, had expressed support for Chryslers existing management team, particularly Mr. LaSorda, who had been Chryslers chief executive since the start of 2006. Mr. LaSordas job security appeared fragile last year, when Chrysler lost $1.5 billion and built 100,000 more vehicles than it had dealer orders for. Senior executives at Chrysler said Mr. LaSorda might be promoted to a job with the companys then-parent, DaimlerChrysler. Departures from Chrysler are already beginning. On Sunday night, people with knowledge of the situation said that its chief operating officer, Eric Ridenour, would leave, and the former head of global purchasing at DaimlerChrysler, Thomas W. Sidlik, is departing as well. More Articles in Business »AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Aug. 6  Robert L.

Home Depot, the worlds largest home improvement store, and Sears Holdings, the biggest department store company in the country, said they expected second-quarter net income to drop far more than they anticipated just two months ago. Home Depot, based in Atlanta, said its earnings per share would decline by 15 to 18 percent for the fiscal year. In May, the company estimated a 9 percent decline, but that was before it announced the sale of its contractor supply company, HD Supply. Sears, which also runs Kmart, has been recording shrinking sales since it united with the struggling discount chain in 2005. The company, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said it expected net income to be $160 million to $200 million. In the corresponding period last year, net income was $294 million. Home Depot blamed a weakening housing market and the sale of its contractor unit. Sears acknowledged that it needed to become more relevant to its customers and to do more to control its costs. Analysts said both companies were the victims of the sluggish housing industry. Consumers have the money in their pockets, but they are just not spending it, said Markus Schomer, a global economic strategist at AIG Investments, because they see the negative headlines about the housing market, and they are scared. Mr. Schomer said the climate was supportive for a robust economy. The main drivers of spending, job growth and income growth, remain relatively stable. And last month, the Commerce Department reported strong retail sales in May, reflecting an expanding economy. But mortgage rates have been rising and the troubles in the subprime mortgage business, which gave loans to people with poor credit, have become more widespread. Reports about delinquencies and foreclosures have made consumers more reluctant to spend money, he said. The retail sales report for June will be released on Friday, and analysts and others are predicting a decrease in spending. This appears to be a spillover effect from the downturn in the housing market, said James OSullivan, an economist from UBS. A slumping housing industry affects consumer spending in more ways than one, he said. Not only are consumers less willing to shop, they are also hesitant to do home repairs and buy appliances. Sears said sales at Kmart stores, a leader in tools, home appliances and lawn and garden equipment, declined across most categories, except for a small increase in purchases of womens apparel and footwear. Home appliance sales fell more sharply than most other categories. Although we believe our business has suffered from many of the same factors that have led other retailers to announce disappointing results and lowered expectations, Aylwin B. Lewis, Sears Holdings chief executive, said in a news release, our recent performance underscores our ongoing need to become more relevant to consumers while improving our discipline around expense management. Though Home Depot forecast a sales decline of as much as 2 percent and a revenue drop in the mid-single digits, the company said it would continue with plans to open 108 stores this fiscal year. While we expect the housing market to remain challenging for the rest of 2007 and into 2008, we plan to continue our reinvestment plans, Carol B. Tome, the chief financial officer and executive vice president for corporate services at Home Depot, said in a news release. Both retailers plan to buy back some of their stock. Last month, Home Depot announced a buyback valued at $22.5 billion. Yesterday, the company announced an offer to buy as many as 250 million shares for $39 to $44 apiece. Sears said yesterday that it would repurchase an additional $1 billion in shares. Analysts forecast more sales declines from retailers as the softness in housing continues.

But whatever they are called, the new environmental chiefs  many of them named in the last two years  wield extraordinary power. They are exploring partnerships with vendors and customers to create green products  and they have the power to close the deal. They are also getting a vote  often, the deciding vote  on product research and advertising campaigns. Since he became Dow Chemicals first chief sustainability officer in March, David E. Kepler has been talking to Dows technology, manufacturing and finance people about alternative fuels and green products. We usually agree, Mr. Kepler said. But if a critical environmental issue is in dispute, Ill prevail. Linda J. Fisher, the chief sustainability officer at DuPont, scuttled the purchase of a company that was not in a sustainable business. Were building sustainability into the acquisition criteria, she said. And when two business chiefs at General Electric blanched at the cost of developing green products, Jeffrey R.

The evolution was probably inevitable. Corporations are facing demands from all quarters to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and to buy and produce green products. So, many chief executives are urging their managers to figure out what products they should sell in a warming world, said Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute. Still, few corporate chiefs want to micromanage the changes. That means they are appointing environmental surrogates to do it for them. You need a lot of huskies pulling the sled, but youve got to have a lead dog, said Andrew N. Liveris, chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical. I cant be everywhere, so I confer my clout on Dave. The environmental chiefs hail from widely disparate backgrounds. Owens Corning plucked its chief from research, while Home Depot dipped into its merchandising ranks. Ms. Fisher of DuPont once worked for the Environmental Protection Agency, while Francis Sullivan, deputy head of group sustainable development for the HSBC Group, came from the World Wildlife Fund. I was already advising HSBC about the environmental impact of their activities, so now Im making sure that their brand stands for sustainability, Mr. Sullivan said. Two people share that job at G.E. Ms. Bolsinger is responsible for green products; Stephen Ramsey, the vice president for corporate environmental programs, oversees compliance and external relations. Both are corporate officers. Jeff will tell the staff to do something, Ms. Bolsinger said. We tell them how. Other companies have rolled two jobs into one. Ernest Wooden Jr., executive vice president for brands for the Hilton Hotels Corporation, is overseeing Hiltons efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of its nearly 3,000 hotels. He already sets the standards for everything from architecture to shampoo, so purchasing agents and suppliers are accustomed to heeding his recommendations. Our C.E.O. decided I was the most powerful hammer to get things done, Mr. Wooden said. The powerful hammer thought certainly motivated Home Depot and Owens Corning. Since October, when he became Home Depots vice president for environmental innovation, Ron Jarvis has led efforts to sell green products, run green stores and educate customers about sustainability. He is also responsible for buying and selling lumber products. The other merchandising people know Im from their world, and understand what will or wont work, Mr. Jarvis said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »The corporate roster of chiefs used to be pretty short: chief executive, chief financial officer and, maybe, chief operating officer.

But the serious implications in the case of ovarian cancer strikingly illustrate the danger of promoting those forms of health insurance that discourage seeking early medical care for seemingly minor conditions. In fact, one of the most cost-effective preventive measures is prompt attention by a primary-care physician who is allotted enough time and compensation to exercise his or her clinical skills.

But not in his mind. Most of what you see today in the green movement is voodoo marketing, he added. If they say their product makes the sky bluer and the grass greener, thats just not good enough. By the standards of Mr. Jarvis  who fertilizes his own home garden with a liquefied worm waste product packaged in recycled soda bottles and fills his swimming pool with salt water to avoid putting chlorine into the environment  only 2,500 of the products made the cut. Even at that number, some environmentalists say that Home Depot is being too inclusive. In the process, they say, it is engaging in its own kind of overstated marketing, posing as green even as it continues to sell powerful pesticides and polluting lawnmowers.

Sometimes he requests product improvements, since Home Depot ultimately wants to sell about 6,000 products under the Eco Options program.

It was a bad week for automakers. Home Depot downsized by a unit, and Wal-Mart introduced products and services for the unbanked. YAHOO UPHEAVAL What’s next for Yahoo? Terry S. Semel resigned Monday as Yahoo’s chief executive, amid growing shareholder dissatisfaction over the company’s poor performance and Mr. Semel’s high pay. Perhaps more than anything, Mr. Semel became a victim of Google, whose technology prowess and startling success over the last few years left Yahoo a very distant second in the Internet’s hottest business: search advertising. The job of restoring the company’s fortunes now falls on a co-founder, Jerry Yang, who was appointed chief executive, and the longtime chief financial officer, Susan L. Decker, who was promoted to president, the No. 2 post. The two have vowed not to change course, but rather to do a better job of executing Yahoo’s current strategy, which they helped shape. They will have to deliver results  and quickly  to skeptics in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, who believe that Yahoo needs more drastic changes.

MICHAEL J. de la MERCED FUEL ECONOMY PUSH Detroit auto companies spent more than 20 years fighting increases in fuel economy requirements. But this week, that battle ended with a stunning defeat. And the companies face the prospect of yet another setback. The Senate approved a sweeping energy bill Thursday night that requires cars and trucks to get a combined average of 35 miles a gallon by 2020, a 40 percent increase from the current standard, which has been in place since the 1980s. Now the action moves to the House, where Democrats have vowed to impose an even stricter standard than the Senate bill. In normal times, auto companies could count on their old friend Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan to help them thwart an increase. But Mr. Dingell was among Michigan lawmakers who warned executives that it was time to dispense with their past resistance and figure out something with which they could live.

By the end of the week, RC2 had still not publicly explained how lead became added to the paint on the wooden toys. RC2 subcontracts its manufacturing to a number of third parties in China, and the Thomas recall has raised questions about the hidden costs of outsourcing to countries like China. RC2 also makes toys based on character from other famous shows like “Dora the Explorer” and “Sesame Street.” Despite concerns about the Thomas toys, RC2 executives attended the annual licensing convention in New York this week, where manufacturers like RC2 met with movie studios, television networks and other media companies each year to sew up licensing deals. HIT Entertainment, the owner of the Thomas &amp; Friends brand, also attended. Yesterday, a law firm based in Seattle, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against RC2 on behalf of Channing Hesse, a mother in Downers Grove, Ill., who had purchased seven of the recalled Thomas &amp; Friends toys for her toddler sons. RC2 executives were unavailable to comment yesterday on the suit or any other aspect of the recall, a spokeswoman for the company said.

It was placed there by Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia to benefit an Atlanta-based corporate constituent, Home Depot. The amendment would prohibit state and local laws that required big home-improvement stores to provide rudimentary shelter for day laborers. There arent any such laws yet, but the City Council in Los Angeles, where Home Depot wants to open 13 stores, is considering one. Mr. Isaksons pre-emptive strike would be an extraordinary intrusion of federal power into a local land-use matter. Home Depot is a magnet for day laborers. Small contractors and homeowners load up on lumber, drywall and buckets of screws, and then grab a crew. Communities have struggled to deal with these often-untidy labor bazaars where looking for work can be hard to distinguish from loitering. The combative approach, with anti-loitering laws and police harassment, seldom works and has been overturned repeatedly in the courts. The Los Angeles City Council is considering something more constructive, an ordinance that would charge big retail chains that attract day laborers  Home Depot, essentially  about $200,000 per store to provide a bare-bones space with shade, benches and toilets, to bring some order, cleanliness and safety to the daily mixing of men and trucks. The ordinance treats day labor as a measurable and inevitable effect of Home Depots buy-in-bulk business. Just as stores must obtain conditional-use permits, operate at certain hours and install lights and signs to mitigate traffic and other problems they cause, Home Depot would have to help make its stores safer and less unsightly. But after more than two years of discussions with Home Depot, council members were stunned to learn that the companys backdoor lobbying had gotten Mr. Isaksons proposal onto the short list of Republican amendments for the Senates climactic debate next week. Supporters say the amendment is germane to the immigration debate, but its not. Day labor is often a path for illegal immigrants, but not every day laborer is illegal, or even an immigrant. As long as there are homes and homeowners and Home Depots, day laborers will be with us, and local governments will need the authority to respond to them. Mr. Isakson pulled his support for the immigration bill on Wednesday, because he doubted it was ambitious enough to seal the Mexico border. Now he wants the Senate to minutely tweak the grand bargain to allow his friends at Home Depot  the countrys second-largest retailer, and a campaign contributor  to save some pocket change and to shuck off responsibility for the unruliness in its parking lots to its customers and neighbors.

Now he wants the Senate to minutely tweak the grand bargain to allow his friends at Home Depot  the countrys second-largest retailer, and a campaign contributor  to save some pocket change and to shuck off responsibility for the unruliness in its parking lots to its customers and neighbors. The immigration debate has always been wrenching. Now its getting shabby.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/business/20depot.html?ref=homedepotinc">Home Depot Sells a Unit That Never Fit<date>Published: June 20, 2007</date><text>Home Depot agreed yesterday to sell its Home Depot Supply Unit to a group of private equity firms for more than $10.3 billion. Members of the consortium  Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice  will take an equal stake in the company. Skip to next paragraph Related Home Depot Press Release (homedepot.com) Home Depot also announced yesterday that its directors had authorized a $22.5 billion increase in its share repurchase program. The repurchase would be financed, Home Depot said, with the proceeds from the sale of the supply unit, cash on hand and the sale of $12 billion in unsecured notes. Analysts had always found the supply unit a poor fit alongside the faucets and light bulbs that are Home Depots mainstays. Carol B. Tome, Home Depots chief financial officer, said yesterday that the move would allow the company to focus on its retail business, where it is being challenged by Lowes. Ms. Tome said that the price was higher than the almost $8.5 billion that Home Depot had paid for the companies it cobbled together to create the unit. Long expected, the sale of the unit, which provides pipes, lumber and concrete for professional builders, is the shedding of a liability from the era of Robert L. Nardelli, Home Depots former chief executive who was ousted this year. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter. Mr. Nardelli, a former General Electric executive, was criticized by investors and analysts for his inability to raise the companys stagnant share price, even as he earned $270 million for the last six years. Under Mr. Nardelli, customers had also complained that the level of service at the companys 2,000 stores had fallen. Home Depots new chief executive, Frank Blake, has struck a more conciliatory tone and so far earned cautious praise. But as the housing slump continues to take a toll on the companys profits and individual store sales  while the fortunes of Lowes have risen  it will be hard-pressed to start its turnaround. Shares of Home Depot rose slightly yesterday, by 31 cents, to $38.27, in regular trading, and rose as high as $40.55 in after-hours trading. Mr. Nardelli originally created the supply unit in 2000, as Home Depot found itself running out of room to build stores. The goal was to both expand the retailers reach and to achieve cost savings through synergies, like buying wood in bulk for both its supply and retail divisions. Yet Home Depot Supplys profit margins never reached the level of the retail side, and the cost savings never came as quickly as executives had hoped. The unit accounted for 13 percent of companys sales and 8 percent of its operating profit. This year senior executives determined that integrating Home Depot Supply into the rest of the company would be too costly and distracting. Home Depot hired Lehman Brothers to evaluate options for the unit, including whether to sell it or spin it off. Patricia Edwards, a money manager with Wentworth, Hauser &amp; Violich, which owns Home Depot shares, said that the supply unit was a distraction because company executives needed to focus on improving the performance of the chains 2,000 stores. The sale, Ms. Edwards said, allows management to focus where the needs are and allows them to return to their roots. Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan Securities and Citigroup Global Markets acted as acquisition advisers to the equity firms and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton served as legal counsel.

The first was that in his tenure as chief executive, Bob Nardelli returned more money to shareholders -- in the form of dividends and buybacks -- than the entire book value of the company when he took over. If that's not a rock-solid return, nothing is. Also, Mr. Nocera did not point out that most of the compensation he objects to was, and remains, strictly performance-based, not simply ''salary,'' as the article indicated. Most independent analysts agree that Mr. Nardelli built many other strong fundamentals. Of course, as a co-founder of a company that was built from scratch and a significant shareholder, I want to see that value maximized. But the ulterior motives and ideological agenda of activists and journalists were never mentioned by Mr. Nocera. Are those critics truly interested in improving the company, or as Mr. Nocera has morally instructed us before, do they simply regard compensation as ''a huge source of class tension''? Kenneth G.

The result of a special referendum on Tuesday was too close to call. In the initial count, voters turned down the initiative, 775 to 770. Village officials estimated there were at least 30 to 40 absentee and affidavit votes left to count. Carolee C. Sunderland, commissioner with the county Board of Elections, said she was uncertain how many ballots were outstanding. She said that by law, she must wait seven days for absentee ballots to be returned. All remaining votes will be opened and counted at the same time, 10 a.m. Wednesday. She noted that a problem with a voting machine early Tuesday resulted in some emergency ballots being used. It was unclear how many of those remained. She said that machines would be canvassed on Friday to doublecheck existing figures and that the count could also change based on that survey. Turnout for the referendum was low. Of some 6,000 eligible voters in Dobbs Ferry, fewer than 1,600 showed up to vote. Mayor Joseph J. Bova, who supported moving elections back to March, expressed disappointment in the turnout. "I would have preferred if we got twice as many people out to vote," he said. Mr. Bova said he supported holding elections in March because local issues get lost when lumped with state and federal races in November, and smaller parties sometimes get poor placement on the ballot. Voters approved moving village elections to November, from March, in 2004. The issue resurfaced after three incumbents were voted out. Democrats now control the village board, 4 to 3. Opponents of moving the election to March said the low turnout reinforced their argument for keeping elections in November. One of their concerns is that it is easier to get controversial measures passed when turnout is low. "Potentially, there's a slightly lower hurdle to bringing out a swing vote," said Matt de Gannon, a member of a group called Dobbs Ferry Citizens for Smart Growth, which opposed changing election day. In ads in The Rivertowns Enterprise, a local weekly newspaper, the group referred to a now withdrawn proposal to build a mega supermarket in Dobbs Ferry, saying: "No Super Stop &amp; Shop: Keep Elections on Election Day." Those who support having elections in the fall say it saves money to have only one election a year and it nearly doubles turnout. Asked whether Tuesday's weak turnout justified those arguments, Mr. Bova said, "I just hope that all the people that got interested in this election and promoted smart growth take the time now to get involved in village issues in a positive way." Home Depot Is Fined for Not Giving Rain Checks Home Depot has been fined $1,500 by the county for failing to provide rain checks on sale items not available at its store in Hawthorne. The company, based in Atlanta, also agreed not to repeat the practice. County consumer protection officials conducted an investigation at the store after a resident reported that he was denied an opportunity to buy a trash can at an advertised sale price at a later date. Gary Brown, a spokesman for the county's consumer affairs department, said inspectors were also denied rain checks when trying to buy other unavailable sale items. "It's really a form of bait and switch if they don't give you a rain check," he said. "It's hard to tell whether it was simply employees in the store who were unaware of the law or whether it was intentional." Home Depot did not respond to an e-mail request for comment. It was the second time this year that a major retailer in Westchester has been fined for failing to provide rain checks. Circuit City was cited in January. County consumer code requires that retailers issue a rain check for the next 30 days if advertised sale items are unavailable because of a lack of supply, unless the advertisement discloses there is a limited supply. The code provides for a $1,000 fine for each violation. While a fine of $1,500 may not sound like much of a penalty for a major retailer, Mr. Brown said the company had also signed an agreement in which it agrees to issue rain checks, have adequate stock of advertised sale merchandise, disclose when there is limited supply and train employees about the law. "In a store like that, with major employee turnover, it's really important that employees be trained," Mr. Brown said. "I think in many ways, that's the most important part of the settlement."

In the meeting’s aftermath, the timers became a symbol of the authoritarian, contemptuous way he had treated shareholders. They surely hastened his demise. At this year’s meeting on Thursday, everything was different, or so it seemed. Last year, not a single director showed up; this year, all but one was in attendance, and before it began, they actually mingled with shareholders. Last year, the meeting was in out-of-the-way Wilmington, Del., where no more than a few dozen people showed up; this year, with the meeting back in Home Depot’s headquarters city, Atlanta, more than 300 made it. Last year, Mr. Nardelli couldn’t be bothered to discuss the state of the business. This year, his successor, Frank Blake, spent well over an hour talking about the business and taking questions. And of course last year the big issue — indeed, the reason Mr. Nardelli pulled his stonewall act — was his outsize compensation. The details of Mr. Nardelli’s $200-million-plus pay package that emerged from the company’s 2005 proxy statement, combined with Home Depot’s sagging stock price, had turned Mr. Nardelli, the former General Electric executive, into a big, fat, juicy target for activists outraged by excessive C.E.O. pay. This year, the pay of the new chief executive, Mr. Blake — who took over in early January when the board gave Mr. Nardelli the boot — was barely mentioned. And when it was, many of the same shareholder activists who once denounced Mr. Nardelli rose to applaud the way Mr. Blake’s pay was tied to the company’s performance. (Mr. Blake is paid a $8.9 million salary, in case you’re wondering, compared with $39.7 million for Mr. Nardelli.) On stage, the new guy was everything the old guy was not: folksy, disarming, sincere, occasionally funny and often self-deprecating. “You are a breath of fresh air,” one shareholder said to him. The room broke into applause half a dozen times as speaker after speaker praised Mr. Blake’s style. Clearly, the Wicked Witch was dead. And yet, not everything was different. As a company, Home Depot is struggling, just as it was last year. Mr. Blake told the shareholders that in 2007 he expected the company’s earnings to decline by almost 10 percent and that Home Depot was putting $2 billion into an effort to overhaul the stores and recharge its employees. There were 11 shareholder proposals on the ballot, many of them dealing with executive compensation issues. After each was introduced and commented on, Mr. Blake would conclude the discussion by saying, “Your board recommends that you vote against this proposal for the reasons stated forth in the proxy.” I could swear those were the exact words Mr. Nardelli had used at last year’s debacle. The proposals all lost, though several got nearly 45 percent of the vote. And even though Mr. Nardelli was long gone, his compensation remained the looming issue at this year’s meeting. This is in part because the company is still trying to recover from last year’s annual meeting disaster — and because for many shareholders, this was their first opportunity to sound off on Mr. Nardelli’s pay. But it’s also because, as a glance at the 2006 proxy makes plain, Mr. Nardelli’s package still haunts the company: his retirement benefits alone far exceed anything anyone at Home Depot currently makes. And then there were the timers. No, they didn’t stare out at the audience this year, or dictate how much was said, but they were there just the same, tucked away in a place where only Mr. Blake could see them as they counted down. I happened to notice them after the meeting ended, when I went to the front to interview the company’s lead director, Kenneth G. Langone, who had been Mr. Nardelli’s great champion right up until the end. I was a little startled by them. But I shouldn’t have been. • Can we be completely honest here? Annual meetings aren’t about anything real, and haven’t been for a very long time. The days when Judy Holliday could rouse small investors to throw the bums out, as she did so memorably in one of the great business movies ever, “The Solid Gold Cadillac,” those days are long gone, if they ever existed at all. Today big institutions own the majority of shares in every Fortune 500 company, and they do their business behind the scenes. The vast majority of proxy votes — the ostensible purpose of the meeting — have been counted long before the meeting even begins.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/business/25depot.html?ref=homedepotinc">Apologetic, Home Depot Tries to Move Beyond Nardelli’s Shadow<date>Published: May 25, 2007</date><text>ATLANTA, May 24  For two hours, Home Depot executives did not utter his name. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Pool photo by Louie Favorite The lead director Kenneth Langone arriving Thursday at Home Depots annual shareholders meeting. Related Home Depot to Investors: Mea Culpa (May 23, 2007) But it was no use. Robert L. Nardelli loomed large over this year’s annual shareholder meeting here on Thursday, as the company’s directors and executives struggled with, and at times delivered clashing views of, the legacy of Mr. Nardelli, the ousted former chief executive. At first, it seemed that everyone was on the same page. The new chief executive, Frank Blake, took the stage and apologized for last year’s infamous annual meeting, when Mr. Nardelli refused to take questions from investors, and members of the company’s board stayed home, at their leader’s urging. “There is no better way to deal with a mistake than to acknowledge it, fix it and move forward,” Mr. Blake said. “We apologize for last year’s meeting. It was a mistake, and we won’t do it again.” But in an interview minutes before the meeting, the company’s lead director, Kenneth G. Langone, strongly defended Mr. Nardelli’s leadership and pay, both of which came under withering criticism before the board asked him to step down in January. “We needed the best. We got the best. Bob saved Home Depot,” Mr. Langone said. He said Mr. Nardelli was worth “the full value” of his pay, roughly $270 million over six years. “I am never going back away from it.” So it went, back and forth, during a day of discussions about the future of the giant home improvement retailer that returned repeatedly to the past  back to the company’s two major founders, Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank, who were both present for the first time in years, to show support for Mr. Blake. And back to its heyday in the 1990s when, as several angry investors noted, the stock price, now stagnant, made them rich. Mr. Blake tried hard to distance the proceedings from last year’s session, which was viewed as a botched effort to muzzle angry shareholders. Last year, for example, Mr. Nardelli employed large digital timers that cut off speakers after one minute. The theme of this year’s shareholder day was “openness.” Executives used the word several times, and Mr. Blake tried to show that he meant it, fielding long-winded, critical questions and discussing Home Depot’s business problems. Since Mr. Nardelli did none of those things last year  he concluded the gathering after 37 minutes  investors said the bar for transparency had been set rather low. Still, several applauded the new tone from the top, repeatedly praising Mr. Blake’s humble style and willingness to acknowledge mistakes. “You have done a remarkable job today,” said Timothy H. Smith, a senior vice president at Walden Asset Management, who sponsored one of 11 shareholder proposals that were voted down during the meeting. Richard Ferlauto, director of pension investment policy at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and a longtime critic of Mr. Nardelli’s pay, said that “the bunker mentality of last year has really flipped around.” Still, several investors complained that Mr. Blake’s humility would do little to improve the company’s flagging financial performance or stock price. With home sales slumping, Home Depot’s profit and individual store sales are falling. The problem is expected to persist for at least the next year. Mr. Blake said that the solution was to invest heavily in Home Depot’s 2,000 stores to the tune of more than $2 billion over the next year. One area of focus: recruitment. Mr. Blake said the company would aggressively reach out to former plumbers and electricians, the kind of employees who gave Home Depot a reputation for expertise before Mr. Nardelli cut workers’ hours and alienated longtime salesclerks. Once the housing market improves, he said, those investments will leave Home Depot in a stronger position to lure home owners with kitchens to renovate and garages to reorganize. “We are at a turning point for our company,” Mr. Blake said. “We know this is a tough market. But this is a great market, and we need to invest now for the future.” But for all the talk of the future, the past kept cropping up. After the meeting, Mr. Blake offered his own qualified defense of Mr. Nardelli, saying he had been caught between “plates shifting in society” as people began challenging the salaries of chief executives. “It’s an unfortunate thing,” he said, “when you see a real-life human being get caught up in that.” Mr. Langone, who helped found Home Depot, conceded that the board members had been “foolish and stupid” to skip the meeting last year. He insisted that the directors “should take more of a hit from last year’s meeting than Bob.” Mr. Langone, who was heavily criticized because he was considered Mr. Nardelli’s strongest ally on the board, said he “should have known” that the directors’ absence would inflame shareholders. “That was a miscalculation,” he said. “The shareholders own the company. We can never forget that.” In a sign that some investors had grown tired of the past, Mr. Langone was re-elected with just 67 percent of the vote, by far the lowest of any director. After the meeting, Mr. Marcus said Mr. Blake had “demonstrated real leadership today. He is the type of person who listens.” He added that Mr. Blake “did not need fear and a hammer in his hands” to run Home Depot. Was he referring, perhaps, to what is often described as the authoritarian style of Mr. Nardelli? Mr. Marcus smiled and said that he would let others interpret his words.

Richard Ferlauto, director of pension investment policy at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and a longtime critic of Mr. Nardelli’s pay, said that “the bunker mentality of last year has really flipped around.” Still, several investors complained that Mr. Blake’s humility would do little to improve the company’s flagging financial performance or stock price. With home sales slumping, Home Depot’s profit and individual store sales are falling. The problem is expected to persist for at least the next year. Mr. Blake said that the solution was to invest heavily in Home Depot’s 2,000 stores to the tune of more than $2 billion over the next year. One area of focus: recruitment. Mr. Blake said the company would aggressively reach out to former plumbers and electricians, the kind of employees who gave Home Depot a reputation for expertise before Mr. Nardelli cut workers’ hours and alienated longtime salesclerks. Once the housing market improves, he said, those investments will leave Home Depot in a stronger position to lure home owners with kitchens to renovate and garages to reorganize. “We are at a turning point for our company,” Mr. Blake said. “We know this is a tough market. But this is a great market, and we need to invest now for the future.” But for all the talk of the future, the past kept cropping up. After the meeting, Mr. Blake offered his own qualified defense of Mr. Nardelli, saying he had been caught between “plates shifting in society” as people began challenging the salaries of chief executives. “It’s an unfortunate thing,” he said, “when you see a real-life human being get caught up in that.” Mr. Langone, who helped found Home Depot, conceded that the board members had been “foolish and stupid” to skip the meeting last year. He insisted that the directors “should take more of a hit from last year’s meeting than Bob.” Mr. Langone, who was heavily criticized because he was considered Mr. Nardelli’s strongest ally on the board, said he “should have known” that the directors’ absence would inflame shareholders. “That was a miscalculation,” he said. “The shareholders own the company. We can never forget that.” In a sign that some investors had grown tired of the past, Mr. Langone was re-elected with just 67 percent of the vote, by far the lowest of any director. After the meeting, Mr. Marcus said Mr. Blake had “demonstrated real leadership today. He is the type of person who listens.” He added that Mr. Blake “did not need fear and a hammer in his hands” to run Home Depot. Was he referring, perhaps, to what is often described as the authoritarian style of Mr. Nardelli? Mr. Marcus smiled and said that he would let others interpret his words.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/business/23depot.html?ref=homedepotinc">Home Depot to Investors: Mea Culpa<date>Published: May 23, 2007</date><text>It was, as even Home Depot executives will concede, a 37-minute fiasco.

Home Depot’s annual meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, will strike a far warmer, inviting tone, with members of the board in prominent attendance and the company’s folksy new chief executive fielding dozens of shareholder questions  sans digital timers. Frank Blake, the chief executive, will purposefully distance himself from his predecessor, Robert L. Nardelli, by reviewing the state of the chain’s business (in 2006, Mr. Nardelli didn’t bother), acknowledging the problems it faces (ditto) and laying out his vision for the chain’s future (Mr. Nardelli left the stage after a vote on shareholder proposals). There is a lot riding on the performance. Mr. Blake has won over critics of Mr. Nardelli with his low-key, humble approach, but this meeting is his biggest chance to show investors publicly how much the company  and the board  have changed since last year’s debacle. “It would be impossible to have a meeting worse than last year’s,” said Richard Ferlauto, director of pension investment policy at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union. “Anything they would do is an improvement.” Attendees are looking for change in another area, too: Home Depot’s flagging performance. Profit fell 30 percent in the first quarter of this year, and sales at stores open at least a year plunged 8 percent. As the typically candid Mr. Blake put it: “While we expected a tough quarter, this was worse than we anticipated.” The company has blamed the weak housing market, which has also put a dent in the profits of its main rival, Lowe’s. But analysts worry that low morale among Home Depot’s employees, combined with management’s lack of investment in the stores, has turned off shoppers who have decks to build and kitchens to renovate. Mr. Blake has begun to confront both issues, considered a legacy of Mr. Nardelli’s tenure, hiring experienced plumbers and electricians as store employees, eliminating unattainable sales goals for managers and setting up a $3,000 fund at every store to reward workers. But a turnaround could take time, and it is unclear how much patience Wall Street will have for quarter after quarter of slipping sales. So far, many analysts are giving Mr. Blake, who was named to the top job in January, the benefit of the doubt. “I am confident enough to give him the time,” said Steve Chick, an analyst at JPMorgan. The good will toward Mr. Blake has much to do with his break from Mr. Nardelli’s imperial style. He took a far smaller salary ($8.9 million a year, compared with $39.7 million for Mr. Nardelli) and has earned a reputation for humility, frequently admitting to mistakes (like ill-timed clearance sales during the last quarter, which he said “weren’t the smartest thing to do”). That kind of transparency is expected throughout tomorrow’s meeting. What struck investors about Home Depot’s 2006 annual meeting was not just its beat-the-clock brevity, but the fact that Mr. Nardelli tossed aside such rituals as a discussion of the retailer’s performance and the presence of board members up for re-election. Given the debate swirling around Mr. Nardelli’s pay at the time, the absence of both struck investors as an attempt to gloss over the company’s problems and deny investors a chance to question  or more likely criticize  the directors who set his pay. This year, in a symbolic gesture, Home Depot will return to its headquarters city of Atlanta, holding its meeting at the same convention center as it did for years before Mr. Nardelli moved the event around the country. Executives are expected to proceed at a leisurely pace, at least compared with last year’s sprint. The company expects a two-hour meeting, with Mr. Blake and his deputies expected to walk through a slide-show presentation. And, of course, board members will be introduced, one by one, to shareholders  a moment likely to draw a combination of applause and a few jeers, given the strong emotions over their absence last year. Brad Shaw, a spokesman for Home Depot, said the company was “looking forward to demonstrating our commitment to open, two-way communication with our shareholders.” Several big investors who left last year’s meeting in anger are scheduled to meet with members of the board today in Atlanta to discuss proposals for corporate governance and the process of picking future directors, since four board seats will be open over the next year, according to people briefed on the matter. One of those investors is the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which last year protested Mr. Nardelli’s pay by posting a man dressed in a chicken suit outside the Delaware gathering. Comparing the tenure of Mr. Blake with that of Mr. Nardelli, Dan Pedrotty, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s office of investment, said “the contrast could not be any more stark in terms of the outreach to investors.” The A.F.L.-C.I.O. had planned to introduce a proposal at tomorrow’s shareholder meeting requiring Home Depot to disclose any ties it has to the compensation consultants it hires and to explain the role of the chief executive in choosing the consultants. But Mr. Pedrotty said that, in conversations with the company, he learned that Home Depot had already adopted the plan internally, sparing both sides a showdown at the annual meeting, so the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has withdrawn it as a shareholder proposal. For all the progress, however, there is still some bitterness over the 2006 meeting. Mr. Ferlauto of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said Home Depot executives and directors should express contrition, in one form or another, for last year’s conduct. “They need to do their mea culpas,” Mr. Ferlauto said.

Two of the largest retailers, Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, reported lackluster first-quarter earnings. Wal-Mart's profit climbed 8 percent, to $2.83 billion. Sales, meanwhile, rose by the smallest amount in at least a decade. The results, while disappointing, still matched Wall Street expectations. The same could not be said for Home Depot, which reported a 30 percent decline in profit for the first quarter. Its earnings declined to $1.05 billion, and overall sales barely edged up. Analysts said the results could portend trouble for retailers in the coming months, as the housing market continues to drag and the economy runs at a slower pace. The earnings report from Target, scheduled for Wednesday, should help shed some light on just how much consumers are pulling back.

Home Depot said its quarterly earnings fell 29.5 percent, and Wal-Mart warned that profit in its current quarter might fall short of expectations. Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the nation, said it earned $2.83 billion, or 68 cents a share, up 8 percent from the $2.62 billion, or 64 cents a share, it earned a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended April 30 and was the first quarter of Wal-Marts fiscal year, rose to $86.41 billion from $79.67 billion a year earlier. The results met the 68 cents a share profit and $86.9 billion in sales expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. But the company said it expected a second-quarter profit of 75 cents to 79 cents a share, while analysts were expecting a profit of 79 cents a share. Shares of Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., fell 22 cents, to $47.62 a share. Home Depot, meanwhile, said erratic weather and continued weakness in the housing market hurt its results in the first quarter and gave a bleak assessment of its financial picture for the rest of the year. The company, which is based in Atlanta, said it earned $1.05 billion, or 53 cents a share, compared with a profit of $1.48 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended April 29, rose 0.6 percent, to $21.59 billion from $21.46 billion. Profit fell short of the 59 cents expected by analysts, and shares in Home Depot fell 71 cents, to $38.30. While we expected a tough quarter, this was worse than we expected, the chief executive, Frank Blake, said during a conference call with analysts. He said the housing market remained a challenge and that erratic weather across the United States had hurt the companys spring selling season. Sales at stores open at least a year were disappointing for both companies. At Home Depot, same-store sales fell 7.6 percent, and Mr. Blake said the company was not expecting any near-term market improvement. The company said it now expected profit in the current year to decline by as much as 9 percent, the high end of the range it forecast at the start of the year. Goldman Sachs said in a research note that the lower forecast from Home Depots and Wal-Marts focus on lower prices could weigh on retail stocks at large as investors become increasingly skeptical about the macro and competitive environment. Wal-Marts chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., focused on low prices during a conference call with analysts. You will see us be more committed than ever to price leadership, Mr. Scott said. Same-store sales at Wal-Mart stores in the United States rose 0.6 percent in the first quarter, with its Sams Club stores accounting for all of the gain. Wal-Marts namesake stores slipped 0.1 percent in the quarter, while Sams Club warehouse stores rose 4.7 percent. For the current quarter, Wal-Mart projected same-store sales to rise by 1 percent to 2 percent. Wal-Mart is losing market share after an effort last year to offer fashionable, costlier apparel, which failed to win broad customer appeal. Wal-Mart began to shift to lower-priced goods last holiday season. Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst with A.G. Edwards, said apparel remained a problem for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is continuing to fail to properly interpret the fashion trends of their core low-income customers, Mr. Buchanan said. Sams Club, however, now has had seven consecutive quarters in which profits grew faster than sales, Mr. Scott said. Wal-Marts international division, the fastest growing part of the company, accounted for 23 percent of sales for the quarter. Icahn Sells Federated Shares The billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn sold his 1.3 percent stake in Federated Department Stores. Icahn Management sold its 6.8 million shares as of March 31, Mr. Icahn said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Federateds shares fell 96 cents, to $39.94. Funds managed by Mr. Icahn also cut their Time Warner holdings to 12.9 million shares from 25 million at the end of December, according to the filings.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Erik S. Lesser for The New York Times Dan Brown stocked organic vegetables and herbs in peat pots at a Home Depot store in Atlanta. The health benefits spur sales of organic food. Home Depot today will introduce a label for nearly 3,000 products, like fluorescent light bulbs that conserve electricity and natural insect killers, that promote energy conservation, sustainable forestry and clean water. The initiative  which is expected to include 6,000 products by 2009, representing 12 percent of the chains sales  would become the largest green labeling program in American retailing and could persuade competitors to speed up their own plans. And it signals that Home Depot, the countrys second-largest retailer, is joining the largest, Wal-Mart, in pursuing issues of public concern like climate change that stores have left to governments and environmental groups. More than 90 percent of the products in the line are already on Home Depots shelves, but the Eco Options brand will identify them as environmentally friendly. Home Depot executives said that as the worlds largest buyer of construction material, their company had the power to persuade thousands of suppliers, home builders and consumers to follow its lead on environment sustainability. Who in the world has a chance to have a bigger impact on this sector than Home Depot? said Ron Jarvis, vice president for environmental innovation at the retailer, which is based in Atlanta. But persuading the majority of Americans to buy less polluting products could prove an uphill battle, at least for now, environmental advocates say. Decades of research have shown that consumers often say they want sustainable products but rarely purchase them. Prices tend to be higher, and consumers complain that the products do not always work as well as those they are meant to replace. There has not been a lot of success, frankly, said Laurie Demeritt, president of the Hartman Group, which consults with retailers like Wal-Mart and Whole Foods on how to sell environmentally sustainable products. A big exception has been organic food. But even there, Ms. Demeritt said, consumers seem to be motivated by the health benefits, not the environmental impact. Home Depot introduced Eco Options products in Canada in 2004, where the company has fewer than 200 stores  and so far, sales there have been strong. Mr. Jarvis said Home Depot found that given the option of a product that performs just as well, we are seeing the consumer would rather buy something that has less of an impact on the environment, adding, We are just making that easier. The company said it had asked suppliers to produce Eco Option goods at the same prices as conventional merchandise. But it acknowledged that some products would be more expensive at the cash register, even if consumers are likely to save money over time  as in the case of the energy-efficient light bulbs. Suppliers that qualify for the Eco Options label will be rewarded with what preferential treatment  like prominent shelf space in the nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores in the United States and aggressive marketing through weekly newspaper inserts. Merchandise can qualify for the new line in two ways. It either meets widely accepted federal and industry standards, like the Energy Star or the Forest Stewardship Council certification process, or its environmental claims are tested and validated by an outside company, Scientific Certification Systems. Ultimately, Home Depot, rather than a third party, determines what products will receive an Eco Options label. There is, for example, a silicone window and door sealant from General Electric that improves the energy efficiency of heating and cooling systems and reduces greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-burning electricity plants. Another product is a glass cleaner from OdoBan that has low levels of volatile organic compounds, vapors linked to health problems. And organic plant food from Miracle-Gro uses no harsh chemicals that imperil water supplies. For Home Depot, the new program is the culmination of a nearly decade-long journey from environmental whipping boy to green darling. In the late 1990s, groups conducted repeated protests against the company, contending that it sold wood from endangered forests in countries including Chile and Indonesia. But by 2000, Home Depot had promised to eliminate sales of lumber from environmentally sensitive areas and began giving preference to wood from forests that are managed in ways considered sound. Since then, Home Depot has worked with environmental groups to develop a variety of green programs, like offsetting carbon emissions from its headquarters by planting thousands of trees in Atlanta. Its changes mirror those at Wal-Mart, which was heavily criticized by environmentalists for failing to manage storm-water runoff during construction of new stores in the United States and for generating high levels of pollution in countries like China, where many of its products are manufactured. But in 2005, Wal-Mart committed itself to reduce energy use in its stores, improve its trucks fuel efficiency and minimize the use of packaging. Like Home Depot, Wal-Mart is asking that suppliers develop more sustainable products. But Wal-Mart has yet to introduce a broad environmental labeling program. It is hardly alone. Retailers have been reluctant to brand products as green because of lackluster sales. The options offered in the past have been a little ahead of their time, said Lawrence A. Selzer, president of the Conservation Fund, an environmental group that works closely with Home Depot. But Mr. Selzer said what feels different today is the level of public engagement on issues like climate change. There is a buzz in the country right now, he said. The buying public is ready, willing and able. Even if the products do not sell briskly, environmental leaders said their presence on the shelves would begin teaching millions of shoppers about the impact of household products like weed killers and light bulbs. People hear about the environment, they see commercials, they attend a feel-good meeting, but at the end of the day they dont know what to do, Mr. Jarvis of Home Depot said. We see educating the consumer as being the highest impact of this process. More Articles in Business »After squabbling over prices for decades, the nations big-box retail chains are ready to battle in a new arena: the environment.

A big exception has been organic food. But even there, Ms. Demeritt said, consumers seem to be motivated by the health benefits, not the environmental impact. Home Depot introduced Eco Options products in Canada in 2004, where the company has fewer than 200 stores  and so far, sales there have been strong. Mr. Jarvis said Home Depot found that given the option of a product that performs just as well, we are seeing the consumer would rather buy something that has less of an impact on the environment, adding, We are just making that easier. The company said it had asked suppliers to produce Eco Option goods at the same prices as conventional merchandise. But it acknowledged that some products would be more expensive at the cash register, even if consumers are likely to save money over time  as in the case of the energy-efficient light bulbs. Suppliers that qualify for the Eco Options label will be rewarded with what preferential treatment  like prominent shelf space in the nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores in the United States and aggressive marketing through weekly newspaper inserts. Merchandise can qualify for the new line in two ways. It either meets widely accepted federal and industry standards, like the Energy Star or the Forest Stewardship Council certification process, or its environmental claims are tested and validated by an outside company, Scientific Certification Systems. Ultimately, Home Depot, rather than a third party, determines what products will receive an Eco Options label. There is, for example, a silicone window and door sealant from General Electric that improves the energy efficiency of heating and cooling systems and reduces greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-burning electricity plants. Another product is a glass cleaner from OdoBan that has low levels of volatile organic compounds, vapors linked to health problems. And organic plant food from Miracle-Gro uses no harsh chemicals that imperil water supplies. For Home Depot, the new program is the culmination of a nearly decade-long journey from environmental whipping boy to green darling. In the late 1990s, groups conducted repeated protests against the company, contending that it sold wood from endangered forests in countries including Chile and Indonesia. But by 2000, Home Depot had promised to eliminate sales of lumber from environmentally sensitive areas and began giving preference to wood from forests that are managed in ways considered sound. Since then, Home Depot has worked with environmental groups to develop a variety of green programs, like offsetting carbon emissions from its headquarters by planting thousands of trees in Atlanta. Its changes mirror those at Wal-Mart, which was heavily criticized by environmentalists for failing to manage storm-water runoff during construction of new stores in the United States and for generating high levels of pollution in countries like China, where many of its products are manufactured. But in 2005, Wal-Mart committed itself to reduce energy use in its stores, improve its trucks fuel efficiency and minimize the use of packaging. Like Home Depot, Wal-Mart is asking that suppliers develop more sustainable products. But Wal-Mart has yet to introduce a broad environmental labeling program. It is hardly alone. Retailers have been reluctant to brand products as green because of lackluster sales. The options offered in the past have been a little ahead of their time, said Lawrence A. Selzer, president of the Conservation Fund, an environmental group that works closely with Home Depot. But Mr. Selzer said what feels different today is the level of public engagement on issues like climate change. There is a buzz in the country right now, he said. The buying public is ready, willing and able. Even if the products do not sell briskly, environmental leaders said their presence on the shelves would begin teaching millions of shoppers about the impact of household products like weed killers and light bulbs. People hear about the environment, they see commercials, they attend a feel-good meeting, but at the end of the day they dont know what to do, Mr. Jarvis of Home Depot said. We see educating the consumer as being the highest impact of this process.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/opinion/12thu2.html?ref=homedepotinc">The Billion-Dollar Brushoff<date>Published: April 12, 2007</date><text>If there is a single, logical justification for the wild executive compensation packages that have become standard at large American companies, it is performance.
