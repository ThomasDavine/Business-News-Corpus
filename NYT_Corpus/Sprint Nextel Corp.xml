Its shares still edged lower on Wednesday as investors continued to focus on finances that look precarious for the next two years. Sprint’s net loss was $301 million, or 10 cents a share, for the third quarter. That is down from $911 million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago. It was the best performance by Sprint since it reported a profit of $64 million in the third quarter of 2007. Revenue rose 2.2 percent to $8.3 billion. Sprint, the country’s third-largest wireless carrier behind AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, said it added a net 1.3 million subscribers in the July-to-September period, the best result since 2006. Sprint continued to lose subscribers from its lucrative contract-based plans, but at a relatively low rate: 44,000 in the quarter. Sprint’s total customer count, 53.4 million, is now back at where it was in 2007, before the exodus of Nextel customers turned into a torrent. The company, based in Overland Park, Kan., has made steady gains in the last year and a half. Unfortunately for the company, most of the new customers are low-paying ones. They buy service from Sprint’s low-cost Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile or Assurance Wireless brands, or from non-Sprint brands that use the company’s network. The latest subscriber results do not include the effect of the iPhone, which Sprint started selling Oct. 14. The phone is expected to further improve the company’s ability to keep customers, at a high price. Apple charges about $600 for a phone that Sprint sells for $200. Sprint’s chief financial officer, Joseph J. Euteneuer, said each iPhone would cost the company about $200 more than another smartphone. All the same, the company expects its four-year purchasing agreement with Apple to add $7 billion to $8 billion to its own bottom line. The problem for Sprint is that the cost of selling the iPhone comes upfront, while benefits like higher service fees and lower service costs accrue over time. Sprint does not expect the iPhone to be a moneymaker until 2014. The added cost of the iPhone comes as Sprint is also starting to revamp its network for higher speeds. That adds up to financing needs of $5 billion to $7 billion in the next few years, Mr. Euteneuer said. Shares of Sprint fell 19 cents, or 7 percent, to $2.51.Sprint Nextel reported on Wednesday its smallest quarterly loss in four years as it continued a turnaround and improved at keeping and attracting customers.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/business/sprints-hand-in-antitrust-suit.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint’s Hand in Antitrust Suit<date>Published: October 25, 2011</date><text> Sprint’s efforts to thwart AT&amp;T’s $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA hedge against a swing and a miss by the Justice Department. The company, the third-largest mobile operator, has said it just wants to help the government. But its separate lawsuit suggests a lack of confidence in federal arguments. Though a court hearing on Monday showed the case faces hurdles, it may give Sprint insurance in case the government stumbles. Judges generally look askance at competitors’ lawsuits to block mergers. Antitrust law doesn’t protect rivals from harmful competition, the Supreme Court has ruled, unless it’s clear their injuries would also damage consumers. Merely filing a suit can appear self-serving and undercut a company’s arguments, and legal fees are costly. That’s why most firms let the Justice Department do the heavy lifting and cheer from the sidelines. Sprint, though, says that stepping in frees it to make clearer legal points and give the government technical support about the industry. The latter may be harder to accomplish after a judge’s ruling on Monday denied the company access to AT&amp;T documents already given to the government. Sprint also notes that the more lawsuits AT&amp;T faces, the tougher a settlement — and consummation of the deal — will be. But court documents suggest another reason. The government argues that the merger would cut competition, curb innovation and raise prices. Sprint says the deal would block smaller rivals from offering cutting-edge handsets, reaching roaming agreements and gaining access to so-called backhaul services, which tie a central network to remote sites. Both sets of results could harm consumers. But the first might benefit Sprint if higher prices gave it a competitive edge. The second would limit its market. Antitrust-law experts critical of the Justice Department’s argument say Sprint’s is legally much stronger. The stock market seems to agree. When the government announced its lawsuit on Aug. 31, Sprint’s stock jumped substantially. That’s a surprising reaction to a move intended to keep the mobile industry generally from raising prices. Sprint says the government’s case is strong. That the company felt compelled to make its own arguments in a rare lawsuit may be telling nonetheless. With AT&amp;T’s play for T-Mobile threatening to create a wireless behemoth, there’s a lot at stake for Sprint. Little wonder that it wants to have its own say in court.  Netflix Woes Netflix’s story of triumph has turned quickly into something akin to “The China Syndrome.” Like the nuclear disaster depicted in that 1979 film, the company’s core, where profit is concerned, is melting down. Until Monday, Netflix had been cagey about the respective profitability of the two units it was planning to separate. New figures show Netflix makes about 10 times more from a DVD customer than from an online streaming subscriber. Trouble is, the wrong arm is shrinking — fast. The future for Netflix was always in streaming. There’s no reason to wait for a DVD in the mail when a movie can be delivered instantly. Still, many subscribers complained when Netflix outlined plans this year to split the two businesses. The company reversed itself, but related disclosure proceeded. The new numbers reveal that while money-losing international businesses are growing, far larger domestic operations have hit a wall. Netflix reckons it could lose as much as 7 percent of its streaming subscribers this quarter. Worse, up to 3.6 million of its 13.9 million DVD subscribers could flee by the end of the fourth quarter. Netflix says profit from United States DVD rentals should be $177 million to $192 million. It will make just $30 million to $42 million on streaming, even though there are twice as many buyers of the service. A recent price increase undoubtedly exacerbated the loss of these more valuable customers. Many opted for streaming only to save cash. But even Netflix acknowledges that DVDs are a dying business. The associated profit will deflate over time anyway. Profit from streaming could grow as subscribers are added, but the cost of programming is rising and competition is stiffening. It’s understandable that Netflix lost about 35 percent of its market value Tuesday, and its value has fallen about 75 percent from its high in July. The company still trades at about 17 times estimated earnings for this year. After these forecasts are slashed on the heels of the latest revelations, Netflix will still command a premium valuation. But with its biggest source of profit evaporating, the company’s shares no longer deserve one.      For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com. </text></article><article index="3" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/choosing-the-right-iphone-data-plan/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Choosing the Right iPhone Data Plan<date>October 12, 2011, 8:12 pm</date><text>If you have decided to get a new iPhone, the choice is a whole lot harder than what color — black or white — or how much storage — 16, 32 or 64 gigabytes — you want. The next step is choosing a carrier, and while your decision may be based on any number of factors like coverage or the compelling nature of commercials, I was trying to figure it out by looking at the best value. And I am flummoxed because — big surprise — the carriers don’t make it easy. Apple lays out the various plans for you in a very convenient fashion, but the plans (by design) are not comparable. Let’s take a stab at it anyway. First, no one talks on phones any more. So we can start with the minimum number of voice minutes for that. For AT&amp;T and Verizon that is $40 a month. For Sprint it is $80, but that includes unlimited data and text messaging. So on to the other two carriers in those categories. AT&amp;T gives you only two options for text messages: pay per use and unlimited for another $20. Unless you are a teenager, you aren’t going to send 100 text messages a month. There are loads of ways to send text messages free outside the carrier’s control (including the new iMessage feature on the iPhone), so go for pay per use and never use it. Do the same for Verizon, though I suppose you could pay $5 a month for 250 text messages a month, just as insurance. Now the hard part: data. It’s hard because you never really know how much to use. (You can check your use by looking at your account with your current carrier.) But you are going to use at least two gigabytes a month. For AT&amp;T that’s $25, and for Verizon it’s $30. So at this point, it its AT&amp;T at $65 and Verizon at $70. These two plans look cheaper than Sprint, but Sprint is letting you have more data. Should you need more data (or you still don’t believe Sprint’s marketing that it is no longer the customer-unfriendly company it once was), AT&amp;T sells four gigabytes for $45 and you can use the phone as a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot for other devices, like an iPad or a laptop. You can get the same amount from Verizon, but it will cost $50. (that’s $30 for two gigabytes of data and another $20 for two additional gigabytes with mobile hotspot service). So again, advantage AT&amp;T, by $5.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/how-to-pick-the-best-iphone-4s-carrier/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">How to Pick the Best iPhone 4S Carrier<date>October 12, 2011, 8:29 pm</date><text>If you’re in the market for an iPhone 4S, you may be wondering which carrier you should give your money to. After all, you now have a new choice to consider, Sprint, not to mention the ever-shifting landscape of each carrier’s plans and add-ons. Let’s try to break it down. In order to do this, however, we must start by acknowledging that different people want different things out of their phone. Some people travel internationally a great deal; some stay stateside almost all of the time. Some people are counting pennies; some people are rolling in cash. So before we go any further, let’s identify a few categories that all carriers can be judged by. Network quality – Some call this “coverage,” others “speed,” but it’s all basically the same–will your calls and texts and browsing get through? Plan costs – How much will you be paying each month? Is one carrier considerably cheaper than another? And remember–this category has more to do with data costs these days than it does with voice minutes. International roaming costs – All iPhone 4S’s are world phones, so they can function in most places on the globe. But are you locked in to your carrier’s international calling plan if you leave the country, or can you swap SIM cards and use a local provider for far less? Browsing while talking – Only AT&amp;T‘s network lets you use a Web browser and Internet-enabled apps at the same time you are talking to someone on the phone. On a Verizon or Sprint phone, you have to hang up your call to go on the Internet. Not all these factors are equal — and they’re certainly not valued the same way by every user. Network quality seems fairly important to everyone, but international costs? If you do care about that, then you care a lot. That being the case, let’s rank their importance as best we can, giving each a value from 4 points (most important) to 1 (least important). For example, here’s how my needs stack up: Ranking Values Network Quality: 4 (I want my phone to work.) Browsing while talking: 3 (It’s not huge, but I like it.) Plan costs: 2 (The difference in plan prices is between $5 and $10 for me.) International costs: 1 (I am rarely out of the country.) Your mileage may vary, but you can do the same ranking/points list. Now, let’s shift gears slightly. While everyone’s going to prioritize differently, there are some things we do know for sure: Verizon has a better network than AT&amp;T or Sprint. (You may disagree.) Sprint has the cheapest plans. Only AT&amp;T lets you browse and talk at the same time. Only Verizon lets you use local SIM cards when abroad. So, we can give points to this as well, with the higher point value going to the company with the better/most consumer-friendly attribute. There are three players, but in all cases, there’s always a tie between two of them, so I’ve limited the points field to 2 points: Attribute Values Network Quality: Verizon 2, AT&amp;T 1, Sprint 1 Plan costs: Sprint 2, Verizon 1, AT&amp;T 1 Browse and talk: AT&amp;T 2, Verizon 1, Sprint 1 International costs: Verizon 2, AT&amp;T 1, Sprint 1 Now, I’m no Nate Silver, but if you take your ranking values and multiply them by the attribute values, you get a rough idea of which carrier is better at the things which are important to you. Again, I’ll use my preferences as an example: Network quality was my most important thing, at 4 points. That means that Verizon gets 8 points (ranking value of 4 points times attribute value of 2), while AT&amp;T and Sprint each get 4 points. Browsing while talking was my second-most important thing, at 3 points. That means that AT&amp;T gets 6 points for that, while Verizon and Sprint get 3 each. Plan costs was my third-most important thing, at 2 points. That means that Sprint gets 4 points for that, while Verizon and AT&amp;T get 2 each. International costs was last, at 1 point. Verizon gets 2 points, and AT&amp;T and Sprint each get 1 point. So, add that all up and… Verizon – 15 points AT&amp;T – 13 points Sprint – 12 points Looks like I know which carrier I’m supposed to go with.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/technology/sprints-shares-fall-on-news-it-lacks-money-for-upgrades.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint’s Shares Fall on News It Lacks Money for Upgrades<date>Published: October 7, 2011</date><text>The struggling wireless carrier Sprint Nextel said Friday that it would need to raise additional money to build a higher-speed data network, a move that sent its stock down 20 percent.

But Tuesday’s announcement will also probably fan the flames of a rivalry that is almost as fierce. Apple announced that in addition to AT&amp;T and Verizon, Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 4S, beginning Oct. 14. For years, AT&amp;T benefited from being the only American carrier with the iPhone. And Verizon saw an increase in sales once it added the device to its portfolio, albeit a minor one. The carriers are counting on the lucrative revenue generated by smartphone owners and the expensive data plans that those devices require to buoy their financial outlook as they move away from their legacy landline businesses. Now that most people in the country own a cellphone, one of the last remaining areas of growth is getting them to upgrade to more sophisticated smartphones. For Sprint, the stakes are even higher. The beleaguered carrier has a lot riding on the success of its ability to sell the iPhone on its network. But does Sprint have a shot at luring customers away from AT&amp;T and Verizon? Sprint may have one advantage — it still offers unlimited data plans for its line of smartphones, something that Verizon and AT&amp;T have already abandoned in favor of tiered data plans. We’ve already seen the carriers taking potshots at one another in advertising campaigns and trying to appeal to consumers by adjusting their pricing structures. AT&amp;T has announced that it will give away the iPhone 3GS free for new contract subscribers on its network — something Verizon and Sprint cannot offer, as there is no compatible version of that phone model for their respective networks. “The elbows are getting sharper,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Now that they have most of the same portfolio, we’re going to start to see the carriers hone in on their own offerings as a way to pitch themselves.” Verizon will probably promote the quality of its network, he said, while AT&amp;T will boast about its download speeds and having the broadest portfolio of iPhones, with the iPhone 3GS, 4 and 4S. Sprint’s ace will be its unlimited data plans. Expect the battleground to get bloodier in the coming weeks as the iPhone 4S goes on sale.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/att-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuits-by-sprint-and-cell-south/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">AT&amp;T Moves to Dismiss Lawsuits by Sprint and Cell South<date>September 30, 2011, 3:57 pm</date><text>The legal fusillades have continued in the battle over AT&amp;T‘s proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA, as the company sought on Friday to take shots at competitors seeking to stop the takeover. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg NewsHu Meena, chief of Cellular South, testified at a Congressional hearing in May against AT&amp;T’s merger with T-Mobile. AT&amp;T moved to dismiss antitrust lawsuits by Sprint Nextel and Cellular South, arguing that both companies were looking to block the deal for self-interested reasons, not because the combination of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would be bad for competition. (Here is AT&amp;T’s Sprint response, and here is its Cellular South response.) The lawsuits by Sprint and Cellular South were filed in the wake of the Justice Department’s lawsuit seeking to halt the deal. That case, which has been joined by seven state attorneys general, is the biggest legal battle that AT&amp;T faces. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Interactive Timeline: AT&amp;T's Merger With T-Mobile Perhaps the most pointed of the evidence backing up AT&amp;T’s claim was an e-mail sent by Cellular South’s chief executive, Hu Meena, asking for demands that would head off opposition to the deal. In the message, sent to AT&amp;T’s wireless chief, Ralph De La Vega, Mr. Meena suggested an expansive roaming agreement in which Cellular South would build out its next-generation LTE network anywhere in the South, especially in all of Mississippi. AT&amp;T would then strike roaming agreements with Cellular South for use of that network, as well as allow the company access to data and voice roaming services elsewhere. “The Sprint and Cellular South complaints should be dismissed as both are an obvious attempt to use the court to improve their own strategic interests,” Wayne Watts, AT&amp;T’s general counsel, said in a statement. Of the Cellular South proposal, he added: “Such an extraordinary and inappropriate proposal simply confirms that what Cellular South fears is competition, not an alleged lack of competition.” In a statement, Vonya B. McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president of government affairs, said, “AT&amp;T’s motion is without merit, and Sprint will respond to it next Friday and continue to cooperate with Judge Huvelle as she seeks to efficiently try both this case and the Justice Department’s case against AT&amp;T.” In the meantime, AT&amp;T is reaching out to competitors like Sprint and Cellular South to reach accords on asset sales and roaming agreements. The hope is to settle the Justice Department’s lawsuit seeking to block the T-Mobile deal.

But Google wants to go one step further: it wants to be our wallets.Its new phone software, called Google Wallet, is intended to replace the credit cards in our actual wallets. It does sound pretty spectacular, doesn’t it? No fishing plastic cards out of wallets, no paper slips, no signatures. Everything is handled securely, instantly, conveniently, with one tap of your phone at the register. Europeans and Asians already routinely pay for things that way. Why can’t we have that in America? Now you can. But there are enough footnotes to fill a podiatry journal. At the moment, the free Google Wallet app runs on only a single cellphone model: Sprint’s Google Nexus S, which runs Google’s Android software. That’s because Google Wallet requires a special N.F.C. chip (near-field communications), and the Nexus S is one of the few phones so equipped. Someday, Google says, many more phones will have N.F.C. chips. The company says that it’s in talks with every major Android phone maker. The next question: Where can you use Wallet to pay for things? Google had the inspired idea of teaming up with MasterCard, which has already installed N.F.C. readers at 150,000 merchants in the United States and 230,000 overseas. You can see the black MasterCard PayPass terminals all over the place. That’s 150,000 companies; the total number of physical stores is far higher. At the moment, they include CVS, Duane Reade, RadioShack, Sunoco, Sports Authority, Foot Locker and New York City taxis. In coming weeks, Google says, more stores will come along, including Subway, Macy’s, Walgreens and Bloomingdale’s. Someday, Google says, the readers will be installed at cash registers all across this great land. Think of Wallet as a copy of your actual credit card. Wherever you might swipe a credit card, you can tap your phone instead. At the moment, though, the only credit card Wallet can impersonate is a Citibank MasterCard. Someday, Google says, all kinds of credit cards from all kinds of banks will work with Wallet. If you don’t have a Citibank MasterCard, you can still use Wallet. On the screen where you select which credit card you want to use, you’ll find an imaginary one called Google Prepaid Card. It comes with $10 of credit — Google’s gift to you, O Early Adopter — but right there on the phone, you can preload it with more money from another credit card. All right. So you’re in CVS or 7-Eleven, and the cashier announces the total, “$31.24.” At the exact moment when you would ordinarily swipe your credit card, you simply turn on the phone. (You don’t have to fire up the Wallet app first.) You hold it against the PayPass terminal and enter your four-digit password. The screen says “Sent,” and the terminal’s screen says “Authorizing ... Approved ... Balance $0. Thank you!” Security, Google says, is baked into the system from the beginning. The phone’s N.F.C. chip is completely deactivated when the screen is off. That’s to prevent sneaky evildoers from “skimming” (reading) your credit card information. A shame, really; Google says that the N.F.C. chip could work even when the phone was off, meaning you could keep using it to buy things. But Google chose to emphasize security over convenience; as a result, the phone is useless as a wallet once its battery is dead. The pass code requirement is intended to prevent people from buying stuff with your phone if it’s lost or stolen, since they won’t know the code. (And if they guess wrong five times in a row, the whole Wallet becomes unusable. You have to contact Google and explain yourself.) Of course, the four-digit pass code requirement also sucks most of the fun and convenience out of the whole phone-as-wallet concept. Tapping out the pass code on small keys on a not-always-responsive touch screen is a hassle, and not demonstrably faster than signing a regular credit card slip. Why can’t we disable that requirement according to our own paranoia levels? You can’t even pick an easy-to-type pass code to save yourself effort; Wallet won’t accept codes like 1234 or 1111. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.comPlenty of companies would love to get their hands on our wallets.

But if data gluttons are the only ones who partake of Sprint’s feast, unmetered service will be unsustainable. “The simplicity and peace of mind from unlimited services at one consistent price must attract mainstream users, not just outliers,” says Will Souder, Sprint’s vice president for pricing. Mr. Souder compares Sprint’s business to that of a pizzeria that offers an all-you-can-eat lunch. “If I come in and eat eight pieces, that needs to be balanced by my sister coming and eating at the salad bar,” he says. Three years ago, Sprint introduced its “Simply Everything” plan for $99.99 — covering, within the United States, unlimited voice calls, data and text messages. “When we launched, we had a lot of trepidation,” Mr. Souder says, “but we were pleasantly surprised with the number of relatively light users who were willing to pay more for this plan.” If Sprint Nextel’s financial results were showing a nicely profitable business, humming in the shadows of its much bigger rivals, Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T, customers who hate meters could rejoice. Unfortunately, the company has not posted annual net profits since 2006. Mr. Souder says the unlimited plans have not contributed to the losses, saying Sprint has had four consecutive quarters of growth in average revenue per user and has reversed a trend of losing customers. Sprint has been monitoring use patterns and costs, and in January it increased the price of “Everything” plans for newly activated smartphones by $10 a month. The move has helped the company keep its business on a healthy, sustainable foundation, Mr. Souder says. Sprint is behaving more like some carriers across the Atlantic. Smaller operators in Europe “tend to be more aggressive in pricing strategies” and are using unlimited data plans to differentiate their offerings from larger rivals, says Thomas Tschentscher, a partner at the international law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer who specializes in telecommunications. In the United States, T-Mobile sells “unlimited” plans, too, but it throttles back the download speeds when data use passes a certain threshold each month. Mr. Tschentscher says that in Europe, data throttling is all but absent. “Because of the interoperability of the handsets, customers in Europe can easily switch carriers,” he says. “So it would be a competitive disadvantage for a carrier to impose throttling down if the others don’t.” Sprint says its network hasn’t been swamped by too many users wanting to watch movies or television shows on Android phones. “Long-form video on the handset today is still in its infancy,” Mr. Souder says. Of course, tablets are a different matter — and that’s why Sprint has never extended unlimited data plans to them. Asked what happens when smartphone screens become larger and some tablet computers become smaller, blurring the boundaries between the two, Mr. Souder said Sprint would “constantly evaluate our pricing strategy.” Sprint’s network has accommodated the arrival of Android phones. The iPhone may come to Sprint next month, if rumors on tech blogs prove accurate. Mr. Souder declined to respond to questions about how his network could absorb a sharp spike in data use if Sprint — speaking only hypothetically, of course — were to add an unnamed, but very, very popular smartphone. Some independent analysts see nothing but difficulties ahead for Sprint. Craig E. Moffett, a vice president and senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, says scale is essential to this business and is the reason that the only profitable major carriers are AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless. Mr. Moffett notes that Sprint has $4 billion in debt that will soon mature. It is also the majority owner of Clearwire, whose half-built 4G network covers only half the United States population. To have 4G cover the next 40 percent of the population, spread across a much wider area, it will have to build eight times as much infrastructure as required for the first phase, he says, adding: “It can’t afford to abandon Clearwire but it can’t afford to finish it either.” If Sprint doesn’t complete the next-generation network, it won’t be able to keep unlimited data plans for long, Mr. Moffett says, because “the burden on the 3G network will be too great.” There are no signs that Sprint will pull back from unlimited data, at least for now. In fact, the company seems to be staking its identity on the appeal of all-you-can-eat pricing. It may even expand the concept further. Speaking at the Dive Into Mobile conference last December, Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint Nextel’s C.E.O., talked about the logical next step: including the phone, tablet, PC, e-reader and whatever in a single plan. The idea was mentioned merely as a possibility, and it was not clear whether it would be feasible to have unlimited data for multiple devices on one plan — the ultimate in simplicity. Sprint’s unmetered wireless business needs more customers to reach scale. Salad eaters who like one worry-free, all-you-can-eat price are especially welcome at the table.

Hesse, chief of Sprint Nextel, at a Senate hearing in May on the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T. 7:02 p.m. | Updated Only days after the Justice Department sued to block AT&amp;T’s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA, Sprint Nextel is following suit. The company said on Tuesday that it filed its own lawsuit in the United States District Court in Washington, echoing the Justice Department’s argument that allowing the deal to go through would significantly restrict the American cellphone service landscape. “AT&amp;T’s proposed takeover of T-Mobile is brazenly anticompetitive,” Sprint wrote in its complaint, adding that it would push the market “back toward a 1980s-style cellphone duopoly that would force consumers to endure higher prices and be denied the fruits of vigorous innovation.” It is the first of a potential string of lawsuits aimed at stopping the blockbuster telecommunications merger, though it would most likely be subordinate to the Obama administration’s case. AT&amp;T has said that it plans to fight the Justice Department, though it also plans to continue talks with the government in hopes of securing a settlement. And T-Mobile’s current owner, Deutsche Telekom, has also said it would take steps to ensure the merger goes through. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Sprint’s lawyers in the litigation are from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. They will be going up against Arnold &amp; Porter for AT&amp;T and Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton for T-Mobile. Sprint was one of the first and biggest opponents of the T-Mobile deal, having failed to buy the wireless carrier itself earlier this year. Its main argument is that putting the two companies together would cement AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless as the giants of cellphone service, leaving others even further behind and less equipped to compete. Sprint’s chief executive, Daniel Hesse, has been exceptionally vocal in listing reasons to oppose the deal. Should the merger go through, he said in a speech this year, “competition will be stifled, growth will be stifled, and wireless innovation will be jeopardized.” The company has also sought to combat many of AT&amp;T’s claims about the merger, including its job impact. After AT&amp;T announced that it would repatriate 5,000 call-center jobs and preserve some 25,000 existing positions if the deal goes through, Sprint commissioned its own study to rebut those assertions. Even without the deal, however, Sprint is facing its own challenges, including revamping its 4G wireless network. (A bit of trivia: Sprint’s lawsuit has been assigned to Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, the same judge overseeing the Justice Department’s action.)

Mr. King says that Sprint has arguably already lost to Verizon and AT&amp;T. Sprint itself has acknowledged the difficulties it faces when competing against companies whose scale will allow them to secure better deals on hardware. The company has also argued that the amount of spectrum that a combined AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would control would be anticompetitive. Other analysts are more optimistic about Sprint’s chances, as the company appears to be stemming the loss of subscribers after several years of serious erosion. Even so, its market share of subscribers on contracts dropped to 13 percent in 2010, down from 17 percent in 2008, according to Barclays Capital. The company reported a net loss of $847 million in the second quarter of this year. Sprint, which sells a number of smartphones using the Google Android operating system, is to a large degree pinning its hopes of attracting more customers on the phone that performed that magic for AT&amp;T and Verizon: the Apple iPhone. Analysts widely expect the two companies will reach an agreement. But the most pressing issue facing Sprint, the analysts say, is its need to build a fourth-generation, or 4G, wireless network. It would give Sprint customers a speedy wireless connection most suited to data-hungry smartphones. Because 4G offers service similar to home broadband Internet, wireless companies want to build out 4G networks as the way to provide data service to compete with established providers. And Sprint is falling behind and faces a daunting row of hurdles just to stay in the game. Data service is becoming increasingly important to a wireless industry that is experiencing declining revenue from voice traffic. Data charges will account for more than 41 percent of the revenue from contracted wireless subscribers in 2011, according to James Ratcliffe, an analyst at Barclays. That compares with less than 30 percent in 2009. Almost everyone who wants a cellphone already owns one, so the only way for wireless companies to add voice customers is to poach them from rivals. The number of people demanding data service, on the other hand, is growing as cellphone users embrace smartphones, so wireless companies can earn more from existing customers by persuading them to add larger data plans to their voice plans. Sprint has an advantage in this market because it continues to offer unlimited data plans, while AT&amp;T and Verizon have tiered plans. It could hold that advantage if it aggressively builds out a 4G network that is wider and better than its rival’s 4G networks. But it is not clear that will happen. The company is planning to set out a new strategy for its 4G network next month at its investor conference in New York, and declined to comment before then. All the options the company has at its disposal have flaws, according to experts. Sprint relies on awkward partnerships to secure the amount of spectrum it needs to build a new network. AT&amp;T and Verizon have largely been able to buy outright the spectrum they need. AT&amp;T has cited access to additional spectrum as a major reason it needs to acquire T-Mobile. For Sprint, which lacks the capital of its larger rivals, securing spectrum has been even more difficult. It has set out to patch together what it needs through collaborations. In 2008 it entered a partnership to acquire a large portion of Clearwire, a troubled wireless company that controls a large swath of spectrum. The two companies set out to build a 4G network in tandem, hoping to benefit from a significant head start. This allowed Sprint to market the country’s first 4G network, and it became the first wireless carrier to offer a 4G smartphone, the HTC Evo 4G, in June 2010. But the effort soon slowed, in no small part because of Clearwire’s tenuous financial situation. Verizon has since overtaken Sprint as the nation’s largest 4G provider. Verizon’s network is built on a technology called LTE, which is incompatible with the WiMax technology that Sprint’s network is based on. That presents Sprint with yet another problem because Verizon’s technology is becoming the industry standard. Sprint could soon have trouble persuading hardware manufacturers to build devices for its network. Sprint has said it will shift to LTE. But there will still be eight million to 10 million orphaned Sprint devices running on WiMax by the end of the year, according to Mr. Ratcliffe of Barclays. Sprint will have to support that technology for some time, which adds to its costs. Sprint’s solution is a deal it reached with LightSquared, a company that sells spectrum to niche carriers. LightSquared agreed to pay Sprint $9 billion to build a 4G network using its spectrum. But Sprint hit yet another barrier. Federal regulators are hesitant to allow the companies to use this spectrum because it interferes with GPS frequencies. Between Clearwire and LightSquared, Sprint should have the spectrum it needs to build its network, analysts say, but it is unclear how it will be able to make the investment to take advantage of this. There is speculation that Sprint will have to buy Clearwire outright, or assemble a consortium of other companies to help it do so. Another option would be a collaboration with cable companies that control spectrum and could be willing to work with Sprint. Charles S. Golvin, a telecom analyst at Forrester Research, thinks that Sprint’s best hope, whether or not the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger goes through, is to differentiate itself with unlimited data plans as it builds a reliable network. There is a certain marketing advantage to going against Goliath and saying, “We’re the little guys, we have to try harder,” Mr. Golvin said. “That sort of story could work for them.”If the Justice Department succeeds in blocking the $39 billion merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, the deepest sighs of relief may well come from the executives at Sprint Nextel, the country’s third-largest wireless carrier.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/reacting-to-justices-suit-against-att-deal/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Reacting to Justice's Suit Against AT&amp;T<date>August 31, 2011, 2:02 pm</date><text>Stephen Yang/Bloomberg NewsAn AT&amp;T store in Manhattan. As the biggest telecom deal in years, one that could reshape the American wireless landscape, AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA drew scores of supporters and critics alike. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links U.S. Moves to Block AT&amp;T Merger with T-Mobile Those backing the deal, including communications workers unions and lawmakers, echo AT&amp;T’s arguments that the merger would create jobs and expand the nation’s high-speed cellular networks. Opponents, including competitors like Sprint Nextel, consumer groups and other politicians, contend that the combination would hurt competition and lead to higher prices and fewer jobs. Now that the Justice Department has sued to block the deal, here’s what some of those parties have to say. (AT&amp;T’s biggest competitor, Verizon Communications, declined to comment.) Supporting the merger Communications Workers of America, the union that represents thousands of AT&amp;T workers: “The decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to seek to block the merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA is simply wrong. “In today’s sinking economy, where millions of Americans are looking for work, the DOJ has filed suit to block a merger that will create as many as 96,000 quality jobs. In the U.S., where too many Americans, especially in rural areas, don’t have access to the tools of Internet technology, the D.O.J. is looking to block a plan to build out high speed wireless access to 97 percent of the country. … “Instead of acting to block this merger, our government should be looking to support companies that create, keep and return good jobs to the United States.” Opposing the merger Sprint Nextel’s Vonya B. McCann, senior vice president of government affairs: “The D.O.J. today delivered a decisive victory for consumers, competition and our country. By filing suit to block AT&amp;T’s proposed takeover of T-Mobile, the D.O.J. has put consumers’ interests first. Sprint applauds the D.O.J. for conducting a careful and thorough review and for reaching a just decision – one which will ensure that consumers continue to reap the benefits of a competitive U.S. wireless industry. Contrary to AT&amp;T’s assertions, today’s action will preserve American jobs, strengthen the American economy, and encourage innovation.” Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin: “We applaud the Justice Department for their action to protect consumers in a powerful and growing industry that reaches virtually every American. Preserving choices means ensuring competition, and competition ultimately benefits consumers.” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota: “I have long believed that this merger would be a terrible deal for consumers, and I’m pleased the Department of Justice has taken the wise step of officially opposing it. I’ve heard from families across Minnesota that cell phone expenses are an ever-rising percentage of their bills each month, and this merger could make wireless bills increase by as much as 25 percent — a burden families certainly don’t need in this tough economy. This merger would also hurt competition and concentrate enormous power in the hands of just two companies-AT&amp;T and Verizon — who would control more than 80 percent of the wireless market. I’m glad the Justice Department recognizes that this merger would hurt consumers and I hope that the court will agree and block it from moving forward.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts: “The Justice Department’s decision to take action to block AT&amp;T’s purchase of T-Mobile is a victory for competition, consumers and choice. We should be protecting American consumers holding their cell phones, not just telecommunications titans holding stock in the companies. “The merger would reduce the number of national wireless companies from four down to three, sending the mobile marketplace into a telecommunications time machine back to 1993. That would be an historic mistake.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/u-s-moves-to-block-att-merger-with-t-mobile/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">U.S. Moves to Block AT&amp;T Merger with T-Mobile<date>August 31, 2011, 10:56 am</date><text>Stephen Crowley/The New York TimesJames M. Cole, the Justice Department’s deputy attorney general, said the merger would result in “higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products.” 5:13 p.m. | Updated The Justice Department on Wednesday sued to block AT&amp;T’s proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA, a deal that would create the largest carrier in the country and reshape the industry. “The department filed its lawsuit because we believe the combination of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products for their mobile wireless services,” James M. Cole, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference. AT&amp;T said it would “vigorously contest this matter in court.” The Justice Department’s complaint, which was filed in United States District Court in Washington, said that T-Mobile “places important competitive pressure on its three larger rivals, particularly in terms of pricing, a critically important aspect of competition.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The complaint Reacting to the Justice's Suit Against AT&amp;T Deal Sprint Shares Surge on AT&amp;T Setback The complaint also highlighted T-Mobile’s high speed network and its innovations in technology, noting that it was the first to use Google’s Android operating system and BlackBerry wireless e-mail, among other things. “AT&amp;T’s elimination of T-Mobile as an independent, low-priced rival would remove a significant competitive force from the market,” the complaint said. “Thus, unless this acquisition is enjoined, customers of mobile wireless telecommunications services likely will face higher prices, less product variety and innovation, and poorer quality services due to reduced incentives to invest than would exist absent the merger.” Shares of AT&amp;T ended the day down 3.9 percent. In trading in Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Telekom tumbled nearly 8 percent. &lt;br /&gt; The Justice Department has broad authority to influence proposed deals. In January, the U.S. sued Comcast for its proposed merger with NBC Universal; the case was settled at the same time with Comcast agreeing to some concessions. On rare occasions, the agency takes the more aggressive step of suing to block a deal altogether, as it did with AT&amp;T and earlier this year with H&amp;R Block’s bid for the owner of TaxAct tax-preparation software. Sometimes just the threat of legal action is enough to stymie a deal, as in May when Nasdaq and a partner dropped their rival bid for the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company. In other cases, the Justice Department will remain silent, blessing a deal by default. In a statement, AT&amp;T said: “We are surprised and disappointed by today’s action, particularly since we have met repeatedly with the Department of Justice and there was no indication from the D.O.J. that this action was being contemplated. “We plan to ask for an expedited hearing so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed. The D.O.J. has the burden of proving alleged anticompetitive affects and we intend to vigorously contest this matter in court.” That could mean a potentially lengthy court fight. Companies have triumphed over the Justice Department before, such as a federal judge sided with Oracle in its purchase of PeopleSoft in 2004. Yet there is still the chance that two sides could reach a settlement on the deal. In a news conference on Wednesday, Sharis A. Pozen, the acting assistant attorney general, indicated that a compromise was still a possibility, saying: “We apprised them of our serious concerns. And as any party can do, our door is open. If they want to resolve those concerns, we can certainly do that.” AT&amp;T also expects to enter in discussions about a possible solution, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. Indeed, AT&amp;T has one powerful incentive to try to salvage the deal. Under the terms of the agreement that AT&amp;T signed with Deutsche Telekom, AT&amp;T would pay a breakup fee of $3 billion in cash, as well as a roaming agreement and spectrum rights — an estimated total value of $6 billion — if the acquisition did not go through for regulatory reasons. AT&amp;T already has three high-priced law firms advising on the deal, including Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Arnold &amp; Porter and Crowell &amp; Moring. T-Mobile is receiving legal advice on the merger from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz; Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton; and Wiley Rein. Ever since AT&amp;T announced plans to buy T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion in March, the deal has proved controversial. Lawmakers, consumer advocates and rivals have voiced opposition to the merger, saying it would significantly reduce competition. The deal would have left just three major players: AT&amp;T, Verizon and the significantly smaller Sprint Nextel. The complaint also noted that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile currently compete head to head in 97 of the 100 biggest wireless markets in the country. “Sprint urges the United States government to block this anticompetitive acquisition,” Vonya McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president for government affairs, said back in March. “This transaction will harm consumers and harm competition at a time when this country can least afford it.” Shares of Sprint Nextel ended up nearly 6 percent on the day. Citigroup analysts said Sprint was “a potential beneficiary” of the antitrust action. Still, they said that AT&amp;T’s pursuit of T-Mobile was “a catalyst for eventual wireless consolidation in some form, either through the current proposed transaction or other merger scenarios that would likely form if the pending merger is not completed.” The Justice Department’s complaint noted that while there were smaller telecommunications providers, none of their voice networks “cover even one-third of the U.S. population, and the largest of these smaller carriers has less than one-third the number of wireless connections as T-Mobile.” On Wednesday, AT&amp;T said that “we remain confident that this merger is in the best interest of consumers and our country, and the facts will prevail in court.” The company repeated its arguments that a merger would “help solve our nation’s spectrum exhaust situation and improve wireless service for millions,” would expand 4G mobile broadband and would mean billions in additional investment and tens of thousands of jobs. Deutsche Telekom said it would join with AT&amp;T to defend the deal, saying in a statement that it was “very disappointed” by the Justice Department’s action. U.S. v.

At an industry conference in March, its chief executive, Dan Hesse, criticized the merger, fearing it would hurt consumers. A week later, Sprint formally objected to the deal and called on regulators to block the acquisition. “The wireless industry has sparked unprecedented levels of competition, innovation, job creation and investment for the American economy, all of which could be undone by this transaction,” Sprint said in a statement in late March. Sprint has reason to be concerned about the potential merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. If the deal went through, the merged company would have nearly 130 million subscribers, leaving Spring a distant No. 3 player with about 50 million customers. It has been a tough position for Sprint. Mr. Hesse has made some improvements during his tenure. He has invested in customer service and bolstered the product lineup, including signing an agreement to sell the iPhone 5, the next version of Apple‘s popular smartphone. Such moves have helped keep customers from switching to other carriers. But the company continues to struggle. In the quarter ended June 30, the company lost $847 million, compared with a loss of $760 million the period a year earlier.

Falcone faces big challenges with his wireless venture, LightSquared. 8:46 p.m. | Updated LightSquared, the wireless broadband venture controlled by the billionaire hedge fund manager Philip A. Falcone, has reached a 15-year agreement to jointly develop and operate a 4G network with Sprint Nextel, a reprieve for a company that has come under fire recently for its wireless ambitions. The roughly $15 billion deal would allow LightSquared to piggyback on Sprint’s network instead of having to build its own, according to a letter Mr. Falcone sent to investors in his hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners. For Sprint, the deal gives it a partner to bear the cost of an expensive build-out and gives it access to LightSquared’s high-speed wireless service. The exact terms of the deal are still unclear. Mr. Falcone has been under pressure on multiple fronts. Most recently, his company has been facing down concerns that its wireless venture will interfere with GPS signals, a condition that could pose problems for technologies as diverse as medical services and car systems. A report by LightSquared on the extent of the potential interference has been delayed until July 1, but the looming issue had raised questions about the viability of Mr. Falcone’s venture, which cannot move forward under its current plans until the conflict is resolved. A spokesman for Mr. Falcone declined to comment. Mr. Falcone, 48, rose to prominence in 2007 when his hedge fund placed a major bet against the subprime mortgage market that made him an instant billionaire. Known as a tough investor, Mr. Falcone built his reputation by buying up shares in troubled companies and finding creative ways to turn them around. But in recent years, Harbinger’s large ownership stake in LightSquared has frightened his investors. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Indeed, the wireless venture was the latest in a long line of actions that Mr. Falcone had taken that alienated Harbinger investors. His funds were down heavily during the financial crisis, and he refused to let clients pull out their money for fear of selling assets into a falling market. But during that same period, Mr. Falcone borrowed $113 million from one of his funds to pay a tax bill, prompting regulators to take a closer look at him and Harbinger. Problems have grown worse for Mr. Falcone since then, as investors have withdrawn their money in droves and the size of his bet in LightSquared has swelled. Mr. Falcone caught the attention of Washington lawmakers, who raised questions about why LightSquared was given a rare waiver by the Federal Communications Commission on the company’s operations. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, sent a letter to the F.C.C. requesting copies of all communications between the agency and Mr. Falcone and his companies. The confrontation with GPS users has been the most recent hurdle for Mr. Falcone’s grand ambition, which is to create a broadband provider to help relieve the country’s overloaded wireless networks. Some have raised questions about the viability of any deal struck between the company and Sprint, given the uncertainty over the GPS issue. Analysts figure that in addition to the GPS question, Mr. Falcone must raise billions of dollars more to pay for whatever deal he has worked out with Sprint to build the network they would share. LightSquared must also find customers and clean up some patches of its spectrum, or wireless capacity. The deal, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg News, includes an upfront cash payment to Sprint as well as caveats should the GPS issue prove damaging to LightSquared’s ambitions, according to a person who has been briefed on the terms.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/big-names-in-tech-back-atts-bid-for-t-mobile/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Big Names in Tech Back AT&amp;T's T-Mobile Bid<date>June 6, 2011, 11:00 pm</date><text>Alex Wong/Getty ImagesRandall Stephenson, the chief of AT&amp;T, during a Senate panel’s hearing in May, with Daniel Hesse, right, of Sprint Nexte. June 7, 1:07 p.m. | Updated with the letters In its quest to win approval of its $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, AT&amp;T just got a lot of help from its friends. Eight technology giants, including Facebook and Microsoft, and 10 venture capital firms, filed letters supporting the acquisition late on Monday. The letters, filed with the Federal Communications Commission, lent their support to AT&amp;T’s argument that the T-Mobile deal will help the company extend its next-generation data network across the country, helping to meet the growing need for wireless broadband services. “Many policy-related efforts will not be able to quickly address near-term capacity needs,” the Microsoft-led group wrote in its letter. “The F.C.C. must seriously weigh the benefits of this merger and approve it.” The letters are the latest salvo in the fight over AT&amp;T’s effort to become the nation’s biggest cellphone service provider. It is a fight that has pitted AT&amp;T against consumer groups and smaller rivals like Sprint Nextel. Sprint and other service providers have argued strenuously that the deal would revive the “Ma Bell” situation of old, leaving AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless in a duopoly that controls most cellphone customers. Such a combination could lead to higher prices and reduced service, they say. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The letters AT&amp;T's Deal for T-Mobile Sprint, the nation’s third-biggest carrier behind Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T, has been the most outspoken opponent of the deal. “I am here because Sprint believes in competition, which goes hand in hand with innovation,” the company’s chief executive, Daniel Hesse, testified at a Senate hearing last month. Both sides have been racing to enlist as many prominent supporters as possible. Sprint has found common cause with consumer groups, while AT&amp;T has lined up support from unions, particularly the Communications Workers of America. And both sides have sought political leaders to speak out. The outpouring of support is taking place within the confines of reviews by the F.C.C. and the Justice Department, which are aimed at determining if the deal is in the public’s interest and whether it harms competition. The process may take about a year. The deadline to file supporting comments for the deal is Friday, while the deadline to file opposing comments was last week. The letters filed Monday provide solid support for the deal from Silicon Valley. Other companies that have signed on are Yahoo, Oracle and the BlackBerry’s maker Research in Motion. The venture capital firms include Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Sequoia Partners. As smartphones and tablets proliferate, so too have apps like one by Facebook that draw in ever-rising amounts of data. Monday’s letters cite AT&amp;T’s contention that the T-Mobile deal will allow the carrier to expand its nascent 4G network to cover 97 percent of the country and an additional 55 million Americans. “The access aspect of this is so, so important,” Fred Humphries, Microsoft’s vice president for United States government affairs, said by telephone. “We quickly came to the conclusion that this is a good merger.” Promod Haque, a managing partner of Norwest Venture Partners, said in a telephone interview that constraints on network capacity were harming new mobile applications and offerings. “The lack of adequate spectrum is killing the quality of users’ experience,” he said. “Customers say, ‘I can’t even get a phone call and can’t get adequate reception. So you want me to use this new service?’ ” Allowing AT&amp;T to consolidate its network spectrum with T-Mobile’s is easier and more cost-effective than alternatives, Mr. Haque added. Microsoft approached “a select few” technology companies to support the deal, mostly those whose products would obviously also benefit from wider data pipelines, and received quick and positive replies, Mr. Humphries said. The software giant also contacted several trade associations to which it belongs, letting them know of the company’s position. While Microsoft and Research in Motion have signed the letter, other notable smartphone players whose offerings consume large amounts of data, like Apple, have not. Some of the signers said that while they had considered Sprint’s arguments that the deal would harm both competition and innovation, they disagreed. Jon Auerbach, a general partner at Charles River Ventures, pointed to smaller competitors like Leap Wireless and “virtual network operators” like Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile USA as alternatives for consumers. Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Haque also said that AT&amp;T had repeatedly shown a willingness to work with its portfolio companies. They argued that those business relationships showed a willingness by AT&amp;T to eschew existing technology in favor of new developments from unproven players. “When a large provider is willing to take a bet on something that may not have the best balance sheet in the world or a long track record, that goes a long way,” Mr. Auerbach said. “AT&amp;T really wants to know what’s next.” Update: Here are the four letters submitted to the F.C.C. One is from Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, Yahoo, Research in Motion, Qualcomm, Avaya and Brocade. The second is from Kleiner Perkins. The third is from Sequoia. And the fourth is from a group of eight venture capitalists, including Mr. Haque and Mr. Auerbach.

But Verizon’s start of the iPhone on Feb. 10 and AT&amp;T’s price cut on an older iPhone model did not leave Sprint completely unscathed. Sprint posted a net loss of 114,000 subscribers on contract-based plans, which are more lucrative. People deciding between smartphones on Sprint and Verizon seem to have been tipped toward Verizon by the new iPhone. But people who were already Sprint subscribers showed no inclination to abandon their contracts and move to Verizon. Sprint reported stronger loyalty among its contract subscribers than it had ever seen. The effect of the Verizon iPhone release on AT&amp;T’s quarterly results was similar. Sprint has reported losses in every quarter for almost four years. The period ended March 31 was no different, with a net loss of $439 million, or 15 cents a share. But that was down from a loss of $865 million, or 29 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago, and Sprint posted an operating profit for the first time since 2007. Revenue rose 3 percent to $8.3 billion, from $8.1 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected a larger loss of 22 cents a share, and lower revenue of $8.2 billion. The company has been holding the line on costs while subscriber trends have improved in part because of better customer service, a signature project of the chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse. In January, Sprint effectively raised prices by adding a $10-a-month fee for new smartphones. Mr. Hesse has said that Sprint, and the health of the wireless industry as a whole, is threatened by AT&amp;T’s $39 billion deal to buy T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest carrier. It would leave Sprint even further behind the top two carriers, AT&amp;T and Verizon. Speaking to analysts and investors on a conference call, Mr. Hesse said many of them probably welcomed the combination because it would lead to higher, more stable prices and thus better profits in the industry. But they should pay attention to what diminished competition would do, he said. Sprint’s push to develop a fourth-generation wireless data network (now part of its Clearwire subsidiary) pushed Verizon to develop its own 4G network, which in turn prompted AT&amp;T to speed up its plans, Mr. Hesse said.Sprint Nextel, the telecommunications company, said on Thursday that it added more wireless subscribers in the first quarter than it had in five years, mainly on cheap service plans, as its turnaround continued despite the new threat of Verizon’s iPhone.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/htcs-thunderbolt-is-as-fast-as-lightning/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">HTC's Thunderbolt Is as Fast as Lightning<date>March 30, 2011, 5:47 pm</date><text>Finally, a credible 4G phone. The term 4G has been conveniently applied to half-step measures that speed up phone networks, but the HTC Thunderbolt in tandem with Verizon’s LTE network finally provides the ripping speeds we have been promised. How fast is it? At my desk in Baltimore, without having to travel to any special location, downloads averaged 12.28 megabits per second, which is — by today’s standards — lightning fast. To compare, have a look at my test of the T-Mobile HSPA+ network, which it calls 4G and the Sprint WiMax network. When I drove my car to an “optimal location,” as directed by T-Mobile, the average download speed was 5.7 megabits per second. At that speed a two-hour movie would load in about 20 minutes. With the HTC EVO, Sprint’s WiMax 4G phone, I got an average speed of 3.7 megabits per second (Sprint said it should have been faster). The Thunderbolt has a 4.3 inch touch screen in a case that is slightly larger, thicker and heavier than I’ve come to expect from 3G phones. It comes with 8 gigabytes of memory built in and a 32-GB microSD card installed. The phone incorporates an 8-megapixel camera with a dual-LED flash and photo effects software as well as geotagging and face recognition features. It also has a front-facing camera for video chats. The operating system is Android 2.2, so it includes Flash, which means you can see a majority of Web content. And it has a mobile hot spot feature, so your computer can use it as a Wi-Fi hot spot to get to the Internet. It can play a variety of music formats, including MP3 and AAC, as well as supporting video. It even has a built-in FM radio. Like many Android phones, its ability to multitask means that it burns battery power at a prodigious rate, especially if you are downloading lots of data and using the features like the GPS. It is also a bit pricey, at $250 with a two-year Verizon contract. That contract will require a $30-a-month data package on top of voice and text. But that is the way of the world. Ask any sports car fan: the faster you want to go, the more you have to spend.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/sprint-formally-denounces-atts-deal-for-t-mobile/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Formally Denounces AT&amp;T's Deal for T-Mobile<date>March 28, 2011, 4:05 pm</date><text>Ramin Talaie/Bloomberg News Sprint Nextel formally announced its opposition to AT&amp;T‘s proposed $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA on Monday, saying that the deal would drastically cut down on cellphone service competition in the country. The announcement is aimed at stirring up opposition to the merger, which would again make AT&amp;T the biggest cellphone carrier in the United States. AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have acknowledged that they expect to face tough scrutiny from federal regulators over the next 12 months as they seek to close the deal. Sprint‘s decision was wholly unsurprising, given critical comments by the company’s chief executive, Daniel Hesse, at an industry conference last week. In its announcement, Sprint warned that allowing the merger to proceed would drastically cut competition among cellphone carriers, effectively handing control of the industry to AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless. The T-Mobile deal would refashion AT&amp;T into a new giant with nearly three times Sprint’s revenue, according to the statement. “Sprint urges the United States government to block this anti-competitive acquisition,” said Vonya McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president for government affairs. “This transaction will harm consumers and harm competition at a time when this country can least afford it.” Shares in Sprint have fallen more than 5.5 percent since AT&amp;T announced its deal last week, trading at $4.77 late on Monday afternoon.

Mead, chief executive officer of Verizon Wireless. 7:39 p.m. | Updated As AT&amp;T seeks to become the nation’s biggest cellphone service provider by buying T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, many eyes are now turned to the company that currently holds that title, Verizon Wireless. For now, it appears that Verizon’s strategy is simple: Do nothing drastic. With 101.1 million customers, Verizon Wireless already holds considerable market share, and its network is regularly praised by subscribers and analysts alike for its strength and broad reach. Even if the T-Mobile deal is approved sometime in the next 12 months, vaulting AT&amp;T to the top of the industry, analysts say that Verizon is well-positioned for at least the short term. “I don’t think they need to do anything right now except stay focused on their core message and superior experience,” Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research, said in a telephone interview. While rivals — specifically Sprint Wireless, already in third place and facing the prospect of falling further behind — plan to lobby against the merger, Verizon has so far adopted a nonchalant attitude. Its chief executive, Daniel S. Mead, has signaled that he will not oppose the AT&amp;T merger as it begins a yearlong process of tough antitrust approval. When asked at a wireless industry conference if the company would be interested in a potential deal for Sprint as a counter to AT&amp;T’s deal, Mr. Mead was terse in his dismissal. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “We’re not interested in Sprint,” he said on Monday evening, according to Reuters. “We don’t need them.” While Verizon would most likely be unable to pursue a deal for Sprint in any case, and especially not if AT&amp;T’s T-Mobile deal is approved, Mr. Golvin of Forrester said that Verizon could still look at smaller acquisitions to buy additional wireless bandwidth, known as spectrum. Among the potential candidates are smaller carriers like MetroPCS or Leap Wireless, though any deal for either would probably be far off in the future. Unlike AT&amp;T, which has said that its deal for T-Mobile was in large part an effort to gain extra bandwidth for next-generation data services, Verizon already has plenty of spectrum. The carrier recently introduced its newest mobile broadband network, based on a standard called LTE, while AT&amp;T will not have until this summer. Verizon could also benefit from its biggest competitor being distracted by the huge effort needed to win approval for its deal, let alone the even more intensive effort of meshing AT&amp;T’s operations with T-Mobile’s. AT&amp;T will also most likely be forced to divest parts of its business to satisfy government regulators. Verizon’s business is also among the healthiest among the major carriers, having generated $16.1 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $63.4 billion for all of last year. The company also lays claim to the lowest rate of customer defections, or churn, among the big four carriers at 1.34 percent. By contrast, Sprint has 49.9 million subscribers and lost $3.5 billion last year. Verizon also has other strong advantages over its rivals. It has a robust selection of attractive smartphones, including those using Google’s Android system, and most recently, the Apple iPhone.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4D6123AF932A15750C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=sprintnextelcorporation">AT&amp;T Makes Deal To Buy T-Mobile For $39 Billion<date>Published: March 21, 2011</date><text>12:16 a.m. | Updated AT&amp;T announced on Sunday that it had agreed to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion, in a deal that would create the largest carrier in the nation and promised to reshape the industry. The transaction - one of the largest since the onset of the financial crisis - is expected to start a fierce battle in Washington as regulators scrutinize the impact of the deal on competition and consumers. The deal would leave just three major cellular companies in the country: AT&amp;T, Verizon and the much smaller Sprint Nextel. Some critics denounced the merger within hours of its announcement, saying it would most likely lead to higher prices. T-Mobile had offered some of the lowest rates in the country, keeping pressure on competitors. While AT&amp;T is expected to honor current contracts, T-Mobile customers may have to pay higher rates once those contracts expire. Still, AT&amp;T pointed on Sunday to a recent report from the federal Government Accountability Office that said cellular subscription costs fell 50 percent from 1999 and 2009, a period in which the industry has consolidated. ''Consumers have borne the brunt of the increasingly concentrated market for mobile phone service,'' Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumers rights, said in a statement. ''The explosion of cellphone usage - especially smartphones - makes competition in this market more important than ever as a check on prices, consumer choice and service.'' AT&amp;T customers, though, could benefit in one notable area: service. Both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile operate on the same technology, known as GSM, so the combination should provide better coverage. That has been a sore point for AT&amp;T, which has been ridiculed over dropped calls and slow data services, especially on Apple's iPhone. ''The carriers' network technology fits nicely together so AT&amp;T could redeploy some of T-Mobile's spectrum in short order, helping relieve some of the pressures on its network,'' said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. The acquisition would give AT&amp;T additional leverage against its main rival, Verizon. The newly combined company - bringing together AT&amp;T's 95.5 million wireless subscribers with T-Mobile's 33.7 million customers - would account for roughly 42 percent of all wireless subscribers in the United States. Verizon has around 31 percent, said Charles Golvin, a telecom analyst at Forrester Research. T-Mobile customers would have the option to buy an iPhone, helping AT&amp;T combat the migration of the popular device to Verizon. The deal would also provide significant cost savings, roughly $3 billion a year for the new company. Those savings, however, could have a huge effect on both the local and national economy, from real estate to media. The combined company is expected to close hundreds of retail outlets in areas where they overlap, as well as eliminate overlapping back office, technical and call center staff. It may also slash advertising spending. Last year, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile spent $2.7 billion combined on advertising, according to Kantar Media. ''From AT&amp;T's perspective, this is a huge win,'' said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. ''It's about being No. 1 and having economy of scale.'' Scale will be critical as AT&amp;T continues its aggressive rollout of the next generation wireless network, known as 4G. The carrier has been slower than rivals to deploy the 4G technology, LTE, than competitors. T-Mobile does not have a 4G technology in place. Meanwhile, Verizon has already started to sell LTE-enabled devices. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Verizon announced at least a dozen new smartphones and tablet computers that will be compatible with the technology. Deutsche Telekom had been weighing options for T-Mobile for more than a year. It had considered an initial public offering for the company, but shelved the plans. More recently, Deutsche Telekom had held talks about selling the unit to Sprint.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/telecom-union-backs-t-mobile-deal/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Telecom Union Backs T-Mobile Deal<date>March 20, 2011, 8:35 pm</date><text>8:53 p.m. | Updated Combining two companies with significant overlap usually leads to howls of protest by employees facing potential job cuts. But in the case of AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile, the two cellphone service providers have a somewhat unusual supporter: the Communications Workers of America. By securing the backing of a prominent union, one with more than 700,000 members, AT&amp;T appears to be shoring up important political backing as it prepares for tough regulatory scrutiny. In a press release issued on Sunday, the C.W.A. talked up the benefits of the merger, primarily its aim to expand next-generation wireless service to 95 percent of the country. The union has already focused on building out the nation’s broadband wireless network as an important driver of job growth, having rolled out an initiative called Speed Matters. “For more than a decade, the United States has continued to drop behind nearly every other developed economy on broadband speed and build out,” Larry Cohen, the C.W.A.’s president, said in a statement. “Today’s announcement of the acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&amp;T is a victory for broadband proponents in both the U.S. and Germany.” The C.W.A. will also have the chance to expand an ongoing effort to unionize T-Mobile USA workers. The group has already partnered with Germany’s ver.di union to create a new group, TU, to represent T-Mobile employees on both sides of the Atlantic. “Hundreds of TU members in the U.S. will welcome this news since of all the possible partners, AT&amp;T will mean better employment security and a management record of full neutrality toward union membership and a bargaining voice,” Mr. Cohen said in his statement. “For T-Mobile USA workers who want a voice in their workplace, this acquisition can provide a fresh start with T-Mobile management.” In some ways, the C.W.A.’s support of the deal comes as no surprise. The union generally enjoys a good working relationship with AT&amp;T, representing some 42,000 of the company’s wireless service employees. It also represents a fraction of Verizon Wireless workers. Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the C.W.A., told DealBook that AT&amp;T had already completed about 20 smaller deals, which led to the creation of jobs. Those transactions also offered workers the choice of union representation and collective bargaining rights. By contrast, C.W.A. has clashed with other wireless companies, arguing that they contract out much of their work. Among these is Sprint Nextel, which also sought a deal with T-Mobile. Still, there’s at least one prominent group that has come out against the deal: Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. “From a consumer’s perspective, it’s difficult to come up with any justification or benefits from letting AT&amp;T swallow up one of its few major competitors,” the group’s policy counsel, Parul P. Desai, said in a statement. She added, “We plan to work very closely with regulators and lawmakers to carefully scrutinize this deal and what it would mean to people’s pocketbooks.” Here’s the full statement from the C.W.A.’s Mr. Cohen: For more than a decade, the United States has continued to drop behind nearly every other developed economy on broadband speed and build out. The Federal Communications Commission sounded the alarm more than a year ago with its broadband report, and President Obama in his State of the Union address called for increased efforts to bring the U.S. back to global parity as a key stimulus for economic development. Today’s announcement of the acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&amp;T is a victory for broadband proponents in both the U.S. and Germany. For the U.S., it means that T-Mobile customers will get quick access to the AT&amp;T network, soon to include LTE or data speeds of at least 10 megabits down stream. More important, as part of the deal, AT&amp;T is committing to build out to nearly every part of the U.S. within six years. Both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile use GSM technology so there will be the immediate benefit of shared spectrum. Other reported deals involving T-Mobile would have joined incompatible networks; not only would that have forced a rebuild but would have required new phones for T- Mobile customers. In Germany, the cash deal will provide investment in parent Deutsche Telekom’s own fiber network, particularly important for D.T.’s principal owner, the German government. CWA and ver.di, the largest union in Germany, have partnered to support T-Mobile workers in the U.S., and the global union movement has been a strong supporter of this effort. CWA and ver.di formed a joint union – TU – that represents T-Mobile workers on both sides of the Atlantic. Hundreds of TU members in the U.S. will welcome this news since of all the possible partners, AT&amp;T will mean better employment security and a management record of full neutrality toward union membership and a bargaining voice. For T-Mobile USA workers who want a voice in their workplace, this acquisition can provide a fresh start with T-Mobile management. Some 42,000 ATT mobility employees are union represented. As with any merger or acquisition involving large entities, oversight issues will be raised. We ask all those involved to balance the inquiry with adequate weight for broadband speed and build out, and employment and workers rights.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/technology/11sprint.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Adds Subscribers for First Time in 3 Years<date>Published: February 10, 2011</date><text>Sprint Nextel on Thursday reported better-than-expected subscriber additions in the fourth quarter, adding customers for the first time in more than three years.The company’s shares were up 3.9 percent after its results showed that it added 58,000 subscribers in the quarter. That was more than three times the 17,000 customer additions that eight analysts contacted by Reuters expected on average. While the number was tiny compared with growth at bigger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T, it was a milestone for Sprint, which last reported contract customer growth in the second quarter of 2007. AT&amp;T, meanwhile, which is looking to counter its loss of exclusive rights in the United States to the iPhone, introduced a service on Wednesday allowing unlimited phone calls to any mobile phone, an option that has helped Sprint win customers. Analysts expect Sprint to revert to a subscriber loss this quarter, particularly with Verizon now selling the iPhone. Christopher Larsen, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, said rumors about the new iPhone might have helped Sprint’s customer cancellations, or churn, in the fourth quarter if consumers were waiting to go to Verizon. “Churn may have been artificially low, industry wide, in the fourth quarter as people waited,” Larsen said. Sprint’s chief executive, Dan Hesse, said growth would be hurt this quarter by the Verizon iPhone as well as the typical postholiday season sales dip. But he said Sprint would still improve over last year. “If you compare the first quarter versus the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter to the second quarter of 2010, you’d expect to see continued improvements,” he said. Mr. Hesse cautioned that Sprint still had a lot of work to do. “I’m not declaring mission accomplished yet, far from it,” he said in a conference call with analysts. Sprint could potentially add the iPhone to its own device lineup, but Mr. Hesse declined to comment on any talks with Apple. Sprint also faces tough competition in high-speed wireless services. It was the first American operator to sell phones supporting high-speed wireless services based on the latest technology standards. Verizon plans to introduce high-speed phones in coming months. Sprint’s high-speed wireless service depends on the Clearwire network. While Sprint, which owns 54 percent of Clearwire, and Clearwire have been bickering over the wholesale rates, Mr. Hesse told analysts the companies were having “good discussions.” Sprint’s loss narrowed to $929 million, or 31 cents a share, from $980 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose more than 5 percent to $8.3 billion, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $8.15 billion, according the Thomson Reuters. In comparison with Sprint’s rise in net subscribers, Verizon Wireless had 872,000 in the fourth quarter while AT&amp;T had 400,000. Sprint said 2011 capital spending would be about $3 billion, up from its previous target for $2.5 billion as a result of a network modernization project it is starting this year. Sprint shares closed up 25 cents, or almost 6 percent, to $4.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.Sprint Nextel on Thursday reported better-than-expected subscriber additions in the fourth quarter, adding customers for the first time in more than three years.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/sprint-wants-to-tell-your-phone-whether-youre-really-exercising/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Will Know Whether You're Really Exercising<date>January 3, 2011, 7:00 am</date><text>This year, your phone will know whether you’re jogging as much as you said you would. Sprint will show off a series of new fitness-related apps at the Consumer Electronics Show. BodyMedia, a company that makes fitness monitoring equipment, and Sprint, the wireless carrier, will announce on Monday a plan to use Sprint’s wireless network to continuously send information about activity levels, sleep patterns and other vitals from BodyMedia armbands to Sprint phones. At the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas this week, Sprint will show off a series of apps for its Android-based phones that will allow users to crunch this constant stream of data to create workouts, set goals and monitor progress. The BodyMedia armband is designed to be worn throughout the day, where it measures things like how many steps you take, how long you are physically active each day, and how efficiently you sleep. The device will now automatically transmit this information directly to a phone. The apps are free, although BodyMedia’s armbands come with subscription fees. Pricing has not been announced. Many people have already been seduced by technology’s ability to help them analyze their activities with relentless precision. Fitness-minded data-collectors have no shortage of ways to use their phones as workout partners. Many apps offer collections of exercises to base a routine on, or menus to craft a diet. Other apps use a phone’s GPS or accelerometer to monitor running pace or sleeping patterns. There are also a growing number of devices that use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to transmit information to a phone. Adidas and Nike make devices that communicate with phones. BodyMedia’s existing armbands have the ability to communicate with phones via Bluetooth, which allows a user to connect the device to a smartphone in order to send the data into an app. But Christine Robins, the chief executive of BodyMedia, described Bluetooth as only “first baby steps” when compared to a constant connection to a wireless network. Instead of the short-range access of Bluetooth, a wireless network allows for essentially unlimited range, so the connected armband can continue to send information to a phone that is nowhere near it. The wireless connection also allows for data to flow into a phone automatically and continually, which is useful for a device whose purpose is to monitor what is happening not only when you are exercising, but also when you are not. Many people believe that devices which constantly monitor health indicators and transmit them to doctors will play an increasing role in health care. Sprint already uses its wireless network to allow doctors to monitor patients’ vital signs; this is the first time it is working to give consumers themselves such data. For wireless companies, such connected devices hold the promise of new revenue streams, allowing them to lessen their reliance on cellphones alone. Sprint has said that it plans to head further in this direction with its 4G network. Which probably means that the number of gadgets constantly talking to our phones is bound to increase.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/nyregion/13taxitv.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Taxi TV Screens Gain Ad Business in New York<date>Published: December 12, 2010</date><text>Take a taxi through the East Village this week, and there is a good chance that a commercial for the Blue Man Group — playing nearby on Astor Place — will pop up on the miniature television facing the back seat.It would not be a coincidence: the theater troupe is one of the advertisers using the GPS devices in cabs to pinpoint when and where its commercials should play. Once dismissed as a moving billboard dominated by advertising for strip clubs and beer, the yellow cab (and its backseat screen) is emerging as an unlikely vehicle for marketing techniques more common to the Internet than to a beat-up Crown Victoria. The number of advertisers — including national brands like AOL, Citibank and Sprint — has doubled since last year, with cabs featuring everything from commercials for Broadway shows to a political advocacy campaign by Human Rights Watch. The advantages for marketers are clear: captive viewers, affluent consumers and 13,000 locations across New York City — although it may be hard to find one outside Manhattan. Still, many passengers profess to hate the screens, deeming them squawking irritants. But the impulse to hit the off button may be a myth: the televisions stay on 85 percent of the time that cabs have passengers inside, according to data that the screens’ operators have provided to the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Such statistics have helped persuade skeptical businesses to embrace a medium that got its start in 2007, when New York became the first major city to require that cabs have televisions. “When they first approached me, I said, ‘You have got to be kidding me,’ ” said Joe Barron, the owner of Definitions, a high-end Manhattan fitness chain that has advertised in taxis since last winter. Mr. Barron assumed that passengers would simply shut off the screens or ignore them, until he ran a test campaign and found his phone ringing with clients. He has renewed his account six times since then, he said, and he is prepared to spend half a million dollars next year on taxi commercials, at the expense of advertising on the Internet or in magazines. “Even if they are not watching the entire ad, they see our name up there,” Mr. Barron said. “They see our brand. They know we’re out there.” Agencies are looking to expand taxi advertising into markets like Boston, Chicago and Miami. In New York, taxi passengers are shown a mix of news, weather and light cultural fare on a single channel provided by either WABC or WNBC. Next year, the city plans to add a second channel of government-produced programming, including shows like “$9.99” and “NYC4Free,” which point viewers to inexpensive goings-on in the city. The second channel is intended to provide passengers with a greater range of entertainment options, city officials said. “With two channels, there’s a better chance for content you’re happy with,” said David S. Yassky, the taxi and limousine commissioner. But the new channel will not add to the city’s coffers: New York receives none of the advertising revenue from taxicabs. The profits are split between the sales agency and the channels that provide programming. In some cases, cab owners receive a cut, although drivers almost invariably do not. It remains difficult to track sales of taxi-screen advertising. The agencies that oversee the sales would not release specific revenue figures, and industry observers like the Nielsen Company do not keep detailed statistics on the emerging field. But VeriFone Media Solutions, which handles advertising sales for about 12,000 yellow cabs — nearly the entire fleet — said its revenue was up 60 percent in the past year. In November, the company had 105 active campaigns, compared with 67 a year ago. About two-thirds of its sales are from national brands, with a heavy concentration in financial services, fashion and retail companies, and tie-ins to films and television shows. “Like anything, people had to get used to it,” said Chris Polos, the company’s vice president of sales and marketing. To lure advertisers, agencies promote taxis as a closed, uncluttered environment that allows for direct engagement with an audience. “Taxi riders are young, educated and upscale,” reads a promotional pamphlet sent to potential clients by WABC, which provides programming for about half of the city’s taxicabs. The pamphlet claims that taxi passengers skew slightly female and that nearly half earn more than $100,000 a year. A 30-second advertisement running in half of the city’s taxi fleet could be seen more than 200,000 times a day — at a weekly cost of about $20,000. The city is finalizing a two-year contract extension with Creative Mobile Technologies and VeriFone Systems, the vendors that install and operate the screens, and the revenue arrangement is not expected to change. (VeriFone Systems is the corporate parent of VeriFone Media Solutions.) Taxicab owners must pay fees to the vendors in exchange for providing the screens, which also allow passengers to pay by credit card. Since owners must enter into individual contracts with the vendors, some have arranged for a cut of the advertising revenue, although this is not common across the industry. Mr. Yassky, the taxi commissioner, said the televisions improved the quality of the taxi experience for passengers. There have been other benefits, too: the ability to pay by credit card, for example, has been credited with a rise in ridership despite the recession. Mr. Yassky said that in lieu of demanding advertising revenue, the city hoped that the additional income for vendors might encourage them to lower the fees they charge to cab owners, which could in turn reduce the pressure to increase fares. “I don’t think advertising is so much an opportunity for city revenue,” he said, “so much as an opportunity to keep fares down.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/sprint-gets-an-iphonesort-of/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Gets an iPhone, Sort Of<date>November 10, 2010, 7:42 pm</date><text>Update: Added calculations regarding the amount of data per minute was used when placing an VoIP call. Thanks to the wonder that is Voice over Internet Protocol, better known as VoIP, people have long been able to make phone calls from computers or, say, an iPod Touch. But a new iPhone case with a built-in 3G-to-Wi-Fi hot spot comes closest yet to turning an iPod Touch into a real phone. The case, called the ZTE Peel, wraps around a second- or third-generation iPod Touch to connect it to Sprint’s 3G data service. That means that by using a VoIP application, you can make phone calls on the move just as you can from a mobile phone. You can also use it to connect a fourth-generation iPod Touch to the Internet just by having the Wi-Fi hot spot case nearby, but it will not snugly fit the fourth-generation Touch. Two devices can connect to the Peel at a time, so you can also use it to connect a Windows or Macintosh computer to the Internet at the same time you are using your faux phone. The Peel, which becomes available on Sunday, will retail for $80 through Sprint online. It will also require a $30 monthly service plan, which allows for 1 GB of data. That is about the equivalent of one hour of YouTube streaming, 250 Facebook uploads or 5,000 one-page e-mails. When AT&amp;T offered tiered data packages last June, Skype estimated that one minute of VoIP over 3G would use about 0.345 MB of data. So according to Skype, 1 GB of data should be about 2900 minutes of VoIP voice calls. That’s for a $30 a month fee. If the Peel works as promised … bargain! Whether or not it’s as good a deal as buying an iPhone depends on whether you already have an iPod or not. A 32 GB iPod Touch costs $299, the same as the 32 GB iPhone 4. Comparing the cost of plans with the iPhone 4, still available only through AT&amp;T, you would have to have a voice plan the costs $40 to $70 a month, a data plan that costs $15 to $45 a month, and there’s an optional messaging plan that costs $5 to $20 a month. The low total would be $55 a month for talk and data with no texting. The Peel-iPod-Sprint plan combo is less expensive, but until we know how much talk you get, it’s premature to call it a bargain. If you need a phone, I suspect you’ll still be better off with the proper iPhone. I’ll know more after testing the Peel in a week or so. If you just want to add a phonelike feature at a moderate price, the Peel might appeal.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/technology/28sprint.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Nextel’s Third-Quarter Revenue Was Up<date>Published: October 27, 2010</date><text>The Sprint Nextel Corporation reported Wednesday that its quarterly revenue increased for the first time in three years, as improvements in Sprint-branded and prepaid service offset the continued flight of subscribers. But its net loss widened compared with a year ago, when a large tax benefit lifted results. The company, based in Overland Park, Kan., gained a net 644,000 subscribers in the quarter, compared with a loss of 545,000 in the period a year ago. It ended September with 48.8 million subscribers. Its quarterly loss was $911 million, or 30 cents a share. It lost $478 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 1 percent, to $8.15 billion, from $8.04 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a smaller loss of 28 cents a share on lower revenue of $8.04 billion. Sprint continued to lose subscribers on contract-based plans, which are the most lucrative, because of the decline of Nextel. Its phones with walkie-talkie functions have been popular with work crews and other professionals, but the Nextel network is poorly suited to smartphones, and the core Nextel base is eroding. Sprint compensated for the loss of contract-signing customers by adding people on prepaid plans, which cost less. In recent years, Sprint made a push to use excess capacity on the Nextel network for cheap unlimited-calling plans under its Boost Mobile brand. But even that effort is flagging and new prepaid subscribers are being put on the Sprint network instead. The company has started talking about converting some of the Nextel spectrum  to Sprint use. The burden of operating two incompatible wireless networks has weighed heavily on Sprint since the 2005 acquisition of Nextel Communications, widely hailed as one of the most disastrous deals in the telecommunications industry. In the fourth quarter, Sprint said, it expects to continue to gain subscribers.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/technology/26telecom.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Huawei Technologies of China’s Bold Push Into U.S.<date>Published: October 25, 2010</date><text>SANTA CLARA, Calif. — This spring, an executive from a Chinese telecommunications equipment company made an intriguing job offer to a Silicon Valley software engineer. The Chinese company, Huawei Technologies, wanted to get into the booming market for Internet-based computing, and it had just moved its United States research headquarters here to capture some of the best local talent.“How many engineers would you like for your team? Several hundred? That’s not a problem,” the recruiter said, according to the engineer. When the software manager turned down the offer, the Chinese executive was undeterred and asked for the name of the engineer working under him. The exchange underscores Huawei’s bold entrance onto the world’s technology stage. In the span of a decade, it has gone from imitating others’ products to taking on international rivals with its own innovative computing and communications gear. But Huawei has largely been locked out of the United States — until now. Sprint Nextel, the nation’s third-largest wireless carrier, is preparing to make a decision on buying $3 billion in advanced wireless equipment, and Huawei is considered to be a front-runner for the deal. Huawei is one of many Chinese companies that are pushing into more sophisticated and lucrative businesses. But security concerns make telecommunications a particularly delicate industry in this country, and even the hint of a Huawei deal with Sprint has generated worries in Washington. Some in Congress and the national security establishment fear that Huawei’s close ties to the Chinese military might allow China to tamper with American communications gear. Last week, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and three other members of Congress wrote a letter to Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, raising the specter that an equipment sale might permit the Chinese government to manipulate parts of the communications network, making it possible to disrupt or intercept phone calls and Internet messages. Anticipating these hurdles, Huawei has hired a remarkable array of Washington lobbyists, lawyers, consultants and public relations firms to help it win business in the United States. It has also helped create Amerilink Telecom, an American distributor of Huawei products whose high-powered board includes former Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the former World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn and the one-time chief executive of Nortel Networks, William A. Owens. Amerilink executives say they are primarily interested in helping Huawei overcome objections that its entry into the American market could jeopardize national security. “We take the accusations very seriously,” said Kevin Packingham, who recently left Sprint to become chief executive of Amerilink. “But regardless of the accusations, we have a model in place that ensures the security” of the network should Huawei win American contracts, he said. The effort is beginning to pay off. This fall, the American Internet communications firm Clearwire will begin testing a system based on Huawei’s 4G, or fourth-generation, network technology. The Sprint contract would be Huawei’s largest American deal by far. A Sprint spokesman, Scott Sloat, declined to discuss any potential deal. Sprint bought its last round of network equipment from Motorola, Nortel Networks and Lucent, now part of Alcatel-Lucent. Huawei’s American drive is significant because it is China’s first truly home-grown multinational corporation. And some analysts say they believe its spectacular rise will serve as a model for other Chinese companies seeking to compete internationally. Huawei is now the world’s second-largest telecom equipment supplier behind Ericsson of Sweden, and with Chinese government backing, it has sewn up major deals in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In Europe, Huawei has outmaneuvered Ericsson to supply equipment to big carriers. Despite those successes, Huawei has struggled to break into the United States market, largely because of the security concerns and accusations of intellectual property theft and corporate espionage. The company has repeatedly been linked to the People’s Liberation Army of China. And over the last decade, Huawei has been sued in the United States by two of its major competitors, Cisco Systems and Motorola, over accusations that it stole software designs and infringed on patents. Cisco settled its suit with Huawei soon after filing it. But in court documents filed in a lawsuit last summer, Motorola claimed that a group of Chinese-born Motorola engineers developed contacts with Huawei’s founder and then, between about 2003 and 2007, conspired to steal technology from Motorola by way of a dummy corporation they had set up outside the company. The national security issue has been bubbling up for some time. In a letter in August, a group of Republican senators wrote to the heads of four federal agencies asking questions about the risks of Huawei’s entering a deal with Sprint, whose customers include the United States military and law enforcement agencies.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04EFDE1E31F932A15753C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=sprintnextelcorporation">GADGETWISE; Secondhand Phones That Look Like New<date>Published: October 21, 2010</date><text>In the car industry, the preferred term for ''used'' is ''certified pre-owned.'' It would appear the term is becoming popular in the phone industry as well. Here's the lay of the land. Sprint has announced a new program that will sell previously owned phones at a deep discount. The inaugural deal offers a BlackBerry Tour for $80, a Samsung Reclaim for $50, or a Sanyo 2700 for $50. The Sprint refurbs carry a 30-day warranty, compared with one year for the same phone new. Also like new phones, refurbs come in a box with all of the accessories and manuals. What distinguishes Sprint's program from other existing used-phone programs at other carriers is its flexibility. People who buy a refurb phone do not have to extend their contract and retain their seniority for getting an upgrade - Sprint doesn't reset the meter on either of these things. Compare this with AT&amp;T's plan, which sells refurbished iPhones, for example, for as low as $50 (there are 20 other handsets available). Thing is, while the iPhone may be used, the contract that comes with it is brand spankin' new, adding years to your arranged marriage with the carrier. AT&amp;T says it will, from time to time, sell a customer a refurb phone to replace a damaged one, like Sprint, but that is done on a case-by-case basis. Verizon has more than 15 models of refurbished phones available to people who are upgrade-eligible. Customers are eligible for an early upgrade after 13 months, and there is a $20 upgrade fee on top of the cost of the phone. The phones range from a Droid X at $150 to the BlackBerry Curve 8530, which can be had for the upgrade fee alone. The phones have a one-year warranty, the same as a new phone. This is not to be confused with a second Verizon program for people with lost, stolen or damaged phones that are not under warranty. There are 40 models of refurbished phones available as replacements. Customers can take advantage of that program once a year. T-Mobile offers seven models of refurbished phones. It sells them in two price levels, just like new phones. If you buy one with a two-year contract, the phone price is lower, but your monthly minutes cost more. Or you can pay for the phone up front and get a cheaper rate which is paid month-to-month with no long-term contract. For example, a new MyTouch 3G Slide is $430 new without a contract, or $300 refurbished without a contract. With a two-year contract, a new MyTouch 3G Slide is $180, while a refurbished one is $50. The phones come with a 90-day warranty. If you have lost or damaged your phone, another option is to buy a replacement on eBay, as a friend of mine did. He replaced a broken phone for $40, but of course, the phone has no warranty. Checking eBay, I found that many of phones cost less refurbished than the price they brought at auction. I suppose it's just a matter of time before a phone salesman offers a sweet deal on a slightly used Motorola, owned by a little old lady who only spoke to her family on Sundays. If you have a different strategy for upgrading or replacing a missing phone, I'd love to hear about it. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Sprint said the resignations were only to comply with new developments in antitrust laws on director independence and were unrelated to any negotiations Clearwire might be having with potential investors. But the news sent shares of Clearwire up 3 percent as investors bet the resignations would make it easier for Clearwire to do a deal with a company such as Sprint’s rival T-Mobile USA, a venture of Deutsche Telekom. The companies said on Thursday that Dan Hesse, chief executive of Sprint, Clearwire’s majority owner, resigned from the venture’s board on Sept 28 along with Sprint’s strategy chief Keith Cowan and top networks executive Steven Elfman. Reuters continued: The move comes after Clearwire, which needs new funding to continue expanding a network it is building, said last week it was in talks with T-Mobile USA about a potential deal in which the No. 4 US mobile service could invest in Clearwire to rent space on its network at discount rates. “People are interpreting this as paving the way for some kind of additional negotiations with T-Mobile USA, which has been talking to Clearwire and Lightsquared about its 4G wireless strategy,” Watts said. Lightsquared is a private company that is setting itself up as a Clearwire rival. T-Mobile spokesman Andreas Fuchs confirmed T-Mobile USA is looking at different options and that Clearwire was one of them. Clearwire declined comment on speculation related to the resignations but said the decision was made to address legal questions that had originally been raised by Clearwire. The news comes amid speculation about tensions over strategy between Sprint and Clearwire, whose investors include cable providers such as Comcast, and technology companies Intel Corp and Google.

This one, the Epic from Sprint, sports two significant differences from others in the family. While it still has the bright, detailed AMOLED screen and great battery life of the other Galaxy phones, it adds a spacious slideout keyboard and works on the speedy 4G WiMax network. The phone includes all the features of the other Galaxies: the Android operating system, a fast 1 GHz Hummingbird processor, a 5-megapixel still and video camera with LED flash, 1 gigabyte of onboard memory and a slot for additional 32 gigabytes on a memory card. The phone weighs noticeably less than other slideout smartphones, like the Droid2 from Verizon or the myTouch Slide from T-Mobile, even though it has a bigger screen than either. Fans of high-speed downloading, may have less rejoicing to do. Although I live in a city where a 4G network began service in 2008 (you would think it would be pretty built-out by now), reception has been spotty, and I would have to pay an extra $10 a month for whatever reception I get. If you are not in the sweet spot of one of the 48 4G markets, you might want to save the money and stick with 3G service for now. Another head scratcher: this new phone ships with Android operating system 2.1, when 2.2 is already available on other Android phones and offers many advantages, including the ability to view most Flash video and animation. It also means you cannot take advantage of the new Google Voice apps for 2.2, which let you dictate and send texts and e-mail from your phone, dial numbers on command, name songs to play, show you directions on Google maps or conduct a Google search. The Epic is $250 after rebate with a two-year contract, considerably more than the similarly configured Droid2 at $200 and myTouch Slide at $180. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Geithner and the director of national intelligence, Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., the senators expressed concern over claims that the company had sold equipment to the regime of Saddam Hussein and had a close business relationship with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in Iran. The senators also said the company, Huawei Inc., had close ties to the People’s Liberation Army in China. “Sprint Nextel supplies important equipment to the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies, and it offers a broad array of devices, systems, software and services to the private sector,” wrote the group of senators, including Jon Kyl of Arizona, Christopher S. Bond of Missouri and Susan Collins of Maine. “We are concerned that Huawei’s position as a supplier of Sprint Nextel could create substantial risk for U.S. companies and possibly undermine U.S. national security.” A campaign to block Huawei’s bid to sell equipment in the United States would almost certainly aggravate American-Chinese trade relations and intensify a longstanding debate over whether big Chinese companies will be allowed to invest in sensitive industries in the United States. Several Chinese companies, including Huawei, have repeatedly been discouraged or blocked in recent years from doing business with American companies because of national security concerns, decisions that have angered Chinese officials and business leaders. A Treasury spokeswoman, Natalie Wyeth, said the department had received the letter and was reviewing it. Ms. Wyeth said the government welcomed foreign investment in general, including from China. “Foreign investment creates significant economic benefits for American workers, including millions of well-paying jobs,” she said. The letter, dated Aug. 18, drew sharp responses from both the Chinese government and Huawei. Wang Baodong, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, issued a statement saying Huawei was a private company that simply wanted to do business in the United States. “We hope that some people in the U.S. will take a rational approach toward these normal commercial activities rather than do anything to stand in the way by abusing national security concerns,” Mr. Wang said in the statement. Huawei, which is based in Shenzhen in Southern China, issued its own statement late Friday saying that the Chinese government and military had no control over the company. Huawei also defended itself against past charges that it had infringed on the intellectual property rights of American companies. “Huawei is disappointed to learn that old mischaracterizations about the company still linger,” Ross Gan, a company spokesman, said in the statement. Under American law, an interagency panel called the Committee on Foreign Investments can block foreign companies from acquiring or investing in companies. In this case, the senators, in their letter, asked the Obama administration and national security agencies to fully investigate Huawei and assess the risks posed by allowing it to sell equipment to Sprint Nextel. In raising their concerns, the senators cited media reports; a press release from the Chinese embassy in Iran; a report by the Iraq Survey Group, a committee set up after the fall of Iraq; and several other documents. The senators wrote that Huawei’s presence in Iran, “especially with military industries, suggests that under U.S. sanctions on Iran, Huawei should be prohibited from doing business with the U.S. government.” The letter also highlighted the firm’s “reported relationship” with the People’s Liberation Army, citing what it called “China’s well-documented focus on developing cyber warfare capabilities.” It concluded with a series of questions in which the senators asked whether the Treasury Department was currently negotiating a deal to allow Huawei to acquire or invest in American companies, and whether Huawei’s potential control over a company involved with sensitive government contracts would “present a national security threat for technology leakage or enhanced espionage against the United States.” A spokesman for Sprint Nextel, one of the largest mobile phone operators in the United States, declined to comment late last week. Efforts to reach several of the senators for elaboration on the letter were unsuccessful. Although Huawei is not well known in the United States, it is already one of the biggest telecom equipment suppliers worldwide, with major operations in China, Europe and Africa and revenue last year of over $20 billion The company is now eager to enter the American telecom equipment market. But that move has been slowed by nagging questions about the company’s history — whether it has sold equipment to countries like Iraq and Iran; received financing from the Chinese government; or stolen technology from global companies. The company was founded in the 1980s by Ren Zhengfei, a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army. Some analysts say the Chinese government has helped Huawei win contracts in Africa and other developing nations and often helped finance government purchases of Huawei equipment. Cisco Systems sued Huawei in 2003, saying that the company had illegally copied its software and infringed on several patents. The companies settled the case out of court. Last month, Motorola sued Huawei in the United States, accusing it of plotting to steal trade secrets with the help of a group of former Motorola employees. Huawei insists the case has no merit and said it planned to fight it in court. Huawei did not say what Sprint Nextel contract it was bidding on. But Huawei has had trouble entering the United States market. In 2008, Huawei dropped a bid to take over the 3Com Corporation after the federal government began investigating whether the acquisition would pose national security risks. And earlier this year, Huawei lost bids to buy the assets of the software maker 2Wire and Motorola’s wireless equipment unit, according to Bloomberg News. Bloomberg said Huawei lost both bids despite offering more than the winning bidders because the sellers doubted Huawei could win federal approval.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/technology/29phone.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Nextel Reports Gain in Subscribers<date>Published: July 28, 2010</date><text>The Sprint Nextel Corporation, the wireless phone provider, said Wednesday that it gained subscribers in its latest quarter, the first such increase in three years, as it continued to improve customer service and retention. However, it is still losing the most lucrative customers, those who sign two-year contracts, and posted a wider loss for its second quarter because of tax issues. Sprint gained a net 111,000 subscribers in the April to June period, compared with a loss of 257,000 in the same quarter last year. It said it expected to keep adding wireless subscribers for the rest of the year, and reduce the number of contract customers who leave. Sprint still lost 55,000 subscribers under its own brands in the latest quarter, but made up for that by adding 166,000 wholesale and affiliate subscribers, who buy access to the network through resellers. It lost 228,000 contract subscribers, a figure much improved from the 991,000 it lost in the same quarter last year. Sprint has been hemorrhaging subscribers nearly constantly since its 2005 acquisition of Nextel. That network, incompatible with Sprint’s, is valued for its walkie-talkie-like push-to-talk function, but is poorly suited to smartphones, and subscribers have been leaving every year. The rate of contract subscribers canceling service every month was 1.85 percent in the quarter. That was the company’s lowest figure ever, though it was still higher than the corresponding figure at AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless.Sprint ended the quarter with 48.2 million subscribers. Its quarterly loss amounted to $760 million, or 25 cents per share. That compares with a loss of $384 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts who took into account a change in Sprint’s tax treatments were on average expecting a loss 24 cents per share, according to the company. Revenue slipped 1 percent to $8.03 billion. Analysts expected $8.0 billion in revenue.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/business/media/22adco.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">G4 Channel to Become 4G to Promote Sprint<date>Published: July 21, 2010</date><text>NEXT week the cable channel G4 will morph into 4G.In a letter-swapping promotion for Sprint Nextel’s next-generation wireless Internet service, the name of the channel will change for seven days, affecting all its logos and shows. The campaign begins Monday. “We think it has some unique abilities to break through the clutter in the marketplace and help Sprint promote its service,” Neal Tiles, the president of G4, said in a telephone interview. He added, “How often do you get to change the name of the network for an extended period of time?” No, nothing is sacred now, not even a television channel’s name. It’s hard to imagine that the temporary change will upset many G4 viewers. The channel, a domain for video game reviews, reality shows and manly humor, is owned by Comcast. It was started just eight years ago, so it lacks the heritage of a network like ABC, CNN or MTV. If anything, the temporary change might bring new attention to the channel, which is carried in about 70 million homes and usually has low ratings. Steve Gaffney, a vice president for corporate marketing at Sprint, said the G4 channel was seen as “very fertile ground” for the 4G message because of its intended audience, men ages 18 to 34. Mr. Gaffney said that aligned nicely with its audience for the 4G campaign, “the young male tech-savvy early adopter.” Similarly, Mr. Tiles said he felt that the 4G service was relevant to his audience, making the playful name change “very natural.” Sprint has been promoting the 4G speeds for well over a year. Now it is broadening its ad campaign to promote the Evo 4G, a next-generation smartphone. (4G is shorthand for fourth-generation cellular infrastructure.) The package of promotions for Sprint was conceived by G4 in conjunction with Sprint’s media services agency, Mindshare, Mr. Tiles said. The name change will probably be most visible on two original series, the talk show “Attack of the Show” and the video game series “X-Play,” because Sprint messages will be mentioned in both shows for the week. Sprint has also worked with G4 to create short ads called interstitials that promote the speed of its service. Mr. Gaffney said the interstitials would “communicate the value and the utility of the 4G standard to gamers who depend so heavily on broadband speeds.” The G4 Web show “Feedback” will take the integration to an exceptional level, with custom show segments about playing games anytime and anywhere using the Evo phone as an access point. Asked about channels changing their name for advertisers, Gary Lico, the chief executive of CableU, a research company that analyzes channels and programming trends, said, “I can’t think of another time it’s ever even been pitched.” He added, “I don’t think it’s desperation in any way. It’s just another way — a bold way — to cut through the clutter.” Sprint will also run some of its standard ads on G4 next week. In early June, the company started an advertising campaign for the Evo by the Sprint agency Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. The campaign centers on the idea that users want to be the first to try a new phone. In a TV commercial for the Evo, famous firsts like the wheel, the Model T, the Wright Brothers’ plane and the typewriter set the stage for the unveiling of the phone. An announcer intones phrases like “First resets everything” and “First moves us forward fast.” The same theme continues in some of the print ads, which begin: “First leads. First moves us forward. First kicks open the door, and possibilities follow. First takes us places we’ve never been before.” A campaign goal is to “reclaim some of Sprint’s heritage of leadership,” said Rob Smith, associate partner and group account director at Goodby, Silverstein. Wireless is one of the most active categories of advertising. Sprint Nextel spent $1.2 billion on ads in 2009, according to Kantar Media, an amount that was dwarfed by its larger rivals AT&amp;T ($1.9 billion) and Verizon Communications ($2.2 billion). Stunts like turning G4 into 4G allow the provider to stand out. Mr. Gaffney said, “We end up, frankly, boxing above our weight by renaming a channel.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/motorolas-path-to-breakup/?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Motorola's Path to Breakup<date>July 20, 2010, 3:34 am</date><text>Motorola is getting closer to splitting itself up, with the announcement of a deal to sell its Networks division to Nokia Siemens Networks. Next year, the remainder of Motorola is splitting into two companies. Motorola is currently made up of four units: Enterprise Mobility, Mobile Devices, Home and Networks. The Associated Press provides a summary of each and says something of what their fate will be come the split. Enterprise Mobility — Makes police radios, bar-code scanners and other equipment for government and corporate clients. It had $1.69 billion in revenue in the first quarter and operating earnings of $141 million. This unit will be called Motorola Solutions when it becomes a separate company early next year. Mobile Devices — The cellphone unit will be called Motorola Mobility when it becomes a separate company early next year, together with the Home unit. Had $1.64 billion in revenue in the first quarter and lost $192 million on an operating basis. Home — This unit makes cable TV set-top boxes and modems. It’s a leading provider in the United States, competing with Cisco Systems. It will be combined with Mobile Devices to form Motorola Mobility early next year. It had $838 million in revenue in the first quarter and $20 million in earnings. Networks — Most of this unit is being sold to Nokia Siemens networks for $1.2 billion. It makes network equipment for wireless carriers, notably Sprint Nextel and Verizon Wireless, but has fallen behind the times. It had sales of $896 million in the first quarter and earnings of $112 million.

It’s all about the fine print.It’ll get you when you buy a car. When you rent an apartment. When you sign a prenup. Most of all, it’ll get you when you buy the new Sprint Evo 4G phone ($200, after rebate, with two-year contract). It’s another great-looking, blazingly fast app phone made by HTC and running Google’s Android operating system. Android gives the phone more complexity than the iPhone (its obvious rival), but also provides some sensational features: speech recognition that lets you type by speaking, almost anywhere; an excellent, free turn-by-turn GPS navigation program; and a wireless app store stocked with more than 70,000 little programs. Of course, the Evo’s little brother, the terrific HTC Incredible, delivers all of that, too. What makes the Evo seem even more spectacular are all the firsts and bests. For example, the Evo has an enormous 4.3-inch touch screen that dwarfs those of most phones. You can turn the Evo into a pocket Wi-Fi hot spot, so up to eight people can get online with their laptops. The 8-megapixel camera has dual LED flashes and records hi-def video. The Evo is also one of the first app phones that can run Flash videos and animations on the Web, which the iPhone, notoriously, can’t. There’s even a second camera on the front, so you can actually make video calls to other Evo owners. Now you, too, can play Dick Tracy, or at least show your Evo-owning grandparents the new baby. Above all, the Evo is the first 4G phone in America. That is, it can exploit the fourth-generation cellular towers that Sprint has been building, to bring you much, much faster Web pages and e-mail, and skip-free Internet video. Come on — all that sounds amazing. Who wouldn’t sign on the dotted line? Unfortunately, these groundbreaking features come with enough fine print to give the White Pages an inferiority complex. First, the screen. It’s big, all right, and bright and beautiful (480 by 800 pixels). The hugeness pays off when you’re looking at photos, videos or maps, and whenever you’re reading anything. Unfortunately, physics has some fine print of its own — and one of the footnotes says that you can’t have a big screen on a small phone. The Evo is nice and thin, but it’s also tall and wide. It is not for the small of hand. People might mistake it for an iPad Nano. The Wi-Fi hot spot business is slick. With a couple of taps, you can turn the Evo’s cellular Internet signal into a Wi-Fi hot spot. Now nearby laptops, game machines and even other smartphones can get online wirelessly through it. It’d be great on long car rides, slow-moving movie shoots and camping trips for those who can’t let go of their technology. Actually, make that “short car rides,” “brief movie shoots” and “afternoon camping trips,” because this feature eats through a full battery charge in as little as one hour. (More on the Evo’s amazing disappearing battery in a moment.) And beware: the hot spot feature costs an extra $30 a month. O.K., so what about Flash? Isn’t it a big deal that the Evo lets you watch Flash videos that its rivals can’t? Well, sort of. The Evo runs something called Flash Lite, which is marketing-ese for, “Sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t.” It plays videos on some sites that the iPhone can’t — on Engadget, for example, plus all the blinking ads (a mixed blessing). But it still can’t play the Flash videos on CNN.com or, sadly, TV shows on Hulu.com. All right, what about video calling? Surely this is the killer app. Imagine: your friends and family can not just hear you, as with normal phones, but see you as well (assuming they also bought Sprint Evos, of course). Well, let’s hope they’re NASA engineers, because this feature is head-bangingly unstable. After two days of fiddling, downloading and uninstalling apps, manually force-quitting programs and waiting for servers to be upgraded, I finally got video calling to work — sort of. Sometimes there was only audio and a black screen, sometimes only a freeze-frame; at best, the video was blocky and the audio delay absurd. To make video calling work, you have to install an app yourself: either Fring or Qik. But we never did get Fring to work, and Qik requires people you call to press a Talk button when they want to speak. The whole thing is confusing and, to use the technical term, iffy. But come on — this is the first 4G phone in America! That’s got to be better than 3G, right? Hard to say, since I couldn’t find any 4G reception, even in weeks of traveling. My problem, evidently, was that I was visiting major cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco. So far, Sprint has installed 4G coverage in only 32 areas — and they’re bustling metropolises like Boise, Idaho; Wichita Falls, Tex.; High Point, N.C.; and Milledgeville, Ga.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDA123FF934A25755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=sprintnextelcorporation">STATE OF THE ART; A Bold Phone Fades a Bit In the Details<date>Published: June 17, 2010</date><text>Fine print, baby.

Analysts were encouraged that the company, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., slowed the loss of valuable long-term customers and posted an increase in the number of budget-conscious customers who paid in advance. “People were looking for it to show improvements and it did,” said Kevin Roe, an analyst at Roe Equity Research. “There’s still a lot of heavy work ahead of them but they’re moving in the right direction.” Sprint lost 578,000 contract-signing customers in the quarter, an improvement from a loss of 1.25 million a year earlier, and better than the 623,574 drop expected by analysts. Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint’s chief executive, said the company’s progress came at the expense of its bigger rivals. “That’s the biggest driver in their reduction, Sprint’s improvements.” Mr. Hesse said in an interview. He added that Sprint’s progress was even more impressive because of signs that the overall growth of the contract market was slowing. Mr. Hesse said cancellations by contract customers would decline in the second quarter from first-quarter levels. He did not give specific targets but said the decline would come from an increase in the percentage of customers buying multiple services. Sprint’s net loss widened to $865 million, or 29 cents a share, from $594 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Mr. Hesse said Sprint planned to broaden its service offerings for customers who prepaid for calls. Prepaid customers are currently the main growth segment in the wireless market as users increasingly look to economize. Sprint shares rose 17 cents, or 4 percent, to close at $4.26.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/technology/25texting.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Catholic Charity and Sprint Tangle Over Texting<date>Published: March 24, 2010</date><text>When the earthquake devastated Haiti, Catholic Relief Services tried to gather contributions for its efforts using the hottest trend in giving: donations via cellphone.But the charity wanted to try a twist on the technology: when people sent a text message to donate, they got a reply offering to connect them via phone to the charity’s call center. The group hoped that the calls could build a stronger bond with donors, and garner larger contributions as well. But just three days into the effort after the Jan. 12 earthquake, the charity got word that Sprint Nextel was demanding that the “text-to-call” effort be shut down. The charity had 40 days to abandon the feature or lose access to millions of Sprint customers. Sprint’s original motivations are murky; it said that an intermediary company had failed to properly fill out a form to verify that it was dealing with a legitimate charity. The conflict underscores a problem that public interest groups asked the Federal Communications Commission to address more than two years ago: the hazy legal status of text messages, which are controlled by telephone companies without any real government oversight. The laws that prohibit phone companies from interfering with voice calls do not apply to text messages, a fast-growing medium. “We should be able to communicate with people the way they want to be communicated with, not the way the phone company wants them to be communicated with,” said Jed Alpert, a founder of Mobile Commons, the company that connects Catholic Relief Services and 100 other nonprofit organizations with text messaging networks. The texting fight parallels a broader conflict over who controls the information flowing through data pipelines, a long-running dispute that has come to be known as net neutrality. “This issue is floating in a regulatory limbo — no one knows what the rules are,” said Susan Crawford, who teaches Internet law at the University of Michigan. “The regulatory void here is substantial.” In a previous clash over texting, Verizon Wireless in 2007 rejected a request for a text message program for Naral Pro-Choice America saying it had the right to block “controversial or unsavory” messages. Once the decision came under scrutiny, Verizon allowed the text program to go forward, calling the initial decision “an incorrect interpretation of a dusty internal policy,” but it did not disavow its legal power to reject messages. The Naral dispute led a coalition of groups that focus on technology policy to file a request with the F.C.C. that asked for the government to step in and clarify the regulatory confusion surrounding text messages. The F.C.C. has announced no action on that filing. Catholic Relief Services says it has not received a clear explanation for the decision to shut down the program, which used a five-digit number known as a short code to set up the call with potential donors. Sprint has said it was all a big misunderstanding. “We never told them to shut the code down,” said Crystal N. Davis, a Sprint spokeswoman. “We have no problem with Catholic Relief Services.” However, she said, Sprint needs proof, provided through the intermediary companies that market the short code services, that any charity pursuing such a plan is legitimate. The form that came back to Sprint “was incomplete,” she said. Mr. Alpert said that he had never been asked to vet a charity in three years of operation. Once he completed the requested form, he said he received no guidance or feedback about it. The telecommunications giants generally do not deal directly with nonprofits, but distribute the short codes through intermediary companies known as aggregators, who often sell them to other companies that set up the text messaging services. So Catholic Relief Services heard from Mobile Commons, which got the bad news from an aggregator, OpenMarket. The note from OpenMarket read, “We did everything we could over the last two days to save this program, but Sprint has officially rejected.” An OpenMarket spokesman, Scott Baldwin, said the company was simply the middleman, adding, “I’m not sure why Sprint rejected it.” Laura Durington, the online communications manager for Catholic Relief Services, said that when the group found out its program had been rejected, “we were so floored.” Ms. Davis, the Sprint spokeswoman, said the company was “working to resolve this situation” and had “no current plan to deny the use of the short code.” Mr. Alpert said that on Tuesday, Sprint told him it would allow the program to continue if it were converted to a simple text-to-donate program. The public interest groups that took part in the Naral filing in 2007 say that whatever the intricacies of the fight over Catholic Relief Services, the underlying issue is still the need for some regulatory authority and recourse in disputes. M. Chris Riley, who serves as policy counsel for Free Press, a media policy and advocacy group in Washington that participated in the 2007 filing, suggested that Sprint might be legitimately concerned about people using the text-to-call method to flood consumers with unwanted calls or messages. However, he said, problems emerge for legitimate organizations like Catholic Relief Services when the telephone company, with its control over the market, “is being insufficiently flexible or categorically eliminating a range of communications because sometimes they result in spam.” Harold Feld, legal director for Public Knowledge, a public policy group in Washington that also joined the 2007 filing, said that even though customers of other carriers would not be directly affected by a Sprint shutdown, companies and nonprofits would be reluctant to lose access to so many potential recipients of their messages. The effect, he said, is that “you discourage anyone from innovating.” Both groups are planning new filings based on this conflict. Matthew Nodine, a spokesman for the F.C.C., said that the agency had no comment on the Catholic Relief Services dispute, because of the 2007 petition. “It is a matter pending before the commission at this time,” he said. Some experts question whether greater government authority is the answer. Adam D. Thierer, the president of the Progress and Freedom Foundation in Washington, a pro-business research organization, said that “most people would say, I want my carrier to be doing a certain amount of policing for potentially harmful or fraudulent activities,” and would hold the carrier responsible if things went wrong. If a company has gone too far in that regard, he said, “I would hope to see that play out in the market and see what works and what doesn’t.” Mr. Alpert disagreed. “Land’s End doesn’t have to live with the idea that Verizon isn’t going to let them be connected by voice,” he said. “How text messaging got into a different category makes no sense.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/technology/personaltech/25smart.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Locked or Unlocked?

Skip to next paragraph These T-Mobile myTouch phones may look the same. Their prices, however, could be quite different. It could very well be the $400 phone. That can be the case when the calling plan for the full-price phone is less than the one for the discounted phone. The cellphone industry has started to change because of a recent policy switch from T-Mobile. And as it does, a shopper will increasingly have to consider the total price of the wireless service plan as well as the price of the phone itself. This is especially true if the smartphone under consideration can be perpetually updated with new apps. You might not really need to spend hundreds more on a new phone after a two-year contract expires and then chain yourself to a network for another two years beyond. And who knows: if enough consumers actually vote with their pocketbooks for this option, the other carriers may come around as well. The United States is one of the only places where consumers buy phones that are subsidized by the mobile carriers. The American carriers lock you into a contract with steep monthly prices so they can recoup the phone’s discount. At least that’s the stated logic. But the logic splinters when it comes to your personal phone bill. Let’s say that you buy a MyTouch 3G, one of T-Mobile’s most popular smartphones, for $400, and sign up for its 500-minute voice, text and data plan for $60 a month. The total cost of the phone over two years would be $1,840. If, instead, you buy the phone subsidized by T-Mobile for $150, that same plan will cost $80 monthly  bringing your two-year total to $2,070. If you reject the subsidy, you’ll actually have $230 to spend two years from now, and $20 every month you keep the phone beyond that. Android phones like the MyTouch 3G have thousands of apps that will let the device evolve with your needs. Another benefit is that you’ll have been free to jump to another carrier at any time without a penalty or having to sell the phone. The only caveat is that you’ll need to use T-Mobile, because that is the only carrier bold enough to give a $20 monthly break on their plans to customers who buy unsubsidized phones. If your stomping grounds have good T-Mobile coverage, you could save hundreds of dollars with this approach. You’ll save less money if you want Google’s Nexus One, which costs $529 unsubsidized, and $179 with a two-year contract with T-Mobile. So for this phone, the two-year, unsubsidized cost would run $1,969, which is still $130 less than the $2,099 you would spend with the subsidy. Accounting majors will start running net-present-value calculations to determine the benefit of holding onto more money in the short term, but even here, T-Mobile has an answer. The company accepts installment pricing for the unsubsidized phone, so if your credit is good, you could pay $20 a month until the phone is paid off. International travelers who choose this approach enjoy another benefit. Since T-Mobile operates on the G.S.M. standard used by most carriers in the world (but not Verizon and Sprint in the United States), you can take your T-Mobile phone abroad, walk into a store and buy a G.S.M. chip for cheap calls. If you don’t own that phone outright, or if you’ve been under contract with T-Mobile for four months or less, you can’t swap out the phone’s G.S.M. chip. (That’s why it’s known as a “locked” phone.) Here is the last thing to think about if you are interested in saving money. You might expect carriers to free you from a contract after they’ve recouped their subsidy and immediately begin charging you less each month. How much less? As much as $30 less, which is what you pay for unlimited talk, text and data for prepaid service on networks like Sprint’s Boost Mobile. Boost charges $50 monthly when you pay ahead of time, instead of carrying a contract. In other words, about a year after buying that subsidized phone, your financial obligation to the carrier should be finished, and the two of you should continue your relationship for as long as it makes you both happy. Of course, that doesn’t happen.

He adds to a list of cooperating witnesses that federal prosecutors are using to build a case in a wide-ranging insider-trading scandal. Skip to next paragraph LiPo Ching/Mercury News, via Bloomberg News Rajiv Goel, formerly of Intel, said he had leaked inside information to Raj Rajaratnam. Add to Portfolio Intel Corp Sprint Nextel Corp Go to your Portfolio » The executive, Rajiv Goel, said at a court hearing that his friendship with Mr. Rajaratnam began 25 years ago when the two attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Goel said he provided Mr. Rajaratnam in 2007 with inside information about Intel’s financial condition before it was publicly released. He also tipped Galleon’s founder about a pending joint venture between the Clearwire Corporation and Sprint Nextel, a deal in which the chip maker Intel planned to invest $1 billion. Mr. Goel was a managing director in Intel’s treasury department until he left the company in late January. While they lived on different coasts, the men kept in touch regularly and their families vacationed together, Mr. Goel said in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Rajaratnam twice gave Mr. Goel money for “personal financial reasons” and often asked Mr. Goel questions about Intel. Prosecutors said had Mr. Goel not pleaded guilty, they were prepared to prove that he had committed the crimes, in part, with wiretapped recordings of Mr. Rajaratnam in 2008. Agents for the F.B.I. secretly listened to numerous conversations Mr. Rajaratnam had with various sources of insider tips that resulted in over $50 million in gains for Galleon, according to prosecutors. “I gave Rajaratnam the information because of my friendship for him,” Mr. Goel said in court. “I cannot express how sorry I am. I come here to do the right thing.” Mr. Goel pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, which carry a combined maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 28 and remains free on $750,000 bail. Prosecutors accuse Mr. Rajaratnam of trading on the inside information provided by Mr. Goel, bringing Galleon several million dollars in profit. They also accuse him of paying for the tips by making investments for Mr. Goel based on inside information he was receiving from other sources. Mr. Rajaratnam has denied any wrongdoing. He is currently free on $100 million bail. Mr. Goel is the third person to plead guilty who had direct contact with Mr. Rajaratnam. The others are Anil Kumar, another friend of Mr. Rajaratnam’s who leaked information about a deal he was working on as a consultant for McKinsey &amp; Company, and Roomy Khan, a former employee of Intel and Galleon, who passed on several tips about pending takeovers and other information to Mr. Rajaratnam. Ms. Khan and Mr. Kumar are also cooperating with investigators. “Rajiv Goel is a professional who abused the access he had to sensitive corporate secrets to benefit a select few,” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. “We will continue to work with our partners at the F.B.I. and the S.E.C. to pursue corporate corruption to the fullest extent of the law.” In all, 22 people have been criminally charged or face civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Galleon case. So far, Mr. Goel and nine others have pleaded guilty, and several are cooperating with investigators. They are accused of making tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits by trading on nonpublic information. The S.E.C. and prosecutors for the Justice Department have said the investigation is continuing and charges could be brought against others. Both the S.E.C. and prosecutors describe the Galleon case as the largest insider-trading case involving hedge funds.

Ms. Smith, 35, has sued the companies that provided the driver’s phone and wireless service. She hopes to prove that the companies should have foreseen the dangers and that they failed to provide adequate warnings. Legal experts said her lawsuit, currently the only such case and one of only a handful ever filed, faces steep challenges but also raises interesting questions about responsibility for behavior that is a threat to everyone on the road. “This is a compelling type of legal claim,” said Kenneth A. Bamberger, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. “It deals with the widespread use of a product we now know is involved in significant risk and deals with the ultimate question of who should contribute in minimizing the risk.” The lawsuit, filed in October, involves a crash in Oklahoma City on Sept. 3, 2008. Ms. Smith’s mother, Linda Doyle, 61, died after her Toyota Rav4 was hit by a Ford pickup driven by Christopher Hill. Mr. Hill, then 20, told the police he was so distracted by a cellphone call that he ran a red light at 45 miles an hour, hitting Ms. Doyle’s car as it crossed in front of him. Mr. Hill was talking on a Samsung UpStage phone on the Sprint Nextel service. Samsung declined to comment. Sprint Nextel said that it “rejects the claims of negligence” in the suit and that it includes safety messages on packaging and user manuals, on its Web site and in its advertising. In 2003, a woman in Indiana sued Cingular after getting into an accident with another driver, who was reportedly using a Cingular phone. An Indiana appellate court, affirming a lower court’s decision, dismissed the suit, for reasons that include the unforeseeability of the accident and the absence of a legal relationship between the woman and Cingular. But the court also said that crashes are caused by driver inattention, not by cellphones, adding that drivers often talk on phones without crashing. Russell Jackson, a lawyer who defends companies in product liability cases and is chairman of the Product Liability Committee of the New York City Bar Association, said Ms. Smith, in her lawsuit, faces a challenge in that consumers generally know it is risky to talk on a phone but do it anyway. As a result, he said, it is fair to assume that drivers like Mr. Hill would have kept talking, even if there had been more warnings. In fact, Mr. Hill, who pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, does not blame the cellphone companies. “It’s our choice if we’re going to talk on the cellphone while driving or walking down the street or in the office,” he said. “The cellphone companies don’t say you should talk on the phone and drive.” At the same time, Mr. Hill said, he was not aware of the education efforts by wireless companies on distracted driving, like the warnings in his phone manual to focus on the road. “I never read it,” he said. Ms. Smith argues that the industry’s success in marketing to drivers is the reason people like Mr. Hill do not change their behavior or pay attention to what she characterizes as faint warnings by the industry. Of her mother’s death, she said: “They should’ve told people from the beginning there was a real risk, and this would’ve never happened.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: December 9, 2009 An article on Monday about a lawsuit against the cellular industry in a case of distracted driving reversed the name of a lawyer who defends companies in product liability cases.

Instead, Telenor this month chose Huawei Technologies, a Chinese equipment maker, to build its ultrafast network based on a technology called LTE, or Long Term Evolution. Grabbing the contract in the heart of Scandinavia was the latest coup for Huawei, the rising star of the mobile equipment industry, whose low-cost, multipurpose networks have catapulted it to No. 2 in the world, behind Ericsson. “Huawei has established itself as a serious competitor,” said Morten Karlsen Sorby, the head of global business development at Telenor. “They have been able in a very short period of time to build the necessary competence and innovation.” But as Huawei’s influence grows — it leapfrogged Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens in quarterly sales this year, according to Dell’Oro, a research firm in Redwood City, California — the private company founded in 1988 by Ren Zhengfei, a former officer of the People’s Liberation Army, has fought the perception that it has ties to China’s government and military. A 2007 report by the RAND Corp., a policy research institute, for the U.S. Air Force said Huawei “maintains deep ties with the Chinese military, which serves a multifaceted role as an important customer, as well as Huawei’s political patron and research development partner.” Security concerns motivated the Committee on Foreign Investment, a U.S. government panel, to reject Huawei’s joint $2.2 billion bid with Bain Capital in 2008 for 3Com, a U.S. communications equipment maker that produces anti-hacking software for the U.S. military. Huawei’s private ownership — which it has never disclosed in detail — has brought it scrutiny in India and Australia this year as it has bid on contracts. Edward Zhou, the Huawei marketing director for Europe, dismissed questions surrounding the company’s ownership structure as “market speculation,” saying Huawei was owned by its 80,000 employees and had no links to Chinese officialdom. “No government or government-linked organizations have any ownership stake,” Mr. Zhou said during an interview. “Huawei has no connection to the Chinese military, and none of our directors hold, or has held, any positions with, or serves or has served as a consultant or advisor to, any Chinese government or agency.” A senior executive for one of Huawei’s main rivals, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak for the company, said he did not know of any government ties the company might have but that that did not mean they did not exist. “They are very aggressive as a vendor,” he said. “But there is a definite lack of transparency, which makes it very tricky for us.” Questions surrounding its ownership have not prevented Huawei from supplying 36 of the world’s top 50 mobile operators, including Telus in Canada and Cox Communications, Leap and Clearwire, a WiMax operator majority owned by Sprint Nextel, in the United States. All were attracted to innovative Huawei products like its SingleRAN, a multipurpose wireless network that transmits in second- and third-generation, as well as LTE, signals, saving operators the expense of separate, parallel grids. In-Stat, a research firm in Scottsdale, Arizona, says Huawei was the first company to produce an LTE base station, the fastest in the industry, on a large scale. “In whatever sector they are competing in, Huawei is a major player,” said Jeff Heynen, an analyst at Infonetics in Raleigh, North Carolina. “They are now among the top three in almost every market. The future for them continues to look bright.” Supplying gear to China’s three big operators — China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom — helped Huawei almost double its share of the $38 billion global mobile equipment market to 20.1 percent in the third quarter from 11 percent a year earlier, according to Dell’Oro. Huawei moved past Nokia Siemens, at 19.5 percent, and trails Ericsson, which has 32 percent. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on November 30, 2009, in The International Herald Tribune.When Telenor decided to upgrade its mobile phone network in Norway, the job drew bids from the companies that had built its original grid: Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks.

Along with job cuts, Sprint said it would reduce the use of outside contractors, which would contribute 60 percent of projected savings, the company said in a statement. Sprint, which has about 42,000 workers, forecast a charge of $60 million to $80 million in its fourth quarter for severance payments and other costs related to the latest round of layoffs, which follows 8,000 job cuts earlier this year. The mobile phone company said many of the cuts would happen by the end of December and would include jobs across the entire company, including layoffs in its wholesale unit. That adds up to a total work force reduction of 16,500 for Sprint this year, including the September transfer of 6,000 Sprint employees to Ericsson, which has agreed to manage Sprint’s network. One analyst said the savings would not make a big difference for Sprint, which would still have high costs. On Oct. 29, Sprint posted a third-quarter loss of $478 million, or 17 cents a share. It ended the quarter with a balance of $5.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and forecast positive free cash flow for the fourth quarter. Sprint, which has been working on stemming customer losses in its mobile business, said last week that it was planning dozens of layoffs in its wholesale business because of a lack of growth in its landline business.

The retail outlets operated by the carriers generally offer a wider choice than do the mass merchants. Related All Phone Smart Columns » A device can have vastly different prices depending who is selling it, and since retailers offer a limited selection of phones, it’s hard to trust a salesperson who recommends a certain device, especially when carriers introduce new handsets weekly. It’s getting worse. Carriers seem to believe that everyone wants a shiny new phone for a holiday gift, so new devices are now surging into the market. There is a way to approach the task with a small measure of logic. To boil it down, the process is a three-step boogie: go online to narrow your choices, go offline to test a few, go back online to buy one. Spend a day doing this, and you can avoid two years of cellphone remorse. STEP 1: LOG ON Several weeks ago, a friend asked me to recommend a Verizon smartphone. The BlackBerry Tour was new, so I suggested he at least take a look at that. Mistaking my suggestion for an endorsement, he bought one the next day, and quickly found the keyboard was far too cramped for his fingers. Had my friend read a couple of online reviews of the Tour, he might have chosen more carefully. If he had another shot, I’d suggest he start by spending five minutes on sites like GotReception.com, DeadCellZones.com and CellReception.com to check the coverage of the major carriers in his area. These sites aren’t completely reliable, because they can have limited, or old, data on certain towns, but they can help narrow your list of carriers. Next, check LetsTalk.com or AmazonWireless.com, an Amazon spinoff. These sites have a handy selection feature that helps you winnow your device choices, depending on whether you prefer a full keyboard, GPS, Wi-Fi and the like. (To find it on AmazonWireless.com, look for the “See all phones” link on the home page.) Neither site asks you how important it may be to customize your phone. Assuming that’s important to you, consider whether the phone has a good app store. You know about iPhones, but BlackBerrys and Android phones like the myTouch 3G from T-Mobile also have good app stores. (Android isn’t a manufacturer; it’s the brand of software that runs the phone, just as Windows runs a computer.) Speaking of that, on Monday Windows Mobile introduced an app store, Windows Marketplace for Mobile, with apps for phones that run the new version of its operating system. Apps for Symbian phones from Nokia and WebOS phones from Palm are in shorter supply, but there are more each week. Remember that app stores are useful only for smartphones, not the old-fashioned flip phones that aren’t meant to surf the Web or speak directions to you on a drive across town. Finally, to eliminate possible clunkers from your list, click over to CNet.com, LetsTalk or PhoneDog.com for professional reviews, and check AmazonWireless or HowardForums.com for user reviews. STEP 2: HIT THE ROAD Armed with a list of two or three phones, head to a local retailer to test them. Bear in mind that carrier-specific stores stock more phone models than mass-market retailers like Best Buy, Wal-Mart or Radio Shack. Take the phone in hand and compose an e-mail message or a text on it. Imagine doing it hundreds of times. Take a picture. See how easy or difficult it is to call up your favorite Web page. If something initially annoys you, it will drive you to distraction over time. Navigate around a page and try to enlarge the type for easier reading. I’ve been shocked to find some high-end smartphones, like the Nokia N97 and the BlackBerry Storm, that are surprisingly weak at Web surfing. Finally, note the prices of these phones, then head home. STEP 3: LOG ON AGAIN By now, you will probably have decided which phone you want. If it’s an iPhone, and you’re willing to buy a refurbished device, check AT&amp;T’s Web site, where you sometimes find deep discounts. If it’s another device, a visit to several retail sites will usually yield the best price. Start with online retailers, which can charge lower prices because they have lower operating costs than physical retailers. Wirefly, LetsTalk and AmazonWireless are your best bets here. AmazonWireless is still in testing mode, and Sprint phones are not yet available there. Just about any retailer will accept a returned phone within 30 days and let you escape your carrier contract without an early termination fee. After that, it gets dicey. Amazon will refuse to accept a returned phone. And if you cut off service or switch to a cheaper plan within the first 181 days, it will charge you up to $250, on top of whatever early termination fees you face from the carrier. Walmart.com and Wirefly will charge similar fees if you end your contract early, so ask about that before you buy anywhere online, then decide if it’s worth the risk. The Web sites of major retailers can offer good prices, too. Walmart.com last week sold the Palm Pre for $99, after a $50 mail-in rebate, which was $50 less than on Sprint.com. Wirefly and Amazon.com matched the $99 price, and neither site puts you through the hassle of mail-in rebates. Another caveat: if you have any anxiety about transporting your contacts from your old phone to your new one, setting up an e-mail account or connecting a Bluetooth headset, you might consider buying directly from a store. Sales representatives in Radio Shack, Wal-Mart and other retailers are not required to help you do this, but if you find the right associate at the right time, you might be rolling with the device before you leave the store. Best Buy Mobile’s employees are required to offer this service, through its Walk Out Working policy. Likewise, the carrier-specific stores pride themselves on prepping your new phone  most notably, Sprint, which last year introduced its Ready Now service. Let’s face it: if you don’t know how to do these things yourself, it’ll cost you hours of research and stumbling around the controls to get it done. Your time is probably worth more than the $50 you will have saved, to say nothing of the frustration you’ll endure  or the possibility that you’ll just give up and completely avoid e-mail, Bluetooth headsets, Wi-Fi and everything else that made that shiny new smartphone so enticing in the first place. Quick Calls If you’re overwhelmed by the apps available on iTunes, Apple is trying to help. The company’s Web site recently started Apps for Everything, showing a short list of apps in various categories to help users browse more easily. So instead of slogging through Utilities, you can browse Apps for Moms and Dads. ... MSpot, a mobile media company, began delivering rental movies last week to smartphones on the four major carriers. Movies cost $5 each. Blockbusters can be viewed for 24 hours; others expire after five days. Movies are streamed, so you’ll want a solid connection; or, if you have an iPhone, use Wi-Fi.

The retail outlets operated by the carriers generally offer a wider choice than do the mass merchants. Related All Phone Smart Columns » A device can have vastly different prices depending who is selling it, and since retailers offer a limited selection of phones, it’s hard to trust a salesperson who recommends a certain device, especially when carriers introduce new handsets weekly. It’s getting worse. Carriers seem to believe that everyone wants a shiny new phone for a holiday gift, so new devices are now surging into the market. There is a way to approach the task with a small measure of logic.

Related Bits: Will Consumers Take Their I.S.P.'s to Go? Times Topics: Sprint Nextel Corporation Warren Mell/Clearwire Bill Morrow was hired last spring as chief executive of Clearwire. What does that mean? Sprint’s advertisements do not say. The company assumes that most people, dizzy from the tornado of technobabble, will figure that whatever a G is, when it comes to mobile communications, four of them must certainly be better than three. In many ways, they are right. The fourth generation (the G) of cellphone technology can carry Internet data for smartphones and laptops as much as four times as fast as the current third-generation systems, and within a couple of years, most big carriers in the United States will offer some version of it. For Sprint, getting a head start on introducing 4G may be its best and last chance to repair its position in the market, which has been eroded by the company’s disastrous merger with Nextel and its lapses in customer service. Through Clearwire, an affiliated company in which Sprint owns a 51 percent stake, Sprint is now offering the faster data service on laptops in Baltimore, Portland, Ore., and other cities for a total population of eight million people. By the end of the year, the service will be in 25 markets, including Chicago, Philadelphia and Dallas. A year after that, it hopes to reach about a third of the country’s population, including New York and San Francisco. Verizon Wireless will not start to unveil its 4G network until the middle of next year. And AT&amp;T will come out with its upgrade a year later, although its 3G technology can be upgraded to offer much faster speeds than the system used by Sprint and Verizon. But Sprint’s 4G push comes with huge technical and financial risks. The company is using a technology called WiMax, which was initially developed by Intel to offer wireless service over large distances to computers in homes and offices, not to mobile phones. The rest of the wireless industry has settled on a global standard called L.T.E. (for Long Term Evolution). While it is still in development, some experts say L.T.E. will be able to handle more traffic than WiMax, and the L.T.E. systems planned by AT&amp;T and Verizon would use radio frequencies that penetrate buildings better than those used by Clearwire. Moreover, WiMax proved to be more expensive to deploy than the cash-starved Sprint could afford. Last year, it merged its WiMax effort, initially called Xohm, with Clearwire, a struggling start-up initially backed by Craig McCaw, the cellphone pioneer, that went public in 2007 but ran into its own financing troubles. The combined company raised $3.2 billion from Intel, Google and three cable companies: Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. The new financing created an opportunity to sell Clearwire’s WiMax service in partnership with its cable investors, said Bill Morrow, who was hired last spring as chief executive of Clearwire. “Verizon has 81 million customers and AT&amp;T has 79 million,” Mr. Morrow said. “As I divide the camps, that leaves 90 million for the rest of us to band together and share the costs of the build-out.” Clearwire offers service both for laptops and for home networks, largely in areas that are not well served by existing cable and phone companies. The company is slightly undercutting competitors, offering unlimited broadband for $45 a month, with lower prices for slower speeds and limited usage. Sprint offers a $70-a-month plan that lets laptops connect to Clearwire’s 4G network wherever it is turned on and to Sprint’s 3G network everywhere else. Next year, Sprint will introduce smartphones that can use the faster 4G networks where they are available. Voice traffic will still be handled by Sprint’s current network. Mr. Morrow’s early months at Clearwire have been notable for a fair bit of management turmoil. David Sach, hired in March to be chief financial officer, left in August, taking a $1 million severance check with him. But Mr. Morrow’s biggest problem may be that he needs to raise a lot more money for Clearwire. The company says it needs an additional $2 billion by the end of next year. One possibility is to sell a stake to T-Mobile, which does not have much spectrum for a 4G network. A person briefed on the fund-raising said talks with T-Mobile were at an early stage and Clearwire was also talking to other potential investors as well as current holders that may put more money in. Securing the financing is just the first challenge, according to Philip Cusick of Macquarie Securities. “Trying to build a brand name in the wireless space is going to be really tough,” he said. Clearwire’s shares closed Friday at $8.22 and are down about 25 percent over the last year. One eager investor is Sprint. Dan Hesse, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month that Sprint wanted to preserve its majority ownership. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on September 28, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.Sprint Nextel has taken to boasting that it offers “the first wireless 4G network.” Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Minh Uong/The New York Times Clearwire demonstrated its 4G modem, which uses cell signals for wireless broadband.

It may well, argued Daniel R. Hesse, the chief executive of Sprint Nextel. He said that an increasing number of customers were going to use mobile hot spots -- tiny devices that connect any nearby gadget equipped with Wi-Fi to the Internet using a cellular data network. (In May, David Pogue reviewed one of the first of these hot spots, Novatel's MiFi 2200, above, calling the concept a ''jaw-dropper.'') As devices like digital cameras and portable game machines seek to communicate with the world over the Internet, Mr. Hesse argues, this sort of hot spot is better than trying to put a cellphone connection on each gadget or accepting the one-device limit of a wireless data card for a laptop. ''If it's your iTouch or MP3 player or your netbook or your PC or whatever it might be, even your BlackBerry phone, it can use Wi-Fi to connect to the mobile hot spot to connect to our 3G network,'' Mr. Hesse said. ''You won't need a separate bill for each and every device.'' Mr. Hesse said 425 million computers and other device already have Wi-Fi connections. The one bill you do have will not be small, however. Sprint charges $99, after rebate, for the Novatel device and $59.99 a month for up to five gigabytes of use. Verizon Wireless offers the same device with a range of price plans. Mr. Hesse said the hot spot, MiFi, is selling well, but he expected the concept to take off as Sprint introduces a faster network. He imagines that people will put the hot spots ''in the coffee-cup holder of the car.'' He said, ''As you go down the road, everybody is connected.'' SAUL HANSELL COMMENTIn these frugal times, I would expect that the ''family on the go'' is not going to be the major market for MiFi. $1,200/year seems a significant cost to entertain children in the backseat of the car on a trip. -- Bob Gezelter, Aug. 4 If it works in the home, bye bye cable bill. -- NantucketTom, Aug. 5 PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY BUSINESS WIRE)</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/technology/companies/30sprint.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Nextel Loss Widens as Subscribers Decline<date>Correction: July 31, 2009Published: July 29, 2009</date><text>The telecommunications company Sprint Nextel lost money and customers in the second quarter, even as its management pointed to signs of a turnaround. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Sprint Nextels chief, Dan Hesse, last month. He said Wednesday that the companys network and service were improved. The company said Wednesday that it lost $384 million, or 13 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $344 million, or 12 cents, in the period a year ago. Wall Street had expected a loss of 2 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Sprint’s stock was down 11 percent in early afternoon trading. Revenue declined 10 percent, to $8.1 billion, meeting analysts’ expectations. The company lost 257,000 accounts in the quarter, and now has a total of 48.8 million customers. It lost 991,000 postpaid customers, where it now has 34.4 million over all. Prepaid customers increased by 777,000. Sprint’s marketing continues to be dragged down by public perception of poor service quality, the chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, told investors in a conference call. While Sprint’s network and its customer service have improved, prospective customers have not noticed yet. “It takes a while for perception to catch up with reality,” Mr. Hesse said. “There are no quick fixes.” Sprint’s long-running problems have been compounded by the recession. Business customers, normally its most loyal and profitable segment, have been canceling large blocks of wireless lines. The company has turned to prepaid callers to help offset the loss of business customers and consumers who sign long-term contracts. Prepaid callers, who do not sign a contract, spend less and stay with the company for a shorter period. But Sprint spends less on marketing and on subsidizing a handset to get each prepaid account. Sprint has aggressively pushed its Boost mobile brand, which has a $50-a-month unlimited usage plan. On Tuesday, Sprint said it would buy another prepaid operator, Virgin Mobile USA, which has been using Sprint’s network, paying $420 million in stock while also assuming $205 million in debt. Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said in a note to clients that the Virgin acquisition along with Boost’s growth were “as clear an indication as one could get that Sprint increasingly views itself as primarily a prepaid, not postpaid, wireless operator.” In an interview, Mr. Hesse took issue with that view. “As successful as prepaid is, it doesn’t drive enough incremental profitability to make up for the loss of postpaid subscribers,” Mr. Hesse said. “As you look longer term, we expect the postpaid business to be more important and larger than prepaid,” he added. Still, he said that a growing share of Sprint’s customers would be on prepaid plans. Right now many of the people who do sign up for new contracts with Sprint do so because its prices are lower than those of AT&amp;T and Verizon. Mr. Hesse said that over time, he hoped people would also be attracted by the quality and capability of Sprint’s data network, which will start offering faster service in conjunction with its affiliate Clearwire. Mr. Hesse acknowledged that Sprint also needed more “hero” handsets to compete with Apple’s iPhone on the AT&amp;T network. The company introduced the Palm Pre handset in the second quarter, but it did not release sales figures. Mr. Hesse did say that the Pre was not anywhere as successful for Sprint as the iPhone had been for AT&amp;T. “I don’t think it’s fair to think there will be another iPhone,” Mr. Hesse said. He said that Sprint had a stream of attractive smartphones including the Pre, the Samsung Instinct and the BlackBerry Tour and will add a new phone that uses Google’s Android operating system by the end of the year. “You will see a rolling thunder of really strong devices coming out of Sprint,” Mr. Hesse said. As a sign of a turnaround, Sprint pointed to a decrease in the “churn” levels  the percent of its customers who cancel their accounts. Churn for postpay accounts was 2.05 percent, down from 2.25 percent. (That is still well above the industry leader, Verizon Wireless, which had postpaid churn of 1.01 percent in the second quarter). Churn for the Boost prepaid service also decreased, falling to 6.38 percent, from 6.86 percent in the first quarter. The bigger wireless companies have been increasing the average revenue per user  a crucial indicator in the wireless business  mainly because of higher data sales, but Sprint has been trying to simply keep its postpaid revenue constant at $56 a customer. While its data use is going up, it has been aggressively promoting its $99 unlimited usage plan, which cuts revenue from heavy customers. It said it was benefiting, however, from its improved service quality, meaning it had to give fewer credits to disgruntled customers. Even as it tries to turn around its business, Sprint is carefully hoarding its cash to pay down a heavy debt over the next few years. While the company posted a net loss, largely because of charges to account for the declining value of its acquisition of Nextel, it generated $676 million in cash in the quarter, leaving it with $4.6 billion on hand. Much of the improvement in cash came from a sharp decrease in capital spending. It invested only $227 million in its network and other capital projects in the quarter, down 42 percent from a year ago. The company said that one benefit of its shrinking customer base was that it did not need to spend as much to expand its network. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 31, 2009 An article on Thursday about Sprint Nextel’s quarterly earnings misspelled the surname of an analyst with Sanford C. Berstein &amp; Company who commented on Sprint’s recently announced acquisition of Virgin Mobile USA. He is Craig Moffett, not Moffet.

Prepaid callers, who do not sign a contract, spend less and stay with the company for a shorter period. But Sprint spends less on marketing and on subsidizing a handset to get each prepaid account. Sprint has aggressively pushed its Boost mobile brand, which has a $50-a-month unlimited usage plan. On Tuesday, Sprint said it would buy another prepaid operator, Virgin Mobile USA, which has been using Sprint’s network, paying $420 million in stock while also assuming $205 million in debt. Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said in a note to clients that the Virgin acquisition along with Boost’s growth were “as clear an indication as one could get that Sprint increasingly views itself as primarily a prepaid, not postpaid, wireless operator.” In an interview, Mr. Hesse took issue with that view. “As successful as prepaid is, it doesn’t drive enough incremental profitability to make up for the loss of postpaid subscribers,” Mr. Hesse said. “As you look longer term, we expect the postpaid business to be more important and larger than prepaid,” he added. Still, he said that a growing share of Sprint’s customers would be on prepaid plans. Right now many of the people who do sign up for new contracts with Sprint do so because its prices are lower than those of AT&amp;T and Verizon. Mr. Hesse said that over time, he hoped people would also be attracted by the quality and capability of Sprint’s data network, which will start offering faster service in conjunction with its affiliate Clearwire. Mr. Hesse acknowledged that Sprint also needed more “hero” handsets to compete with Apple’s iPhone on the AT&amp;T network. The company introduced the Palm Pre handset in the second quarter, but it did not release sales figures. Mr. Hesse did say that the Pre was not anywhere as successful for Sprint as the iPhone had been for AT&amp;T. “I don’t think it’s fair to think there will be another iPhone,” Mr. Hesse said. He said that Sprint had a stream of attractive smartphones including the Pre, the Samsung Instinct and the BlackBerry Tour and will add a new phone that uses Google’s Android operating system by the end of the year. “You will see a rolling thunder of really strong devices coming out of Sprint,” Mr. Hesse said. As a sign of a turnaround, Sprint pointed to a decrease in the “churn” levels  the percent of its customers who cancel their accounts. Churn for postpay accounts was 2.05 percent, down from 2.25 percent. (That is still well above the industry leader, Verizon Wireless, which had postpaid churn of 1.01 percent in the second quarter). Churn for the Boost prepaid service also decreased, falling to 6.38 percent, from 6.86 percent in the first quarter. The bigger wireless companies have been increasing the average revenue per user  a crucial indicator in the wireless business  mainly because of higher data sales, but Sprint has been trying to simply keep its postpaid revenue constant at $56 a customer. While its data use is going up, it has been aggressively promoting its $99 unlimited usage plan, which cuts revenue from heavy customers. It said it was benefiting, however, from its improved service quality, meaning it had to give fewer credits to disgruntled customers. Even as it tries to turn around its business, Sprint is carefully hoarding its cash to pay down a heavy debt over the next few years. While the company posted a net loss, largely because of charges to account for the declining value of its acquisition of Nextel, it generated $676 million in cash in the quarter, leaving it with $4.6 billion on hand. Much of the improvement in cash came from a sharp decrease in capital spending. It invested only $227 million in its network and other capital projects in the quarter, down 42 percent from a year ago. The company said that one benefit of its shrinking customer base was that it did not need to spend as much to expand its network.

Berstein &amp; Company who commented on Sprint’s recently announced acquisition of Virgin Mobile USA.

It ascended to the throne after Clearwire introduced WiMax service last winter, giving the city a preview of what the company is slowly building throughout the country. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Stuart Ramson/Intel Clearwire introduced WiMax in Baltimore last year, allowing people to test its service in a preview of what it is building throughout the country. Related Calling the city “wired” is not quite accurate because, HBO series aside, WiMax has little to do with copper; it delivers the Internet through radio signals broadcast from cellphone towers. The service is much faster, though, than what many cellphone networks currently provide with their 3G networks. Indeed, WiMax delivers speeds much faster than many DSL circuits, rivaling many cable modems. I often clock downloads at 6 megabits per second (equivalent to basic cable service in many areas) and uploads at faster than 1 megabit per second. Sprint, one of the owners of Clearwire, calls WiMax a “4G network” to distinguish it from the 3G networks that connect smartphones and offer speeds from 0.4 to 1 megabit per second. To make matters a bit more confusing, Clearwire sells “pre-WiMax” service in 47 cities at speeds that top out at 2 megabits per second. In an effort to clarify the matter, Clearwire is using the brand name “Clear” to apply to full WiMax service. For the last six months, I’ve used a full WiMax/4G equipped netbook to test the service around Baltimore. The Acer Aspire One with a Sprint U300 WiMax card I used is an ideal companion for sending and receiving e-mail messages. It’s small enough to take almost everywhere but it’s large enough to act like a PC  a PC that’s always connected to a very big Wi-Fi hotspot. Adding WiMax to a laptop may make it easier to read e-mail messages often, but the real value of the bandwidth becomes apparent when the PC does something more than just send text. VoIP software like Skype turns it into a video phone, a browser pointed at Hulu acts like a television that can fetch shows on command and there’s also GPS service for finding directions. It’s a smartphone with a normal keyboard and a very open software marketplace. All of the PC software built for the desktop also works with the small package. The U300 attaches to any laptop, but Netbook manufacturers are offering more and more machines with built-in cards. Lenovo, for instance, will add the WiMax/Wi-Fi Link 5150 card to some of their laptops for an additional $30. Prices vary depending on the model. WiMax is also one of the first wireless services that’s being actively marketed to people sitting on their couches at home. Xohm, the brand name originally given to Baltimore’s WiMax service (it’s now being merged into Clearwire and the Xohm brand will disappear), sells a home base station meant to compete directly with DSL or cable for $35 a month, and sometimes there is a short-term discount. A base station and a laptop card together cost $50 a month. The service options are getting complicated and the prices vary in different communities. Comcast, another investor in Clearwire, is starting a wireless service in Portland, Ore., under its own brand name. It will charge $50 a month for service within Portland that is promised to deliver downloads at a rate of 4 megabits per second. Sprint also sells a card that offers both 4G service where WiMax is available and 3G service where Sprint’s cellphone network is all that’s there. It’s a better choice for anyone who travels outside of the cities where WiMax is appearing. Sprint charges $80 for the modem and $80 a month for the service. The WiMax coverage in Baltimore is good but far from comprehensive. The signal blankets downtown and many of the neighborhoods, but it stops just a few blocks from my house. The cellphone tower is on one side of the hill and my house is on the other. Clearwire says that it is slowly expanding coverage but I’ve seen little change in the map over the last few months. WiMax can also suffer from the same problems that affect all wireless services. Rain and snow absorb the signal, reducing the quality of the service during storms, an effect the industry calls “rain fade.” Trees and other plants are filled with water and can cause the same problems even when the sun is shining. Thick walls are also a challenge. Being closer to the tower is always better for service. All of these effects work together, so it’s no surprise that the maps of WiMax service show that early deployment is concentrated in the densest part of the city where trees are rare. That’s where the most people will find the best reception. But wireless also comes with advantages. I’ve averaged about one visit from the phone or cable company every year or so because the copper wires coming to my house need their care. Both services require internal wiring that must either be fished through the walls or the baseboard. Wireless service to the home avoids these problems. The Xohm/Clearwire base station can sit anywhere in the house and it can even be moved, but putting it on a higher floor near a window improves service. If the house isn’t near the tower, it may even help to put it on the closest side of the house where there’s no dense foliage in the path. Using the WiMax laptop card alone also works under the same conditions. The more I used the laptop while traveling around the city, the more aware I became of the time it took Windows to start. While the Internet service may be available everywhere, it took several painful minutes for Windows to boot up. To make matters worse, the U300 card needs its own minute or so to look for a signal. Some netbook manufacturers are experimenting with adding a simpler operating system that can start much faster than Microsoft Windows. These machines can boot up in less than 10 seconds but only by loading a lightweight operating system that offers a few basic services like a Web browser or Skype. The full version of Windows is still available if you need it. Needless to say, offering such a start-up time will change the utility of these microlaptops considerably. Speeding the start-up time will be crucial if the netbooks want to compete with smartphones for casual use by people on the go. The bandwidth is ready to supply full-size applications that augment reality with an endless heavy stream of data. Scott Richardson, chief strategy officer of Clearwire, told me: “I did a demonstration in Portland with some computer industry guys. I was driving down a road going 60 miles per hour and I got a 14 megabits-per-second download.” Portland came online in January of this year and Clearwire just announced that it was selling service in Atlanta and Las Vegas a few weeks ago. This isn’t the end. Clearwire says it’s on to Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Honolulu, Seattle and Charlotte, N.C. They’re all fine cities, even if they don’t all have the same level of baseball and the same fertile source of inspiration for narrative crime dramas.

The mobile phone company agreed to pay $5.50 a share to public shareholders of Virgin Mobile, whose biggest investor is the billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Group. Sprint gains 5.25 million users, expanding a prepaid unit that has added customers while its contract unit has lost them. Sprint had 4.3 million prepaid subscribers, most of which were on the network obtained from Nextel, at the end of the first quarter. Its average monthly bill for contract customers was almost double the $31 the company got from prepaid subscribers. The company is set to report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Sprint is taking a risk by increasing its exposure to the low prices and higher customer turnover of the prepaid market, said Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Company. The company is still recovering from the Nextel acquisition, which led to almost $30 billion in losses from write-downs. Sprint, which already owns 13 percent of the company, will retire Virgin Mobile’s outstanding debt, which it expects to be no more than $205 million net of cash by the end of September. Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kan., plans to complete the acquisition as soon as the fourth quarter. Sprint lost 4.6 million customers last year after the $36 billion Nextel purchase led to complaints about call quality as the company struggled to integrate the Nextel network into its operations. The company wrote down most of the acquisition in 2007. The purchase also increased Sprint’s debt, which stood at $20 billion at the end of the first quarter. Virgin Mobile, which sells Sprint service under its own brand, gives Sprint more customers that buy mobile phone service without a contract, a business that is growing amid the worst economic slump in a half-century. In May, Virgin Mobile it raised its forecast for 2009 earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation and some other items to $127 million to $142 million, from a March projection of $117 million to $132 million.

Exclusivity contracts, with which the Big Four cellphone companies lock in the hottest new phones, are a good place to start looking. But the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice also should look broadly at whether competition is being stifled among mobile providers. Because of exclusivity, unless you are willing to be a hacker, you can use the iPhone only on AT&amp;T’s network, the BlackBerry Storm on Verizon’s and the Palm Pre on Sprint’s. Cellphones from Samsung and LG are also tied up. If you live in a rural community that the large companies aren’t interested in serving, exclusivity generally means you get an outdated handset. With the pattern of exclusive deals extending to new netbooks, smaller companies warn that mobile Web access could be tied up entirely. In the past 10 years, the big cellphone companies have gobbled up smaller ones while regulators looked on. The Big Four  Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile  account for 90 percent of cellphone subscribers. Verizon and AT&amp;T alone have 60 percent. Dozens of areas have but one wireless provider. And they haven’t been shy about using that power. The F.C.C. mandates carriers, for example, to sign roaming contracts for voice services. But data, the fastest-growing and most innovative segment of telecommunications, isn’t covered. Small carriers complain that the big ones won’t enter into data roaming contracts. Verizon and AT&amp;T also control so much of the country’s land-line market that it could hamper the development of new services like mobile Web access, which requires use of wire-line networks. Consumer advocates and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, have warned about scant competition, high prices and onerous contracts in this area. Phone companies point out that exclusivity agreements are commonplace in other industries. For example, they say, it is not often that one finds a restaurant serving Coke and Pepsi. They argue that the iPhone and its imitators are testament to a competitive and innovative market. But many of their practices hinder consumer choice. Consider the decision to block the Skype application on the iPhone from working on AT&amp;T’s 3G network or cellphone contracts that get extended every time you buy a new phone or change your plan. In 2007, the average American cellphone subscriber paid $506 for the year, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. This compares with $374 in Britain and $293 in Spain. The average of all countries in the O.E.C.D. was $439. Regulators’ attention may already be prompting some changes in behavior. Verizon announced it would shorten the exclusivity contracts for some handsets to six months so that rural providers can have them. More is needed, however. The F.C.C. is directed to foster a competitive wireless marketplace, which is an important gateway to the Internet. It warrants close examination.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Telefon AB LM Ericsson | Sprint Nextel Corporation Sprint executives said the seven-year agreement, valued at $4.5 billion to $5 billion, would free a substantial chunk of money that the company intended to use to develop new products and improve network coverage and quality. Steven L. Elfman, president of network operations and wholesale at Sprint, said that while Ericsson would assume day-to-day tasks like maintenance of service and cell towers, Sprint would retain ownership. “Sprint will remain in full control of the network,” Mr. Elfman said in a conference call with reporters and securities analysts. “We own it. We’re not selling it.” Under the deal, 6,000 Sprint employees will be transferred to a subsidiary owned by Ericsson that is based in Overland Park, Kan., close to Sprint’s headquarters there. Sprint, which has been struggling to reverse its fortunes and overcome a reputation for poor customer service, has seen a bit of a rebound lately, particularly with the Palm Pre smartphone, which recently debuted to rave reviews and is available exclusively on Sprint in the United States. Edward Snyder, a telecommunications industry analyst at Charter Equity Research, agreed that the outsourcing deal would free cash for the company, which has struggled with falling revenue and operating losses. “Sprint is doing this out of necessity,” said Mr. Snyder. “The Palm Pre they just released is costing them a pretty penny. It’s a big expense for them.” Sprint declined to provide details on cost savings, but Philip Cusick, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said he expected the network outsourcing and reshuffling employees to amount to an annual savings of $100 million. Roger Entner, an telecom analyst with Nieslen IAG, said that Ericsson was no stranger to handling operations for other mobile phone companies, from Britain to New Zealand. Currently, Ericsson manages networks that serve more than 275 million subscribers worldwide. However, “at 50 million users, Sprint is the largest carrier Ericsson has handled,” said Mr. Entner. “It’s a big deal for Ericsson that they’ve been trusted.” Jan Frykhammar, senior vice president and head of Ericsson’s Global Services, said the company’s extensive experience managing services enabled it to operate the network more cheaply than Sprint. But Mr. Entner said that Sprint needed to be careful that the handoff did not hurt the quality of its voice and data services. “One of the biggest challenges Sprint has now is to convince the American public that the network will be at least as good as it is now when Ericsson is going to run it,” he said. Mr. Elfman said the changes should actually improve Sprint’s service to customers. “With Ericsson doing the day-to-day stuff, we can focus on the quality of the coverage, attention to new products and services that differentiate us from the competition,” he said in a phone interview. Investors seemed to respond favorably: Sprint shares rose 17 cents, or almost 4 percent, to $4.48 by the end of the day. The company’s stock price has nearly doubled since January.

It’s a big expense for them.” Sprint declined to provide details on cost savings, but Philip Cusick, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said he expected the network outsourcing and reshuffling employees to amount to an annual savings of $100 million. Roger Entner, an telecom analyst with Nieslen IAG, said that Ericsson was no stranger to handling operations for other mobile phone companies, from Britain to New Zealand. Currently, Ericsson manages networks that serve more than 275 million subscribers worldwide. However, “at 50 million users, Sprint is the largest carrier Ericsson has handled,” said Mr. Entner. “It’s a big deal for Ericsson that they’ve been trusted.” Jan Frykhammar, senior vice president and head of Ericsson’s Global Services, said the company’s extensive experience managing services enabled it to operate the network more cheaply than Sprint. But Mr. Entner said that Sprint needed to be careful that the handoff did not hurt the quality of its voice and data services. “One of the biggest challenges Sprint has now is to convince the American public that the network will be at least as good as it is now when Ericsson is going to run it,” he said. Mr. Elfman said the changes should actually improve Sprint’s service to customers. “With Ericsson doing the day-to-day stuff, we can focus on the quality of the coverage, attention to new products and services that differentiate us from the competition,” he said in a phone interview. Investors seemed to respond favorably: Sprint shares rose 17 cents, or almost 4 percent, to $4.48 by the end of the day. The company’s stock price has nearly doubled since January.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/business/media/07adco.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Lights, Camera, Action for Concession Coupons<date>Published: July 6, 2009</date><text>FILM producers spend millions every year to draw audiences to their movies. Now, advertisers are beginning to benefit from that, using not only movie screens for their commercials, but the lobbies of cinemas as well. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Sprint is placing kiosks in about 500 movie theaters so customers can scan in a code from their phones to get coupons for snacks. Add to Portfolio Sprint Nextel Corp National CineMedia , Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » This month through December, Sprint Nextel is sponsoring a cinema-centric marketing effort, placing kiosks in about 500 movie theaters nationwide. Sprint customers can scan in a code from their phones, and the kiosks will print coupons, like a free upgrade to a bigger popcorn or larger soda. “We see a very natural affinity between cinemagoers and our target audience,” said Simon McPhillips, director of media for Sprint. With more people going to see films, it’s a good time for Sprint to go to the movies, he added. Companies have been expanding their cinema advertising recently, realizing that theaters are good places to reach audiences that don’t have too many distractions. For years, companies like Screenvision and National CineMedia have been running on-screen commercials before trailers started, and lately they have been offering new products for advertisers. National CineMedia operates TV screens at concession stands that feature ads.  Screenvision has a few new projects in the works: with Cinema Scene, it will expand the number of theaters featuring stand-alone digital panels that replace movie posters. They show trailers or images that can be changed every day, or even every hour. And it will also introduce a backlit ministage that displays a hologram later this year. These stages, about 8 feet by 8 feet, will be placed in theater lobbies, and marketers can use them to display any image they want, like a candy bar or a cellphone. Those are scheduled for limited introduction this year and are more for the “wow” factor than anything else, said Michael Chico, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Screenvision. Sprint, too, is becoming more creative with its cinema spots, Mr. McPhillips said. “People with high mobile phone usage do tend to go to cinemas more than people with lower mobile phone usage,” he said. “Years back, when cinema advertising was just launching, people were a little skeptical on how it would be received. It’s only been around for a relatively short amount of time, but all the research that came back said, despite initial skepticism, people feel that the advertisements are not intruding  in fact, in many ways are complementing  the overall event.” Sprint uses National CineMedia’s network to run what are known as courtesy spots  reminders to silence cellphones  just before the movie (this spring, it added a warning not to text during a movie). Screenvision and Sprint have conducted promotions that ask cinemagoers to choose the best-dressed celebrity from a red-carpet event via text message, or allow consumers to text a certain number and receive a trailer download in return. The idea is not to get moviegoers to switch phone companies then and there, but to show off what Sprint can do, Mr. McPhillips said. “We’ve got a term called brand utility, and what we’re looking to do with brand utility is use the phone as a marketing device, leveraging the benefits of a mobile phone,” he said. “Any marketing is obviously looking to improve people’s perceptions of the brand and bring them closer to the Sprint experience: the ‘Now network,’ living in the now  what that means is being in touch, wanting to get the most out of ‘now,’ whether it’s getting data on your phone or sharing an experience.” Sometimes, as in the red-carpet texting campaign, Sprint allows any cellphone customer to participate. But with the kiosk, Sprint has a different goal. “The first was a reward for their own customers, building that loyalty, and the other was the envy factor,” said Christine Martino, national account director for Screenvision, which brought the idea to Sprint. The kiosk works by instructing Sprint customers to text a certain word (like “Sprint”) to a certain phone number. The customers then receive a text message that includes a string of letters and numbers. The kiosk includes a computer screen next to a scanning device, and people hold up their cellphones, scan that code and can browse through a few offers on the screen. The customers select their offer, and the kiosk prints a receipt that people can take to the concession stand for free upgrades, like a larger popcorn.  Margaret Clerkin, the head of the invention group at Mindshare, Sprint’s media agency and a unit of WPP, said that offering something to Sprint customers was a necessary element. “There’s entertainment value provided by cinema advertising, but there’s also an exchange of value  can you enhance their experience?” she said. The logistics side is relatively simple, Ms. Martino said: a coupon company handles the paperwork, with Sprint paying for the discounts. The kiosks are on Sprint’s 3G network and plug into a regular electrical outlet. The movie theaters and Screenvision have a revenue-sharing agreement for this and other cinema-advertising efforts. Mr. McPhillips declined to say how much the Sprint program cost. While Sprint will receive live data about where and when the program is most popular, along with which cellphone numbers are using it, Mr. McPhillips said he would be careful about using that information. “What I’d rather do is see what data we get, and then we can probably make an appropriate decision,” he said. “At the end of the day, protection of individuals’ data is something we all have to respect.” Though Sprint is the inaugural customer, Screenvision executives suggested other uses for the kiosk  Burger King could offer a discount on a post-show hamburger, for instance. “It’s a direct reward for the consumer,” said Andrew L. Blacker, senior vice president for marketing at Screenvision.

Churn, a measure of customer turnover, was 2.16 percent, down from 2.29 percent a year ago.

Sprint reported a net loss of $1.6 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the fourth quarter. A year ago, the company lost $29.3 billion, or $10.31 a share, which included a $29 billion write-down of Sprint’s 2005 purchase of Nextel. Sprint wrote down an additional $1 billion from the merger and other transactions in the fourth quarter. The company’s revenue declined 14 percent to $8.4 billion, from $9.8 billion.

Skip to next paragraph Related Your Money: Preparing Your Budget for Disaster (January 17, 2009) Add to Portfolio Sprint Nextel Corp Home Depot Inc Pfizer Inc Wyeth Sprint Nextel Corporation Go to your Portfolio » On Monday alone, companies across the employment spectrum announced more than 65,000 job cuts in the United States and around the world, a stark sign that businesses are enduring a painful, protracted downturn. Monday’s toll included 20,000 cuts at Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and mining machinery; 8,000 jobs at the wireless provider Sprint Nextel; 7,000 workers at Home Depot, and 8,000 from the expected merger of the pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and Wyeth. The beleaguered automaker General Motors announced that it would cut shifts at plants in Michigan and Ohio, where the downturn has hit hardest, eliminating some 2,000 jobs. And Texas Instruments said after the market closed on Monday that it would cut 3,400 jobs or 12 percent of its work force through 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 buyouts or retirements. In Europe, the banking and insurance group ING said it would cut 7,000 jobs; the electronics company Philips, 6,000; and the steel maker Corus, 3,500 worldwide. “We’re now into the danger zone,” said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight. “It really becomes pernicious because the uncertainty increases, corporate confidence is badly battered, and you get these severe measures being taken.” President Obama cited the layoff announcements in remarks Monday morning as he urged action on an $825 billion economic stimulus package of tax cuts, emergency benefits and public spending projects. “These are not just numbers on a page,” Mr. Obama said. “As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold. We owe it to each of them and to every single American to act with a sense of urgency and common purpose. We can’t afford distractions and we cannot afford delays.” The United States economy has dropped some 2.59 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, and unemployment rose to 7.2 percent last month. Economists worry that the economy could now be losing as many as 600,000 jobs a month, and they said Monday’s layoff announcements served to underline the stricken state of the labor market. Last week, the government reported that first-time unemployment claims had risen to 589,000 for the week ending Jan. 17, tying a record high set in December. The latest job cuts  and the additional announcements likely to come in a cascading pattern as job losses through the economy cause demand to shrink further and thus lead to more layoffs mean more pain for states, as unemployment insurance claims rise and deplete state coffers. The Obama administration has proposed setting aside $43 billion to help blunt the problem and provide for new recipients of unemployment insurance and existing ones. That money is intended to raise the weekly benefits, to extend how long people can collect those payments and to cover more types of workers, like part-timers. It is largely based upon an estimate that the unemployment rate will peak at 8.3 percent in 2010. But if unemployment reaches the double-digits, as some economists expect, the funding will almost certainly not be enough, economists say. “The economy is deteriorating at a faster clip than even the most dreary forecasts had expected,” said the economist Joseph Brusuelas. “At the current trend, $43 billion will not be sufficient, should we breach 9 percent unemployment and maybe reach into the double digits.” Monday’s announcements only added to a grim parade of job cuts from Wall Street to wireless providers to computer companies to retail stores. Last week, Microsoft announced it would cut 5,000 jobs over the next year and a half; Sony in Japan and Ericcson in Sweden each announced 5,000 layoffs; and the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said it was eliminating 1,000 jobs. Carmakers in Japan, South Korea and Europe have also cut jobs in recent months as did the cellphone maker Nokia. “It steepens the whole downturn,” said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. “The magnitude of these layoffs indicates that the downturn in the labor markets seems to be accelerating.” “This is a big deal,” said Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “We’re losing jobs at an incredibly rapid rate, and even with that, I’m worried they’re accelerating. We’re seeing a much more rapid rate of layoff announcements.” Caterpillar, which has been hurt by falling orders for construction and mining machinery, said Monday morning that it would cull 20,000 workers through layoffs and buyouts. It said it would make “sharp declines” in overtime and eliminate scores of temporary and contract jobs. The company said 2009 would be one of its weakest years since World War II. “These are very uncertain times,” the chief executive, James W. Owens, said in a statement. “While it’s painful for our employees and suppliers, it’s absolutely necessary given economic circumstances. We expect to have most of the actions needed to lower employment and cost levels in place by the end of the first quarter.” “We were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices,” Mr. Owens said. The wireless provider, Sprint Nextel, said its 8,000 job cuts were part of a plan to trim labor costs by $1.2 billion, and said most of the cuts would be completed by March 31. About 850 of the job cuts are expected to come through buyouts, which will cost the company $300 million in severance costs and related expenses. “Labor reductions are always the most difficult action to take, but many companies are finding it necessary in this environment," Sprint’s chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, said. Home Depot, the country’s largest home-supply chain, said it would cut 7,000 jobs, about 2 percent of its work force, and would close its higher-end Expo Design Center business, which includes 34 stores. Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview that the company began exploring ways to save its Expo business months ago, but “as we kept looking at alternatives the business kept getting softer and softer.” With no sign of consumers cracking open their wallets anytime soon, executives simply realized, “we can’t fix it.” Stephanie Rosenbloom and Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.

Last week, Microsoft announced it would cut 5,000 jobs over the next year and a half; Sony in Japan and Ericcson in Sweden each announced 5,000 layoffs; and the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said it was eliminating 1,000 jobs. Carmakers in Japan, South Korea and Europe have also cut jobs in recent months as did the cellphone maker Nokia. “It steepens the whole downturn,” said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. “The magnitude of these layoffs indicates that the downturn in the labor markets seems to be accelerating.” “This is a big deal,” said Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “We’re losing jobs at an incredibly rapid rate, and even with that, I’m worried they’re accelerating. We’re seeing a much more rapid rate of layoff announcements.” Caterpillar, which has been hurt by falling orders for construction and mining machinery, said Monday morning that it would cull 20,000 workers through layoffs and buyouts. It said it would make “sharp declines” in overtime and eliminate scores of temporary and contract jobs. The company said 2009 would be one of its weakest years since World War II. “These are very uncertain times,” the chief executive, James W. Owens, said in a statement. “While it’s painful for our employees and suppliers, it’s absolutely necessary given economic circumstances. We expect to have most of the actions needed to lower employment and cost levels in place by the end of the first quarter.” “We were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices,” Mr. Owens said. The wireless provider, Sprint Nextel, said its 8,000 job cuts were part of a plan to trim labor costs by $1.2 billion, and said most of the cuts would be completed by March 31. About 850 of the job cuts are expected to come through buyouts, which will cost the company $300 million in severance costs and related expenses. “Labor reductions are always the most difficult action to take, but many companies are finding it necessary in this environment," Sprint’s chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, said. Home Depot, the country’s largest home-supply chain, said it would cut 7,000 jobs, about 2 percent of its work force, and would close its higher-end Expo Design Center business, which includes 34 stores. Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview that the company began exploring ways to save its Expo business months ago, but “as we kept looking at alternatives the business kept getting softer and softer.” With no sign of consumers cracking open their wallets anytime soon, executives simply realized, “we can’t fix it.” Stephanie Rosenbloom and Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/business/economy/27layoffs.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Layoffs Spread to More Sectors of the Economy<date>Published: January 26, 2009</date><text>Furloughs, wage reductions, hiring freezes and shorter hours simply did not do enough. A year into this recession, companies across the board are resorting to mass job cuts. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Related Your Money: Preparing Your Budget for Disaster (January 17, 2009) Times Topics: Credit Crisis — The Essentials Home Depot, Caterpillar, Sprint Nextel and at least eight other companies announced on Monday they would cut more than 75,000 jobs in the United States and around the world  a gloomy start to the workweek for employees anxious about holding their own as the economy sinks. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, is slashing its payrolls by 16 percent. Texas Instruments said late in the day that it would eliminate 3,400 jobs, or 12 percent of its work force. Jobs began disappearing in home building and mortgage operations early in the recession, then across finance and banking more generally. Now the ax is falling across large swaths of manufacturing, retailing and information technology, taking out workers from New York to Seattle. Just last week, Microsoft announced its first significant job cuts ever. Because companies like Microsoft have invested in their workers’ skills and knowledge, they usually delay major work force reductions as long as they can. But with orders for new products and services drying up and financing tight, employers are looking to shrink their costs drastically and are slashing their payrolls, anticipating a protracted decline for business in 2009. Monday’s parade of negative news comes after months of announcements from other prominent companies like Citigroup, General Electric, Nokia and Harley-Davidson. As part of its acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer said it would cut the combined workforce by 19,500 employees. On Wednesday, the tally of mass layoffs for December will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Already, the bureau says the United States economy has shed 2.55 million jobs since the recession began, pushing the unemployment rate up to 7.2 percent last month. The latest round of job cuts  and the additional rounds likely to come as these move through the economy  mean more pain ahead for states as unemployment insurance claims rise and deplete state budgets. Congress has proposed setting aside $43 billion to assist the states and to provide for new and current recipients of unemployment checks. That money is intended to increase the weekly benefit amounts; to extend how long people can collect payments; to cover more types of workers, like part-timers; and to help states distribute benefits more quickly. It is based largely on an estimate that the unemployment rate will rise to 8 to 9 percent this year even with a stimulus package, according to the proposal summary from the House Appropriations Committee. But if unemployment soars into double digits, as some economists expect, the financing may not be enough. “The economy is deteriorating at a faster clip than even the most dreary forecasts had expected,” said Joseph Brusuelas, an economist who, bucking the current job market trend, will soon start a new job at Moody’s Economy.com. “At the current trend, $43 billion will not be sufficient should we breach 9 percent unemployment and maybe reach into the double digits.” President Obama cited the layoff announcements in remarks Monday urging Congress to approve an $825 billion economic stimulus package of tax cuts, emergency benefits and public spending projects. “These are not just numbers on a page,” he said. “As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold.” Charles DiGisco, of Randolph, N.J., is one casualty of the downturn. He said he had been looking for work since Sept. 18, when he lost his job as a vice president for sales and marketing at Master Cutlery, a knife maker. He frequently hears a familiar refrain from would-be employers: “We would hire you, but we’re not hiring anybody.” His family’s monthly expenses are four times what Mr. DiGisco collects from unemployment, and he said his family was selling two of its three cars and might dispose of some stocks or dip into retirement funds to keep paying the mortgage. “It takes me 20 years to save it, and it takes me five months to go through it,” Mr. DiGisco said. While stimulus spending on public works may take some time to get going, some companies could bring back displaced workers quickly if the government initiative generated new orders. Caterpillar, for example, had announced buyouts, wage freezes and work stoppages around the holidays because of “a dramatic decline in orders,” said Jim Dugan, a spokesman for the company, based in Peoria, Ill. On Monday, the company said that a total of 15,000 permanent and temporary jobs, out of about 125,000, would have been eliminated by the end of this week, and that it would trim 5,000 more by the end of the first quarter. Should orders for earthmovers and other heavy equipment improve, which some expect as countries around the world start building bridges, highways and other public works to help create jobs, Caterpillar can recall some workers quickly. Many companies, though, may not rush to increase staffs even if business begins to pick up. Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, said downturns often motivate companies to restructure business models permanently, meaning jobs they cut now are unlikely to be replaced. “Structural change is put into overdrive because of the recession,” he said, “so who knows for sure how a company like Microsoft will fare?” Sprint Nextel, which announced Monday that it was eliminating 8,000 jobs, or roughly 14 percent of its work force, is similarly facing some tough restructuring decisions as it continues to hemorrhage subscribers. After a dismal holiday shopping season, retailers are letting employees go in droves. More than 66,600 retailing jobs were lost in December, the worst period since the late 1930s. Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, said Monday it would cut 7,000 jobs, or 2 percent of its workers. Some 5,000 cuts will come through store closings, largely of its upscale Expo chain; the rest will come from corporate support, many at its Atlanta headquarters. Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said the company had explored ways to save Expo, but “as we kept looking at alternatives, the business kept getting softer and softer.” For most of last year, relatively healthy demand for exports gave global companies like Caterpillar a cushion. But with downturns deepening across Europe and Asia, and the dollar strengthening, global demand for costlier American goods has faltered. “There really isn’t any hiding place for companies anymore,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. “The recent numbers coming in from the rest of the world are disastrous.” Jack Healy, Stephanie Rosenbloom, Louis Uchitelle and Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.

But if you bought that new BlackBerry Storm last month, only to find you would rather have something else, you still face contract cancellation fees of up to $175. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Unless, that is, you can find someone to take over that contract for you. It’s a little-known fact that cellphone carriers will let you swap contracts with another person, no matter whether you have one month or two years remaining on your commitment. They just will not help you do the hard work of finding someone who actually wants your contract and the vintage flip phone that came with it. That’s the sort of dirty work best left to the Web, where sites like Celltradeusa.com and Cellswapper.com act as matchmakers for those who want to swap spots in the cellular realm. It costs $20 to use Celltradeusa and $25 for Cellswapper, but for those who feel trapped in a contract, that is a small price to pay for freedom. First things first: why exactly would you want someone else’s cellphone contract? Simple: you can get fairly new devices and accessories, often free, without having to swallow a two-year commitment or pay an activation fee of $35. This is especially useful to those who are waiting for a new device to hit the market but do not want to spring for a new phone in the meantime. This week on Cellswapper, for instance, users were offering free year-old BlackBerrys on all four of the major carriers, as well as Motorola KRZR phones on Verizon Wireless. Similar deals were available on Celltradeusa. The services are easy to use, although they can sometimes cause users a bit of anxiety. Let’s take, for example, the hypothetical Storm owner who has buyer’s remorse after a few weeks with his new toy. On Cellswapper, he would submit details about his carrier (in this case, Verizon), the length of time remaining on the contract and any incentives he can offer. Sometimes the incentive is just the phone, but since many people on these sites own run-of-the-mill devices, they often need to kick in another $50 or more to attract takers. The Storm obviously does not fit this mold because it is still in demand. And among customers of the four major carriers, subscribers to Verizon have a slightly easier time finding takers than the others, according to the cell-swapping sites. Cellswapper would then match the hypothetical Storm owner with Storm seekers in an online chat session. Seekers of new contracts type in their preferred carrier and device, and Cellswapper does the connecting. Buyers can click on a seller’s contract offer and start a one-on-one chat, or they can receive an offer to connect with a particular seller. Cellswapper makes such offers based on buyers’ browsing patterns on the site. If you want to trade your half-used contract for someone else’s half-used contract, Cellswapper lets you specify this preference, then find others who seek the same. Once users confirm that a match has been made, the person who is unloading the contract pays Cellswapper $25. The parties also need to do a little work on their own. The departing customer calls the carrier and informs it that he has found a match. The other party then calls the carrier to confirm, and to give the carrier a chance to review its prospective new customer’s credit record. Sometimes complications arise: customer service representatives for AT&amp;T, for instance, may not make the switch unless you explain that you are executing a “transfer of service,” while Verizon reps prefer to hear that you are seeking a “change of financial responsibility.” Sprint and Helio require a conference call with both parties  a step that can actually make the process easier. Other carriers will sometimes set up a conference call if you request it, Cellswapper’s chief executive, Adam Korbl, said. The new subscriber can, at this point, have the phone number on the device changed. This is an important moment, since the device now has less value to the old subscriber. The seller of the device then typically sends it and the incentive payment to the buyer. Executives of both Cellswapper and Celltradeusa said sellers almost never try to cheat the buyer by keeping the device or selling it elsewhere. Still, the transaction does involve a sort of hold-your-breath moment. The process on Celltradeusa differs only slightly from that on Cellswapper, in that users connect with each other via e-mail messages passed through the Web site. People who want to leave their contracts must pay $20 before they can read offers from interested parties. In one important respect, it is now easier to find a taker for your contract than it was even a few months ago. The major carriers have changed their transfer policies so that if you take on another person’s contract, you need not take on its exact terms. The duration of the contract remains, but if, say, you end up with a $100 monthly family plan with four lines, you can change that to a $40-a-month individual plan. Celltradeusa, which is based in Kearny, N.J., said it generated 1,000 to 2,000 listings over the course of a month. Cellswapper said it carried about 2,000 listings every day, and roughly 200 people found matches weekly. To maximize your chances of finding someone to take on your contract, consider trying both. If you get 25 messages in your Celltradeusa in-box but only a few offers from Cellswapper users, pay the $20 Cell- tradeusa fee and move on to greener pastures.

Mr. Garcia also was chief marketing officer, a job he assumed after the departure of three executives in a shake-up this year.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/technology/08nextel.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Nextel Lost 1.3 Million Customers in Quarter<date>Published: November 7, 2008</date><text>Sprint Nextel, the third-largest mobile service, posted a quarterly loss and weaker revenue on Friday as customers fled to rival services.

(AP)  The Sprint Nextel Corporation lost another 1.3 million wireless subscribers to its competitors during the third quarter, leading the company to post a loss that sent its stock skidding Friday. Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint’s chief executive, told analysts that Sprint Nextel plans to work harder to attract new customers during the coming holiday season but acknowledged, “We have yet to turn the corner.” “We made good progress on our operational priorities in the third quarter and resolved some key issues,” he said. “Still, subscriber losses are too high.” Sprint, the nation’s third-largest wireless provider, said it lost $326 million, or 11 cents a share, for the three months ending Sept. 30. It earned $64 million, or 2 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Sprint Nextel said it would have broken even during the quarter. On that basis, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 3 cents a share. Sprint Nextel’s revenue fell 12 percent, to $8.81 billion, from $10.04 billion. Analysts expected $8.85 billion. Stock in Sprint Nextel, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., fell 31 cents, to $3.37 a share. Since its 2005 acquisition of Nextel Communications, the company has struggled with technical problems, unfocused marketing and difficulties integrating operations. Despite heavy investments to correct those problems, Mr. Hesse said the company still suffered from poor perceptions in the market. Sprint Nextel’s wireless business reported a 13 percent decline in revenue, to $7.5 billion, as its subscriber base fell by 1.3 million. That included 1.1 million customers who have contracts. That was worse than in the second quarter, when Sprint Nextel lost 901,000 subscribers, including 776,000 customers with contracts. Mr. Hesse said the company would focus on slowing the losses of those customers in the fourth quarter. A JPMorgan analyst, Mike McCormack, said in a research note on Friday that Sprint’s subscriber trends and guidance did not signal near-term improvement and that he would continue to warn investors away from the stock, which has lost more than 70 percent of its value this year. Also Friday, Sprint Nextel said it had changed the terms of its credit agreement, reducing the amount it can borrow to $4.5 billion, from $6 billion, but increasing the allowed debt ratio to 4.25 times earnings before taxes and other adjustments, up from 3.5 under the previous deal. Sprint also said it repaid $1 billion of the outstanding loan under the amended credit agreement. Sprint Nextel ranks behind AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless with 50.5 million customers.

The deal successfully ends efforts by Embarq to sell itself. CenturyTel's offer of 1.37 shares for each Embarq share represented a 36 percent premium over Friday's closing price of $40.42, the companies said. ''We expect that bringing Embarq and CenturyTel together will accelerate both companies' strategic plans, diversify our revenues and provide us with the expanded networks, expertise and financial resources to build long-term value for shareholders,'' Glen F. Post III, CenturyTel's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement Monday. Embarq, which runs the original landline services of Sprint Nextel, hired JPMorgan Chase and put itself up for sale at perhaps the worst possible time, September, amid the financial crisis. Faced with the shriveling of the debt markets, which made deal financing virtually unobtainable, CenturyTel decided to make an all-stock bid. Shares in CenturyTel fell 13.2 percent to $25.62 on Monday, making the deal worth about $5 billion at the closing price. Including Embarq's $5.8 billion in debt, the merger is valued at nearly $11 billion. Shares in Embarq rose about 2 percent to $30.38. Both companies have also sought to combine amid a growing wave of consolidation, as industry executives and analysts agree that bigger is increasingly better. Local phone companies have faced increasing pressure as more subscribers drop their landlines and as cable companies offer their own Internet access services. That was reflected in the earnings of both companies, also announced on Monday. CenturyTel reported $82.8 million in third-quarter profit, a 23.5 percent drop from the period a year ago that the company attributed in part to the loss of local phone service customers. Embarq reported $160 million in third-quarter profit, a slight gain from a year ago. While it also lost local phone service customers, its gains in high-speed Internet subscribers offset those losses. The new corporation, whose name has not yet been determined, will have its headquarters in Monroe, La., where CenturyTel is based, though both companies said they would maintain a ''significant presence'' in Embarq's home of Overland Park, Kan. Mr. Post will be chief executive of the merged company, while his counterpart at Embarq, Thomas A. Gerke, will be executive vice chairman. The board will include eight CenturyTel directors and seven Embarq directors. CenturyTel said it would refinance Embarq's bank debt through commitments from Bank of America, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and SunTrust. Among the advisers are several former Lehman Brothers bankers, working for the first time under the Barclays Capital name since the investment bank collapsed in September. Barclays Capital acquired Lehman's capital markets operations out of bankruptcy.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E6DA1131F93BA15753C1A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Big Tech Companies Back Global Plan to Shield Online Speech<date>Published: October 28, 2008</date><text>Google, Microsoft and Yahoo and a group of human rights and public interest organizations plan to introduce Wednesday a global code of conduct that they say will better protect online free speech and privacy against government intrusion. The principles are the starting point for a new effort, called the Global Network Initiative, which commits the companies to ''avoid or minimize the impact of government restrictions on freedom of expression,'' according to a final draft of documents obtained by The New York Times. Stating that privacy is ''a human right and guarantor of human dignity,'' the initiative commits the companies to try to resist overly broad demands for restrictions on freedom of speech and overly broad demands that could compromise the privacy of their users. The initiative was begun after human rights groups and Congress criticized the Internet companies for cooperating with Chinese government censorship and demands for information on dissidents. In addition to laying out the code of conduct, the initiative will provide a non-governmental forum for the companies and human rights groups to jointly resist demands for censorship. It will also establish a system of independent auditors to rate the companies' conduct. ''This is an important first step in providing standards for free expression and privacy that obligate companies to do more to challenge government restrictions,'' said Michael Posner, president of Human Rights First, who agreed to discuss the initiative after The Times obtained the documents. ''It sets up an accountability mechanism that will allow each of the companies to be evaluated over time.'' In addition to the three American companies, two European telecommunications companies, France Télécom and Vodafone, are also considering participating. And members of the initiative are hoping to recruit additional companies. So far, AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications and Sprint Nextel, which were embarrassed in 2005 after it was discovered they were cooperating with the National Security Agency in a warrantless surveillance scheme by the Bush administration, have not signed on. The principles have the backing of prominent human rights organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, Human Rights Watch and Human Rights in China. Business for Social Responsibility and the Center for Democracy and Technology helped lead the two-year talks, and organizations like Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society and the Calvert Group, a socially responsible money manager, also participated. But the effort is already being criticized by some human rights activists. ''After two years of effort, they have ended up with so little,'' said Morton Sklar, executive director of the World Organization for Human Rights USA. ''It is really very little more than a broad statement of support for a general principle without any concrete backup mechanism to ensure that the guidelines will be followed.'' Currently Google, Microsoft's MSN division and Yahoo's Chinese affiliate are all cooperating with the Chinese government's demands that search results be filtered. This month, Canadian researchers revealed that the Chinese version of the Skype Internet chat and telephony client had been modified to permit the logging of chat sessions and storage of the information on server computers belonging to Skype's Chinese partner, Tom, a wireless and Internet company. Yahoo has been harshly criticized for its decision in 2004 to help Chinese authorities identify Shi Tao, a Chinese business reporter, who had sent a brief of a government document calling for press censorship to his private Yahoo e-mail account. Mr. Shi is now serving a 10-year prison sentence. Asked whether the principles would have made a difference in the Shi case, Mr. Sklar said, ''My guess is it wouldn't have had any effect at all.''</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/technology/companies/27deal.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Century Tel Is Said to Be Near Deal to Buy Rival<date>Published: October 27, 2008</date><text>CenturyTel, a provider of local phone and Internet services, was near a deal Sunday night to buy Embarq, its larger competitor and a spinoff from Sprint Nextel, for about $5.76 billion in stock, excluding debt, people briefed on the matter said.

If completed, the deal would mark the successful end of long efforts by Embarq to sell itself amid the tumult in the markets.

Embarq, which runs the original landline services of Sprint Nextel, hired JPMorgan Chase and put itself up for sale at perhaps the worst possible time, September, amid the financial crisis. The ensuing upheaval rattled the stock prices of Embarq and its potential suitors, making it difficult to determine a deal price. It also nearly shut down the credit markets, making obtaining financing virtually impossible for bidders like CenturyTel. CenturyTel instead turned to an all-stock offer, bidding about 1.37 of its shares for each Embarq share, or about $40.42 a share based on CenturyTel’s closing share price of $29.50 on Friday. Under the proposed terms, CenturyTel shareholders would own about 35 percent of the combined company. A deal would mark the latest instance of consolidation in the phone services sector, as industry executives and analysts agree that bigger is increasingly better. In June, Verizon Communications bought Alltel for $28.1 billion, the latest deal in a race by phone companies to expand. CenturyTel and Embarq may feel even more pressure to combine, as more customers cut off their landlines and as cable companies offer their own Internet access services. Embarq reported a 3.5 percent drop in its second-quarter revenue in July, and it said in August that it would seek to cut as many as 700 employees. Embarq, based in Overland Park, Kan., has publicly signaled its interest in industry consolidation. At a conference last month, Thomas Gerke, the company’s chief executive, said, “We’d certainly be, and have always been, open to looking at that.” As of Dec. 31, the company had about 18,000 employees and operated in 18 states. Its shares have fallen about 40 percent this year, closing on Friday at $29.74. CenturyTel, based in Monroe, La., provides services to small to midsize cities located mostly in the Midwest and South. As of Dec. 31, the company had about 6,600 employees and operated in 25 states. In August, it reported a 4.4 percent drop in revenue for its second quarter.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Stuart Ramson/Intel WiMax, the technology behind Sprint's Xohm service, was recently tested in Baltimore. Related All Wi-Fi Coverage Enlarge This Image The Nokia N810 WiMax Edition uses WiMax chips. That’s the idea behind a new service from Sprint called Xohm, which takes Wi-Fi to its logical extreme. Fittingly, the technology behind it is called WiMax. Although it isn’t widely deployed in the United States, a test run of the service in Baltimore, where it was recently introduced, suggests that it could one day become a solid option for getting things done online and even making phone calls while on the go. Of course, there are plenty of reasons the technology could also become a historical footnote, not the least of which is that it won’t work everywhere in a given city, much less all over the country. So-called mobile hot spot Internet services sold by cell carriers, including Sprint, have much greater range. But for those living in an area Xohm covers  the service arrives in Washington and Chicago in the coming months, with Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, Fort Worth and Providence, R.I., to follow  the monthly outlay of $35 to $65 could be well worth it. For $35, subscribers get home broadband service that they can share among multiple computers; $45 lets you connect at home or on the road with one laptop or other mobile device, and $65 broadens that to cover multiple devices. The prospect of getting speedy wireless service outside your house while also tearing up your contract with your home Internet service may appeal to many, because that combination is not available with data services from cell carriers. Actually, most Xohm customers will have to pay something beyond that. To receive the signal, you need a Windows laptop with a WiMax chip, and only eight WiMax-ready machines are on the market. (The cheapest is a Lenovo SL500 for $570. I used a $2,560 Lenovo X301.) If you don’t own one of those, you’ll need a wireless dongle or PC card ($60), and to set up a home network, you need a Xohm router ($80). If you’re just stopping into a Xohm city and you have the right equipment, you can buy 24-hour access for $10. Once you are in a coverage area, the service works much like a home Wi-Fi connection, where you don’t need to type in a password each time you log on. Rather, after you sign up, the network recognizes your device whenever you’re in range of the signal. When I visited Baltimore last week, Xohm operated at broadband speed no matter what kind of demands I put on it. I opened multiple browser windows, simultaneously streaming videos in each, without a hiccup. I ducked into alleys and hotel room corners and the connection still sped along nicely. So how does the speed stack up against wired and unwired competitors? Time Warner, which charges about $50 a month for cable Internet service, averaged 3 megabits a second for downloading in New York on Monday, and 1 megabit a second for uploading, according to Keynote Systems, a mobile and Internet monitoring firm. Xohm’s connections can be faster than that; the company is aiming to provide 4 megabits a second for downloading and 1.5 for uploads. Wireless Internet services from cell carriers come in various speeds, but AT&amp;T’s Broadband Connect service, as an example, is much slower than Xohm. It averages 400 to 700 kilobits a second for downloads, and a maximum of 384 kilobits a second for uploads. That service costs $20 to $60 a month depending on data use. Individual results, as they say in weight-loss and investing seminars, may vary. Because Xohm was turned on only last month, I shared the WiMax signal with just a handful of people. But soon the network will be carrying the load of thousands of file-swapping, video-downloading bandwidth hogs. Xohm says that once the system has more users, it will either add more transmission towers or offer tiered service, forcing some people to pay more for faster data speeds. The type of device you use will also affect speed  and here’s where the WiMax story starts to get more interesting, or more complicated, depending on your stance. Xohm says that because WiMax chips are cheaper to produce than the communications chips in many smartphones, it expects manufacturers to introduce an array of new devices that can connect to the Web. The first such device is the Nokia N810 WiMax Edition, a hand-held PC of sorts that went on sale last week for $493. The Nokia is a little bigger and a lot heavier than an iPhone, and it includes a big touch screen, but you can’t use it to make standard cellphone calls. Rather, you use it with Internet telephony software like Skype or Gizmo5, and simply make calls or set up video chats that way. Video chats and phone calls over wireless Internet signals can be unstable, said Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester Research, and it remains to be seen how reliable they’ll be on Xohm. Web surfing on the Nokia was noticeably quicker than on a 3G iPhone, but it wasn’t exactly fast. Watching NFL.com video highlights on the Nokia, I had a flashback to the days of 56k modems, when everything moved in fits and starts. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on October 23, 2008, on page B7 of the New York edition.What if you could take along your strong and speedy home Wi-Fi connection wherever you go?

Related Times Topics: Credit Crisis  The Essentials For the last year Mr. Hesse has been trying to turn the beleaguered Sprint around. And in some areas he is making progress. In a report released last week by Pali Research, Sprint has improved its customer care response times, ranking first in a survey of peers. He has cut costs, with more belt-tightening to come. And he has, literally, put himself out there, imploring customers in television ads to give Sprint another chance. But at the same time, said Craig Moffett, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, “he’s still presiding over a business with deep structural problems.” And those are not going away soon. “He’s got to play the set of cards he’s been dealt,” David Barden, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a recent report, adding that “tougher days will follow.” As a result, Mr. Hesse, he said, “will be called upon to demonstrate real competitiveness. For a sustainable rally in Sprint shares, the business must get better, not simply stop getting worse.” Mr. Moffett and other analysts warned that the recent credit problems could hurt Sprint because the cost of borrowing money was rising. Sprint has already taken steps to strengthen its balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, the company had $23 billion in debt, $3.5 billion in cash and free cash coming in. Most analysts expect that Sprint will use cash on hand as well as money it saved cutting costs to reduce its debt by $1 billion in the third quarter. Next year Sprint must pay a $600 million note coming due. But what gives analysts pause is whether Sprint will be able to maintain certain debt ratios to meet covenants that guarantee, among other things, a lower interest rate on its debt. If it does not, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at Pali Research, Sprint would technically be in default and could be forced to pay a higher rate. That, too, could make it harder for Sprint to obtain capital if it is needed in the future. A spokesman for the company, James Fisher, said Sprint expected to meet loan provisions and to meet those covenants. Some analysts lowered earnings estimates for Sprint recently, fearing tighter credit would restrict its ability to get financing. Others predicted more customers would defect. And its stock is trading near an all-time low, closing at $3.55 a share on Monday. Sprint continues to face its toughest competition in years. John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS Investment Bank, said he expected Sprint to report the defection of 1.1 million customers in the third quarter, one of its largest losses ever. Sprint announces its third-quarter results on Nov. 7. Fewer customers are signing up for new service, he said, while, at the same time, others are switching to competitors. Wireless companies measure how happy consumers are based on churn, or the number of customers who switch to a different carrier each month. Verizon’s and AT&amp;T’s percentages are low, about 1 percent, compared with Sprint which has twice that. Mr. Fisher said Sprint expected a “seasonal uptick” in churn, but some of that is by design as Sprint has been getting rid of its least-creditworthy customers. Mr. Piecyk said it was unrealistic that Sprint would suffer more mass defections. “Sprint has purged a lot,” he said. And it is more successful getting customers to renew contracts. Now, said Mr. Piecyk, 8 percent of customers each quarter renew early, compared with 3 percent 2 years ago. But at the same time the company is trimming the number of risky customers in one part of the business, it is chasing them in another. Recently Sprint said Boost Mobile, a division that aims at teenagers and young adults, began courting what Mr. Fisher called “cash- and credit-challenged” adults ages 18 to 34. He said it posed less risk for Sprint because the company was paid cash upfront. Tighter credit markets have also made it less likely a buyer would quickly emerge for Sprint’s iDen division which was acquired in the Nextel merger in 2005. IDen phones and other equipment are largely used by municipal employees. Analysts agree Sprint is looking for about $5 billion, but they are skeptical it would get that for iDen. Of course, with Sprint’s market capitalization now at about $10 billion, Sprint is looking like a bargain acquisition itself. Which company could acquire them, though, or whether one would choose to invest is another question. Analysts agree that AT&amp;T and Verizon would be hard-pressed given antitrust concerns. Sprint flirted this year with SK Telecom of South Korea discussing among other things a partnership, according to people apprised of those talks. Last year, Sprint turned down a $5 billion offer from SK Telecom and Providence Equity Partners, which were interested in buying a minority stake. Mr. Fisher said Sprint would not comment on rumor or speculation. “If somebody would acquire them it would be an international acquirer or a very adventurous private equity fund,” said Roger Entner, a senior vice president for IAG Research, a market research firm. “The question is do they want all the headaches.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on October 21, 2008, on page B3 of the New York edition.Dan Hesse, the chief executive of Sprint Nextel, has not found it an easy task righting the wireless carrier that is losing customers at twice the rate of its larger rivals.

Skip to next paragraph The Airave from Sprint is designed to strengthen cellphones signals in customers' homes. Related All Cellphone Coverage So why must cellphone users still live with the same irritations? Anyone old enough to remember extending a cellphone antenna to start a call also knows how much better cell reception is now than in the 1990s. But cell users still often live on the razor’s edge between a conversation and a soliloquy. And it is not improving very fast. Nearly 20 percent of the wireless calls in North America and Europe have unacceptable voice quality, says Ditech Networks, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that sells voice improvement technology to network carriers. Ditech has no comparative data to discern a trend and it would not disclose how the various carriers stacked up. But Karl Brown, a company vice president, said: “My gut is that things are getting worse. We’re using our cellphones in more places, we’re trying to turn them into speakerphones, which generates echoes, and we’re buying Bluetooth headsets that have problems picking up background noise.” You can also blame the carriers for not keeping pace with demand, especially in suburban areas. There, networks fight not-in-my-backyard battles with residents when they try to situate new cell towers to accommodate ever-chattier subscribers. Those customers shouldn’t expect a great leap forward in call quality anytime soon, said Shiv K. Bakhshi, an analyst for IDC, a market consulting firm. Networks, he said, do not always have the capacity to satisfy peak demand from customers without glitches. “Which is the way it always is,” he said. Carriers have no economic incentive to build capacity so quickly that they outpace demand, but nor will they let voice quality drop so much that subscribers bolt en masse. “On average, I think voice quality is pretty good. We can understand each other,” he said. Maybe at that particular moment. Mr. Bakhshi was using the AT&amp;T wireless network in Seattle, and the line noise rendered his statements unintelligible, as in: “The cost of deploying a network in ... that every single nook and cranny is covered with equal ... is ... part.” The same glitches happen on every wireless network, of course, which is perhaps why AT&amp;T was slightly defensive when asked about this one. Mark Siegel, an AT&amp;T spokesman, declared the state of cellphone quality “excellent.” “We continue to add new capacity in places where we weren’t before,” Mr. Siegel said, “and enhance the capacity of the service we already have, and I think you’ll find it true of other carriers as well.” Perhaps, but Sprint, which has recently been much more forthcoming about its faults as it tries to improve its customer service reputation, is striking a different tone. The company in late July began selling Airaves, or miniature cellphone towers, to strengthen cell signals in customers’ homes. The devices, which cost $99 (and a $5 monthly subscription), plug into a customer’s broadband Internet connection and support up to three simultaneous Sprint calls. Kevin Packingham, a Sprint senior vice president, said the company is also giving the devices away and waiving the $5 monthly fee to customers who complain about poor coverage at home. (Note to Sprint subscribers: it’s not a complete gimme. The company must first verify that you’ve experienced dropped calls.) The device could help jittery customers finally sever themselves from landline telephone service, Mr. Packingham said, since subscribers have lingering fears about not being able to get a signal to dial 911, for instance, or make business calls from home. “Five years ago, customers expected their call to drop,” he said. “Now people expect crystal-clear quality, so these hiccups on the network have suddenly become very frustrating to subscribers.” At the same time, though, there are signs that consumers are coming to terms with the state of call quality. ComScore, a technology research firm, recently found that price has edged out signal quality as the top reason for switching networks. Industry data suggests the so-called churn rate, the percentage of customers that switch networks, stands at a modest 1.2 percent, or about half of what it was three years ago. Whether that’s because consumers are happy with their cell coverage, or whether they simply don’t expect better coverage from anyone else, is an open question. (Mr. Packingham, for one, said the networks are “within spitting distance of each other” when it comes to voice quality.) Handset makers, meanwhile, are trying to pick up the slack with some high tech gadgetry of their own. Motorola last year began building technology into its handsets that recognizes the difference between voice and background noise, minimizing noise before the sounds reach the listener. Customer complaints and returns dropped significantly. Nokia, for its part, has begun selling a phone, the 6220 Classic, that transmits the compressed voice data in high-definition, essentially polishing the speaker’s voice before it hits your ear. Sounds great? Not so fast. Carriers must also adopt the technology before its effects can be heard by subscribers, and while carriers are working on it, none has yet done so. In other words ... consumers ... wait if ... as good as ... Internet connection. Quick Calls ¶Mobile phones will display the number of the incoming caller, but unless you recognize the number, that’s little help. Privus Mobile recently introduced a new caller ID service for cellphone users that looks much like that of conventional landline services.

But the company says it lost some of them on purpose. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Competition for Customers Related Sprint Nextel Press Release Qwest Press Release Add to Portfolio Sprint Nextel Corp Go to your Portfolio » Meanwhile its chief rivals, AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, respectively gained 1.3 million and 1.5 million new wireless customers. As customers tighten their spending during rough economic times and when nearly nine out of every 10 Americans already own a cellphone, winning customers from a competitor is the only way to grow quickly. And at that task, analysts say, Sprint is struggling. Daniel R. Hesse, who has been chief executive of the company since January, said that Sprint had deliberately rid itself of some of those 901,000 customers. Mr. Hesse said Sprint tightened credit standards in order to focus on keeping dependable mobile phone customers who have the money to pay their monthly bills. “We did it knowingly,” he said. “We are interested in quality, not quantity.” Sprint said Wednesday that it now has 51.9 million customers. Mr. Hesse, who appears in ads for Sprint, said the failure to attract new customers was because customers did not know that Sprint had improved. But the customer losses left some analysts pondering what Sprint’s prospects are. “It’s fine to say you are getting rid of undesirable customers, but that means you have to make significant growth someplace else to make up for it,” said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at Pali Research who covers wireless companies. “It’s a company in perpetual decline.” By some measures though, Mr. Hesse’s strategy is working. Sprint lost 1.1 million customers in the first quarter. Sprint reduced churn  the percentage of customers who drop service or go to a rival  by 45 basis points, to 2 percent, in the second quarter, the best since Sprint merged with Nextel in 2005. But the company’s churn is still a far cry from the 1 percent at AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless. And it warned that there would be more customer defections in the coming months. Still, Mr. Hesse contended, “we overdelivered,” referring to improved profit margins resulting from cost cutting. Despite that, Mr. Hesse acknowledged the fragile nature of Sprint’s turnaround. “We are not in a position to deliver sustained revenue growth, but we believe we have a good plan in place,” he told analysts in a conference call Wednesday morning after announcing the company’s second-quarter financial results. Sprint reported a loss of $344 million, or 12 cents a share. A year ago it earned $19 million, or one cent a share. Revenue in the quarter fell 11 percent to $9 billion, from $10.2 billion a year earlier. The loss includes $149 million in pretax charges for severance, exit costs and asset impairments and other minor costs tied to its 2005 purchase of Nextel. Not counting one-time items, Sprint said it would have earned 6 cents a share. Mr. Hesse said the company’s “Simply Everything” plan, a $100 flat fee plan that includes voice and data services, was popular with new and existing customers. And the Instinct handset, the company’s answer to the iPhone, was offered first to existing customers and helped Sprint retain customers who otherwise might have left. But Mr. Piecyk, the analyst, wondered instead if Sprint was “being managed for a potential sale, not growth.” It is possible, Mr. Piecyk and other analysts said, that Sprint is hoping to sell or spin off assets not associated with the consumer business. Mr. Hesse declined to comment on whether he was readying the company for a sale. “My view is to create a great company,” he said. Still, he added, “I don’t have a crystal ball about what will happen down the line.” Sprint recently held talks with SK Telecom of South Korea to share information about mobile phones and other technology, according to people briefed on those talks. The two companies also discussed whether SK Telecom would consider a minority investment in Sprint  about $5 billion  but the discussions, which were held informally, have so far have not brought a cash infusion. Instead, Sprint said on Wednesday that it hoped to raise $3 billion by selling three million shares of convertible preferred stock. Sprint said it had $4.7 billion in cash and available credit and planned to reduce debt by $1 billion. At the same time Sprint continues to cut costs. “Sprint appears to be building/holding cash, arguably out of fears of a liquidity crunch in 2009,” wrote Craig E. Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. While Mr. Moffett said that there were clear signs of improvement at Sprint, the company “remains in need of major surgery.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on August 7, 2008, on page C1 of the New York edition.Sprint Nextel, the troubled No. 3 wireless carrier, lost nearly a million customers in the second quarter.

Related Bits: New LiMo Cellphones Protect and Surf (August 4, 2008) Enlarge This Image Ralph de la Vega of AT&amp;T, which is the exclusive provider of phone service for the iPhone. Consumers have long been frustrated with how much control carriers  AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and the like  have exerted over what they could download to their mobile phones. But in the last nine months, carriers, software developers and cellphone makers have embraced a new attitude of openness toward consumers. Verizon Wireless, which said in November that it would open its network to any device maker that could create a mobile phone compatible with its network, has already welcomed a few business-oriented devices. It hopes to announce new consumer phones in the coming months. When the world’s largest cellphone maker, Nokia, recently took full ownership of Symbian, which owns a popular mobile operating system, it agreed to share the software with other phone makers. And on Monday, the LiMo Foundation, an alliance of companies promoting a rival operating system open to makers of all wireless devices, is announcing that seven new mobile phones would use that system, bringing the number to 21. AT&amp;T, like Verizon, has followed suit with a promise to also open its networks. But the pressure on AT&amp;T is also coming from another direction: Apple, its iPhone partner. AT&amp;T has no control over the applications downloaded to the iPhones, which AT&amp;T offers exclusively. But the proliferation of new applications and the realization that they only make cellphones more popular has convinced executives there that they need to give consumers more freedom. The industry, of course, has selfish reasons for promoting openness. Applications spur the use of higher-priced wireless data plans and the purchase of more expensive smartphones. “What is most important for us is to have a customer sign up for a plan," said Ralph de la Vega, who is in charge of AT&amp;T’s wireless unit. “We think we can have multiple ways to make money.” Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists are already salivating over the enthusiasm for cellphone applications. Their investments in this category rose 90 percent in the first half of 2008, to $383 million, from the second half of 2007, according to Rutberg &amp; Company, a technology research firm based in San Francisco. Analysts and industry executives agree that Apple, a new entrant to the cellphone market, deserves credit for spurring the carriers and cellphone makers to change. But there is something bigger at play, too. The market for smartphones, which are really handheld computers, has quickly expanded beyond business users. They have gone mainstream, with teenagers and women finding novel uses for them  texting snippets of their lives to friends or tracking friends on maps. The carriers and the handset makers realize they have to make the phones adaptable to those new customers. “What is happening is inevitable,” said Walter Piecyk, a communications analyst at the research firm Pali Research who studies the mobile phone market. “Companies can’t really stop it. They might as well embrace it. Consumers are demanding these types of devices, which is good for everyone.” Of course, consumers should be careful what they wish for. Already there are at least six major operating systems for cellphones  Linux, Symbian and BlackBerry, as well as those made by Microsoft, Palm and Apple. And more are coming. Google expects the first phones in its Open Handset Alliance, which will use its Google Mobile operating system, to be out this fall. Consumers may find it confusing that some applications work only for certain phones because developers do not have the time or money to adapt projects to every operating system. Consumers will also come to realize that “open” comes with an asterisk. The word means what the carriers, handset makers and software developers want it to mean. For example, Verizon’s open system is “open” only to phones it has certified. IPhone users can download only the applications Apple has approved. Still, many developers agree that Apple is less restrictive than AT&amp;T or Verizon. “While the iPhone is closed, it does have the openness characteristics, which are unique,” said Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and a proponent of more open networks. If consumers are curious about what the mobile phone of the future might look like, they have to look no farther than OpenMoko, a Taiwanese cellphone maker that began selling the Neo Freerunner in July. The Freerunner, a six-ounce phone that sells for $400 and works on the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T networks, has a three-inch touch screen and data storage, like many other smartphones. But what makes it unusual is that technologically savvy buyers can create or download personalized programs. “What we want to do is bring the openness of the personal computer to the phone,” said Michael Shiloh, who is in charge of developer relations at OpenMoko. “We want people to be able to play around. You can’t do that now on a mobile phone.” For now, Neo Freerunner is not a mainstream device. But a group of archeologists, Mr. Shiloh said, have developed a program that allowed them to create maps using Global Positioning System technology that more precisely catalog finds at their archeological sites. And he envisioned a day when creative programmers could combine different tools, like Wikipedia, directories and G.P.S., to create uniquely personalized phone applications. Mr. Shiloh said his 13-year-old daughter told him recently that she wanted to create her own mobile games. “To some extent, it may sound geeky,” Mr. Shiloh said. “But considering we have a population of people who have grown up creating their own Web pages, it’s not unfathomable.” With independence, consumers develop a relationship not with their carrier but with the phone or the applications on the phone. Google, one of the most strident proponents of the move to openness, is certainly aware of that as it builds an operating system that could allow anyone to add applications to any phone using Google Mobile software  without going through a carrier. “If I’m a developer, my job is to surprise and delight as many people as I can,” said Matt Waddell, a product manager for Google Mobile. “That’s hard right now because of this fragmentation. We want that to go away for very selfish reasons. We can tell people to go to Google.” He added: “The Internet is not owned by any one company.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on August 4, 2008, on page C1 of the New York edition.In the first 10 days after Apple opened its App Store for the iPhone, consumers downloaded more than 25 million applications, ranging from games like Super Monkey Ball to tools like New York City subway maps. It was nothing short of revolutionary, not only because the number was so high but also because iPhone users could do it at all.

Consumers have long been frustrated with how much control carriers  AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and the like  have exerted over what they could download to their mobile phones. But in the last nine months, carriers, software developers and cellphone makers have embraced a new attitude of openness toward consumers. Verizon Wireless, which said in November that it would open its network to any device maker that could create a mobile phone compatible with its network, has already welcomed a few business-oriented devices. It hopes to announce new consumer phones in the coming months. When the world’s largest cellphone maker, Nokia, recently took full ownership of Symbian, which owns a popular mobile operating system, it agreed to share the software with other phone makers. And on Monday, the LiMo Foundation, an alliance of companies promoting a rival operating system open to makers of all wireless devices, is announcing that seven new mobile phones would use that system, bringing the number to 21. AT&amp;T, like Verizon, has followed suit with a promise to also open its networks. But the pressure on AT&amp;T is also coming from another direction: Apple, its iPhone partner. AT&amp;T has no control over the applications downloaded to the iPhones, which AT&amp;T offers exclusively. But the proliferation of new applications and the realization that they only make cellphones more popular has convinced executives there that they need to give consumers more freedom.

The loss widened to $113 million, or 23 cents a share, from $37 million, or 7 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results included $67 million in revamping charges. “The macro environment in the U.S. and the U.S. carrier spend continues to be challenging,” the chief executive Mike Zafirovski told analysts. He said the slowdown in the United States had hurt sales related to CDMA, or Code Division Multiple Access, wireless technology. This has already started to show up in Nortel’s results: its orders fell to $2.15 billion in the quarter, from $2.68 billion a year earlier, mostly because of a weaker CDMA market in North America and lower orders from the company’s joint venture with South Korea’s LG Electronics. CDMA is one of several widely used mobile communications technologies for networks that offer cellphone service. Edward Snyder, principal analyst at Charter Equity Research, said it could be 2009 before CDMA spending recovers as major carriers like Sprint and Verizon clamp down on spending. “Obviously, the quarter is a disappointment to the Street,” Mr. Snyder said. He said the company did well at controlling costs and keeping margins steady. Revenue rose 2 percent to $2.62 billion from $2.56 billion, exceeding the analysts’ average estimate of $2.51 billion. But that was partly because of a deferred revenue release during the quarter. Nortel has recently cut hundreds of jobs and moved others to Asia, where costs are lower, as part of its effort to bring down expenses.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Brandon Kruse/The Gainesville Sun An AT&amp;T store in Gainesville, Fla. AT&amp;T is the exclusive provider of service for the Apple iPhone. Related Times Topics: AT&amp;T But AT&amp;T, the biggest telecommunications company in the United States, has a problem: analysts say consumers are dropping traditional landlines faster than expected. The company, which still gets 32 percent of its revenue from its landline business, reports its second-quarter financial results Wednesday and is expected to talk about how its traditional phone service is contracting. AT&amp;T is not the only company facing a changing environment in the communications business. All of the major telecommunications companies  AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint Nextel  are figuring out how to make more money from customers as they spend more time sending text messages or browsing the Web on their wireless phones, rather than talking. At the same time, as the American cellphone market gets saturated  nearly 85 percent of American consumers already own a mobile phone  phone companies are finding that growth is slowing. With more options, mobile phone buyers are also becoming more selective about the calling plans and the type of phones they want, making the market even more competitive. “In short order, sentiment in the telecom sector has gone from bullish to guarded to ... well, slightly queasy,” Craig Moffett, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company who follows communications companies, wrote in a recent report. Wireless phones are, by far, more common than landlines. According to CTIA, the wireless industry’s trade group based in Washington, there are 262 million wireless subscribers in the United States. In contrast, the Federal Communications Commission counts 163 million business and residential landlines as of June 2007, its latest report. Analysts say that AT&amp;T will report a decline in the number of its traditional landline subscribers. A spokesman for AT&amp;T said executives could not comment ahead of earnings. Currently the company has 60.4 million traditional landlines  in contrast to 68.7 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2006  and 71.4 million wireless subscribers. AT&amp;T has been losing landline subscribers each quarter at an accelerated rate since 2006. It dropped 7.4 percent in 2007. Analysts think that the economic downturn could also have an impact on the landline business. They say consumers looking to cut expenses will drop their landline  which can cost up to $60 a month  before they drop their wireless phone plan. “I think AT&amp;T is pedaling as fast as it can to transform themselves from a wire line to a wireless company,” Mr. Moffett said. “To a degree it is working.” The question, though, he said, is “is it fast enough?” Analysts also expect it will report slower growth in its wireless business as well. Verizon, which reports its second-quarter results on Monday, also is seeing slower growth. On Tuesday, Verizon Wireless said it added 1.5 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2008, the same number it added in its first quarter. Both numbers are down, though, from the fourth quarter in 2007, which was two million new subscribers. Verizon Wireless, which is a partnership between Verizon and Vodafone, has 68.7 million subscribers. “It’s still very strong,” said Roger Entner, a senior vice president for Nielsen IAG, a market research firm. But compared with earlier figures, he said, it “is indicative of a slowdown.” Verizon, too, is not immune from customer losses in its landline business. According to the report by Mr. Moffett, Verizon is vulnerable in the East Coast where it has a high percentage of customers. Despite the loss of customers, companies will still need to spend to upgrade their networks. (Verizon currently has 40.5 million traditional landlines.) A spokesman for Verizon said executives were not available to speak until its financial results were announced. Mr. Entner said AT&amp;T and Verizon would have to sell customers more services to make up for the decline in traditional landline revenue. It is why they, particularly Verizon, are aggressively competing with cable companies to sell Internet and television services, bundled with traditional and wireless phone service. “If you own a home business, they are going to want to sell you not only a line for your home, but one for your office too,” Mr. Entner said. “They are going to want to sell you more, more of everything.” Keeping customers, along with acquiring new ones, is of paramount importance. Sprint, the No. 3 wireless carrier in the United States, has sought to stem the tide of customer defections of its wireless service. In the first quarter of 2008, 1.1 million of Sprint Nextel’s 53.9 million customers fled, and churn  a measure of turnover and therefore how unhappy customers are  was on the rise. It announces its financial results on Aug. 6. “The big carriers have fed on Sprint Nextel,” Mr. Entner said. “But there comes a time when all the people who want to leave have already left.” A bright spot, at least in the case of AT&amp;T, is the debut of the latest iPhone. With a subsidized price of $199, it is sure to attract new customers, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst with Pali Research. “Economically, it turns out great for them,” he said, because new customers are required to sign a two-year contract to get the subsidized price. Carriers are seeking to address declining revenue in the landline business several ways besides focusing on the wireless business and bundling calling plans with Internet and television service. It would not be inconceivable, said one telecommunications executive who declined to be named because he was not authorized to discuss his company’s plans, that in the next 10 years, carriers could entice their least profitable landline customers to give up their old-fashioned phones for free or deeply discounted wireless service.

But can they shred on a Nokia? Skip to next paragraph As of May, Guitar Hero's mobile version ranked ninth among top-selling games. Cue the pinky-and-index-finger salute. The answer is a resounding “yes.” Cellphone carriers are introducing a mobile version of the rock music game, by Activision, and customers are subscribing at a pace that could make it the most successful console-to-cellphone crossover game in history. As the cellphone rapidly emerges as the next computing platform, games would seem to be a natural application. For consumers, the trend could lead to big improvements in mobile gaming  a market that has fallen far short of projections. But for now the Guitar Hero phenomenon is a lot like Jimi Hendrix, circa 1968: a groundbreaking talent with a backup cast destined for obscurity. Drag a finger down the list of top-selling games for phones from the mobile industry statistics firm M:Metrics, for instance, and an array of yawners passes by  sorry, Tetris fans  before hitting a really engaging game. As of May, the latest period for which M:Metrics provided data, Guitar Hero’s mobile version ranked ninth, but it was a nine with a bullet, having climbed from the 85 spot in three months. It will go farther. Hands-On Mobile, which adapted the game on behalf of Activision, said it would unveil Guitar Hero III Backstage Pass, a new version for Sprint and AT&amp;T customers, on Thursday, with other carriers to follow. The networks finally have a breakout success on their hands, and more is to come. Electronic Arts, the giant game maker, is releasing its long-awaited Spore for cellphones, including the iPhone, not just on the well-known game platforms. Hands-On Mobile is also selling a classic Mac game, Crystal Quest, which with Kung Fu Panda, Electronic Arts’s mobile adaptation of the DreamWorks film, and The Dark Knight, Glu Mobile’s game adaptation of the Warner Brothers film, add to the list of new cellphone games. All of this raises the question: Why has the industry gone this long feeding customers a steady diet of lame games? Blame the Razr. When Motorola hit the market several years ago with a device that played Twiggy to the industry’s plus-size models, consumers demanded more of the same. And the industry offered phones with displays that could fit only slightly more data than fits in a Web banner ad. Game consoles, like Sony’s PSP or Nintendo’s DS, went the opposite direction, with adventure and athleticism rendered in high-resolution brilliance. But if Guitar Hero can get console gamers to see their phones as legitimate gaming devices, the thinking goes, manufacturers will build more devices to cater to them, as game developers will do the same with their software. The iPhone’s innovative design and features and the growing list of games available for it certainly are pushing the trend. Evan Wilson, a gaming analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, summed up the feelings of the industry when he said, “hopefully this will jump-start mobile games.” While it is significantly harder to look cool while playing the game on a cellphone, the Guitar Hero experience is otherwise fairly close to that of the frantic, note-chasing console game. Competitors choose a song and one of three difficulty levels. When the notes on the screen start flying, players hit numbers on the keypad that correspond to one of three colors of notes. The price, meanwhile, is a far cry from the console game that sells for about $90, ersatz guitar included. Subscribers of the four major wireless carriers pay $3 to $4.50 a month to play. In addition to the subscription, users without unlimited data plans will pay to download game songs. When players buy a subscription, they are given four songs from an initial list of 15, with more songs available the farther they advance in the game. Depending on the phone, the tunes may not be original recordings, but are rather synthesized versions similar to ring tones. Clearly, Guitar Hero fans consider it a small price to pay to hone their skills outside the home. Whether they can attract groupies in the meantime is, unfortunately, far less certain. Quick Calls: ¶Mobile gamers need not develop a case of carpal tunnel syndrome as they reach for the new personal bests on their phone. Device manufacturers are starting to make more game-friendly hardware, like the Sony Ericsson W760 Walkman, a phone that goes on sale in September. The device includes dedicated A/B gaming buttons, 3-D game visuals and tilt-control, so players can steer with the phone when they’re playing the Need for Speed racing game, which comes loaded on the device. True to the Walkman brand, the phone will also be rich in music features. It will be priced at about $400, or $100 with a two-year contract. ¶Those who would rather play the stock market on their mobile phones will have an easier time now with a new service from E*Trade. The Mobile Pro service from E*Trade, which is available only to BlackBerry users, offers real-time stock quotes, trading shortcuts and an array of services not previously available in a single service to mobile moguls. It is free to E*Trade users. ¶Nokia recently announced Nokia Chat, an instant messaging service that lets owners of a G.P.S.-enabled Nokia phone see the location of specific friends, read their status reports and exchange text messages. The service will also save a list of favorite spots, like a cafe or apartment, and will broadcast alerts to a list of friends whenever the user lands there. The service, which is still being tested, requires a free software download (see Nokia.com/betalabs), a data plan and at least a few friends with similarly equipped Nokia phones.

As of May, the latest period for which M:Metrics provided data, Guitar Hero’s mobile version ranked ninth, but it was a nine with a bullet, having climbed from the 85 spot in three months. It will go farther. Hands-On Mobile, which adapted the game on behalf of Activision, said it would unveil Guitar Hero III Backstage Pass, a new version for Sprint and AT&amp;T customers, on Thursday, with other carriers to follow. The networks finally have a breakout success on their hands, and more is to come. Electronic Arts, the giant game maker, is releasing its long-awaited Spore for cellphones, including the iPhone, not just on the well-known game platforms. Hands-On Mobile is also selling a classic Mac game, Crystal Quest, which with Kung Fu Panda, Electronic Arts’s mobile adaptation of the DreamWorks film, and The Dark Knight, Glu Mobile’s game adaptation of the Warner Brothers film, add to the list of new cellphone games. All of this raises the question: Why has the industry gone this long feeding customers a steady diet of lame games? Blame the Razr. When Motorola hit the market several years ago with a device that played Twiggy to the industry’s plus-size models, consumers demanded more of the same. And the industry offered phones with displays that could fit only slightly more data than fits in a Web banner ad. Game consoles, like Sony’s PSP or Nintendo’s DS, went the opposite direction, with adventure and athleticism rendered in high-resolution brilliance. But if Guitar Hero can get console gamers to see their phones as legitimate gaming devices, the thinking goes, manufacturers will build more devices to cater to them, as game developers will do the same with their software. The iPhone’s innovative design and features and the growing list of games available for it certainly are pushing the trend. Evan Wilson, a gaming analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, summed up the feelings of the industry when he said, “hopefully this will jump-start mobile games.” While it is significantly harder to look cool while playing the game on a cellphone, the Guitar Hero experience is otherwise fairly close to that of the frantic, note-chasing console game. Competitors choose a song and one of three difficulty levels. When the notes on the screen start flying, players hit numbers on the keypad that correspond to one of three colors of notes. The price, meanwhile, is a far cry from the console game that sells for about $90, ersatz guitar included. Subscribers of the four major wireless carriers pay $3 to $4.50 a month to play. In addition to the subscription, users without unlimited data plans will pay to download game songs. When players buy a subscription, they are given four songs from an initial list of 15, with more songs available the farther they advance in the game. Depending on the phone, the tunes may not be original recordings, but are rather synthesized versions similar to ring tones. Clearly, Guitar Hero fans consider it a small price to pay to hone their skills outside the home. Whether they can attract groupies in the meantime is, unfortunately, far less certain. Quick Calls: ¶Mobile gamers need not develop a case of carpal tunnel syndrome as they reach for the new personal bests on their phone. Device manufacturers are starting to make more game-friendly hardware, like the Sony Ericsson W760 Walkman, a phone that goes on sale in September. The device includes dedicated A/B gaming buttons, 3-D game visuals and tilt-control, so players can steer with the phone when they’re playing the Need for Speed racing game, which comes loaded on the device. True to the Walkman brand, the phone will also be rich in music features. It will be priced at about $400, or $100 with a two-year contract. ¶Those who would rather play the stock market on their mobile phones will have an easier time now with a new service from E*Trade. The Mobile Pro service from E*Trade, which is available only to BlackBerry users, offers real-time stock quotes, trading shortcuts and an array of services not previously available in a single service to mobile moguls. It is free to E*Trade users. ¶Nokia recently announced Nokia Chat, an instant messaging service that lets owners of a G.P.S.-enabled Nokia phone see the location of specific friends, read their status reports and exchange text messages. The service will also save a list of favorite spots, like a cafe or apartment, and will broadcast alerts to a list of friends whenever the user lands there. The service, which is still being tested, requires a free software download (see Nokia.com/betalabs), a data plan and at least a few friends with similarly equipped Nokia phones.

The two companies have also discussed whether SK Telecom would consider a minority investment in Sprint, but nothing is imminent, these people said. The discussions, which were conducted informally in the last few weeks, are at an early stage and may not result in any deal. Sprint's stock climbed 9 percent, to $9.04 Tuesday, after CNBC reported that SK Telecom was in talks to acquire Sprint. A Sprint spokeswoman declined to comment. But it is not the first time that Sprint has talked with SK Telecom about a partnership. Last year, Sprint turned down a $5 billion offer from SK Telecom and Providence Equity Partners, which were interested in buying a minority stake. Sprint, which has struggled with customer defections, recently named a new chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, who is trying to turn around the company. But there has been speculation about its future. Earlier this year, Deutsche Telekom of Germany mulled whether to make a bid for the company, people apprised of the situation said then. Sprint too explored whether to spin off its Nextel unit. Under Mr. Hesse's leadership, Sprint is trying to appease its 52.8 million customers. As chief, Mr. Hesse has encouraged more partnerships. This spring Sprint entered into a new high-speed wireless venture with Clearwire and a consortium of disparate partners, including Google, Intel, Comcast and Time Warner. The company hoped the deal would give it a two-year edge over AT&amp;T and Verizon in high-speed service, both at home and on mobile phones.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEFD81630F93BA35754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Bedeviled by the Churn<date>Published: July 8, 2008</date><text>OVERLAND PARK, Kan. -- Sprint Nextel was in a crisis as Daniel R. Hesse took over the chief executive's job last December. Sprint was reeling from an ill-fated merger with Nextel. Customers were leaving in droves. Executives were threatening to leave, while those who wanted to stay were worried they would lose their jobs. To motivate the staff, Mr. Hesse gave them DVDs of a documentary about Ernest Shackleton, the famous explorer whose ship was trapped in ice on an expedition to Antarctica. He liked the movie for its optimistic message: the crew survived. Shackleton's ship did not. It was crushed by the ice and swallowed by the unforgiving sea. That parallel to Sprint was probably not lost on Sprint employees because many have been asking the question: Can Mr. Hesse save his crew and stop the company from sinking? The task will be as challenging as Shackleton's. AT&amp;T and Verizon, the industry's behemoths, are recruiting Sprint customers who have grown tired of years of inattentive customer service and a lackluster array of cellphones. Investors too have lost patience: the share price has dropped 58 percent since May 2007. And despite early success with the new Instinct smartphone, Sprint's challenger to the iPhone, the company still lags behind its peers. Mr. Hesse has much to do to repair a corporate culture so tattered that executives made bets he would not even show up his first day. ''What do you do when you hit rock bottom?'' asked Roger Entner, a senior vice president at IAG, a market research firm. ''It's going to take a lot to turn this company around.'' In an interview in his office, with its remote-controlled fireplace and hand-carved wooden mantle reminiscent of Sprint's headier days, Mr. Hesse was both practical and hopeful. He is realistic about how much work he and his management team have to do to save Sprint from being irrelevant. ''It's like trying to drink out of a fire hose,'' he said. But at the same time he needs to inspire a team beaten down by bad press and even worse reviews from Wall Street and customers. Morale was so low last year that some workers called Sprint headquarters ''Shawshank'' after the Maine prison in the 1994 film, ''The Shawshank Redemption.'' ''We've gotten some bad press and think we don't deserve it,'' said Brett Collins, who oversees one of Sprint's customer care centers in Kansas. ''We're kind of tired of hearing about it.'' Consumers, more to the point, are the ones who are tired. Tired, that is, of surly customer service representatives who do little to solve their problems. In the first quarter of 2008, 1.1 million of Sprint Nextel's 53.9 million customers fled, and such churn -- a measure of how unhappy customers are -- is on the rise. Sprint has the highest churn rate among its peers, 2.45 percent, which is why Mr. Hesse's first order of business was to make sure customers knew that someone was listening. Mr. Hesse, who once ran AT&amp;T's wireless unit, ordered new commercials and ended up starring in them himself. Mr. Hesse had complained to his advertising agency that he had not liked earlier ads, using glowing light drawings, because they weren't personal enough. Mr. Hesse is an affable but imposing 6-foot-6 figure whose lanky frame posed a problem for producers of the commercials. The sleeves of a shirt they brought to the shoot were too short and had to be lengthened with a two-inch band of gray cloth. In the commercials, Mr. Hesse asks customers to e-mail him with complaints and to give Sprint another chance. In what it calls its most successful ad campaign in years, Sprint has received thousands of e-mail messages from customers who are only too happy to give Mr. Hesse a piece of their mind. ''We needed to put a face on the company, let customers know someone was accountable,'' Mr. Hesse said, adding that he reads daily summaries of those complaints. ''I'm too busy to read every one,'' he said, although notable messages make it to his desk. Mr. Hesse talks about accountability a lot, because he found there was little of it when he joined Sprint, he said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/technology/personaltech/12pogue.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">An Imitator That Rivals the iPhone<date>Published: June 12, 2008</date><text>The story so far: Apple introduced the iPhone a year ago, and has sold six million of them. Then on Monday, Apple unveiled an improved model that brings faster Internet, G.P.S. and a much lower price to an already well-designed device.

Now, this new iPhone won’t be available until July 11. So this is not a review of the iPhone  not exactly. The new iPhone will offer many goodies, but it continues to omit some standard features that a lot of people consider important: removable battery, memory-card expansion slot, video recording, voice dialing and the ability to send pictures to another cellphone. Oh, and the option to escape AT&amp;T, which is nobody’s favorite cell company. In other words, a certain population still awaits something that offers the touch-screen joy of an iPhone without those limitations. Oh, there have been efforts, but just slapping a touch screen onto a phone does not make it an iPhone. It’s all about the software, kids. Here comes one more. On June 20, Sprint will offer the new Samsung Instinct. It, too, is a blatant iPhone wannabe, but its software structure is simple and it has its own personality. It does not succeed in surpassing the iPhone, especially the new one  but it does succeed as a smartphone. The Instinct is tentatively priced at $200 with a two-year contract and a $100 rebate. It’s a wee bit taller and thicker than the iPhone, but noticeably narrower (2.2 x 4.6 x 0.5 inches). Beneath the 3.1-inch touch screen are three glowing, flush-mounted buttons: Phone, Home and Back. That Back button is refreshing, since moving from one software spot to another on the iPhone generally requires pressing Home and drilling down again from the very top. The Instinct’s most gimmicky enhancement is a so-called haptic touch screen, which means that the whole thing vibrates a little each time you tap it. To expand the puny 32 megabytes of built-in memory, you can insert a MicroSD card  in fact, Sprint provides a 2-gigabyte card with the phone. And as though to rub Apple’s nose in the swappable-battery feature, Sprint also includes a second battery and an external charger. Each charge, Sprint says, supplies 5.8 hours of talk time. The phone works the way the iPhone does: tap someone’s name in Contacts to dial, tap Answer or Ignore when a call comes in, and so on. Even what Apple (and now Sprint) calls Visual Voicemail is here  the brilliant feature that displays your voicemail messages in a list, like e-mail, so you can listen in any order (and avoid the 15 seconds of exposition. “You. Have. Seven. Messages. ...”). If you have a Gmail, AOL, Hotmail or Yahoo account, setting up your e-mail is as simple as entering your name and password. You can open, but not edit, some attachments, like JPEG pictures, MP3 music files and Word documents (minus formatting). The good news: On the Instinct, you can always rotate the on-screen keyboard 90 degrees, the wide way, making the keys much bigger targets. The bad news: the Instinct’s software isn’t nearly as sophisticated as the iPhone’s. It makes no effort to save keystrokes by predicting what you’re typing, and when it notices a typo, its suggestions are practically idiotic. (You type “tymes,” it suggests “funds.”) If you find iPhone typing slow going, you’ll really bog down on the Instinct. (There’s a one-word-at-a-time handwriting recognition mode, too, but it’s so inaccurate that it’s nearly worthless.) The iPhone shows complete, fully formatted Web pages on that vast expanse of screen. But the Instinct doesn’t even come close, for two reasons. First, you’re peeking at the Web through a smaller keyhole; the Instinct’s 240 by 432 pixel screen size is dwarfed by the iPhone screen (320 by 480). That’s compounded by the second problem: the Instinct doesn’t have a multitouch screen. So you can’t smoothly zoom in and out of Web pages (or photos, or e-mail attachments) by pinching with two fingers, as on the iPhone. Nor can you enlarge a single chunk of a Web page  a single photo or sidebar box, for example  with a double tap. Instead, the Instinct offers only three zoom settings: full size, double size and half size, and the result is a touch of BlackBerry claustrophobia. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology »The story so far: Apple introduced the iPhone a year ago, and has sold six million of them.

The move is part of a groundbreaking agreement with the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, that will be formally announced on Tuesday as a significant step by leading companies to curtail access to child pornography. Many in the industry have previously resisted similar efforts, saying they could not be responsible for content online, given the decentralized and largely unmonitored nature of the Internet. The agreements will affect customers not just in New York but throughout the country. Verizon and Time Warner Cable are two of the nation’s five largest service providers, with roughly 16 million customers between them. Negotiations are continuing with other service providers, Mr. Cuomo said. The companies have agreed to shut down access to newsgroups that traffic in pornographic images of children on one of the oldest outposts of the Internet, known as Usenet. Usenet began nearly 30 years ago and was one of the earliest ways to swap information online, but as the World Wide Web blossomed, Usenet was largely supplanted by it, becoming a favored back alley for those who traffic in illicit material. The providers will also purge Web sites that traffic in child pornography and are hosted on the three companies servers. While officials from the attorney general’s office said they hoped to make it extremely difficult to find or disseminate the material online, they acknowledged that they could not eliminate access entirely. Among the potential obstacles: some third-party companies sell paid subscriptions, allowing customers to access newsgroups privately, preventing even their Internet service providers from tracking their activity. The agreements resulted from an eight-month investigation and sting operation in which undercover agents from Mr. Cuomo’s office, posing as subscribers, complained to Internet providers that they were allowing child pornography to proliferate online, despite customer service agreements that discouraged such activity. Verizon, for example, warns its users that they risk losing their service if they transmit or disseminate sexually exploitative images of children. After the companies ignored the investigators’ complaints, the attorney general’s office surfaced, threatening charges of fraud and deceptive business practices. The companies agreed to cooperate and began weeks of negotiations. By pursuing Internet service providers, Mr. Cuomo is trying to move beyond the traditional law enforcement strategy of targeting those who produce child pornography and their customers. That approach has had limited effectiveness, according to Mr. Cuomo’s office, in part because much of the demand in the United States has been fed by child pornography from abroad, especially Eastern Europe. “You can’t help but look at this material and not be disturbed,” said Mr. Cuomo, who promised to take up the issue during his 2006 campaign. “These are 4-year-olds, 5-year-olds, assault victims, there are animals in the pictures,” he added. “To say ‘graphic’ and ‘egregious’ doesn’t capture it.” “The I.S.P.s’ point had been, ‘We’re not responsible, these are individuals communicating with individuals, we’re not responsible,’ ” he said, referring to Internet service providers. “Our point was that at some point, you do bear responsibility.” Representatives for the three companies either did not return calls or declined to comment before the official announcement of the agreements on Tuesday. Internet service providers represent a relatively new front in the battle against child pornography, one spearheaded in large part by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Federal law requires service providers to report child pornography to the National Center, but it often takes customer complaints to trigger a report, and few visitors to illicit newsgroups could be expected to complain because many are pedophiles themselves. Last year, a bill sponsored by Congressman Nick Lampson, a Texas Democrat, promised to take “the battle of child pornography to Internet service providers” by ratcheting up penalties for failing to report complaints of child pornography. The bill passed in the House, but has languished in the Senate. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: June 14, 2008 An article and headlines on Tuesday about an agreement by three Internet providers and the office of the New York attorney general under which the three companies will curb access to child pornography overstated the extent of one aspect of the agreement.

Here’s Our New Chief<date>Published: June 9, 2008</date><text>“If you could change the way wireless companies did things, what would you do?” asked the new chief executive of Sprint Nextel, Dan Hesse, in a commercial this spring. Sprint decided it would change the way it did things by inviting viewers to send them feedback via an e-mail address, dan@sprint.com, that flashed at the end of the spot. “Yeah, we were worried,” said Mike Goff, vice president of advertising and marketing communications for Sprint. The company had a reputation for poor customer service, and soliciting critiques for the new chief to read was a risk. But, Mr. Goff said, Sprint wanted to “show we were serious about our intent to improve our customer service. We knew this was happening at a time when the perception of our customer service in the market was poor, so this is a chance for Dan to hear back from the market.” Respondents, at first, were dubious, especially when they got an automated response. “Ah well ... just like Sprint. They take one step forward with their advertising, but 2 steps back when it comes to actually responding to people directly,” one person wrote on a Yahoo message board for Sprint. Ian Schafer, chief of a digital-marketing firm, Deep Focus, tried the e-mail address and was less than impressed. “There’s so much talk about brands being transparent and communicative,” he said, “but it’s another example of a brand going halfway, which is probably worse than it going no way at all.” Soon, though, the tone on the message boards changed. Some of those who posted comments were reporting that after the automated response, they received replies from customer-service representatives with actual names (Ginger, Crystal, Marc), which addressed the complaints and included the representatives’ phone numbers. A test e-mail message sent recently to dan@sprint.com, inquiring whether it was a real e-mail address, yielded an automated response from Mr. Hesse, promising that a representative from his office would be in contact in about a week. Twenty-eight hours later, a response from someone named Shirley appeared. “Yes you have reached a valid e-mail,” it assured. Thousands of customers have written, Mr. Goff said, most with questions about billing or network coverage, some with suggestions. The responses are rolled into reports for Mr. Hesse. The faux-personal address for Mr. Hesse is not meant to trick consumers. “He’s not sitting at a PC and responding to each one, and I would hope that no one would think he would do that as the C.E.O.,” Mr. Goff said, “but he is looking at what they’re writing, and listening to what they’re saying.” “I think when you are a brand that has some issues like we have with perception, you need to take some risks. And so far this one’s working pretty well for us,” Mr. Goff said.

A test e-mail message sent recently to dan@sprint.com, inquiring whether it was a real e-mail address, yielded an automated response from Mr. Hesse, promising that a representative from his office would be in contact in about a week. Twenty-eight hours later, a response from someone named Shirley appeared. “Yes you have reached a valid e-mail,” it assured. Thousands of customers have written, Mr. Goff said, most with questions about billing or network coverage, some with suggestions. The responses are rolled into reports for Mr. Hesse. The faux-personal address for Mr. Hesse is not meant to trick consumers. “He’s not sitting at a PC and responding to each one, and I would hope that no one would think he would do that as the C.E.O.,” Mr. Goff said, “but he is looking at what they’re writing, and listening to what they’re saying.” “I think when you are a brand that has some issues like we have with perception, you need to take some risks. And so far this one’s working pretty well for us,” Mr. Goff said.

Tricks to Logging On<date>Published: May 21, 2008</date><text>THE Internet may be more accessible than ever, but business travelers often need more than one way to log on to get their e-mail, send and receive files and search the Web for maps, restaurants and other information. Skip to next paragraph Linda Spillers for The New York Times ACCESS George Newstrom of Lee Technologies in Fairfax, Va., shows the cellphone alternatives he uses for traveling. One increasingly popular solution is the wireless broadband cards that slide into slots on the sides of most laptops, enabling them to gain access to the Internet from most places with cellphone reception. These PC cards, known technically as PCMCIA cards, require software provided by AT&amp; T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless and other carriers that sell the service for about $60 a month for retail customers, who sometimes must sign a two-year contract. Though the cards are convenient, business travelers find that the average speeds  which are roughly equal to a slow D.S.L. line or a fast dial-up connection  are not fast enough to handle large documents, video downloads and other data-heavy uses. So they will also often search for a speedier, more reliable WiFi hot spot or use broadband connections in hotel rooms. While many WiFi hot spots are faster, they are often more vulnerable than wireless broadband cards, which have far more secure connections. Because no single connection seems to meet every traveler’s needs, businesspeople carry many devices, each with its own cost. Smaller companies like Lee Technologies, in Fairfax, Va., do not have the power of a corporation to negotiate better deals with carriers, said George Newstrom, its president. As a result, he and other employees look for WiFi hot spots rather than using hotel room broadband services, which can cost from $10 to $15 a day. “Many towns have free WiFi, and that’s our No. 1 choice,” he said. “Free is the best price.” “If you’re going to do heavy-duty work, you have to be on a cable connection,” added Mr. Newstrom, whose employees often send blueprints and other large data files. Still, prices for wireless broadband services are slowly dropping, thanks to stiff competition for business customers, who typically spend more than retail customers. Carriers are also cutting prices on their international data plans, which are usually priced on the amount of data sent and received. Carriers like Sprint, for instance, have introduced unlimited data and calling plans for cellphones, starting at $99.99, and are subsidizing the cost of PC cards, BlackBerrys and other devices. Some carriers, including AT&amp;T, sell WiFi access plans that can be added to broadband and cellphone plans. The company offers access to 17,000 hot spots in the United States to its WiFi customers. “Carriers recognize that just like with mobile phones, they want to remove the impediments to using their services,” said Charles S. Golvin, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research. “And as the carriers see more customers take their service, the cost of the PC cards and other hardware will go down.” The most popular PC cards slide into the sides of laptops. But some thinner laptops do not have slots, so Verizon Wireless and other carriers also sell devices that plug into U.S.B. ports. About 5 percent of cellphone subscribers also have a wireless broadband plan, industry analysts say. That number will grow, the analysts say, as Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers include in their laptops wireless broadband chips that remove the need for separate PC cards. The chips are like those in laptops that search automatically for WiFi connections. However, unlike WiFi, which is an open standard, wireless broadband services are unique to each cellphone carrier. That means that, before they buy, laptop users must tell manufacturers which carrier’s chip to include. Cellphone carriers also constantly upgrade their data networks, which means that the chips installed in laptops may become obsolete. The solution may be a new chip, which is being introduced this year by Qualcomm; it supports several wireless broadband standards offered by Verizon Wireless, Sprint and AT&amp;T and carriers overseas. That will give laptop users the flexibility to switch providers without having to upgrade their computers.

But in light of its earnings report on Monday, some analysts are saying that what it needs more is customers. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Seth Perlman/Associated Press Sprint is facing stiff competition from AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless after its floundering merger with Nextel. A company store in Springfield, Ill., offers a variety of products. Sprint, the nation’s No. 3 carrier, is facing stiff competition from AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless after its floundering merger with Nextel. In the first quarter, the company lost 1.1 million subscribers; the total number dropped to 52.8 million. Churn, or customer turnover  a measure of how unhappy customers are  is on the rise, climbing to 2.45 percent from 2.3 percent in the previous quarter. To make matters worse, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, Sprint is losing its best and biggest-spending customers, which will only make it harder to turn the company around. “Sprint’s management is taking an admirably sober approach, and it is at least talking about the core issues  lax credit standards, high involuntary churn, lack of a compelling consumer value proposition, weak customer service, a subpar network, and, well, you get the idea,” Mr. Moffett wrote in a research report. “There’s a lot wrong. But even if they work on this daunting list of problems, new problems keep intruding.” Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint’s new chief executive, was candid about the company’s customer service issues, which have persisted for more than a year. “The issues haven’t changed,” he told analysts on a conference call after the release of the earnings report. But whatever steps Mr. Hesse has taken have not yet been enough to stem the tide of losses that has plagued Sprint for more than a year. The company said it had a loss in the first quarter of $505 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with a loss of $211 million, or 18 cents a share in the period a year earlier. This year’s number included one-time costs related to Sprint’s merger with Nextel in 2005, which so far has proved to be a costly failure for the two companies. Without the charges, Sprint had first-quarter income of 4 cents a share, compared with 18 cents a year ago. That was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who had expected a profit of 2 cents a share and revenue of $9.4 billion, according to a survey of 26 analysts by Thomson Reuters. The company said revenue fell 8 percent, to $9.33 billion from $10.09 billion in the first quarter of 2007. Mr. Hesse outlined several programs the company has instituted to appeal to both new and existing customers, including an unlimited data and voice plan for $100 and simplified bills meant to be easier to understand. And the company said it would offer the new Samsung Instinct, its answer to the iPhone, to existing customers first as an incentive for them to buy one. The phone is expected to be out in June. Mr. Hesse said the company planned to offer even simpler voice and data plans this year. He has overhauled the company’s management, making division leaders more accountable for Sprint’s service and profits. And he said he hoped that Sprint’s new wireless Internet venture with Clearwire and a consortium of disparate partners, including Google, Intel, Comcast and Time Warner, would give the company a two-year edge over AT&amp;T and Verizon in high-speed Internet service, both at home and on their mobile phones. “He has immediately taken the right steps,” said Roger Entner, a senior vice president at IAG Research. But, Mr. Entner added: “The real work is in the execution. If they can execute, and that’s an I-F in capital letters, they can bring a lot of disruption to the market.” The Clearwire venture is already causing some trouble for Sprint. IPCS, an affiliate of Sprint, filed a lawsuit against the company on Monday saying it violates an agreement that gives it exclusive rights to provide wireless service in certain areas. Clearwire also announced its earnings and said it had a first-quarter loss of $176.4 million, or $1.08 a share, because of the cost of expansion. In the period in 2007, it had a net loss of $92.6 million, or 64 cents a share. Shares of Clearwire dropped 9.57 percent, or $1.35, to $12.75. Sprint Nextel closed at $9.24, down 14 cents, or 1.49 percent. On the call, Mr. Hesse was asked whether he would consider spinning off the Nextel assets from Sprint. He said this would be complex, and he declined to say whether he would approve of such a move. But, he added, “nothing is off the table.” For the time being, he said, the company is doing what it can to reinvigorate the Nextel brand. The company said earlier that it was considering selling noncore assets; on Monday, it would not elaborate on what those might be.

The consortium includes a disparate group of partners: Sprint Nextel, Google, Intel, Comcast, Time Warner and Clearwire. The partners have put the value of the deal at $12 billion, a figure that includes radio spectrum and equipment provided by Sprint Nextel and Clearwire, and $3.2 billion from the others involved. They expect the network, which will provide the next generation of high-speed Internet access for cellphone users, to be built in as little as two years, but there is no timetable on when it will be available to users and the price is not determined. The partners are seeking to beat Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T Wireless to the market. The partnership of such fundamentally different companies underscores the convergence of Internet, entertainment and telecommunications services. The wireless network of the future is expected to be fast enough  rivaling speeds that cable customers have in their homes today  to allow delivery not just of text and simple Web pages, but of video and advertising. It also faces considerable challenges. Given the peculiarities of the wireless spectrum that the partners intend to use to deliver the data signal, it may not be easy for the group to create a wide-ranging and adequately reliable service, according to Craig Moffett, a telecommunications industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. He noted that the partners involved were top companies, but that could also work against the interest of the group. Each member has a somewhat different agenda and that could lead to conflicts over operating and managing the network, he said. Sprint Nextel, which has struggled in recent years against a much stronger Verizon and AT&amp;T, is looking to capitalize on its ownership of spectrum; the cable companies are looking to create an additional service to provide broadband access outside the home; Intel would like to sell its chips and generally expand computer use; and Google hopes to develop another platform for advertising, according to people briefed on the deal. “Whether it looks good on paper, I’m not sure,” Mr. Moffett said. “There certainly are a lot of question marks that surround the viability of a proposition like this.” Several of the companies involved in the deal, including Sprint Nextel, Google and Comcast, declined to comment on the partnership. But three people who had been briefed on it  and who spoke in exchange for anonymity because the arrangement had not yet been announced  said that the group had high if still developing expectations for the technology. One of these people said that Clearwire, a wireless company started by the telecommunications industry pioneer Craig O. McCaw, would take over management of the project. This person said that the partners were aware that they had differing agendas that might have to be subordinated to some extent to make the project work. “This has huge possibilities for profit,” the person said. To achieve that, the partners “are going to have to set aside some individual company issues.” The announcement of the partnership comes as the wireless data business is growing, but one that wireless providers think has vastly more potential. For example, wireless data  predominantly text messaging  constituted 23 percent of Verizon Wireless revenue in the first quarter, up from some 17.5 percent in the period a year earlier, Mr. Moffett said. The hope of the telecommunications industry is that users will begin using such service for a range of applications, including surfing the Internet on laptops and phones, and downloading music and video more often to those kinds of devices. The disparate nature of the participants in the Clearwire partnerships also hints at the possibilities. Perhaps most significant is the participation of Google, the search advertising company, which has provided $500 million for the operation. A person briefed on the deal said Google could provide the search engine abilities for the wireless platform, enabling it to sell advertising there. Google took a similar approach in an initiative to use a free Wi-Fi network in Mountain View, Calif., where the company is based, and in a failed plan for a Wi-Fi network blanketing San Francisco. The investments by other participants include $1.05 billion from Comcast, $1 billion from Intel and $550 million from Time Warner Cable. Bright House, a cable provider, will invest $100 million, while a private investment group with wireless industry expertise, Trilogy Equity Partners, intends to invest $10 million, according to a person briefed on the arrangement.

Hesse, Sprint Nextel’s new chief executive, tells it like it is  but on Thursday, investors did not like what they heard. Skip to next paragraph Jin Lee/Bloomberg News A customer in a Sprint store in New York on Thursday. Sprint Nextel had a $29.7 billion write-down in the fourth quarter. Related Sprint Earnings Report Sprint’s stock slid more than 9 percent after the company announced a $29.45 billion fourth-quarter loss because of a huge write-down related in part to its merger with Nextel Communications. The company also said it was suspending the payment of its dividend and had borrowed $2.5 billion through a revolving credit facility. Mr. Hesse, a former AT&amp;T executive, took over the troubled company only two months ago. When asked if he feared the prospect of bankruptcy, he said, “We have plenty of cash on hand.” Sprint borrowed the $2.5 billion, he said, because it “allows us to focus exclusively on fixing the business” and mitigates the potential financial risk of outstanding loans. Sprint has $1.25 billion in bonds maturing in November, as well as $600 million coming due in 2009. Many of Sprint’s peers have warned recently of weak earnings amid a slowing economy. But Mr. Hesse put the responsibility for the company’s situation squarely with Sprint’s management. The $29.45 billion loss, which works out to $10.36 a share, contrasted with a profit of $261 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sprint’s fourth-quarter revenue was $9.85 billion, down from $10.44 billion in the period in 2006. With one-time items like the $29.7 billion write-down excluded, operating income was down 69 percent, to $235 million in the quarter. For the year it was down 43 percent, to $1.78 billion. Sprint has been struggling to keep its 53.8 million customers happy. Mr. Hesse said it expected to lose another 1.2 million subscribers this quarter, about the same amount it lost in all of 2007. He said it could lose even more customers in the second quarter. Analysts were not surprised by the company’s poor showing or the prospect of more defections. “No one expected Sprint’s results to be anything other than poor today, which makes the fact that they have managed to miss on virtually every metric a performance of some heroism,” wrote Craig E. Moffett, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Further, he wrote, “the near-term contrarian argument of a turnaround  or, better, a strategic acquisition  remains highly speculative.” Accepting the chief executive job, which few industry executives expressed interest in, may have been a form of heroism in itself for Mr. Hesse. The company has had a revolving door of executives in the corporate suite. In August 2006, Sprint lost Len J. Lauer, the chief operating officer, who said he was leaving because of a change in organizational structure. Timothy M. Donahue, the executive chairman, also resigned earlier than expected. Last October, Gary D. Forsee, the chief executive, resigned after news reports that Sprint’s board was looking to replace him. Analysts attribute much of Sprint’s management problems to the poorly executed merger between Sprint and Nextel, a deal struck in 2005. The two companies’ networks did not share the same technology, which made it difficult to merge operations, and also had clashing marketing strategies. With the company in a tenuous state, rivals swooped in and courted dissatisfied customers. Mr. Hesse, who became chief executive two months ago, said he took the job because “Sprint is an iconic brand.” But even he underestimated the severity of Sprint’s challenges. Last month Mr. Hesse announced more layoffs and the departure of three senior executives. “Like a lot of things, it is tougher than I thought it would be,” he said. “It’s not a quick fix. I had hoped I could turn it around faster. But I have confidence in the long term.” To stem further customer losses, Mr. Hesse said Sprint would begin offering a service plan that gives customers unlimited calls, text messages, Web access and G.P.S. navigation on their mobile phones. Priced at $100, the offering is aimed directly at AT&amp;T and Verizon, which announced similarly priced wireless plans last week. The rivals’ plans only include voice calls, not Web access or text messaging, which both pump up revenue for wireless companies. Mr. Hesse recalled his days running AT&amp;T Wireless Services and how it began offering simple one-rate plans to customers frustrated by confusing prices on long distance and roaming fees. Sprint customers now spend about $58 a month on average on their wireless plans, he said. “This is about simplicity,” Mr. Hesse said. Still, he warned that the new plan would not cure Sprint’s ills. Sprint’s stock fell 86 cents, to close at $8.09. More Articles in Technology »Daniel R.

Skip to next paragraph Jin Lee/Bloomberg News A customer in a Sprint store in New York on Thursday. Sprint Nextel had a $29.7 billion write-down in the fourth quarter. Related Sprint Earnings Report Sprint’s stock slid more than 9 percent after the company announced a $29.45 billion fourth-quarter loss because of a huge write-down related in part to its merger with Nextel Communications. The company also said it was suspending the payment of its dividend and had borrowed $2.5 billion through a revolving credit facility. Mr. Hesse, a former AT&amp;T executive, took over the troubled company only two months ago. When asked if he feared the prospect of bankruptcy, he said, “We have plenty of cash on hand.” Sprint borrowed the $2.5 billion, he said, because it “allows us to focus exclusively on fixing the business” and mitigates the potential financial risk of outstanding loans. Sprint has $1.25 billion in bonds maturing in November, as well as $600 million coming due in 2009. Many of Sprint’s peers have warned recently of weak earnings amid a slowing economy. But Mr. Hesse put the responsibility for the company’s situation squarely with Sprint’s management. The $29.45 billion loss, which works out to $10.36 a share, contrasted with a profit of $261 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sprint’s fourth-quarter revenue was $9.85 billion, down from $10.44 billion in the period in 2006. With one-time items like the $29.7 billion write-down excluded, operating income was down 69 percent, to $235 million in the quarter. For the year it was down 43 percent, to $1.78 billion. Sprint has been struggling to keep its 53.8 million customers happy. Mr. Hesse said it expected to lose another 1.2 million subscribers this quarter, about the same amount it lost in all of 2007. He said it could lose even more customers in the second quarter. Analysts were not surprised by the company’s poor showing or the prospect of more defections. “No one expected Sprint’s results to be anything other than poor today, which makes the fact that they have managed to miss on virtually every metric a performance of some heroism,” wrote Craig E. Moffett, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Further, he wrote, “the near-term contrarian argument of a turnaround  or, better, a strategic acquisition  remains highly speculative.” Accepting the chief executive job, which few industry executives expressed interest in, may have been a form of heroism in itself for Mr. Hesse. The company has had a revolving door of executives in the corporate suite. In August 2006, Sprint lost Len J. Lauer, the chief operating officer, who said he was leaving because of a change in organizational structure. Timothy M. Donahue, the executive chairman, also resigned earlier than expected. Last October, Gary D. Forsee, the chief executive, resigned after news reports that Sprint’s board was looking to replace him. Analysts attribute much of Sprint’s management problems to the poorly executed merger between Sprint and Nextel, a deal struck in 2005. The two companies’ networks did not share the same technology, which made it difficult to merge operations, and also had clashing marketing strategies. With the company in a tenuous state, rivals swooped in and courted dissatisfied customers. Mr. Hesse, who became chief executive two months ago, said he took the job because “Sprint is an iconic brand.” But even he underestimated the severity of Sprint’s challenges. Last month Mr. Hesse announced more layoffs and the departure of three senior executives. “Like a lot of things, it is tougher than I thought it would be,” he said. “It’s not a quick fix. I had hoped I could turn it around faster. But I have confidence in the long term.” To stem further customer losses, Mr. Hesse said Sprint would begin offering a service plan that gives customers unlimited calls, text messages, Web access and G.P.S. navigation on their mobile phones. Priced at $100, the offering is aimed directly at AT&amp;T and Verizon, which announced similarly priced wireless plans last week. The rivals’ plans only include voice calls, not Web access or text messaging, which both pump up revenue for wireless companies. Mr. Hesse recalled his days running AT&amp;T Wireless Services and how it began offering simple one-rate plans to customers frustrated by confusing prices on long distance and roaming fees. Sprint customers now spend about $58 a month on average on their wireless plans, he said. “This is about simplicity,” Mr. Hesse said. Still, he warned that the new plan would not cure Sprint’s ills. Sprint’s stock fell 86 cents, to close at $8.09.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/us/27scotus.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">A Case-by-Case Ruling on Discrimination<date>Published: February 27, 2008</date><text>WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in a closely watched job discrimination case that allegations that a plaintiff’s co-workers had also suffered discrimination, offered as evidence of a biased corporate culture, may be admissible in court  some of the time. At the same time, the justices said that such evidence should be kept out of court  some of the time. The unanimous decision, in an age-discrimination case against Sprint/Nextel, did not answer the bottom-line question in the case: whether five co-workers of the plaintiff, Ellen Mendelsohn, should have been allowed to testify. All had lost their jobs in the same reduction in force and claimed, as she did, to be victims of age discrimination. But the way the court analyzed the case, in a somewhat cryptic nine-page opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, may prove more significant in the long run than the absence of a specific answer. Because the five would-be witnesses worked for, and were dismissed by, different supervisors, the Federal District Court in Kansas City, Kan., said their experiences were irrelevant and should not be admitted. The district court indicated, in fact, that such evidence should never be admitted. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, overturned that decision, ordering the testimony admitted and indicating that evidence of this kind from the co-workers of a plaintiff in a discrimination case should always be permitted. The significance of the Supreme Court’s ruling, which vacated the 10th Circuit’s decision, lay in its rejection of both categorical approaches. The question of whether evidence of discrimination by other supervisors should be admitted in an individual case “is fact based and depends on many factors,” Justice Thomas wrote. A district court, he said, should make a “fact-intensive, context-specific inquiry” to determine the relevance of the evidence and whether it might be unduly prejudicial to the defendant. Further, he said, appeals courts should generally defer to the district court’s conclusion. But he continued that in this case, Sprint/United Management Company v. Mendelsohn, No. 06-1221, the basis for the district court’s decision was so “ambiguous” that the appeals court lacked an adequate basis on which to evaluate it. The appeals court was correct to reject a categorical rule of exclusion if that was in fact what the district court invoked, Justice Thomas said. In vacating the appeals court’s decision, the justices ordered the district court to “clarify the basis for its evidentiary ruling.” While technically a victory for the employer, because an adverse ruling was vacated, the decision is likely to prove more favorable in the long run to discrimination plaintiffs. That is because many lower courts, taking an approach similar to that of the Kansas district court, have been dismissing cases, granting summary judgment to employers on the ground that co-workers’ testimony, which often provides the strongest proof of a pattern of discrimination, is inadmissible. Under the Supreme Court’s case-by-case approach, plaintiffs will have a greater chance of surviving summary judgment and getting their cases before a jury. “It’s a big deal that portends a real change,” Eric Schnapper, a law professor at the University of Washington who was one of Ms. Mendelsohn’s lawyers, said Tuesday. Because juries are often sympathetic to plaintiffs claiming discrimination, employers usually focus on getting cases dismissed before trial. While this case concerned the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the decision will also apply to lawsuits that are based on the federal laws against race and sex discrimination in the workplace.

In recent days, three large cellphone companies in the United States have introduced unlimited calling plans for $99 a month, a departure from the industry’s longstanding approach of charging customers for each minute used over a monthly allotment. The moves, by Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, are meant to turn cellphone use into an activity covered by a single predictable fee, like watching cable television. Sprint, the nation’s third-largest carrier, says it is testing fixed-rate plans in four cities and evaluating its own nationwide flat-rate offering. The industry’s sudden fixation with flat-rate pricing speaks to the toll wrought by furious competition. As the wireless carriers jockey for a stagnating pool of customers and focus on building broadband data networks to support e-mail and Web browsing, rates for voice calls are dropping and generating less revenue. The new plans also demonstrate how difficult it is for the carriers to distinguish themselves on price. With the new unlimited plans, “the carriers are trying to find ways to hold the line on voice, since voice is the most predictable piece of service they sell,” said Charles Golvin, a wireless analyst for Forrester Research. Investors, however, are worried that a deepening price battle could cut into profitability. Shares of AT&amp;T are down 9.3 percent over the last two days, and Verizon shares are off 6.8 percent. Sprint shares are down 9 percent. The new $99 plans are not necessarily a good deal. An average consumer spends $63 to $77 for cellphone service, depending on the addition of data services like e-mail, according to a study by J. D. Power &amp; Associates. Instead, the fixed-rate plans are aiming for the small yet valuable group of customers who make lots of daytime calls. (Most plans already offer unlimited night and weekend calls.) Mr. Golvin said the industry was slowly but inevitably changing its old ways. “Consumers aren’t really all that happy with the metered approach,” he said. “Eventually that will go by the wayside, and we’ll just get something like we have for broadband Internet access today: use as much as you want, just don’t abuse our network.” Verizon, the nation’s second-largest wireless operator with 65.7 million customers, began the shift early Tuesday when it announced its $99-a-month unlimited calling plan. Data services like Internet browsing and e-mail will cost extra, the company said. Verizon did not have the stage to itself for long. About five hours after the Verizon announcement, AT&amp;T, the nation’s largest carrier with 70.1 million subscribers, introduced an identical unlimited-calling plan. About a half-hour later, T-Mobile USA, a division of Deutsche Telekom with 28.7 million subscribers, announced its own fixed-rate plan, though with a slight difference: the $99 includes text, picture and instant messaging. Peter Dobrow, a spokesman for T-Mobile, said the plans would probably appeal to about 1 in 20 people. T-Mobile already offers and heavily promotes a form of unlimited calling: its MyFaves Plan, for $39.99 a month, lets customers make unlimited calls to five people.

On Jan. 8, shares of AT&amp;T slid 4.5 percent after Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive, said at a conference that some customers were having their phone service turned off because of unpaid bills, indicating a weakening economy. But in a conference call after the release of AT&amp;T’s earnings on Thursday, the company played down those concerns. It emphasized instead the predictable nature of telephone company stocks, which are less vulnerable than those of luxury goods makers or real estate companies during a recession. Rick Lindner, the chief financial officer, said AT&amp;T, like other communications companies, was indeed seeing the impact of a softer economy on its operations. But, he added, “they are not very severe at this point.” Even in a downturn, consumers are going to want to stay connected, either online or on the phone. “I think for us that continues to point to more of the defensive nature of our business,” he said. AT&amp;T reported strong fourth-quarter earnings that met analysts’ expectations, with net income rising 63 percent, in large part because of the growth in wireless communications. Revenue hit $30.3 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $15.9 billion for the same period in 2006. The increased revenue reflects AT&amp;T’s acquisition of BellSouth and the consolidation of its wireless operations. The company now has 70.1 million customers. AT&amp;T gained 2.7 million new wireless customers in its fourth quarter, up 13.5 percent from a year earlier, Mr. Lindner said, adding that 40 percent of customers buying Apple’s iPhone, which is sold exclusively through AT&amp;T, are new to the company. Wireless data revenue increased 57.5 percent from a year earlier as customers sent more e-mail messages by phone, downloaded videos and used the Internet on the go. Analysts say wireless operations will continue to be a driver of growth. But if consumers get worried about the economy and cut nonessential spending, communications companies may see the impact in ways they do not expect. Lisa Pierce, a vice president for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said consumers could decide to forgo spending on mobile music and ring-tone downloads. Such services are moneymakers for companies like AT&amp;T, which have watched the number of phone lines installed in homes shrink. “Wireless has been part of the reason that revenues have been growing rapidly,” Ms. Pierce said. “Those companies want that to keep going.” If consumers do shy away from consuming entertainment on their phones, it could have a ripple effect through the media industry. Industry executives and analysts have been betting on mobile media to follow the trajectory of media on the Internet. As with anything in an uncertain economy, Ms. Pierce said, “we’ll have to wait and see.” Shares of AT&amp;T fell 94 cents to close at $35.75 and continued falling after hours. Shake-Up at Sprint The chief financial officer of Sprint Nextel, Paul N. Saleh, and two other senior executives are leaving the company in a management shake-up, the company said Thursday. Mr. Saleh, who had served as acting chief executive, will leave Friday along with the chief marketing officer, Timothy E. Kelly, and Mark E. Angelino, president for sales and distribution, Sprint said. Sprint shares closed up more than 4 percent as some investors saw the departures of the marketing and distribution executives as a good sign. Sprint has struggled with marketing and customer service problems. The chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, said he was reviewing strategy and would consider both internal and external candidates for the jobs.

Shares of Sprint fell $2.87, or 25 percent, to $8.70 after it said that it planned to lay off 4,000 workers and close stores to trim costs as its customer base shrinks. The stock prices of AT&amp;T and Verizon also slipped after the news. AT&amp;T, the largest wireless carrier, was down more than 3 percent, and Verizon, which owns Verizon Wireless along with Vodafone, fell more than 4 percent. Sprint has been struggling for more than a year, and installed a new chief executive only last month. But the sharp drop in the company’s customer count during the traditionally strong holiday quarter, analysts say, raises concerns that the problem extends beyond Sprint. “The broader question here is whether this is the tip of the iceberg in a deceleration of the U.S. wireless market over all,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Industry analysts had estimated that in the fourth quarter Sprint lost about 350,000 contract subscribers  a carrier’s most valuable customers, signed up for contracts of a year or more. Instead, Sprint announced that it had a net loss of 638,000 contract customers. “It’s the magnitude of the weakness that is shocking,” said Michael Nelson, an analyst at the Stanford Group, an investment firm. To reduce costs, Sprint said it planned to cut its payroll by 4,000 workers. The company, based in Reston, Va., currently has about 60,000 employees. Sprintsaid it would also close 125 company-owned retail stores, about 8 percent of the nearly 1,400 in the Sprint chain. The total labor savings, the company said, should be $700 million to $800 million a year. The cutbacks were the first major step taken by Sprint since the arrival last month of its new chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse. He had been the chief executive of Embarq Corporation, a local-phone spinoff of Sprint. Cutting costs at Sprint, analysts say, is a logical step, given the decline in business. But they say the company must address other fundamental issues  some unresolved since Sprint completed its $35 billion purchase of Nextel in 2005. The company, the analysts say, runs two networks that use different technologies, and making the transition to a single compatible technology is proving to be more time-consuming and costly than expected. Sprint, Mr. Nelson said, has also not settled on a consistent marketing strategy. By contrast, he said, Verizon has successfully promoted the quality of its network with advertisements that include the catchphrase “Can you hear me now?” And AT&amp;T has carved out a position as offering a reliable network and stylish handsets. It was the first to offer Motorola’s Razr and, later, Apple’s iPhone. “But Sprint has not come up with a broad enough marketing strategy to appeal to a mass consumer audience yet,” Mr. Nelson said. It is unclear whether Sprint’s travails are solely its own or portend broader troubles for cellphone carriers. Before the Sprint announcement, Mr. Moffett of Bernstein published a report that noted the telecommunications industry has long been considered a safe haven when the economy is weak. “Suddenly,” he wrote, “that looks like a riskier bet.” The reason, he said, is doubt about the outlook for the wireless business. The industry has been adding 3 million to 5 million new subscribers a quarter in recent years. But by now, more than 85 percent of Americans are subscribers  well into the 90s, if one includes only adults. The growth in net new subscribers will inevitably slow. Some of the slippage will be offset by increased revenue per user, as subscribers buy more data services like Web searching, video and audio. But the main engine of growth for the industry, Mr. Moffett said, has been new subscribers. In the last national economic slowdown, the pace of new-subscriber signups fell approximately in half from 2000 to 2002, before rebounding again. “If we’re headed into a recession,” Mr. Moffett said, “wireless growth expectations are suspect.” More Articles in Technology »Sprint Nextel’s announcement on Friday that it is losing customers more rapidly than expected is making investors nervous about a weak economy’s effect on other wireless companies.

By contrast, he said, Verizon has successfully promoted the quality of its network with advertisements that include the catchphrase “Can you hear me now?” And AT&amp;T has carved out a position as offering a reliable network and stylish handsets. It was the first to offer Motorola’s Razr and, later, Apple’s iPhone. “But Sprint has not come up with a broad enough marketing strategy to appeal to a mass consumer audience yet,” Mr. Nelson said. It is unclear whether Sprint’s travails are solely its own or portend broader troubles for cellphone carriers. Before the Sprint announcement, Mr. Moffett of Bernstein published a report that noted the telecommunications industry has long been considered a safe haven when the economy is weak. “Suddenly,” he wrote, “that looks like a riskier bet.” The reason, he said, is doubt about the outlook for the wireless business. The industry has been adding 3 million to 5 million new subscribers a quarter in recent years. But by now, more than 85 percent of Americans are subscribers  well into the 90s, if one includes only adults. The growth in net new subscribers will inevitably slow. Some of the slippage will be offset by increased revenue per user, as subscribers buy more data services like Web searching, video and audio. But the main engine of growth for the industry, Mr. Moffett said, has been new subscribers. In the last national economic slowdown, the pace of new-subscriber signups fell approximately in half from 2000 to 2002, before rebounding again. “If we’re headed into a recession,” Mr. Moffett said, “wireless growth expectations are suspect.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Cellphone-t.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">The Afterlife of Cellphones<date>Published: January 13, 2008</date><text>1. Cellphones in Hell Skip to next paragraph Richard Barnes for The New York Times Flipped Phones Top: Reclaimed keypads. Bottom: Parts of reclaimed phones; the metal will be recycled. Americans threw out just shy of three million tons of household electronics in 2006. This so-called e-waste is the fastest-growing part of the municipal waste stream and, depending on your outlook, either an enormous problem or a bonanza. E-waste generally contains substances that, though safely sequestered during each product’s use, can become hazardous if not handled properly when disposed. Those products also hold bits of precious metals like silver, copper, platinum and gold. The Belgian company Umicore is in the business of reclaiming those materials. It extracts 17 metals from our unwanted televisions, computers and cellphones and from more ominous-sounding industrial byproducts like drosses and anode slimes. Umicore harvests silver from spent photo-developing solutions collected at American big-box stores and sells it to Italian jewelers. The company describes its work as “aboveground mining.” Umicore has roots in actual mining. In the late 1800s, during the reign of King Leopold II, the firm mined copper in the African Congo and shipped it to a riverside smelter near Antwerp. Today the same property houses a sprawling, state-of-the-art $2 billion smelter and refinery. Here, metals are recovered and processed. Then they are sold, sometimes to Asia, where they are used to manufacture brand-new electronics. It’s a reshuffling of the colonial arrangement: an abundant resource is sent from richer countries to poorer ones, made into goods, then sent back. That resource is our garbage. Umicore’s smelter was burning furiously at 2,116 degrees Fahrenheit one afternoon last fall. Two heavy-set men in blue overalls sat in the control room, staring expressionlessly through heat-shielded windows. They were eye-level with the mouth of the smelter  a pit 13 feet wide by 46 feet deep. A conveyor belt fed shredded circuit boards and scrap into the fire in a dim, fast blur. I imagined the black-and-white television in my mother’s basement, or my first blue Nokia cellphone  all the devices I’d gotten close to and outgrown  spilling out and squealing like lobsters in a pot. The metals exit the smelter’s base as a glowing sludge. It streams into another caldron the height of a house. From there, it moves into tanks of acid. The acid is electrocuted. As electricity flows through the mixture, copper accumulates on the tank’s end plate. I watched a giant claw move across the ceiling, rip out the plate and, with a violent whack, cleave off a gleaming layer of 99.9 percent pure copper, with the unmistakable sheen of a new penny. It was thrilling to see something so clean and recognizable emerge from such an alien process. After explaining the final stages, Thierry Van Kerckhoven, Umicore’s e-scrap manager, handed me another of the end products from this process: a one-kilogram bar of gold. It felt the way I thought it would, based on what you see in the movies: substantial, mesmerizing. It was worth about $24,000. “This gold is recycled gold,” Kerckhoven said. “This gold is green gold.” Recycling feels good because we imagine it as just this kind of alchemy  which Umicore achieves with impressive environmental controls. The centerpiece is a monstrous gas-cleaning-and-filtration system that captures and neutralizes enough of the carcinogenic and endocrine-altering chemicals produced from melting e-waste, according to Umicore, that the faint yellow emission finally released from its smokestack easily surpasses the European Union’s air-quality standards. (Martin Hojsik, who campaigns against toxics for Greenpeace International, notes that the process followed by Umicore and its few, similarly equipped competitors around the world is “not entirely clean” but still “the preferable solution” for recovering metals from e-waste.) Ultimately, by weight, only 1/2 of 1 percent of the e-waste Umicore takes in cannot be safely sent back into the world in a usable form. “There is often a discussion of separating what is valuable from what is toxic,” Christian Hagelüken, Umicore’s senior manager of business development, told me. “But sometimes they are the same thing.” This may never be more true than for cellphones. They are the most valuable form of e-waste. Each one contains about a dollar’s worth of precious metals, mostly gold. And while single phones house far less hazardous material than a computer  an old, clunky monitor can incorporate seven pounds of lead  their cumulative presence is staggering. Last year, according to ABI Research, 1.2 billion phones were sold worldwide. Sixty percent of them probably replaced existing ones. In the United States, phones are cast aside after, on average, 12 months. And according to the industry trade group CTIA, four out of every five people in the country own cellphones. Umicore estimates that, together with its competitors, it received only 1 percent of all phones that were discarded globally in 2006. “This of course is a lousy percentage,” Hagelüken said. “Computers are also bad, but phones are the worst.” Our obliviousness has mostly kept them from being recycled at all. When we do bother, we may not know, or be able to control, where the “recycled” phones go.

Seeks New Life for Old Cellphones<date>Published: January 8, 2008</date><text>The way the Environmental Protection Agency sees it, one discarded cellphone is like one vote: on its own, it cannot do much harm or good, but the cumulative effect can pack a wallop. So on Tuesday, the E.P.A., in partnership with many retailers, manufacturers and service providers, will introduce a public education campaign aimed at getting consumers to recycle those phones. By the agency’s reckoning, as many as 150 million cellphones are taken out of service each year. The phones contain metals, plastics, glass and chemicals, all of which require energy to mine and make, and many of which could be hazardous if they end up in landfills and leach into the ground. Moreover, many old cellphones still work and can be donated to charities or distributed to poor people. “There are significant environmental and energy benefits to getting these phones back into the product stream,” the director of the agency’s office of solid waste, Matt Hale, said. The $175,000 campaign  “Recycle Your Cellphone. It’s an Easy Call”  will rely heavily on public service announcements, particularly in lifestyle and technology magazines read by the 18- to 34-year-olds who trade up to new cellphones most often. The ads will stress environmental and social reasons for recycling. The agency also plans to release a podcast in which recycling specialists elaborate on their methodologies. The E.P.A. said it would schedule several cellphone collections in 2008 and would post a searchable list of cellphone drop-off centers on Web sites, including epa.gov. It will also distribute posters with the “It’s an easy call” tagline to partners, to post over drop-off bins. “Our key role is to get the message out, that recycling cellphones is easy and convenient,” said Mr. Hale, who estimates that 20 percent of unwanted cellphones are recycled or reused each year. This is not the E.P.A.’s first stab at tackling electronic waste. In 2003 the agency inaugurated “Plug Into eCycling,” a program to encourage reuse and recycling of computers, television sets and other large electronic items. Until recently cellphones, which contain smaller amounts of metals and chemicals than the larger items, seemed less troublesome. But now their sheer volume poses problems. According to Sprint Nextel, there are more than 240 million wireless subscribers in the United States alone. Eleven companies  AT&amp;T, Best Buy, LG Electronics, Motorola, Nokia, Office Depot, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Sprint, Staples and T-Mobile  are partners in the campaign. Each has promised to collect phones and hold recycling events. In fact, many already do so. Mark F. Buckley, vice president for environmental affairs at Staples, said the retailer recycled more than 31,600 cellphones and hand-held devices in 2006. That number was sure to rise, he said, as cellphones continued to supplant landlines, and as the E.P.A. continued to publicize recycling issues. “Each partner will still have its own program,” Mr. Buckley said, “but E.P.A. is providing a standardized message to consumers.” Sprint has two cellphone recycling programs. The Sprint Buyback Program lets customers swap old phones for a credit of up to $50 on their bills. Sprint Project Connect, a philanthropic program, accepts phones from customers of any carrier. The phones that cannot be reused are stripped of parts, and the shells sold to a recycler who extracts metals. Sprint subtracts its costs and donates what is left to a program that promotes Internet safety for children. According to Darren D. Beck, the Sprint manager who runs Project Connect, Sprint has recycled more than seven million phones since 2001, and it has donated more than $4.5 million to charity. Like Mr. Buckley, he expects that the E.P.A. campaign will increase those numbers. “It adds awareness and convenience,” he said. “If the Verizon store is down the block, our customers will now know that they can drop phones off there.” Environmental groups applaud the program, as far as it goes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they want the E.P.A. to regulate as well as cajole. “Cellphones are just the tip of the electronic waste iceberg now, but they could become a massive environmental problem,” said Beth Trask, manager for corporate partnerships at Environmental Defense. “Voluntary action and education can help prevent that, but we need regulation too. We really need it all.” More Articles in Technology »The way the Environmental Protection Agency sees it, one discarded cellphone is like one vote: on its own, it cannot do much harm or good, but the cumulative effect can pack a wallop.

Hesse as chief executive on Tuesday, succeeding Gary D. Forsee, who was ousted two months ago. Mr. Hesse, 54, helped slow profit erosion as head of Sprint’s local-phone spinoff, the Embarq Corporation, by closing call centers and creating packages of services. He has spent more than 25 years in the communications industry, and led the largest wireless company in the United States as an executive at AT&amp;T’s predecessor. Mr. Hesse takes over the third-largest cellphone carrier in the United States after a 26 percent decline in share price, while users switched to bigger rivals like AT&amp;T, which has soared 14 percent. He may use a plan similar to his moves at Embarq, where he called for cutting 1,000 jobs as subscribers shut off land lines. “He’s done an excellent job of running Embarq in very difficult times,” an analyst at the Stanford Group, Michael Nelson, said. At Sprint, “the big issue is readdressing the company’s marketing strategy,” he said. “They have a strong handset lineup, but they really do not have a strong marketing message.” Last month, Sprint, based in Reston, Va., cut its forecasts for next year, having lost the most contract subscribers since at least 2005. The company, which lost 337,000 customers last quarter, is on course for its first annual sales decline since 2003. Shares of Sprint fell 3 cents, to $13.88. Before Tuesday, they dropped 25 percent since Mr. Forsee’s ouster on Oct. 8. “Investors were hoping for a splashier announcement and a more marquee name,” said an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, Craig Moffett. Mr. Hesse “was always sort of perceived to be a fallback position,” Mr. Moffett said. “That’s going to make it all the more difficult for him to win over the hearts and minds of investors.” Embarq’s general counsel, Thomas A. Gerke, will serve as interim chief until a successor is found. James H. Hance Jr., a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group, remains Sprint’s chairman, the company said in a statement. Mr. Hesse had led Embarq since its 2006 spinoff from Sprint. He spent 23 years at AT&amp;T, and ran its wireless services group from 1997 to 2000. “He has strong operations experience, so he’s a good fit for what they need,” Ben Abramovitz, an analyst for Icap Equity Research, said. Mr. Forsee, 57, failed to integrate operations quickly from Nextel Communications, which it bought in 2005, and customers fled amid service disruptions.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image C. J. Gunther for The New York Times THERE Ed Gray bought phones with G.P.S. to track the locations of his daughters, Tiffany, left, and Jasmine. Sprint Nextel and Verizon Wireless offer G.P.S. tracking to let parents know the location of their child (as long as the child has a cellphone and it is turned on). Then, if the child doesn’t show up at school or other location at a certain time, parents can arrange to receive an e-mail or text message alert. Mr. Gray, who lives in Granby, Mass., decided that the comfort of regularly knowing the whereabouts of his daughters, Jasmine, 16, and Tiffany, 15, would offset the pain of paying for cellphone service for them, especially if the additional costs were modest. So about five months ago, the Grays signed up for a plan with Sprint that includes Family Locator, a service that for $9.99 a month lets a parent track the cellphones of up to four children. So far, the deal is working well. “The girls have cellphones, and we foot the bill in exchange for peace of mind,” said Mr. Gray, who is a technology support specialist for the alumni association of Mount Holyoke College and the author of a blog, Ed’s Tech Tips. When Mr. Gray uses the service, he turns to his computer and clicks on the Sprint Web site to locate either child. “Within about a minute, an icon appears on a map showing where the phone is,” he said. “It’s easy to use. And it’s good to be able to keep in touch when you need to.” Sprint offers about 90 phones for children that work with Family Locator. Parents can monitor children’s phones not only from their desks, but also from cellphones that can search the Web. By calling up Sprint’s Web site, a parent can see the child’s phone location on a map or listed by street address. A location’s accuracy is typically within 50 to 100 yards, said Rich Pesce, communications manager for Sprint, in Reston, Va. “If the phone can’t communicate with the G.P.S. satellites, it defaults to cell-tower locations and estimates the distance from them,” he explained. Then accuracy drops to about a mile. Sometimes the system cannot locate the child’s phone, Mr. Pesce said, usually because the phone is off or out of range of network coverage. The service isn’t meant to be covert. Parents can choose either to have an alert pop up on the phone every time they check its location or have occasional notices sent to children reminding them that their location is being monitored. The Grays chose a Sprint family plan with an $89.99 monthly charge that includes 1,400 minutes. They added unlimited text messaging ($20) with the location service (about $10). The bill totals about $140 a month, Mr. Gray said, including $20 for the daughters’ two phone lines. His daughters, he added, put up with the parental monitoring because they wanted the phones so much. Verizon Wireless’s service, called Chaperone, allows parents to set up a geographical area where the child can roam  a downtown shopping district, say. But if the child strays from the zone, the system alerts the parent. Some children will no doubt foil the system, for instance, by simply leaving their phones behind. But many parents may still find the tracking services attractive, said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. The services, he said, “are complementary to one of the main motivations adults have in giving children cellphones  to get in touch with them in an emergency.” Adding the ability to know where they are ties in to this. “It’s a comfort to have a bit more information,” he said.

When Mr. Gray uses the service, he turns to his computer and clicks on the Sprint Web site to locate either child. “Within about a minute, an icon appears on a map showing where the phone is,” he said. “It’s easy to use. And it’s good to be able to keep in touch when you need to.” Sprint offers about 90 phones for children that work with Family Locator. Parents can monitor children’s phones not only from their desks, but also from cellphones that can search the Web. By calling up Sprint’s Web site, a parent can see the child’s phone location on a map or listed by street address. A location’s accuracy is typically within 50 to 100 yards, said Rich Pesce, communications manager for Sprint, in Reston, Va. “If the phone can’t communicate with the G.P.S. satellites, it defaults to cell-tower locations and estimates the distance from them,” he explained. Then accuracy drops to about a mile. Sometimes the system cannot locate the child’s phone, Mr. Pesce said, usually because the phone is off or out of range of network coverage. The service isn’t meant to be covert. Parents can choose either to have an alert pop up on the phone every time they check its location or have occasional notices sent to children reminding them that their location is being monitored. The Grays chose a Sprint family plan with an $89.99 monthly charge that includes 1,400 minutes. They added unlimited text messaging ($20) with the location service (about $10). The bill totals about $140 a month, Mr. Gray said, including $20 for the daughters’ two phone lines. His daughters, he added, put up with the parental monitoring because they wanted the phones so much. Verizon Wireless’s service, called Chaperone, allows parents to set up a geographical area where the child can roam  a downtown shopping district, say. But if the child strays from the zone, the system alerts the parent. Some children will no doubt foil the system, for instance, by simply leaving their phones behind. But many parents may still find the tracking services attractive, said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. The services, he said, “are complementary to one of the main motivations adults have in giving children cellphones  to get in touch with them in an emergency.” Adding the ability to know where they are ties in to this. “It’s a comfort to have a bit more information,” he said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/business/30sprint.html?ref=sprintnextelcorporation">Sprint Is Said to Reject Offer by Investors and SK Telecom<date>Published: November 30, 2007</date><text>Sprint Nextel has rejected an offer from Providence Equity Partners and SK Telecom of South Korea to replace management and invest $5 billion in the company, according to people apprised of the situation. Skip to next paragraph Related Letter to Sprint's board of directors (phone numbers removed) Providence and SK Telecom, along with Timothy M. Donahue, the company’s former executive chairman, sent a three-page letter to James H. Hance Jr., nonexecutive chairman of Sprint’s board, asking to meet to discuss an offer that would install Mr. Donahue as the new chief executive. In the letter on Nov. 10, the two companies wrote that they would address the "key operating challenges facing” Sprint and significantly cut costs by jointly purchasing handsets and examining network infrastructure. The board declined to meet with them, according to those briefed on the matter. Sprint has been troubled by a series of problems in recent years, including the departure of high-level executives, customer discontent and the ill effects of the troubled Nextel merger. Gary D. Forsee, the chairman and chief executive, resigned in October on the heels of news reports that the board was seeking to replace him by December. There have been other significant departures, including that of Len J. Lauer, the chief operating officer, who left in August 2006. "We believe that Providence’s investment will signal to the public that Sprint Nextel represents a compelling opportunity," the letter from the would-be buyers said. What Sprint needs more than cash, analysts said, is strong management, because communications has become even more competitive with new entrants, like Google, threatening to offer services to consumers. There are questions, too, whether federal regulators would allow an investment by a foreign communications company in Sprint, the nation’s third-largest wireless carrier after AT&amp;T and Verizon, the analysts said. SK Telecom, South Korea’s largest wireless operator, is seeking to expand globally and already has an investment in Helio, a wireless joint venture with EarthLink. A spokeswoman for Sprint declined to discuss the letter but said the company was continuing its search for a new chief executive. She gave no time frame for when the board planned to finish the search. Representatives of Providence and SK Telecom declined to comment about their proposal. Since Mr. Forsee’s departure, many industry executives have turned down offers of the chief’s job. Daniel R. Hesse, chief executive of the phone service provider Embarq, which was spun off from Sprint, is among those being considered now, according to people with knowledge of the search process. Embarq did not return a call seeking comment.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image The Amazon Kindle incorporates cellular broadband service. Sure, the idea has appeal: an e-reader lets you carry hundreds of books, search or jump to any spot in the text and bump up the type size when your eyes get tired. But the counterarguments are equally persuasive. Printed books are dirt cheap, never run out of power and survive drops, spills and being run over. And their file format will still be readable 200 years from now. So e-book readers keep on coming and keep on flopping: the Rocket eBook Reader. Gemstar. Everybook. SoftBook. Librius Millennium Reader. The Sony Reader is in stores even now, priced at $350 and making literally dozens of sales. Then on Monday, Amazon introduced its own e-book reader, called the Kindle. It arrives at $400  reading material sold separately. Are they completely nuts? The Kindle is a thin, 10-ounce slab of white plastic, tucked into a leatherette cover. It’s not, ahem, gorgeous; it’s all white plastic, sharp angles and visible seams, with all the design panache of a Commodore 64. Its slight left-side thickening is supposed to suggest the feel of a paperback book folded back on your hand. The screen uses the same astonishing E Ink technology that Sony’s Reader uses. It looks like black ink on light gray paper: no backlight, no glare, no eyestrain  and no need to turn it off, ever. That’s because E Ink draws power only when you turn a page. At that point, millions of particles are drawn into a pattern of letters (or four-shade gray-scale images) by a brief electronic charge  and there they can stay forever, even if you take the battery out. You don’t turn this thing off; you just set it down, like a book. The “ink” is so close to the surface of the screen, it looks like it’s been printed there, so reading is satisfying, immersive and natural. At page turns, only a distracting black-white flash reminds you that you’re not viewing paper anymore. To the right is a screen-height recessed groove. What looks like a shiny bit of silver chrome moves in this groove as you roll the clickable thumbwheel beneath it. This is your cursor; the electronically controlled silver patch grows and shrinks to highlight buttons or page chunks on the screen to its left. But the part that will really rock your world is the Kindle’s free wireless cellular broadband service. Now, if you just splurted your coffee, you’re forgiven; “free” and “wireless broadband” have rarely been used in the same sentence before. The Kindle goes online using Sprint’s 3G cellular data network  the same service that costs $60 a month for corporate laptop luggers. The Kindle’s price tag stings less when you realize that Amazon is going to pay your entire wireless tab. So the Kindle can get online almost anywhere  not just in little coffee-shop hot spots, but in cabs, in lines, in doctor’s offices. There’s even a crude Web browser. It’s fine for text and graphics, lousy for Web layouts and useless for streaming audio or video. But with some effort, you can use it to get news, rebook a flight, monitor blogs and even check Web e-mail (like Gmail). But that’s not why Amazon is paying your wireless bills, and that’s not why it burdened the design with a tiny, clicky keyboard. No, the real point is instant book downloading. The Kindle store offers best-seller lists, Most Popular lists and a Search box. The catalog includes 90,000 books so far, including 101 of the 112 currently listed as New York Times best sellers. That dwarfs the Sony catalog (20,000 books), but Amazon says that it’s just the tip of the iceberg. Its goal is to have every printed book on earth available for instant download. It’s a giddy thought. Someone mentions a great book  any book. You whip out the Kindle, download the book in 60 seconds and start reading it. That fantasy isn’t quite fulfilled at the moment. There’s an endless amount of great stuff on the Kindle store, but not everything. There’s no “Harry Potter” series, no “Book Thief,” no “Inconvenient Truth.” Still, the instant wireless gratification is intoxicating, especially compared with the clunky method of loading up previous e-readers, with a Windows PC and a cable. The pricing is another breakthrough: Kindle books generally cost less than half of what printed books cost (and much less than Sony’s e-books). It’s common sense; why should a digital file cost as much as a physical object, manufactured and shipped? Most Kindle hardcover books cost $10, including “I Am America (and So Can You”), “Deceptively Delicious” and “Freakonomics.” Their hardcover prices are $25 or $26.

Mr. Bezos is hoping that Kindle, an ambitious $399 e-book device that he introduced in New York, will avoid that fate. Kindle, which Amazon spent three years developing, lets users wirelessly download best sellers for $9.99 each, and it is designed to be simpler to use and more comfortable to hold than similar devices. Most significant, Amazon has made it easy to shop for and buy books through Kindle without using a computer. The device connects to a high-speed wireless data network from Sprint, and wireless delivery is included in the cost of books and other products. Downloading a book takes less than a minute. Mr. Bezos said Kindle was most likely to appeal to travelers and others who want to carry several books with them. Anyone who is reading two, three, four books at the same time should have one of these, he said in an interview. Kindle can store 200 books at once. Mr. Bezos added that he thought Kindle would be more comfortable for people to curl up with than previous reading devices. It weighs 10.3 ounces and uses so-called electronic ink technology licensed from the company E Ink, based in Cambridge, Mass. The screen reflects light, making it easier to read in a bright room, and it uses less power and generates less heat, because there is no backlight to the display. Kindle will also download and display newspapers, magazines and blogs. Among the newspapers available are The New York Times for $13.99 a month and The Wall Street Journal for $9.99 a month. Some 300 blogs are available for 99 cents or $1.99 a month. Amazon shares some of that fee with newspaper and blog publishers. The device will only be available at Amazon. Amazon, which is one of the worlds largest booksellers, reached agreements with all the major publishers to sell their wares on Kindle. It has about 90,000 titles so far and 90 percent of current best sellers. Sony, which introduced an e-book reader a year ago, has about 20,000 titles for sale. Publishing executives said they were optimistic about Kindle. You kind of understand why it has been three years in development because it offers so much in an uncomplicated way, said David Young, the chief executive of the Hachette Book Group USA, which owns Little, Brown. The big challenge, of course, is that it is still relatively expensive, he added. You have to be a very committed book person to get a repay on that investment. The publishers themselves are concerned about return on investment; most have been spending a great deal to digitize their libraries for electronic readers, with little to show for it so far. If it does contribute to the many millions of dollars we have invested as an industry, thats great, Mr. Young said. Amazon and the publishers declined to discuss the specifics of their financial arrangements. But several publishing executives said the industry practice was to sell an electronic version of a hardcover with a list price of $27 for about $20. While deals vary, the wholesale price of a $20 e-book is about $10, and most retailers have been selling them for about $16. The publishers said Amazon was paying about the same wholesale price as Sony and other e-book vendors. By offering best sellers for $9.99, Amazon is leaving no profit margin, and it will have the expense of paying Sprint for the data transmission. Amazon says it hopes to make money on older titles that have better profit margins. Digital distribution of books would seem to have a lot of benefits for publishers. So far there is not much book piracy online (although there have been some high-profile leaks, most notably that of the latest Harry Potter book). There also is not much pressure to break books into smaller pieces, in the way that people want to buy songs, not albums. And there are no conflicts with distributors of the sort that complicate the online video business. Indeed, e-books have the potential to save publishers the cost of printing, distribution and returns. But publishers said their biggest hope was that Kindle would expand sales of books to a new generation of gadget lovers. We have great authors, and we want to get our books to readers, and this is another channel to us, said Kate Tentler, senior vice president for digital media at Simon &amp; Schuster.

Consumers have never been happy about their cellphone carriers and the services they provide  or refuse to provide. But they also have hardly the means to do anything, except switch from one carrier to the next. But a rebellion is brewing in the communications industry that is expected to pit wireless carriers, including AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, against Silicon Valley powerhouses like Google. The tussle might undermine the control incumbent companies have over mobile phone consumers by giving them a few weapons to strike back. The first salvo came last summer with the release of the Apple iPhone, which, with its easy-to-use features, redefined how mainstream consumers view hand-held devices. Last week, Google generated fanfare when it announced plans for the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of companies working to turn mobile phones into hand-held computers that can offer a variety of applications and services. In addition, federal regulators are moving to create a more open national wireless network when it auctions off spectrum licenses in January that would allow bidders to build a network free from carrier constraint. At the heart of the tension between the different camps is whether the wireless network should be open, much like the Internet is today, or remain under the watchful control of companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone. Carriers, who paid billions of dollars to build their networks, are unwilling to open them. For others, change can’t happen soon enough. As such the alliances and partnerships struck now are likely to shape the industry over the next five years. “It is the battle of the overdogs,” said Tom Wheeler, a venture capitalist and former chief of the CTIA, a trade group for the wireless industry. “They are all jostling back and forth to be leaders of the next generation. The question is, how do I position myself? It is a territorial battle.” Indeed, the rift has spilled into public view. At CTIA’s Wireless I.T. and Entertainment conference in San Francisco last month, a woman attending a panel discussion with representatives from AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint Nextel, stood at a microphone wagging her finger and chiding them for being too controlling, as several others in the audience whispered and nodded in agreement. The next day, at a panel on social networking, executives griped that software developers would not prosper unless phone companies were less greedy. “Definitely there is hostility,” said David Weiden, a partner at Khosla Ventures in Menlo Park who has previously worked at McCaw Cellular, Netscape and AOL. “There are enough catalysts for change now, and it is already happening.” But the question many are asking is why the tension now, in contrast to, say, six months ago? The catalysts are threefold, said Mr. Weiden: the proliferation of new technologically advanced mobile phones, greater bandwidth and increased competition. But mainstream consumers too are being conditioned to expect more, particularly after the debut of the iPhone which offers easy-to-use Web browsing, Wi-Fi capabilities and high-quality video. Indeed, Shahid Khan, a partner at the IBB Consulting Group in Princeton Junction, N.J., said he believes wireless networks will go the way of the Internet, where closed communities like AOL once dominated, then later morphed into hybrids. Now services like AOL co-exist, albeit in a less powerful state, alongside open networks. “The industry is really at an inflection point,” said Mr. Khan. Roger Entner, a senior vice president for communications at IAG Research, said telephone companies have to do a better job communicating with consumers who are accustomed to unfettered access on the Web. “The carriers have done a pretty poor job in portraying their position and reasoning to the public,” Mr. Entner said. By contrast, venture capitalists and technologists are better at whipping up interest in sexy new technologies. “Silicon Valley has done a good job in telling the world what a wonderful nirvana the Internet is,” he said. “But 90 percent of the sites aren’t profitable.” Telephone company executives know they are in a tricky spot. Ralph de la Vega, the president and chief executive officer of AT&amp;T Mobility, said he does not sense tension in the industry. Instead, he politely called it “change.” But he agreed that AT&amp;T and others could better explain that companies like his are more open than most people think. In particular, he said, there are six operating systems currently available on AT&amp;T mobile phones, as well as a variety of music services and e-mail options. It should be noted, he said, that AT&amp;T backed the iPhone. And Mr. de la Vega did not rule out the notion that his company would one day be part of Google’s alliance. “It is one of several operating systems we could use down the road,” he said. “We are still looking at what it means. If we think it’s something our customers want, we will be part of any alliance.” Indeed, wireless carriers are circumspect. When a Verizon executive at the CTIA conference was asked by a reporter what he thought of the calls for openness, he said, “If I talk to you and someone sees me, I’ll get fired.” (He asked not to be named, fearing reprisals from colleagues.) Last week, Verizon executives were not available for comment because they were traveling. Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the relationship between software developers, carriers and handset makers can only change because the way that consumers relate to their phones is changing too. “On a personal level, the phone feels more like property,” said Mr. Wu. “Once you start to make it yours, you feel like you have more rights to it. It will have a huge effect if you don’t feel free to do what they want.” His view is that now that entrants like Apple and Google are in the game, companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon are going to have to adjust. “Little companies are not going to change industry practices,” said Mr. Wu. That happens, he said, “when you have big, powerful players with a different ideology.” Not surprising, he and others are focusing on what will happen with the auction of the 700-megahertz wireless band by the federal government in January. Last summer, Google said it would offer at least $4.6 billion for a stake if certain conditions for the auction were met. Some were, but Google has not said whether it would actually join the bidding. There has been a lot of speculation about what other companies will step forward before the end of the year. Cable companies, software makers, even media companies, are among those weighing their options, industry executives said. “If Google doesn’t get it, what does it do?” asked Mr. Wheeler. “And if it does get it, what does Microsoft do? It’s a game of musical chairs. When the music stops, everyone wants to be near a chair.” Mr. de la Vega said, though, that there is a big difference between buying a license and running a network. And few companies aside from AT&amp;T and others have the expertise. Added Mr. Entner, “An open network is really awesome if you don’t have to operate it.” More Articles in Technology »First come the grumblings, then the torches and pitchforks. Consumers have never been happy about their cellphone carriers and the services they provide  or refuse to provide. But they also have hardly the means to do anything, except switch from one carrier to the next. But a rebellion is brewing in the communications industry that is expected to pit wireless carriers, including AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, against Silicon Valley powerhouses like Google. The tussle might undermine the control incumbent companies have over mobile phone consumers by giving them a few weapons to strike back. The first salvo came last summer with the release of the Apple iPhone, which, with its easy-to-use features, redefined how mainstream consumers view hand-held devices. Last week, Google generated fanfare when it announced plans for the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of companies working to turn mobile phones into hand-held computers that can offer a variety of applications and services. In addition, federal regulators are moving to create a more open national wireless network when it auctions off spectrum licenses in January that would allow bidders to build a network free from carrier constraint. At the heart of the tension between the different camps is whether the wireless network should be open, much like the Internet is today, or remain under the watchful control of companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone. Carriers, who paid billions of dollars to build their networks, are unwilling to open them. For others, change can’t happen soon enough. As such the alliances and partnerships struck now are likely to shape the industry over the next five years. “It is the battle of the overdogs,” said Tom Wheeler, a venture capitalist and former chief of the CTIA, a trade group for the wireless industry. “They are all jostling back and forth to be leaders of the next generation. The question is, how do I position myself? It is a territorial battle.” Indeed, the rift has spilled into public view. At CTIA’s Wireless I.T. and Entertainment conference in San Francisco last month, a woman attending a panel discussion with representatives from AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint Nextel, stood at a microphone wagging her finger and chiding them for being too controlling, as several others in the audience whispered and nodded in agreement. The next day, at a panel on social networking, executives griped that software developers would not prosper unless phone companies were less greedy. “Definitely there is hostility,” said David Weiden, a partner at Khosla Ventures in Menlo Park who has previously worked at McCaw Cellular, Netscape and AOL. “There are enough catalysts for change now, and it is already happening.” But the question many are asking is why the tension now, in contrast to, say, six months ago? The catalysts are threefold, said Mr. Weiden: the proliferation of new technologically advanced mobile phones, greater bandwidth and increased competition. But mainstream consumers too are being conditioned to expect more, particularly after the debut of the iPhone which offers easy-to-use Web browsing, Wi-Fi capabilities and high-quality video. Indeed, Shahid Khan, a partner at the IBB Consulting Group in Princeton Junction, N.J., said he believes wireless networks will go the way of the Internet, where closed communities like AOL once dominated, then later morphed into hybrids. Now services like AOL co-exist, albeit in a less powerful state, alongside open networks. “The industry is really at an inflection point,” said Mr. Khan. Roger Entner, a senior vice president for communications at IAG Research, said telephone companies have to do a better job communicating with consumers who are accustomed to unfettered access on the Web. “The carriers have done a pretty poor job in portraying their position and reasoning to the public,” Mr. Entner said. By contrast, venture capitalists and technologists are better at whipping up interest in sexy new technologies. “Silicon Valley has done a good job in telling the world what a wonderful nirvana the Internet is,” he said. “But 90 percent of the sites aren’t profitable.” Telephone company executives know they are in a tricky spot. Ralph de la Vega, the president and chief executive officer of AT&amp;T Mobility, said he does not sense tension in the industry. Instead, he politely called it “change.” But he agreed that AT&amp;T and others could better explain that companies like his are more open than most people think. In particular, he said, there are six operating systems currently available on AT&amp;T mobile phones, as well as a variety of music services and e-mail options. It should be noted, he said, that AT&amp;T backed the iPhone. And Mr. de la Vega did not rule out the notion that his company would one day be part of Google’s alliance. “It is one of several operating systems we could use down the road,” he said. “We are still looking at what it means. If we think it’s something our customers want, we will be part of any alliance.” Indeed, wireless carriers are circumspect. When a Verizon executive at the CTIA conference was asked by a reporter what he thought of the calls for openness, he said, “If I talk to you and someone sees me, I’ll get fired.” (He asked not to be named, fearing reprisals from colleagues.) Last week, Verizon executives were not available for comment because they were traveling. Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the relationship between software developers, carriers and handset makers can only change because the way that consumers relate to their phones is changing too. “On a personal level, the phone feels more like property,” said Mr. Wu. “Once you start to make it yours, you feel like you have more rights to it. It will have a huge effect if you don’t feel free to do what they want.” His view is that now that entrants like Apple and Google are in the game, companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon are going to have to adjust. “Little companies are not going to change industry practices,” said Mr. Wu. That happens, he said, “when you have big, powerful players with a different ideology.” Not surprising, he and others are focusing on what will happen with the auction of the 700-megahertz wireless band by the federal government in January. Last summer, Google said it would offer at least $4.6 billion for a stake if certain conditions for the auction were met. Some were, but Google has not said whether it would actually join the bidding. There has been a lot of speculation about what other companies will step forward before the end of the year. Cable companies, software makers, even media companies, are among those weighing their options, industry executives said. “If Google doesn’t get it, what does it do?” asked Mr. Wheeler. “And if it does get it, what does Microsoft do? It’s a game of musical chairs. When the music stops, everyone wants to be near a chair.” Mr. de la Vega said, though, that there is a big difference between buying a license and running a network. And few companies aside from AT&amp;T and others have the expertise. Added Mr. Entner, “An open network is really awesome if you don’t have to operate it.”</text></article></page></root>
