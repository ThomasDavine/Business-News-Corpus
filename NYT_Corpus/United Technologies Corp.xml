Otis In both cases, an electric motor, which converts current into mechanical energy, briefly reverses its function to become a generator, converting mechanical energy into current. One problem for cars is that the flow of electricity is so great that batteries have trouble absorbing it. For the last decade or so, companies have been using regenerative braking in elevators. Elevators normally use counterweights that are equal to the mass of a half-empty elevator car. If the car is going up with only one person in it, or coming down full, there is gravity to fight with and brakes have to be used. Otis, the largest elevator manufacturer, points out that some elevators already capture this unwanted energy as electricity but then typically dissipate it as heat. The company and others sell models that put the current back into the building’s electrical grid, which has a far greater capacity to absorb sudden jolts of energy than car batteries do. Then it can be used to power other building systems. Now, the idea has spread to escalators. At a green building conference in Toronto on Wednesday, the company introduced an escalator that combines regenerative braking with a standby feature: the escalator slows down when no one is on it. The new model also uses LEDs for illumination, further cutting energy use. And Otis says it has a better lubricant system, too. It is the first use of regenerative braking in an escalator, the company says. A video from Otis explains the concept.) While the regenerative escalators are just edging into the market, Otis, a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation, said it recently sold 700 of its energy-efficient elevators for a housing project in Jiangsu, China.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/business/a-strategic-risk-in-the-feds-plan.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">A Strategic Risk in the Fed’s Plan<date>Published: September 23, 2011</date><text>Financial markets are tiring of the Federal Reserve’s love offerings. The central bank has long been able to soothe nervous investors with rate cuts or newly printed money. But markets on Thursday spurned the announcement of the Twist, an operation to lengthen the maturity of $400 billion of the Fed’s $1.7 trillion Treasury holdings.Stocks fell sharply and the price of bonds from governments still considered safe rose. Investors were right not to be impressed. The Twist is aimed primarily at the American housing market. But even if the Fed’s rearrangement lowers mortgage costs, house prices will be held back by a weak economy and the huge oversupply left from the bubble years. Tight monetary policy has long ceased to stand in the way of economic growth. Official real interest rates are solidly negative almost everywhere. The Twist could even impede lending — and growth — by narrowing the gap between short and long term rates. Banks, after all, gain from a steep yield curve. Central banks could try to regain the favor of investors with yet more monetary love. The Bank of England dropped some not-so-subtle hints this week about another round of quantitative easing. In the United States, some are calling for QE3. But no amount of money, whether from fiscal transfers, QE3 or QE33, can force banks to lend or consumers to borrow and spend. More money will not push up the prices of financial assets that investors deem too risky. The Asian market rout is caused in part by fund managers trying to get ahead of an expected wave of redemptions from cross-border investors. But while the gains from monetary stimulus are small, the potential harm is significant. The Fed and its peers are creating piles of money that could be put in and taken out of different assets in disruptive quantities and at dizzying speeds. In the current economic environment, the twists and turns of monetary policy will not reduce unemployment or rebalance trade. It would be better for the world if central banks stopped trying. A Debt of Gratitude United Technologies is catching a break from lenders. The 47 percent premium built into the $16.5 billion it is paying for shares of Goodrich, an aerospace specialist, makes the price look overly generous, especially amid gloomy stock markets. But cheap debt should make the deal easier to swallow. The company indicated hoped-for annual synergies of up to $400 million. Taxed, put on a multiple of 10 and offset by the expected $500 million of one-off costs, these are worth less than $2 billion after adjusting for the five-year delay before they materialize in full. That’s only a little more than a third of the premium United Technologies is paying over the undisturbed price of Goodrich. Goodrich’s allure, however, goes beyond cost savings. Among other aerospace interests, United Technologies owns Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. As with the classic example of computer printers, the big profit in this kind of business comes from the aftermarket, and 43 percent of Goodrich’s revenue comes from service calls, giving United Technologies a new source of potential growth. And on another financial measure, the deal doesn’t look so dear. Goodrich is expected to make operating profit of $1.6 billion in 2013, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Suppose $300 million of cost cuts are in place by then, and within a couple of years United Technologies will be collecting a pretax 10 percent return on its total investment, including assumed debt. The deal might have been more attractive but for the news media uncovering the company’s hunt for financing. Then again, the timing is still good for the Connecticut-based conglomerate to borrow three-quarters of the needed cash. Investors are hungry for relatively safe blue-chip industrial credits. Throw in ultra-low Treasury yields, and borrowing is cheap. United Technologies’ existing 30-year debt yields only around 4.4 percent. The $15 billion of new borrowing shouldn’t damage the company’s credit ratings, either, thanks to a conservative capital structure — though it will be issuing new stock and curtailing buybacks. Even offering debt investors a bit extra, it’s hard to see the company paying more than 5 percent. For United Technologies’ shareholders, that should mitigate the initial sticker shock.

But if officials thought a new approach would avoid controversy, they have been disappointed.As the Air Force tries to speed its purchases, it is considering using an obscure 1932 law to buy at least $1 billion worth of helicopters without competitive bids, government officials say. Watchdog groups and some industry officials are bristling at the idea, saying it would hand the business to Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies of Hartford, Conn., without giving other companies a chance to offer what could be substantially lower prices. The law, the Economy Act of 1932, was part of Herbert Hoover’s efforts to cut purchasing costs in the Depression by letting federal agencies buy equipment from one another without seeking bids from industry. Military analysts say it now eases transfers of fuel and computers, but it has hardly ever been used to buy weapons or aircraft. Under the proposal, which is being debated in the Pentagon, the Air Force would add its order for as many as 93 Black Hawk helicopters to an Army contract with Sikorsky. The Army would order the extra craft, then sell them to the Air Force. Air Force officials have said that the new helicopters would replace old Hueys that help secure Western missile silos and can ferry federal officials to safety in a crisis. Most of the Hueys were built during the Vietnam War, and avoiding a bid process could save a year or more in getting the replacements into the field. But, as top Pentagon officials emphasize the need for more competition to reduce weapon costs, several analysts estimate that the Air Force could save 20 to 40 percent by inviting other manufacturers to bid. “There are certainly options out there, and the Air Force rationale just seems kind of shaky,” said Nick Schwellenbach, the director of investigations at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group in Washington. “The idea should be to save money by having the companies slug it out.” Air Force officials declined to be interviewed and released a statement saying, “All options are under review, and no decisions have been made.” Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace and military consultancy in Fairfax, Va., said Air Force officials had had “the living tar beaten out of them” in bid competitions in recent years, with government auditors overturning multibillion-dollar awards for aerial refueling tankers and for other helicopters. Given those delays in replacing other equipment, “you can see the appeal of some kind of fast-track, quick remedy,” he said. Air Force officials might think, “Just give us the Black Hawks.” After all, Mr. Aboulafia said, “everyone else has them.” But while the Black Hawks are among the most popular military helicopters ever made, they are much larger and more expensive than other helicopters that would also be faster and more efficient than the old Hueys, Mr. Aboulafia said. He said Black Hawks typically cost the Army $12 million to $13 million each, and the newest model could cost $16 million to $18 million. By contrast, each AugustaWestland AW139 costs $10 million to $12 million, Mr. Aboulafia said. Eurocopter and Bell Helicopter, which made the Hueys, would also be likely to bid if the Air Force held a competition, he said. Sikorsky won the Army contract for the Black Hawk through a competition in 1976. Paul F. Jackson, a Sikorsky spokesman, said that if Air Force officials decided to buy Black Hawks through that contract, they could “receive deliveries ahead of their schedule and benefit from the cost savings achieved by that agreement.” Sikorsky’s supporters said the Black Hawks, which have been used extensively in war zones, would also need fewer security and safety modifications, which can add to costs and delays. But Dan Hill, an official of AugustaWestland, a unit of Finmeccanica of Italy, said the Black Hawk “seems to be a 125 percent or 150 percent solution” that would also cost much more to operate than his company’s helicopter. “We just need a competition to make that case,” he said. Whatever happens, contract lawyers say, the Pentagon would probably rather not mention one fact — that one of the main precedents for transferring military systems under the Economy Act occurred in the Iran-contra affair in 1986. Investigators later found that the Defense Department had used the act to transfer missiles to the Central Intelligence Agency, which sold them to Iran to raise money for the Nicaraguan contras.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/ge-honeywell-and-united-tech-said-to-eye-bae-unit/?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">G.E., Honeywell and United Tech Among Bidders for BAE Unit<date>October 20, 2010, 3:55 am</date><text>General Electric, Honeywell International and United Technologies are among the bidders for BAE Systems‘ aerospace unit, which could fetch up to $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

Two, Boeing and Lockheed, reduced their outlooks for the year because of the effect of recently pass health care legislation.The Boeing Company, the military contractor and plane maker, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, but cut its 2010 earnings forecast because of health care legislation. “I’m going to be looking for evidence of the trajectory of the recovery,” said Alex Hamilton, senior managing director at C.K. Cooper &amp; Company. The “sweet spot” of the recovery will come when Boeing starts showing a sustained flow of domestic orders, he said. “We’re not going to see that for a while,” Mr. Hamilton said. “But domestic U.S. airlines have been doing much better.” Boeing and its top rival, Airbus, were dogged in 2009 by fewer orders for airplanes as carriers around the world grappled with falling travel demand in the sagging economy. Boeing said first-quarter net profit fell to $519 million, or 70 cents a share, from $610 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. The results, which include a 20-cent-a-share charge on new health reform law’s elimination of tax deductions that have been available to companies for retiree prescription drug expenses, beat Wall Street’s average estimate of 64 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 7.8 percent to $15.2 billion. The company reported an order backlog amounting to $315 billion. The second military contractor, the Lockheed Martin Corporation, said net earnings fell to $547 million, or $1.45 a share, from $666 million, or $1.68 a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.34 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The results included a charge of about 25 cents a share resulting from the health reform law. Revenue rose about 3 percent to $10.64 billion, compared with $10.62 billion expected by analysts. Shares of military contractors were hurt in 2009 by program cuts and concern that spending growth would slow under the Obama administration. President Obama’s fiscal 2011 military budget calls for a 3.4 percent rise in base spending. While billions are set aside for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon docked Lockheed $614 million in performance fees because performance had not met expectations in recent years. The third manufacturer, United Technologies, reported that its quarterly profit was helped by lower reorganization costs. The company’s revenue missed analysts’ forecasts. The company, which makes elevators, air-conditioners and aircraft engines, recorded a 20 percent rise in earnings, ending four quarters of declines, as heavy cost-cutting that included some 15,000 job cuts last year paid off. Sales were weaker than expected at the company’s Sikorsky helicopter and fire and security equipment businesses, and United Tech’s shares were down slightly in light premarket trading. First-quarter profit attributable to common shareholders came to $866 million, or 93 cents a diluted share, topping the 90 cents a share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters. A year earlier the company earned $722 million, or 78 cents a share. The 2010 result included 5 cents a share of reorganization costs, less than the 9 cents a share recorded a year ago. A Deutsche Bank analyst, Nigel Coe, said that the slide in earnings “was driven entirely” by one-time items. “Revenue performance was soft,” Mr. Coe added. Revenue fell 1.3 percent to $12.09 billion, below the $12.26 billion analysts had expected. United Tech, which also makes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines, bolstered the low end of its 2010 profit forecast, predicting a range of $4.50 to $4.65 a share, up from $4.40 to $4.65.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/united-tech-considers-bigger-bets-in-clean-tech/?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">United Tech Considers 'Bigger Bets' in Clean Energy<date>February 12, 2010, 3:51 am</date><text>United Technologies is interested in making bigger investments in alternative energy, possibly including a majority stake in wind turbine maker Clipper Windpower, a top executive at the diversified United States manufacturer said on Thursday, Reuters reported. “We’ve been looking at alternative energy for a long time,” United Tech’s chief financial officer, Greg Hayes, said at an investor conference. “We always liked the space. We see the movement toward clean energy as a space that we can participate in with the technologies that we have.” The Hartford-based company in December paid about $271 million for a 49.5 percent stake in Carpinteria, Calif.-based Clipper. Mr. Hayes noted that technology developed by United Tech’s aircraft engine business could be used to improve the performance of Clipper turbines — an approach rival General Electric has also taken in the wind sector. “If over the next couple of years we see what we like, we always have the opportunity to take a majority share if we want,” Mr. Hayes said of Clipper. “If we like the market dynamics, I think you might see more in that space or other alternative technology spaces, which are adjacent to markets where we can use UTC technologies.” The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners also has a sizable fuel-cell operation. Fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity without emitting carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas associated with global climate change. United Tech remains interested in other investments in the clean-tech area, Mr. Hayes said. The company has a $3 billion 2010 takeover budget, though more than half of that is going for its acquisition of G.E.’s security business. “We hope to play these small bets into a bigger bet sometime down the road,” he said.

The deal, announced this week, signals a change in the ownership structure for one of the few major American-owned turbine makers. (Another is General Electric.) United Technologies, a Hartford-based parent company to businesses like the jet engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney and the elevator maker Otis, has recently shown interest in alternative energy. For example, it has licensed its molten salt storage technology to the solar power plant builder SolarReserve. In a statement on Wednesday, United Technologies said that it “expects to work closely with Clipper Windpower to improve the company’s core technology, manufacturing, product quality, and supply management capabilities.” The agreement, the company added, “allows U.T.C. to expand its power generation portfolio and enter the high-growth wind power segment.” Clipper, which is listed on London’s A.I.M. stock exchange, began to look for investors earlier this year as the global recession took its toll and customers delayed turbine orders. Millions of dollars spent fixing defects in some older turbines further sapped Clipper’s cash flow. Its share price rose by close to 20 percent on Thursday, after the deal was announced. Douglas Pertz, Clipper’s chief executive, said in an interview on Friday that he expects to see the market revive in the latter half of 2010. (On Thursday, G.E. announced a $1.4 billion deal to supply turbines to what would be the nation’s largest wind farm, in Oregon.) United Technologies has agreed not to acquire additional shares of Clipper for two years following the close of the deal. Mr. Pertz argued that there are similarities between General Electric and United Technologies — as well as a bit of history. Clipper’s chairman, James Dehlsen, founded one of the United States’ early wind turbine makers, Zond, in 1980, and subsequently sold it to Enron. When Enron collapsed earlier this decade, General Electric acquired its wind division and subsequently turned the unit into the nation’s biggest turbine manufacturer. (Mr. Dehlsen started Clipper in 2001.) “G.E. bought a company that was probably half a billion dollars in sales at the time and they have grown it into a $6 billion business,” Mr. Pertz said in a telephone interview Friday. “United Technologies, I would suggest to you, is like the G.E. of old.” While Clipper focuses on its 2.5-megawatt Liberty model, the company will continue work in the United Kingdom on the development of the world’s largest windmill, a 10-megawatt, 574-foot-tall offshore turbine dubbed Project Britannia. The Crown Estate, which manages royal property for Queen Elizabeth II, has bought the prototype of the turbine.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E1D7133CF930A25752C1A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">G.E. to Sell Security Unit<date>Published: November 13, 2009</date><text>General Electric said Thursday that it would sell its fire alarm and security systems unit to United Technologies for $1.82 billion, continuing a sale of what the industrial conglomerate considers noncore businesses.

Struggles, a Rival Steps Up<date>Published: November 12, 2009</date><text>It is only fitting that United Technologies is poised to buy assets from its cross-state rival General Electric. At least in the eyes of shareholders, United Technologies -- the manufacturer of Otis elevators, Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters -- has emerged as the more successful of the two industrial conglomerates, both based in Connecticut. G.E. is the larger of the two, with a $169 billion market cap. But it is hobbling its way out of the credit crisis, diverting cash away from dividends and selling assets to shore up its balance sheet. Next week, it is expected to sell a controlling stake in NBC Universal, the broadcaster it has owned for decades. United Technologies, with its $63 billion market value, appears in robust health, quietly buying assets. It is also said to be in talks to acquire fire alarm and security systems operations that G.E., led by Jeffrey R. Immelt, has put on the block for some $1.5 billion. Both companies are sprawling industrial corporations with concentrated portfolios in the aerospace, power and infrastructure. Their main point of difference, however, explains why they find themselves at such remarkable odds. G.E. made a huge bet on finance while United Technologies stuck to its manufacturing knitting. Lately, G.E.'s decision has been dreadful for its shareholders. In the last year, United Technologies, headed by Louis R. Chênevert, has returned 40 percent including dividends. That is 10 times G.E.'s total shareholder return. That period -- which includes the recent panic that especially hurt GE Capital -- may not seem a fair one to choose. Yet since February 2007, when the first problems in subprime became apparent, United Technologies' shares are essentially unchanged while G.E.'s have lost half their value. Go back a decade, and the picture is similar. Investors who rolled their dividends back into United Technologies stock have had a 185 percent return, while G.E.'s shareholders are down about 55 percent. Today United Technologies stock commands a valuation of more than three times its assets minus liabilities. That is about double the premium to book value for G.E. shares. Put it all together, and United Technologies is in position to swoop in and buy businesses from G.E., whose big bet on finance is forcing it to shrink and its shareholders to suffer. Tech Battle Lines Blur Not so long ago, the technology business consisted of a series of silos where dozens, if not hundreds, of companies fought for supremacy. From these skirmishes emerged a handful of giants. Cisco dominated networking while Oracle ruled in databases. With their core businesses maturing, however, these companies are crossing the traditional frontiers of battle. Hewlett-Packard's just-announced $2.7 billion purchase of 3Com is the latest in this blurring of the borders in tech land. The acquisition of 3Com, a maker of network switching and routing gear, is the most aggressive foray yet by H.P. into Cisco's turf. Of course, Cisco arguably fired the first volley in this campaign in March, when it jumped into the server market, where H.P. and I.B.M. had long cavorted. The fight isn't limited to these companies. Oracle agreed to buy Sun Microsystems in April. It snatched Sun away from the clutches of I.B.M. and entered the hardware business, pitting Oracle directly against H.P. Even bystanders have been drawn into the fray this year; Dell bought Perot Systems and Xerox acquired ACS, bringing them up against I.B.M. and H.P. What's driving this hostility? Electronic gadgets continue to cheapen in cost and increase in functionality, making technology more of a commodity. Information technology budgets, meanwhile, have shrunk. Global spending is expected to decline 4 percent this year, Gartner predicts. To cope with this deflation, companies are moving onto one another's turf, hoping to earn a bit of extra revenue from bundling extra goods and services together. How well all these moves will work is unclear. Growth dependent on acquisitions often fails to arrive. And integrating technology firms is notoriously difficult. With that in mind, perhaps the best strategy is to welcome invasion and sell out, naturally at a hefty premium for shareholders.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Lockheed Martin United Technologies Corp Go to your Portfolio » The company warned, however, that the trend might not last, and it issued a weak 2010 earnings forecast, as Wall Street has been predicting in recent weeks. Lockheed expects that sales of fighter jets will dwindle and pension costs will rise next year. Lockheed and its suppliers are feeling the pinch of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates’s decision this year to cap production of the F-22, said Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer. Each F-22, a cold-war fighter jet, costs $140 million, and the decision to limit production to 187 jets is part of the Pentagon’s plan to shift military spending to programs more suitable to modern warfare. The Pentagon this year has also terminated Lockheed’s contract to build new helicopters to carry the president, as well as a contract to build a communications satellite. Lockheed said earnings rose nearly 8 percent from the previous quarter, to $797 million, or $2.07 a share, for the period ending Sept. 27. That compares with $782 million, or $1.92 a share, last year. Revenue grew nearly 5 percent to $11.06 billion. Stock in Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., fell $5, or 6.5 percent, to $71.99 a share. The United Technologies Corporation continued to be squeezed by the downturn in aerospace and real estate markets as nearly all its businesses posted declines in the third quarter. The company, which owns Pratt &amp; Whitney, Otis elevator, Sikorsky Aircraft and other businesses, said it earned $1.06 billion, or $1.14 a share, down 17 percent from $1.27 billion, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 11 percent, to $13.38 billion, from $15.09 billion a year ago. The chief financial officer, Greg Hayes, told investors and analysts in a conference call that the company was confident earnings would rise in 2010. The president and chief executive, Louis R. Chênevert, said a strong military backlog and significant repair and servicing businesses were setting up the company for earnings growth in 2010. In addition, he said United Technologies had begun to see improvement in some Asian economies, notably China’s.

More Articles in Business »WASHINGTON (AP)  The Lockheed Martin Corporation said Tuesday that its third-quarter earnings rose, helped by increased sales of military aircraft like the C-130J transport plane and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, in addition to the delivery of one commercial satellite. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Lockheed Martin United Technologies Corp Go to your Portfolio » The company warned, however, that the trend might not last, and it issued a weak 2010 earnings forecast, as Wall Street has been predicting in recent weeks. Lockheed expects that sales of fighter jets will dwindle and pension costs will rise next year. Lockheed and its suppliers are feeling the pinch of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates’s decision this year to cap production of the F-22, said Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer. Each F-22, a cold-war fighter jet, costs $140 million, and the decision to limit production to 187 jets is part of the Pentagon’s plan to shift military spending to programs more suitable to modern warfare. The Pentagon this year has also terminated Lockheed’s contract to build new helicopters to carry the president, as well as a contract to build a communications satellite. Lockheed said earnings rose nearly 8 percent from the previous quarter, to $797 million, or $2.07 a share, for the period ending Sept. 27. That compares with $782 million, or $1.92 a share, last year. Revenue grew nearly 5 percent to $11.06 billion. Stock in Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., fell $5, or 6.5 percent, to $71.99 a share. The United Technologies Corporation continued to be squeezed by the downturn in aerospace and real estate markets as nearly all its businesses posted declines in the third quarter. The company, which owns Pratt &amp; Whitney, Otis elevator, Sikorsky Aircraft and other businesses, said it earned $1.06 billion, or $1.14 a share, down 17 percent from $1.27 billion, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 11 percent, to $13.38 billion, from $15.09 billion a year ago. The chief financial officer, Greg Hayes, told investors and analysts in a conference call that the company was confident earnings would rise in 2010. The president and chief executive, Louis R. Chênevert, said a strong military backlog and significant repair and servicing businesses were setting up the company for earnings growth in 2010. In addition, he said United Technologies had begun to see improvement in some Asian economies, notably China’s.

Gray, Who Led the Rise of United Technologies, Dies at 89<date>Published: July 9, 2009</date><text>Harry J. Gray, who rose from boyhood poverty to lead the transformation of United Aircraft into United Technologies, one of the world’s broadest and most powerful conglomerates, died Wednesday in Hartford. He was 89. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Associated Press Harry J. Gray in 1978. Add to Portfolio United Technologies Corp Go to your Portfolio » His family announced his death, at Hartford Hospital. By 1971, when Mr. Gray took the company reins, the United Aircraft Corporation already had a long history as a thoroughbred of American industry, at one point claiming names like Boeing, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Northrop and United Airlines as subsidiaries. The sales of several units to comply with antitrust laws beginning in the 1930s were followed by prosperity as a maker of warplane parts in World War II and the Korean War. By the 1970s, the company still played a major role in aeronautics but faced strong competition from General Electric and was plagued by poor performance at its own Pratt &amp; Whitney subsidiary. Mr. Gray became president of United Aircraft in 1971 and chairman in 1974. He had come to the company after 17 years as an executive at Litton Industries, a major military contractor. At first, Mr. Gray took small steps within United Aircraft’s sphere of expertise. He shored up Pratt &amp; Whitney by ordering a redesign of its engines for Boeing’s hugely successful 747 airliners. Then he made leaps. By 1980, Mr. Gray had bought a broad array of companies outside the aerospace business, including Essex International, a manufacturer of wire and cables; the Otis Elevator Company; and the Carrier Corporation, the heating and air-conditioning company. United Aircraft changed its name to the United Technologies Corporation in 1975 to reflect its expanded business. By 1986, Mr. Gray had transformed a one-industry company with $2 billion in annual sales into a conglomerate pulling in $16 billion a year from many sectors. His competitors were other sprawling giants, like Lockheed and Honeywell. In his vision, Mr. Gray was a generalist. But he was single-minded and unrelenting when pursuing companies that he thought had strengths that complemented those of United Technologies. Mr. Gray reportedly compiled and memorized a list of 30 companies that he wanted to acquire, and few managed to resist when the “Grand Acquisitor,” as Mr. Gray was known in that heyday of strong-arm takeovers and boardroom intrigue, came swooping. “He was of an era that created some of the great diversified companies,” Martin Lipton, the mergers and acquisitions lawyer who advised Mr. Gray after founding the New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Kranz, said in a telephone interview. “Very significant companies were built, but they didn’t really last. His was one of the few that lasted, that became a real integrated company.” By the mid-1980s, some United Technologies executives were beginning to chafe under Mr. Gray’s domineering style and disinclination to involve himself in everyday operations. When he reluctantly ceded the chairmanship to Robert F. Daniell, an engineer who set out to trim the organization and take a more direct role in managing it, a Wall Street analyst said, “To say that the days of empire building are over is all but a truism.” Mr. Gray was born Harry Jack Grusin on Nov. 18, 1919, in a rural community called Milledgeville Crossroads, Ga. His mother died when he was 6, and his father, after going broke and moving the family to Chicago, abandoned him and his sister, who was 15 years his senior. His sister was at the steps of an orphanage where she had planned to leave him when she changed her mind, he told a New York Times reporter in 1982. From then until he left for college, Mr. Gray slept on a folding cot in her apartment. Despite this adversity, he later said, he saw a world wide in scope, rich in opportunity and defined by individual success. “I’m a self-starter, a self-charger,” Mr. Gray said in the interview. “By the age of 9, it was my sister and me against the world.” He entered the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1936, working as a waiter and dishwasher, and earned a degree in journalism. He soon left for the European battlefields of World War II. After fighting in the Army for four and a half years under Gen. George S. Patton, his hero, and receiving a Silver Star for actions in the Battle of the Bulge, Mr. Gray returned to Urbana and earned a master’s degree in 1947. He changed his name to Gray in 1951. In his early 30s, having worked as a truck salesman, Mr. Gray moved to California after reading about stock options in a magazine. Thinking that “an individual who didn’t have capital could begin to build an equity position” through stock options as a corporate employee, he took a pay cut, joined Litton and started his corporate career. His first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second, to Barbara Sander. He married Helen Buckley in 1978. She survives him, along with two daughters from one of his previous marriages, Pamela and Victoria, both of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; his stepdaughter, Janet Lewis of West Hartford, Conn.; two grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren. In retirement, the Grays contributed to many charities, mostly in Hartford, and in Illinois and Florida. In his later years Mr. Gray received an honorary doctorate from the University of Illinois, where he said he had once worked as a waiter in the house of a fraternity that he could not afford to join.

Skip to next paragraph Blog The Caucus The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. Join the discussion. More Politics News The helicopters seemed destined for cancellation ever since President Obama described the project as “an example of the procurement process gone amok.” The decision to cancel the program came after the projected costs for 28 helicopters doubled to nearly $13 billion. But some defense experts and Congressional leaders who oversee military spending have said it would be cheaper to keep building a basic version of the helicopter than to scrap the project altogether. Congress could potentially overrule the Pentagon’s decision. Ashton B. Carter, the new under secretary of defense for acquisitions, signed a memorandum Friday canceling the program. The Navy, which oversees the project, then issued its own order to the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, to halt work at its plant in Owego in upstate New York, where it has been conducting flight tests on several of the helicopters. Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat from New York who represents Owego and who sits on the House defense appropriations subcommittee, criticized the decision as a waste of the $3.2 billion already been spent on the program. Mr. Hinchey and Representative John P. Murtha, a powerful Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the subcommittee, are expected to question Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates about the decision when he appears before the panel next week. But lawmakers from Connecticut applauded the Pentagon’s move, saying they want Sikorsky Aircraft, which is based in Stratford, Conn., to have another chance to bid for the huge contract. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said the cancellation was “welcome news” and “a recognition of the slate of problems with the helicopter replacement program.” Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies, built the current fleet of aging helicopters used by the president. But it lost out to Lockheed Martin and a European company in 2005 after the Bush administration set out to create a futuristic craft that could fend off terrorist attacks and resist the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast. The plan was to build five basic helicopters and 23 more sophisticated craft. The Pentagon stopped work on the advanced helicopters in late 2007 as the cost overruns mounted on them. Mr. Gates has said that the basic ones, which were scheduled to go into service in 2011, were built to last only 5 to 10 years. But AgustaWestland, the European company that builds the helicopters for Lockheed Martin, disputed his comments and offered to build a fleet of the basic craft for the $6.8 billion originally budgeted for the project. Records show that while the Navy initially certified the helicopters for only 5 to 10 years of use, it had also budgeted money for fatigue tests commonly used to extend the expected lives of aircraft. AgustaWestland has said that other versions of the basic helicopter have been rated for 30 years of use by the Federal Aviation Administration and civil and military authorities in several other countries. Pentagon officials have said they were also concerned that the basic helicopters could fly only 200 miles without refueling, while the Bush administration wanted new helicopters that could fly nearly 300 miles. But military experts say it would be expensive to customize any midsize helicopter to meet that goal. They said that the Bush White House wanted a craft large enough to carry 14 people, compared with 10 on the current helicopters, which date back to 1975, yet still small enough to land on the White House lawn without tearing up the Rose Garden. Pentagon officials have said that they will review the requirements with the Obama administration before seeking new bids.

It is an 18-foot alternative engine for the Air Force’s new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Skip to next paragraph Blog The Caucus The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation. Join the discussion. More Politics News But some military experts and lawmakers questioned Thursday whether canceling the engine was as sensible as he had portrayed it. The president has drawn similar questions about a new presidential helicopter, which he earlier held up as an example of defense contracting “gone amok.” In announcing his budget for 2010 on Thursday, the president cited the plan to kill the extra engine as showing how “we’re going to save money by eliminating unnecessary defense programs that do nothing to keep us safe.” But while canceling the extra engine could save $1 billion in the short run, military experts said it would add to the risk of much costlier problems with the Joint Strike Fighter, which is expected to become the Pentagon’s largest and most expensive weapons program. And some lawmakers predicted that Congress would save the extra engine as insurance against further delays in the fighter program, just as it did when President George W. Bush tried three times to kill it. “The Pentagon has failed to inform the president of the complete picture,” said Representative Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat from Hawaii who is chairman of a House armed services subcommittee on air and land forces. “We will correct that.” The engine was one of more than a dozen programs identified for cancellation or cuts in the administration’s $640 billion military budget, which has generally been praised for shifting money from futuristic weapons to simpler arms that can be used in today’s wars. All of the other cuts Mr. Obama outlined  in F-22 fighter jets, missile defense systems and the Army’s $159 billion modernization plan  were announced before. The administration’s efforts to rein in waste received another boost Thursday when the Senate approved a bill to strengthen the Pentagon’s contracting controls. And Pentagon officials projected that after the Bush administration’s buildup, the growth in Pentagon spending would slow from 4 percent each year in inflation-adjusted terms to no more than 2 percent annually. But much of the talk in defense circles on Thursday was on the alternate F-35 engine. It was ordered by Congress in the 1990s to avoid a repeat of costly problems with earlier fighters that initially had only one engine supplier. Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, is already building an F-35 engine in Connecticut. General Electric and Rolls-Royce have spent $2.5 billion developing the alternate engine in Ohio, and it is 70 percent complete. Congress’s idea was to have the companies compete for contracts. The Pentagon said that while such competition might produce modest savings as it builds more than 2,400 of the planes, the main engine program is “progressing well, making a second engine program unnecessary.” House aides said two turbine blade failures during Pratt &amp; Whitney’s testing had contributed to cost increases on the F-35 program. Even though the problems have been fixed, they said, lawmakers were wary about relying on one supplier for such a critical program. The Pentagon also plans to cancel the program to develop the new presidential helicopter, which had doubled in cost. Some defense experts have also questioned that decision, saying it would leave the government with little to show for the $3.2 billion that it has already spent. In the budget documents, the Pentagon said it would review the requirements and would conduct new bidding by fiscal 2011. Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat from upstate New York, where the project provides 800 jobs, said Thursday that he had asked the Pentagon not to stop the program until Congress could review the decision. Mr. Hinchey, a member of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, said he and Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the panel, would try to use the Pentagon budget bill to salvage a simpler version of the helicopter already being tested. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: May 11, 2009 A picture caption on Friday with an article about President Obama’s plan to cancel an alternative engine for the F-35 fighter jet misspelled the surname of the president of the team from General Electric and Rolls-Royce that is developing the engine.

Even though the problems have been fixed, they said, lawmakers were wary about relying on one supplier for such a critical program. The Pentagon also plans to cancel the program to develop the new presidential helicopter, which had doubled in cost. Some defense experts have also questioned that decision, saying it would leave the government with little to show for the $3.2 billion that it has already spent. In the budget documents, the Pentagon said it would review the requirements and would conduct new bidding by fiscal 2011. Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat from upstate New York, where the project provides 800 jobs, said Thursday that he had asked the Pentagon not to stop the program until Congress could review the decision. Mr. Hinchey, a member of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, said he and Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the panel, would try to use the Pentagon budget bill to salvage a simpler version of the helicopter already being tested.

Another canceled takeover bid was Vishay Intertechnology’s $1.7 billion tender offer for shares in International Rectifier, a rival maker of semiconductors. Waste Management, the nation’s largest garbage collection company, cited the shaky markets as a reason for withdrawing its $6.7 billion hostile tender offer for shares in the Republic Services Group. Waste Management’s most recent offer, for $37 a share in cash, was dependent on the company’s ability to raise financing  and obtaining debt has become more expensive. “Given the current state of the financial markets, we believe that it would not be prudent to continue to pursue the acquisition of Republic,” David P. Steiner, Waste Management’s chief executive, said in a statement. The move clears the way for a previously announced all-stock merger of Republic and Allied Waste. Waste Management’s offer was criticized by Republic and several investors, including BGI, the investment firm run by Bill Gates. Shares in all three garbage haulers rose on Monday, with Waste Management jumping 18 percent, to $30.39, and Republic gaining nearly 9 percent, to $24.50. Separately, United Technologies, a conglomerate with a broad array of businesses, said that it was withdrawing its $2.6 billion all-cash offer for Diebold, the maker of A.T.M.’s and electronic voting technology, because of Diebold’s unwillingness to open its books and hold merger talks. In a short letter sent to Diebold, United Technologies’ chairman, George David, cited Diebold’s continued refusal to hold talks or release financial information. United Technologies had offered $40 a share after having pursued Diebold for two years. “We had hoped we could negotiate a transaction that would have created substantial value for both your and our shareholders,” Mr. David wrote in the letter. “It’s unfortunate this won’t happen.” In Diebold, United Technologies sought to expand its electronic security business with one of the field’s largest players. But in May United Technologies’ chief executive, Louis Chênevert, told analysts that Diebold was not a “must have.” Shares in United Technologies jumped 13.7 percent, to $54.13, while Diebold rose about 1.5 percent, to $28.69.

Backs Health Care Balloting<date>Published: May 27, 2008</date><text>The Securities and Exchange Commission, shifting its position, has told companies they must allow shareholders to vote on a proposal for universal health insurance coverage. Shareholders, including religious groups and labor unions, have offered the proposal in an effort to draw the nation's largest corporations deeper into a debate over the future of health care, fast emerging as one of the most important issue in domestic policy. The S.E.C. has told Boeing, General Motors, United Technologies, Wendy's International and Xcel Energy over the last several months that they may not omit the health care proposal from their proxy materials. This came as a surprise to many executives, who said the agency had allowed companies to exclude similar proposals in the past. Many companies say the health care principles are not a proper matter for shareholders to vote on, and they have tried to keep the proposal out of proxy statements prepared for their 2008 annual meetings. Some, like General Electric and Medco Health Solutions, have explicitly adopted principles that include the goal of universal coverage. Some, like Boeing and Reynolds American, have opposed the shareholder initiatives. At least a dozen companies, like Wal-Mart and I.B.M., have negotiated with shareholders in the belief they can find common ground. The shareholder proposal asks companies to adopt ''principles for comprehensive health care reform'' like those devised by the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. The institute says health insurance should be universal, continuous, ''affordable to individuals and families,'' and ''affordable and sustainable for society.'' Employers frequently complain about the cost of health benefits for employees and retirees. The shareholder proposal would not require companies to provide health benefits for employees, but asks top corporate executives to view the issue in a broader context, as a question of social policy. ''We are doing what we can as shareholders,'' said the Rev. Michael H. Crosby, a 68-year-old Capuchin priest who has had discussions with nine companies on behalf of 20 Roman Catholic orders this year. ''We come out of a religious tradition, but we are not engaged in a messianic enterprise. We are one voice among many seeking equitable access to health care for all.'' Religious groups and labor unions hold billions of dollars worth of stock in their pension and health benefit plans. They submitted the same basic health care proposal to three dozen large companies, and they say they have received respectful hearings at many. ''We are working for a national policy that provides universal access to health care, and we do hold more than 30,000 shares of General Electric stock,'' said Barbara Kraemer, a Roman Catholic nun who is national president of the School Sisters of St. Francis. ''As we pursued the proposal with G. E., the company requested a dialogue in lieu of the shareholder resolution, so we withdrew it. The dialogue was productive, resulting in G. E.'s public endorsement of the Institute of Medicine principles.'' Labor unions and religious groups said they intended to broaden the proxy campaign by bringing in more pension plans next year. If the dialogue between companies and shareholders were to continue, as expected, it could help bridge the divide that has frustrated earlier efforts to cover the uninsured. Opposition from businesses was one of the major factors that sank President Bill Clinton's proposal for universal coverage in 1994. But businesses of all sizes are clamoring for relief from high health costs and have concluded they cannot solve the problem by themselves. Under the commission's rules, a company does not have to allow shareholders to vote on a proposal if it ''deals with a matter relating to the company's ordinary business operations,'' for which management is responsible. But the commission said it was appropriate for shareholders to express their views to company management by voting on ''significant social policy issues'' beyond day-to-day business matters. Over the years, the commission said, it had reversed its position on certain issues to reflect ''changing societal views,'' and that now appears to be the case with respect to health care. One of the more bizarre proxy battles occurred at UnitedHealth, an insurer that covers more than 70 million people.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/business/04diebold.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Diebold Rejects Takeover Advance<date>Published: March 4, 2008</date><text>Diebold said Monday that its board had rejected an unsolicited $2.64 billion takeover bid from the United Technologies Corporation, a diversified manufacturer.

United Technologies, which first approached Diebold two years ago, initially made the offer in private on Friday. The bid amounts to $40 a share in cash, or a 66 percent premium over Diebold’s closing price on Friday of $24.12, United Technologies said. Several unsolicited or hostile offers have been made this year despite an overall slowdown in deal-making activity. Among companies making unfriendly advances are Microsoft, which is pursuing the wounded Internet giant Yahoo, and Electronic Arts, which made a bid for Take-Two Interactive, the maker of the Grand Theft Auto video games. In Diebold, United Technologies sees a chance to expand its electronic security business with one of the field’s largest players. Last year, United Technologies bought Initial Electronic Security Systems for about $1.2 billion. “This transaction creates significant and immediate value for Diebold shareholders with no operational risk, while creating long-term value for U.T.C. shareholders,” George David, United Technologies’ chairman and chief executive, said in a statement on Sunday. James E. Geisler, United Technologies’ vice president for finance and the head of its mergers and acquisitions team, said in an interview on Sunday that the company contacted Diebold about a possible deal two years ago but was rebuffed. On Feb. 19, Mr. David sent Diebold’s board a letter proposing talks about a deal. Two days later, Diebold’s chairman, John N. Lauer, responded that the company’s board had rejected any possible combination. He also said that a deal would not serve Diebold’s interests and requested that United Technologies refrain from contacting its directors. Mr. Geisler declined to say whether United Technologies would press the bid if Diebold formally declined it, saying only that “we know what our options are.” Founded in 1859, Diebold grew as a provider of security technology for financial systems. But Diebold was thrust into the spotlight in the 2004 election, when it was criticized over flawed electronic voting machines in Ohio and elsewhere. The company has struggled recently with a variety of problems, both internal and external. In January, Diebold said it would restate its financial reports from 2003 through the first quarter of 2007 because of changes to its accounting methods. Diebold previously disclosed that both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department had made inquiries into the way it recognized certain kinds of revenue. The global credit crisis that has stung financial services companies has affected Diebold as well. It said last week that it would cut about 5 percent of its work force, or 800 jobs, in anticipation of slowing demand for A.T.M.’s. Diebold also said it expected slower growth in its voting-machines business. It reported $61 million in revenue from those operations in 2007, compared with $195 million in 2006. United Technologies, based in Hartford, has 225,600 employees spread across businesses like the plane engine manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney, the helicopter maker Sikorsky and the elevator company Otis. The company has a market value of $69 billion. Diebold, based in North Canton, Ohio, has 15,451 employees. As of Friday, it had a market value of $1.6 billion. Its shares have declined nearly 50 percent in the last year. Morgan Stanley is working as United Technologies’ financial adviser. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz is its legal counsel. More Articles in Business »The United Technologies Corporation made public on Sunday an unsolicited $3 billion bid for Diebold, one of the largest makers of automated teller machines and voting machines. United Technologies, which first approached Diebold two years ago, initially made the offer in private on Friday. The bid amounts to $40 a share in cash, or a 66 percent premium over Diebold’s closing price on Friday of $24.12, United Technologies said. Several unsolicited or hostile offers have been made this year despite an overall slowdown in deal-making activity. Among companies making unfriendly advances are Microsoft, which is pursuing the wounded Internet giant Yahoo, and Electronic Arts, which made a bid for Take-Two Interactive, the maker of the Grand Theft Auto video games. In Diebold, United Technologies sees a chance to expand its electronic security business with one of the field’s largest players. Last year, United Technologies bought Initial Electronic Security Systems for about $1.2 billion. “This transaction creates significant and immediate value for Diebold shareholders with no operational risk, while creating long-term value for U.T.C. shareholders,” George David, United Technologies’ chairman and chief executive, said in a statement on Sunday. James E. Geisler, United Technologies’ vice president for finance and the head of its mergers and acquisitions team, said in an interview on Sunday that the company contacted Diebold about a possible deal two years ago but was rebuffed. On Feb. 19, Mr. David sent Diebold’s board a letter proposing talks about a deal. Two days later, Diebold’s chairman, John N. Lauer, responded that the company’s board had rejected any possible combination. He also said that a deal would not serve Diebold’s interests and requested that United Technologies refrain from contacting its directors.

One of the companies, United Technologies, said it expected 2008 earnings to grow by 10 percent to 14 percent. It saw global growth and reaffirmed its profit forecast for the current year. The other, Honeywell International, forecast profit growth of 16 to 21 percent, broadly above Wall Street estimates, with strength in its aerospace business and continued growth in emerging markets. Honeywell, of Morris Township, N.J., said its outlook, which called for stronger growth than some other blue-chip conglomerates have forecast, was achievable even in the face of a slowing economy. The company said it expected 2008 profit of $3.65 to $3.80 a share. That was largely ahead of analysts’ forecasts of $3.67, according to Reuters Estimates. “Over all, we’re planning for a softening global economy, and we expect some spillover of the weakening in the U.S. residential and credit markets,” Honeywell’s chief financial officer, David J. Anderson, told investors. “But on the other hand, we expect that to be offset by the relative strength that we’re experiencing in emerging regions.” The company reiterated its 2007 earnings outlook of $3.14 to $3.16 a share, in line with analysts’ estimates of $3.16. United Technologies, based in Hartford, is the world’s largest maker of elevators and air-conditioners as well as a leading producer of armaments systems. It said it expected a profit of $4.65 to $4.85 a share next year on revenue of $59 billion. The projected profit increase matched a forecast the company provided in October, but on Thursday the company offered greater detail. Analysts tabulated by Reuters Estimates had looked for $4.85 a share, on sales of $57.7 billion. United Technologies also reiterated a full-year estimate for 2007 earnings of $4.22 to $4.25 a share. The company said it expected more than 60 percent of its sales to come from outside the United States. United Technologies, whose subsidiary companies include Sikorsky helicopters, Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners, said it expected sales from existing businesses to grow in the mid-single digits and predicted higher operating profit in all six business units. The company has benefited from global aviation demand and investment in infrastructure projects, particularly in China and India. “It’s been a very good aero cycle and we see that continuing,” the president, Louis R. Chenevert, said. Mr. Chenevert is expected to become chief executive next year, succeeding George David, who has said he will stay on as chairman for two to three years. “Commercial construction looks robust at this time,” Mr. Chenevert said, adding that the housing market is softer than the company thought a year ago and was likely to experience “continuing stress.” More Articles in Business »Two big manufacturers said Thursday that they expected stronger growth next year despite the slowing economy.

The company was accused of helping to topple President Salvador Allende Gossens of Chile and was the focus of numerous investigations, and the conglomerate as a business model faded over the years. Instead, the new mantra became one of stressing core competencies  in other words, concentrating on a relatively few businesses in which the companies excelled. But among the flood of companies reporting second-quarter earnings, there is a largely unheralded trend: the conglomerates are back, and back in a big way. And investors are noticing. I.T.T., now a $7.8 billion-a-year company based in a modest office park in White Plains, reported a 52 percent surge in earnings on the basis of sales in water treatment systems and military and surveillance systems. The companys chief executive, Steven R. Loranger, says the company is on track for a fifth consecutive year of record profitability. Its stock trades at very rich price-to-earnings ratio of about 20, based on current-year earnings. Weve reinvented ourselves, Mr. Loranger said. Other revitalized conglomerates include Textron, based in Providence, R.I., and the owner of companies like Cessna and Bell Helicopter. Textron beat earnings forecasts by 24 cents a share, according to a Cowen &amp; Company analysts report that called the period a blowout quarter. And Honeywell International, a diversified industrial company based in Morristown, N.J., recorded a 17 percent rise in second-quarter profit, largely on the strength of its aerospace holdings. This universe of 25 to 30 companies is outperforming the market as a whole and would be doing even better if not for the fact that General Electric, which pioneered many of the management techniques they are using, has performed relatively poorly. Still, C. Stephen Tusa Jr., an analyst at JPMorgan Securities, estimates that even after recent volatility, the financial markets are giving the 13 diversified industrial companies he covers a P/E ratio of 18 for the current year, compared with about 15.5 for the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index. Its a 15 percent premium, Mr. Tusa said. This class of companies includes such well-known giants as United Technologies, 3M and Siemens, but also a raft of smaller companies like Danaher, Emerson Electric and Illinois Tool Works. Warren E. Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway also owns diverse industrial companies, but because it does not seek to actively manage its holdings in an integrated fashion, it isnt generally included as part of this category. To some extent, the new conglomerates have simply become lucky. They are riding a global infrastructure spending boom for airports and airlines, power systems, waste water and environmental projects, and hospitals and health care systems, not to mention record government spending on military projects and security surveillance. Their ability to assemble product offerings from different industries is a source of strength, they say. Ken Cornelius, president and chief executive of Siemens One, an Atlanta-based subsidiary of the German parent company, says Siemens can provide up to 40 percent of the goods and services needed to build a new hospital, for example, ranging from medical imaging equipment and information technology systems to power systems and building automation equipment. Many of the diversified industrial companies are well positioned to take advantage of global opportunities because their offshore sales are typically 35 to 50 percent of their total revenue. But the chief executives of these companies (as well as many Wall Street analysts) say that theres more to it than just luck  that they have largely transformed how they do business over the past five years. Gone are the days when C.E.O.s bought largely unrelated companies and held them in nearly passive portfolios of assets without seeking to transform their managements, processes or products. When you look back at the history, the companies were put together without any real integration, said David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell. They were really just holding companies. They didnt try to do anything to make the businesses better. This new breed of C.E.O. has embraced many of the techniques of John F. Welch Jr. at G.E. and borrowed liberally from the lean production techniques of Toyota Motor as well. Technological systems, like enterprise resource planning software, allow them to manage their companies more tightly. They are training top executives to think about their whole enterprises, not just about small pieces of the whole. And rather than being sleepy backwaters, some of these conglomerates have become innovators. Weve had to radically change every aspect of how we make decisions, how we behave and how we execute, said Lewis B.

United Technologies is a case in point. Fully 60 percent of its total sales are either made in the U.S.A. and exported, or made and sold offshore. It exports Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and Sikorsky helicopters, mostly from Connecticut. And its Otis elevator and Carrier air-conditioning subsidiaries have carved out leading positions in emerging markets like China, where the two divisions assemble most of their products. Aided by declines in the dollar, those foreign sales are bolstering the parent company's bottom line, which grew 18 percent last year. The price of its stock, one of the 30 in the Dow Jones industrials, reached a record high on Friday of $72.88. ''There's a lot of tension and drum-banging over job losses,'' says James E. Geisler, vice president for finance at United Technologies, which is based in Hartford but has become a global company. In 2006, only 72,500 of the company's 215,000 employees were in the United States. The remainder are based abroad. ''The fact is, companies that are growing are better employers and some of those employees are in the United States,'' Mr. Geisler said. The United Technologies story is part of a broad structural shift in how and where many American companies are making their money. The trend has been in the making for decades, and by now it clearly carries major economic implications, as well as significant investment opportunities. The trend accentuates the divide between workers who benefit from globalization and those who don't, sometimes within the same company. Financial analysts at United Technologies in Hartford overseeing Carrier's sales in India and Pratt engineers designing jet engines in Connecticut for export to Europe certainly benefit; but people who worked in Syracuse in the company's air-conditioning plant, now defunct, do not. Another divide that seems to be widening is between those Americans whose investments capture international growth opportunities and those whose portfolios don't. In short, the economic divisions created by globalization are becoming ever sharper. On the financial side, increasing globalization of American corporate profits may mean, for example, that United States stock markets can retain their lofty elevations even if domestic growth continues to prove tepid -- because leading companies are earning so much abroad. Companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index that break out their international earnings reported at the end of 2006 that they racked up 45.2 percent of their sales through offshore sales and exports. That is up from 32.2 percent in 2001. ''The long-term trend is for more international,'' says Alec Young, chief international equity strategist at S.&amp; P. Many top multinationals have crossed the 50 percent threshold, as General Electric says it will do this year. Part of the explanation for the rising percentages is that the world is where the growth is. ''In Japan, we're seeing some of the strongest economic growth since World War II,'' Mr. Young said. ''And we're seeing upside growth surprises in Europe.'' Emerging markets from India to Brazil also are enjoying big economic gains. ''Real consumerism is breaking out'' in those markets, Mr. Young said. The charge offshore seems certain to continue because chief executives want to invest where they expect growth to occur. The 10 companies with the largest foreign sales in 2006 were some of the biggest names in American business: Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, General Motors, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, the Altria Group, ConocoPhillips, I.B.M., the American International Group and Procter &amp; Gamble, according to S.&amp; P. Those figures include only the sales of their offshore subsidiaries, not goods or services exported from the United States. ''Corporate profit growth is going to do better than it would have done if these companies had ignored the opportunities elsewhere,'' says Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight, an economic consulting group in Lexington, Mass.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/business/19arms.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Otis and Sikorsky Drive 7% Rise in United Technologies Earnings<date>Published: April 19, 2007</date><text>HARTFORD, April 18 (AP)  The United Technologies Corporation, aided by double-digit growth at Otis elevator and a comeback by Sikorsky Aircraft after a strike last year, reported almost a 7 percent increase in first-quarter profit on Wednesday.

Shares ended the day at $66.92, up 74 cents.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D8103FF936A25757C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">THE WEEK; For Hartford, a Fuel-Cell Bus Milestone<date>Published: April 15, 2007</date><text>HARTFORD now has the only fuel cell bus operating east of the Rocky Mountains, a zero-emission vehicle that is among a few dozen running anywhere in the world. The bus represents an important milestone on a municipal mass transit stage that is increasingly mindful of global warming and other pollution issues. But at $2 million, it is unclear whether it is cost effective. The price is nearly six times the cost of each of the 650 full-size conventional diesel buses running in Connecticut and $1.5 million more than each of two diesel hybrid buses that have been running in Stamford. ''That's the $64,000 question,'' said Michael A. Sanders, public transit administrator for the Connecticut Department of Transportation. ''There's a benefit to having no emission from a tailpipe, but it's not worth a million and a half to me.'' Jan van Dokkum, president of UTC Power in South Windsor, the division of United Technologies that developed the fuel cell for this bus and others running in California, said all the buses were still in a demonstration phase. He said UTC was continuing to refine the fuel cell, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce power, as well as the overall system, which is actually a fuel cell/electric hybrid. He expected the price eventually to compete with diesel hybrid buses. ''It's about twice as efficient as a diesel bus,'' Mr. van Dokkum said. ''It has no emissions and no noise. It's a very steep price, but like anything in technology, you need to start somewhere.'' Industry experts believe fuel cell buses and other fleet vehicles show more promise than fuel cell cars, in part because the fueling apparatus can be centrally located. Part of the $2.9 million Federal Transit Administration grant that financed Hartford's bus went toward building a fueling station at UTC Power. The station produces hydrogen for the fuel cell through a process that uses natural gas and produces greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide. The Hartford bus has a range of 300 miles, can reach 60 miles an hour and is running on the free downtown shuttle route. Photo: CLEAN SHUTTLE -- Hartford's zero-emission bus runs the downtown route.

The unions competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said the costs of buildings and hospitals were artificially bloated by these cartels. Jonathan Todd, a union spokesman, said the fines represented the largest ever for price fixing in the European Union. The authorities said the cartel operated from at least 1995 until 2004 in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The companies fined were Otis, a unit of United Technologies of Hartford; the German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp; Kone of Finland; Schindler Holding of Switzerland; and subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Elevator Europe, a unit of Mitsubishi Electric of Japan. George David, the chief executive of United Technologies, said in a statement that company officials were disappointed by the conduct revealed through the commissions and U.T.C.s own investigations. He said nine Otis employees were dismissed over the matter. Otis and United Technologies disclosed the investigation in 2004 and have cooperated with the European Commission, Mr. David said. Nevertheless, he said, Otis will appeal the decision to a European court. Otis was fined 225 million euros ($296 million). ThyssenKrupp was given the largest fine, just over 479 million euros, because the company was labeled a repeat offender by regulators, Mr. Todd said. ThyssenKrupp, which is based in Frankfurt, said it would review the fine and then decide whether to appeal. Schindler was fined 144 million euros; Kone, 142 million euros; and Mitsubishis Dutch subsidiary, 1.8 million euros. Schindler and Kone said they also would review the decision before deciding whether to appeal.

But because it was designed with energy savings in mind, its owners' utilities bill will be about $1,100 less a year than their neighbors'. The builder, Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity, set out to create a healthier, cost- and energy-efficient residence and to dispel the belief that building ''green'' is only for the rich. From photovoltaic solar panels on the roof to engineered-wood joists, more efficient toilets and Energy Star-rated appliances, little has been overlooked in the effort to create a replicable, eco-friendly home. ''This is probably the greenest house in Hartford County right now,'' said Adam Ney, president of AuctorVerno, a marketing firm in Bethany that promotes green construction and that helped Habitat identify environmentally friendly products and supplies. Each side of the duplex is 1,250 square feet, with three bedrooms and one and a half baths. Habitat and United Technologies, which sponsored the environmental upgrades, say they hope that aspects of the home will be copied by other Habitat affiliates in the Northeast as they build homes for needy families. ''What we've learned here, we are already duplicating nearby,'' said Shea Hagy, the construction supervisor, referring to 16 other Habitat homes going up in a two-block radius and four more in New Britain. While Habitat follows standards for green design elsewhere in the country, it has not done so in the Northeast because of the harsher climate and a reluctance to deviate from standard practice, Mr. Hagy said. ''It's easy to put up solar panels in San Diego, where it's sunny all the time,'' he said. ''There's less payback here, but it still makes a difference.'' Solar energy will provide 40 percent of the home's electricity, yielding a savings of about $360 a year, preliminary estimates show. Conservation should reduce water and gas bills by at least an additional $700, the developers predict. ''The energy savings is one more leg up for our families,'' said Julie Donahue, executive vice president of Hartford Area Habitat. Sunlight Solar Energy, of Milford, the installer of the solar system, took advantage of a rebate program started in October 2004 by the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, which typically gives back 55 percent of the installation cost. To date, 100 homes have qualified. New homes account for some installations, but most are in existing homes, said Bryan Garcia, the fund's director of energy market initiatives. Interest in solar power is growing as electric rates skyrocket and fears of a fuel crisis loom, he said. Upfront costs are often higher in eco-friendly construction; in this case, materials added about 15 percent. But Habitat anticipates that reduced electrical and water consumption, the solar panel rebate, durability and longer product warranties will make the home more cost-efficient in the long term. The ''green'' effort extends to framing, furnishing and landscaping. Using two-by-six studs spaced every 24 inches, instead of two-by-fours at 16-inch intervals, created deeper cavities for insulation. Overall, Mr. Hagy said, wood use is reduced by about 30 percent. Household products and appliances were evaluated for air quality and environmental impact, Mr. Hagy said. Linoleum won out over vinyl flooring and carpeting for the high-traffic first floor because it comes from renewable resources, is easy to maintain and emits fewer volatile organic compounds (V.O.C.s), which emit potentially harmful gases. Low-V.O.C. paints were chosen, and on the second floor, low-V.O.C. carpet squares, rather than rolls of carpeting and padding, helped reduce construction waste. Water-saving measures include restricted-flow plumbing devices, a front-loading washing machine and rain barrels to capture water for gardening and car-washing. In terms of eco-building, ''we're only scratching the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Hagy said, ''but for us, it's a big step.''

The company reiterated 2007 earnings guidance of $4.05 to $4.20 a share. Analysts are forecasting a 2007 profit of $4.16 a share. United Technologies’ shares rose $2.05, to $66.14, on Tuesday.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/technology/18united.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Profit Up 21% at United Technologies<date>Published: October 18, 2006</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation, the maker of Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines and Carrier air-conditioners, said third-quarter profit increased 21 percent, driven by sales of aircraft parts and elevators. Net income rose to $996 million, or 99 cents a share, from $821 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales climbed 12 percent, to $12.2 billion, from $10.9 billion. United Technologies benefited from rising commercial construction, which spurred sales at its Otis elevator, Carrier and fire and security units. Demand from airlines and the military bolstered results at Pratt &amp; Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace and Sikorsky, where the company said it encountered production challenges to meet a record number of orders for Black Hawk helicopters. Its profit topped the 96 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call, but its shares fell $1.30, to $65.49, partly because of profit margins at Carrier and Sikorsky that were weaker than some analysts had expected. Sikorsky is a surprise, theyre struggling a little bit, said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst at S. G. Cowen in Boston. United Technologies raised its full-year profit forecast to $3.65 to $3.69 a share, from $3.55 to $3.65 a share. It was the third time this year that the forecast was increased. Analysts were expecting $3.66, according to a survey by Thomson Financial. All of United Technologies divisions posted sales and profit increases. At Carrier, a decline in North American residential and container refrigeration units was overcome by strong commercial sales, the company said. Pratt &amp; Whitneys profit rose 17 percent, to $443 million, on a 15 percent increase in revenue. Otis won orders in India, China and Kuwait and from the Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut, helping to send its sales up 8.6 percent, to $2.57 billion. Profit rose 4.8 percent. Profit at Sikorsky rose 9.4 percent on a 36 percent sales increase. A strike earlier this year slowed production amid record orders.

Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here, which he executed in the 1950’s and expanded in the late 70’s. Growing up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, he made frequent visits to the Hall of Northwest Coast Indians at the American Museum of Natural History. In the 1950’s, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. The foundation had been looking for two of the images for years: “Chief Before Teepee,’’ an abstract oil painting, and a drawing, “Two Wild Indians,’’ both from 1952. They had last been seen in an exhibition in Indianapolis in 1978. Inspired by the show, Mr. Cowart unearthed these works by sleuthing, he said, and found they both belonged to a collector in West Palm Beach, Fla. Perhaps the most important discovery is a 1951 watercolor, “Death of General Wolfe’’ (of French and Indian War fame), that once belonged to Fairfield Porter. It was found after a friend of Porter from upstate New York contacted the foundation in the wake of the exhibition. It will be shown with another painting, “Death of the General’’ (1951), from another Florida collector who had acquired it from the John Heller Gallery, which represented Lichtenstein in New York in the 1950’s. These works will be seen along with a study for “Death of General Wolfe,’’ owned by the artist’s estate. The two other works are “Two Indians/Two Seminoles’’ (1953), a colorful geometric canvas of a pair of intertwined figures, which a Cleveland family inherited from relatives of Lichtenstein’s first wife. “ We didn’t know it existed,’’ Mr. Cowart said. A Manhattan collector called the museum after seeing the show and informed a curator that he owned “Untitled (Two Chippewa Building Canoe?),’’ a little-known painting from 1952. “All of these are important to the foundation,” Mr. Cowart said. “They expand on the energetic experimentation of his early years.’’ MINIMALISTS, FOR STARTERS Sotheby’s will auction 90 paintings and sculptures from Roger and Josette Vanthournout, relatively unknown Belgian collectors, this fall in a series of sales beginning Nov. 7. The entire collection is estimated at $34.3 million to $47.5 million. Mr. Vanthournout, who died a year ago, was a furniture manufacturer. “He was a very private person with highly sophisticated taste who early on began collecting artists like Picasso and Bacon and then moved on to more abstract things, including Miminalist works by Judd and Andre,’’ said Tobias Meyer, head of contemporary art for Sotheby’s worldwide. “He was one of those collectors who trusted his eye and had no qualms about what he bought.’’ The most important works he collected were contemporary, to be sold the evening of Nov. 14. By far the star of the group, which includes works by Damien Hirst, Lichtenstein, Basquiat, Gerhard Richter and Carl Andre, is a 1968 Francis Bacon, “Version No. 2 of Lying Figure With Hypodermic Syringe,’’ in which Bacon took one of the most familiar subjects in art  the reclining female nude  and painted it as a tortured soul, as he often did. It is expected to sell for $9 million to $12 million. URBAN EVOLUTION On Tuesday five eight-foot-tall photographic portraits of men and women who immigrated to New York from around the world appeared in Madison Square Park. While the faces may not be recognized by the public, the imposing style of the images is unmistakably the work of Chuck Close. The photographs, on view until Nov. 10, are part of a three-city exhibition of public art commissioned by United Technologies Corporation, the Hartford-based company that makes aircraft engines and elevators. Organized by Gabriella De Ferrari, a curator and consultant to United Technologies, the exhibition is called “Cities in Transition.’’ Ms. De Ferrari commissioned three artists to do projects in three cities  Mr. Close for New York, the photographer and filmmaker Mitch Epstein for Boston, and the photographer Dayanita Singh for Hartford  based on the evolution of urban America. Mr. Epstein has placed 15 images that he said responded to today’s urban priorities  comfort, privacy and speed  along the tracks on each of the platforms of the Downtown Crossing subway station in Boston, where they will be on view through Oct. 29. Ms. Singh has created for Bushnell Park in Hartford a series of photographs showing an urban landscape without people, a comment on that city’s struggle to rejuvenate itself. They can be seen until Nov. 10. Mr. Close, who said he was “not a big fan of public art,’’ agreed to do the project “because it is temporary, and if you hate it will be gone pretty soon.’’ The theme intrigued him. “I started thinking about New York and how it’s bounced back since 9/11,’’ he said. “New York is a city in constant flux, with an immigrant population that brings a rich smorgasbord of cultures and traditions.’’ So he photographed people he knew who had all immigrated to New York. Usually people photographed for billboards are celebrities, but Mr. Close said he liked the fact that these, mostly young artists, were not known  yet.

Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, contends certain adverse developments are not factored into valuations, raising the chances of a decline. Investors are certainly aware that higher inflation and interest rates pose threats. But they may be missing other risks to earnings growth. The problem, Mr. Berner said in a research note, is profit margins  not that they are too low, but the opposite. Margins reached a 40-year peak in the first quarter as profits climbed to 12.3 percent of sales; when revenue and margins grow, profits grow even faster. He identified several factors to explain the margin expansion: higher productivity, lower interest costs and  heres one for the accountants  shrinking write-offs for depreciation, which reduce a companys costs with the stroke of a pen and inflate stated earnings. All three of these trends may be on the verge of reversing, he warned. That would narrow profit margins, as companies are forced to spread higher costs over a relatively stagnant revenue base. In this situation, earnings growth would drop, making for especially unflattering comparisons with robust recent quarters. Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at the Eaton Vance funds, questioned Mr. Berners premise. Post-Enron improvements in corporate governance make earnings reports more trustworthy and less susceptible to cheap accounting tricks, he said, and he expects productivity gains to persist. When companies make progress on revenue growth, they can translate that into higher earnings, Mr. Richardson said. I would argue that the market looks very cheap based on the current level of earnings. How much progress companies make is anyones guess if the economy slows, however, and he said that investors could do worse than to focus on businesses that can maintain their margins in an uncomfortable climate. The first place he suggested looking was among critical consumer stocks. Some of his favorites include Comcast, Time Warner and other providers of cable television service. They are not exactly life-or-death consumer stocks, but the companies are critical enough to their customers. Its not as if people are going to turn off their cable if times are tough, Mr. Richardson said. ANOTHER resilient sector, he said, is upmarket retailing. Companies like Nordstrom are not going to lower prices just because things get a little soft, he predicted. A third industry he likes for its margin resilience really does involve matters of life and death: military contracting. His choices are United Technologies and General Dynamics. The sector has consolidated and unfortunately will have plenty of business going forward, he said. For the overall stock market, Robert Turner, chief investment officer of Turner Investment Partners, acknowledged that nothing, not even profit margin growth, lasts forever. At some point the rate of change slows, and we may be near that point now, he said. One possible way to avoid the reckoning is to stick with growth companies, which he said are able to keep margins higher because they can keep revenues higher. The stocks are cheap, too, he said, after six years of underperformance relative to value stocks. He favors Internet companies, including Yahoo; aQuantive, which deals in online advertising; and VistaPrint, an Internet-based printing business. He also likes shares of companies tied to gambling, notably Las Vegas Sands, International Game Technology and Station Casinos. Their margins are protected by human nature. One sector that he and Mr. Richardson consider a safe bet to maintain or raise margins is health care. Mr. Richardson recommended large drug makers, like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novartis and Wyeth. Mr. Turner prefers biotechnology companies like Celgene, Genentech and Gilead Sciences. What investors dont know can hurt them, but sometimes it can help them, too, Mr. Richardson said. Some potential developments would improve earnings and margin growth, and they are certainly not factored into valuations. A decline in energy prices and an end to Federal Reserve credit tightening  and the easing that would follow eventually  would serve as levers pulling things up, enhancing results by fueling corporate investment, he said.

The resolution, passed overwhelmingly at the church's general assembly in Birmingham, Ala., responded to outcries by some church members and Jews who accused the church of insensitivity to Israel. The resolution apologized for "the pain that this has caused" among "many members of the Jewish community and within our Presbyterian communion." Church leaders said it still permitted divestment as a "last resort," but emphasized positive, not punitive, steps the church can take to support Middle East peace efforts. The church also sought to reassure Palestinians by including in the resolution a call for an end to Israel's involvement in Gaza and the West Bank, along with criticism of the Israeli security wall where it encroaches on Palestinian territory and "fails to follow the legally recognized borders of Israel" before the 1967 war. "The resolution makes clear that we're not targeting Israel, we're not abandoning our commitment to peacemaking, we're not abandoning the Palestinian Christians," said Jay Rock, coordinator for interfaith relations. The Presbyterian Church never reached the point of divesting from companies that it said provided military equipment or technology for Israel to use in the territories. Church officials had begun to press four corporations  Caterpillar, ITT, Motorola and United Technologies. Divesting would have required a vote by the entire general assembly, which meets every two years. Yesterday, the church's Peacemaking and International Issues Committee drafted the resolution after nearly 12 hours of testimony from church members and three invited guests, an American Jew, an American Muslim and a Palestinian Christian. After a brief debate, the general assembly adopted the resolution, 483 to 28. The compromise mollified some Jewish leaders, who sent several representatives to lobby delegates. "The divestment policy was a one-sided policy that focused only on the bad acts of Israel," said Mark J. Pelavin, director of the Commission on Interreligious Affairs of Reform Judaism, a Jewish leader who spoke to the panel. "One of the criticisms last time was they didn't hear American Jewish voices at all. To their credit, they reached out this time." The national director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam al-Marayati, invited to represent a Muslim viewpoint, said he was disappointed at the retreat from divestment, because it was a nonviolent strategy to put pressure on Israel. But Mr. Marayati said of the Presbyterians, "There's still a commitment to opposing the occupation, and I think that's the most important thing." Mr. Pelavin and Mr. Marayati said they were pleased over the support for a "politically viable and secure Palestinian state alongside an equally viable and secure Israeli state, both of which have a right to exist." The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), with 2.3 million members, has close ties to Palestinian Christians and has long used divestment to communicate foreign policy positions. The divestment vote in 2004 hurt relationships with many Jewish organizations that had long been allies on causes like civil liberties and the separation of church and state. "Our relationships with our Jewish friends were severely strained," said James D. Berkley, director of Presbyterian Action, a conservative group affiliated with the Institute on Religion and Democracy in Washington. "We had congregations that had spent years making excellent relationships with local temples, and rabbis and pastors that were good friends. And suddenly, the rabbis were calling up and saying, 'What has the church done? I thought you were our friends.' " The action on divestment prompted other Protestant churches to consider similar steps. The World Council of Churches urged its member churches last year to give serious consideration to divesting funds from Israel. The Church of England voted for divestment in February. But few others have followed suit. Two years ago, divestment was a sleeper issue at the Presbyterian general assembly, passing without much controversy. This time, opponents mounted a campaign. They put up a billboard on the highway from the airport to the convention center saying, "Divestment is not the way to peace." They invited a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, R. James Woolsey, a Presbyterian layman, to speak, and he said the divestment policy put the church "clearly on the side of theocratic, totalitarian, anti-Semitic, genocidal beliefs." Advocates of divestment, including some American Jews and Israelis, worked the conference hallways. Jewish Voice for Peace, a liberal group, set up a table at the conference center and showed a documentary on Israeli military resisters, said a member, Judith Kolokoff of Seattle. In the end, many delegates who spoke during the final debate said they saw the resolution as fair and even-handed.

Several blocks away, in SoHo, on West Houston Street near Wooster Street, another artist, the British painter Gary Hume, was asked to create a painting for another billboard, 45 feet tall. And a third painter, Lisa Sanditz, the fledgling of the group in both age and reputation, was asked to take on the largest billboard, 64 feet tall, at a SoHo corner on Greene Street, where it will be in full view of an unlikely captive audience: the drivers slogging Holland-Tunnel-bound along Canal Street. The project, like many public art exhibits that sprout like tomato plants in the summer around New York City, was created with corporate money. In this case it was the idea of the United Technologies Corporation, a Hartford-based company that makes aircraft engines and elevators, among other products, and that commissioned the paintings to commemorate 25 years of its support for the arts. But the project is unusual because public painting - as opposed to sculpture or installation-type art - is rare, generally seen only in commissioned (or more often noncommissioned, illegal) graffiti murals on building walls. The project is also atypical because the company decided to give all three artists free rein to paint whatever they wanted, with no oversight or review before the works were writ large above city streets for a two-month run, beginning Sept. 8.

In his studio one overcast day in late May, he was about to begin work on the painting for the project, to be made on a canvas whose proportions in inches would roughly match the proportions of the billboard in feet. (Because of union rules and liability concerns, it was decided early on that the artists would not be allowed to paint the billboards themselves but would give smaller paintings to professional sign painters.) Mr. Katz's studio on West Broadway, where he has worked since the late 1960's, is huge but not fancy, with a plain kitchen, old rotary dial phones on the wall and the smell of paint thick in the air.

United Technologies, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and Carrier air-conditioners, said first-quarter net income climbed 18 percent, to $651 million, or $1.28 a share, from $551 million, or $1.08, a year earlier. Sales increased 8.8 percent, to $9.41 billion. Advertisement The earnings beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share. The Otis elevator unit benefited from rising orders in Asia, while more airline travel helped Pratt &amp; Whitney sell spare parts for engines. Profit this year will climb to $5.90 to $6.15 a share, from $5.29 in 2004, George David, the chief executive, said. The previous forecast, given March 16, was $5.85 to $6.10. Mr. David also raised the revenue forecast to $43 billion from $41 billion to include the purchase of Kidde. Profit at Carrier, United Technologies' biggest business, more than doubled as sales rose 21 percent, to $2.71 billion. Profit at Otis jumped 40 percent on a 10 percent sales increase, while Pratt's profit soared 65 percent as sales rose 3.8 percent. At Honeywell, net income rose 22 percent, to $359 million, or 42 cents a share, up from $295 million, or 34 cents, a year ago. Sales were up 4.5 percent, to $6.45 billion. Analysts had expected profit of 40 cents a share. Sales increased 9 percent at the aerospace unit, the largest of the company's four main businesses, on orders from customers like Singapore Airlines and the United States Air Force. Operating profit rose by 15 percent as a result of reduced costs, while pension expenses declined 17 percent. Honeywell expects second-quarter profit of 49 cents to 51 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call expect 50 cents. General Dynamics, which makes Gulfstream business jets, said quarterly profit rose 25 percent on higher sales of aircraft and a tax benefit. Net income increased to $336 million, or $1.66 a share, from $269 million, or $1.34, in the period a year earlier. General Dynamics' sales rose 3.7 percent, to $4.82 billion, the smallest increase in more than four years and less than analysts expected. Sales and profit rose at the business jet unit as corporations bought more planes. Resolution of a tax audit resulted in a tax that was $63 million less than the $132 million set aside a year earlier. Without that, the company would have missed its forecast, mainly because of rising costs for a commercial oil tanker program, said Eric Hugel, an analyst with Stephens Inc. in New York. "It looked like a pretty weak quarter," said Mr. Hugel, who rates the shares equal weight and does not own them. Other than the tax benefit, "they were pretty light, with weaker margins in the marine unit and combat systems." "People were looking for increasing sales and margins in combat systems and it's not clear why that didn't happen." General Dynamics was expected to earn $1.53 a share, the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DD163EF935A35757C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">COMPANY NEWS; UNITED TECHNOLOGIES TO SELL GEAR UNIT TO CARLYLE<date>Published: April 6, 2005</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation, maker of Hamilton Sundstrand industrial and aerospace equipment, agreed to sell its Falk Corporation gear and coupling unit to the Rexnord Corporation, part of the Carlyle Group, for $295 million to focus on pumps and compressors.

United Technologies, which owns a diverse group of companies that produces things like airplane engines and elevators, will pay 165 pence ($3.18) a share for Kidde, plus a dividend of 2 pence a share. United Technologies, an American company based in Hartford, offered 160 pence a share for Kidde in October and increased that by 5 pence a share earlier this month. The price is a 34 percent premium to the price of Kidde's shares on Oct. 20, the day before United Technologies said it was interested in the British company, but was lower than the 170 pence a share that some analysts said Kidde would bring. Shares of Kidde rose 6.5 pence, to 165.5 pence in London. Shares of United Technologies fell 40 cents, to $102. The acquisition will bolster United Technologies' building equipment unit, which already includes Otis Elevators, Carrier air-conditioning systems and Chubb electronic security systems. Kidde, based in Slough, England, supplies fire extinguishers and alarms to homes, commercial buildings and industries like airlines and oil platforms. The company, which, along with Chubb, was once part of Williams P.L.C., has 7,750 employees in 29 countries and had $1.53 billion in revenue in 2003. "We believe that the offer represents a fair price, giving an outstanding return when compared with the share price of Kidde of 69.5 pence immediately following demerger in November 2000," Kidde's chairman, Norman Askew, said in a statement. Kidde agreed this month to allow United Technologies access to its books, expecting that it would lead to an improved offer. The chairman and chief executive of United Technologies, George David, added, "We are pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the Kidde board." The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2005. UBS is acting as the financial adviser for United Technologies; Citigroup is advising Kidde.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EEDF1031F93AA35751C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Higher Offer For Kidde<date>Published: December 9, 2004</date><text>The British manufacturer of fire extinguishers Kidde said that it had received an improved takeover offer from United Technologies, but that it had not agreed to a deal.

The idea, an extension of the outsourcing of jobs, was posited last week in a report by the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning research center, and United for a Fair Economy, a group seeking to narrow the gap between rich and poor. Specifically, it said that George A. David, the chief of United Technologies, received $70 million last year -- all but about $4 million from stock options -- and speculated that shareholder value could be increased by hiring an executive in India to do his job for less. After all, it noted, the highest-paid executive there, Vivek Paul of Wipro -- a major beneficiary of outsourcing, as it happens -- pulled in a relatively puny $1.1 million. Why pick on Mr. David? The report said he was the highest-paid chief of any of the 15 companies it deemed ''leading outsourcers.'' Others include Sanford I. Weill of Citigroup, Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle and Kenneth D. Lewis of Bank of America. If lower labor costs are their ultimate goal, ''U.S. executives might consider outsourcing themselves,'' the report suggested. Unsaid was how those hypothetical savings might be affected by the golden parachutes that many executives have packed for themselves. Often, the pacts require chiefs to be paid whether or not they work. Mark A.

Now, the competition to build the next fleet of presidential helicopters has become a bare-knuckles brawl that pits a flag-waving domestic maker against an international team hoping to be rewarded for supporting the United States in Iraq.One bidding team is led by the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the nation's largest military contractor, which has lined up European partners and a lobbying juggernaut that includes Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Italian counterpart, Silvio Berlusconi -- two of Washington's staunchest allies in Iraq.Their Italian-designed craft, named US 101, would be the first of its kind to ferry the president.On the other side is the United Technologies Corporation, parent to Sikorsky Aircraft, whose founder, Igor I. Sikorsky, invented the modern helicopter.It is selling itself as the all-American entrant, and ads for Sikorsky's S-92 say that only ''skilled, trustworthy American hands'' can ''ensure mission safety and the security'' of the president.''There is a visceral and gut feeling that you don't want the president in a Mercedes or flying around in an Italian helicopter,'' said Jeffrey P. Pino, a Sikorsky senior vice president. ''You want the president in an American chopper.''To which Stephen C. Moss, president of the United States subsidiary of AgustaWestland, Lockheed's European partner, counters: ''The real issue is whether you want competition on a level playing field or a win based on jingoist antiforeign sentiment in an election year.''Charged with sorting this out is the U.S. Navy, which found selecting of one of these two teams to be such a political hot potato that it kicked the decision up to the defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld. He agreed with the Navy to delay the final decision until after the November election. The current presidential helicopter fleet is now 30 years old.At the moment, both sides are revving up the rhetoric and lining up powerful politicians behind their cause. Lockheed, which will build much of the US 101 in upstate New York, has the support of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who logged many hours on Marine One as first lady, and Gov. George E. Pataki. Sikorsky, whose helicopters, built in Stratford, Conn., currently carry the president, has the Connecticut Congressional delegation knocking on the Pentagon door.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/16/nyregion/rowland-office-linked-to-fuel-cell-deal-at-youth-center.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Rowland Office Linked to Fuel Cell Deal at Youth Center<date>Published: April 16, 2004</date><text>A new legislative report concludes that the governor's office was heavily involved in the decision to commission a costly fuel cell plant in Middletown, Conn., and steer some of the work to United Technologies, a Connecticut-based company that employed John G. Rowland as a consultant before he became governor in 1995.The fuel cell plant supplies power to an adjacent juvenile training center, which has already attracted the attention of federal investigators looking into possible bid-rigging in the Rowland administration and a legislative panel considering whether to recommend impeachment of the governor.The state-built juvenile center, which opened in August 2001, was built by the Tomasso family of builders at a cost of $57 million. The Tomassos, who have been at the center of the investigations of the Rowland administration because of the number of no-bid contracts they have been awarded, as well as for their work on the governor's cottage, were not involved with construction of the fuel cell plant, which cost $17 million.Federal investigators have extended their inquiry into the juvenile center to include the fuel cell deal. The investigation was first reported by The Associated Press, which on Thursday also reported that prosecutors had subpoenaed records from the state's Bond Commission about the fuel cells.Legislators have been conducting their own inquiries. On Tuesday, the Office of Legislative Research released a report, which it said had been requested by an unidentified legislator. Among its findings, the report says, ''The decision to use fuel cells and the ultimate selection of the contractor for the project appears to have made by Judge Nicholas Cioffi, the special project manager the governor selected.''Mr. Cioffi, who retired from the state's Superior Court in 1991, was given a six-figure contract to oversee the construction of the juvenile center and its treatment programs in early 1999, a few months after a 15-year-old girl's suicide at the old juvenile center called attention to its flaws, documents show. Mr. Cioffi at the time was also a close friend of Peter Ellef, who was the governor's co-chief of staff until spring of 2002.''It seems to have been a very mysterious process leading to an expenditure of many millions of dollars,'' said State Senator Don E. Williams Jr., who previously investigated problems with the juvenile center.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/17/business/company-news-united-technologies-european-unit-is-investigated.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">COMPANY NEWS; UNITED TECHNOLOGIES' EUROPEAN UNIT IS INVESTIGATED<date>Published: March 17, 2004</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that some employees at its Otis Elevator subsidiary in Europe may have engaged in illegal anticompetitive conduct.

Kirk, a spokesman for Representative John B. Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut, who sponsored a forum on the industry last spring. ''The congressman's view is that it's critical we in Connecticut work to maintain our status as the leaders of an incredibly important technology.''Fuel cells generate energy through an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Because the fuel is not burned, there are none of the emissions associated with conventional power plants.In the 1960's, a United Technologies Corporation plant in South Windsor began making fuel cells for the Apollo space missions. Today, the company has installed 255 large commercial fuel cells in 19 different countries and is producing 25 to 30 new ones every year.Connecticut is now home to three of the largest fuel cell companies in the world. Besides United Technologies, there are Fuel Cell Energy Inc. in Danbury and Proton Energy Systems in Wallingford.Smaller companies are starting to spring up as well, such as Nxegen in Middletown and GenCell Corporation in Southbury.''It's a technology that has been struggling for years,'' said John Carbone, the chief operating officer at Nxegen. ''But it's been developed to the point where it's right on the verge of being a commercial technology.''The state Department of Economic Development and Community Development estimated that $300 million worth of fuel cell products have been manufactured and shipped from Connecticut, more than any other state. While the industry is still small, with some 1,400 employees in the state so far, the figure still represents more than one-third of the people working on fuel cells in North America.In addition, the largest fuel cell installation in the world is in Connecticut, a 1.2 megawatt generating complex -- enough energy to supply more than 1,000 typical homes -- at the Connecticut Juvenile Training Center in Middletown, constructed by United Technologies.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/business/technology-redrawing-the-electric-power-grid.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">TECHNOLOGY; Redrawing the Electric Power Grid<date>Published: June 24, 2003</date><text>Correction AppendedAll was calm here on an unseasonably cool afternoon in the control room of the Connecticut Valley Electric Exchange as engineers neared the end of their 12-hour shift monitoring the power plants, substations and major transmission lines that serve Connecticut and western Massachusetts.The electronic map filling the wall was a vast grid of red lines, signaling that power was moving smoothly. Here and there, patches of green spotlighted resources that could be tapped if needed.But when heat waves roll through the region and millions of customers turn on their air-conditioning, the green will disappear and Convex, as the exchange is known, will almost certainly endure the kind of strain it experienced on hot days last summer.''We had everything thrown on by 10 a.m.,'' said Hans H. Schwers, head of operating policies and procedures for Convex, recalling one such heat wave last August. ''Then it was just a matter of sitting there and seeing how far our system could go. There was nothing else you could do.''Most summers, power system managers around the country experience similar moments of helplessness. The problem is not so much the amount of power available as it is bottlenecks in the transmission grid.A central issue in the power industry and among alternative power advocates is how best to eliminate the bottlenecks: by building more long-distance transmission lines or by generating more power in small quantities close to where it is needed.Power generation capacity has increased sharply since the late 1990's, when there was a wave of construction of large gas-fired plants around the country. But the aging transmission grid prevents much of that power from flowing easily into areas where it is most needed during summer consumption spikes.The traditional solution -- to build more and bigger transmission lines -- has few fans outside the industry. Transmission projects attract bitter opposition from people in the paths of the lines. Regulators routinely take years to review proposals and are especially leery of plans that rely on new transmission technology. And new lines, even those running less than 50 miles, can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, which Wall Street sees as a poor investment.It is no wonder, then, that plans for new transmission lines invariably lead to debates about whether the federal and state governments would be wiser to give more support to local power generation, new energy technology and conservation.Correction: June 27, 2003, Friday An article in Business Day on Tuesday about congestion in the regional electric power grid misstated the measurement for the cost of power. It is kilowatt-hours, not kilowatts. A picture caption with the article misidentified the control room shown. It was for ISO New England, the regional electric power distribution agency, not the Connecticut Valley Electric Exchange.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/12/business/united-technologies-agrees-to-buy-chubb.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">United Technologies Agrees to Buy Chubb<date>Published: June 12, 2003</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation, the maker of Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines, agreed last night to buy Chubb of Britain, one of the world's largest security companies, for about Â£600 million ($1 billion) in cash.Shareholders of Chubb, which is based in London, will get 75 pence a share, a 13 percent premium to Chubb's closing price on April 15, United Technologies said in a statement.United Technologies will assume the equivalent of $934 million in debt and use the purchase to complement its Carrier air-conditioner and Otis elevator units.United Technologies, based in Hartford, wants to expand its nonaerospace businesses to make up for a decline in demand from aircraft companies. Chubb, which has only been profitable once in its three years as an independent company, will benefit from access to United Technologies' sales network, analysts said.''Diluting the commercial aerospace exposure and adding a business that potentially has a higher growth rate than existing businesses is positive,'' said Marcy Yeamans, an analyst at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, which owns 1.2 million United Technologies shares.Chubb split from Williams P.L.C. in 2000 and has struggled with rising costs as sales waned in Britain, Hong Kong and Australia. It said April 16 that it was in talks about a takeover with an unidentified buyer.Chubb had about $2.5 billion in sales last year and has 48,000 employees. United Technologies had $28.2 billion in revenue last year and has about 155,000 employees.The boards of both companies unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, the companies said in the statement.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/11/business/alarm-provider-said-to-accept-takeover-offer.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Alarm Provider Said to Accept Takeover Offer<date>Published: June 11, 2003</date><text>Chubb, a British security systems company, agreed in principle yesterday to accept a $1.1 billion takeover offer from the United Technologies Corporation, according to executives close to the talks.The board of United Technologies is planning to meet today to approve the deal, the executives said, and an announcement could be made late today or early tomorrow.The offer for Chubb, worth about 75 pence a share according to the executives, has caused some consternation among Chubb investors who consider the bid to be less than the value of the company. But Chubb, the third-largest security systems company in the world, may not be in the best bargaining position to demand a higher price because its stock was down 60 percent this year before news of the interest of United Technologies was reported.A spokesman for United Technologies declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for Chubb could not be reached to comment.Shares of Chubb rose yesterday 1.25 pence, to 69.25 pence, in anticipation of the announcement. Shares of United Technologies gained $1.46, to $70.70.United Technologies is looking to add Chubb, which provides security and fire alarm systems for both commercial buildings and residential homes, to complement its other businesses, which include Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioning.

Chubb is planning to make a statement about the talks early this week, the executives said.While United Technologies, based in Hartford, has not set a firm offer price for Chubb, the executives said, the company has indicated it plans to bid more than $1.3 billion.The addition of Chubb to United Technologies' stable of businesses, which includes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioning, would give it another line of business to offer when bidding on contracts, for big buildings, for example.Chubb is the third-largest security systems company in the world, providing security and fire alarm systems for both commercial buildings and residential homes. The company employs 48,000 people.Just last week, Chubb acknowledged it had ''received a preliminary approach, which may or may not lead to an offer,'' after the company's stock jumped without explanation. The company's statement did not identify the bidder.Shares of Chubb ended last week at 82 pence ($1.29), up from 61.25 pence (96 cents) at the beginning of the week.Analysts had speculated that the offer had come from a buyout firm or a rival security company. Chubb came close to selling itself last year to the Swedish security giant Securitas, but the negotiations collapsed after Chubb's stock price jumped.In September, after Chubb's talks broke down with Securitas, Chubb's chief executive, Robert Gasparini, said: ''Consolidation has stopped and it will probably be another year before improvements allow the key players to restart. We will look at any approach but it needs to be fundamentally serious and quite frankly we are focused totally on growing as an independent company.''United Technologies, which spent about $400 million on acquisitions last year, said in a conference call last week that it planned to spend $1.5 billion on acquisitions this year and appeared to suggest that it was looking at potential targets.Spokesmen for United Technologies and Chubb could not be reached to comment on the talks, which were reported in the British newspapers yesterday.Last week, United Technologies, which also makes Black Hawk helicopters, said it had net income of $502 million, or $1 a share, for the first quarter, compared with $467 million, or 92 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The company warned that it expected to have a tough second quarter as major commercial airline customers reduced orders for spare parts.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/business/united-technologies-posts-gain.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">United Technologies Posts Gain<date>Published: April 18, 2003</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation said today that its income rose 7 percent in the first quarter as military sales and strong demand for Otis elevators offset weakness in its commercial aviation business.But shares of United Technologies fell $2.27, or about 3.7 percent, to $60, after the company warned that it would have a tough second quarter as major commercial airline customers cut spare parts orders.United Technologies, which also makes Black Hawk helicopters and Carrier air-conditioners, had net income of $502 million, or $1 a share, for the first quarter, compared with $467 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier.The company surpassed analysts' average earnings estimate of 97 cents a share as compiled by Thomson First Call.United Technologies, which is based in Hartford, Conn., said it still expected to earn $4.55 to $4.80 a share for the full year despite growing problems being experienced by its airline customers.First-quarter revenue increased 5 percent from a year earlier to $6.7 billion. Operations generated $252 million in cash flow when including a voluntary contribution of $500 million to employee pension plans.Profit at the Otis Elevator division surged 34 percent to $314 million. The Carrier subsidiary, which had $74 million in revamping charges in the year-earlier quarter, saw profit more than double.Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit that makes jet engines, had a 13 percent drop in first-quarter profit. The airline industry has been battered by a decline in travel and the outbreak of the disease known as SARS, in Asia.United Technologies' commercial aerospace sales fell 20 percent, but military aerospace revenue increased more than 30 percent.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/26/business/ge-research-returns-to-roots-management-again-gambles-on-costly-long-term-ideas.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">G.E. Research Returns to Roots; Management Again Gambles On Costly Long-Term Ideas<date>Published: December 26, 2002</date><text>Anil Duggal is 37 years old, but he looks like a mischievous boy as he turns his office lights low. He hits a button and grins gleefully as the flat panel he holds generates a white glow bright enough to light the room.The panel is made from thin sheets of specially treated plastic on glass that seems to generate almost as much light from a small jolt of electricity as an incandescent light bulb running on standard current.If Mr. Duggal and his team of researchers at the General Electric Global Research Center in this small town not far from Schenectady can figure out how to dispense with the glass, they could be a short hop away from developing super-thin lighting and energy sources that could be rolled off printing presses like newspapers. And that could usher in an era of cheap, clean-burning lights, batteries, solar cells -- and the beginning of plastic-based electronics.These days, Mr. Duggal's laboratory, where he specializes in light and energy, is a regular stop for Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, as well as the heads of G.E.'s businesses. Mr. Duggal reassures them that his project is a question of when, not if, and that he is meeting research milestones. But he does not promise a new product any time soon, and no one pressures him to do so.''People used to ask for quarterly progress reports, and I had to struggle to get funding renewed,'' said Mr. Duggal, who joined G.E. in 1992. ''Now I feel I have at least two years before I have to show progress.''For G.E., that change is nearly as radical as the science being pursued. John F. Welch Jr., Mr. Immelt's predecessor, spent two decades pushing the Niskayuna lab to churn out profitable products. Now Mr. Immelt is letting it return to the mission that Charles P. Steinmetz, a G.E. engineer who set up the lab, laid forth more than 100 years ago.''Steinmetz did not want this lab to worry about next quarter's product,'' said Scott C. Donnelly, senior vice president for research. ''He wanted it to work on the next big idea, even as G.E.'s businesses were refining the last one.''The numbers reflect the shift back to those roots. Two years ago the central lab spent $28 million, or only about 10 percent of its $286 million budget, on long-term projects. This year, $91 million of the center's $344 million budget has gone to such research; next year, the center's team expects to direct $104 million -- almost 30 percent of its $349 million budget -- to long-range projects.</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/business/2-outside-ties-cut-by-chief-of-citigroup.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">2 Outside Ties Cut by Chief Of Citigroup<date>Published: October 02, 2002</date><text>The chief executive of Citigroup, Sanford I. Weill, said yesterday that he would resign from the boards of AT&amp;T and United Technolgies, whose chief executives sit on the board of Citigroup.The announcement is the latest effort by Mr. Weill to raise business standards at Citigroup, at a time when regulators are investigating possible conflicts of interest at the company's investment bank, Salomon Smith Barney.Also yesterday, the company named Michael T. Masin, president of Verizon Communications, as chief operating officer of Citigroup. Mr. Masin had been a member of Citigroup's board, serving as chairman of the personnel and compensation committee. He will take over responsibilities given up by Charles O. Prince III, when he became chief executive of Salomon last month.Richard D. Parsons, chief executive of AOL Time Warner, will take over Mr. Masin's role as head of the personnel and compensation committee. Mr. Masin has resigned from Citigroup's board.Mr. Weill will resign from the AT&amp;T board after that company completes the spinoff of its AT&amp;T Broadband division, which is expected by year-end. His resignation from the board of United Technologies will take effect next spring.By resigning from the two boards, Mr. Weill ends a practice at Citigroup known as interlocking directorships, where corporate executives serve on each others' boards. The practice is frowned upon by specialists in corporate governance issues, because it creates the potential for conflicts of interest.''I am doing away with any perceived conflicts, and this will also give me more time to commit to Citigroup,'' Mr. Weill said in an interview yesterday.The possibility of a conflict between Mr. Weill's obligations at Citigroup and his role as an AT&amp;T board member came up in August, when the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, issued a subpoena to AT&amp;T, for documents related to Salomon's selection in April 2000 as an underwriter for a large offering of AT&amp;T stock.Mr. Spitzer appeared to be investigating whether Mr. Weill had a role in prompting Salomon's former telecommunications analyst, Jack B. Grubman, to change his rating on AT&amp;T's stock from negative to positive to win a role in the offering. Citigroup has denied Mr. Weill exerted any pressure.Corporate governance specialists said Mr. Weill's resignation from the boards was a positive step. ''This is designed to increase his credibility with investors at a time when he needs that support,'' said Charles M. Elson, the director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ''Regardless of the motivation, this is welcome news.''</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/10/business/corporate-conduct-reaction-talk-corporate-integrity-heard-street-suite.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE REACTION; A Talk on Corporate Integrity Heard in the Street and the Suite<date>Published: July 10, 2002</date><text>Chief executives widely praised President Bush's speech yesterday, saying it would help restore confidence in American business. But many Wall Streeters and those who run large pension funds that own billions of dollars in stocks expressed disappointment Mr. Bush did not offer more specific proposals to clean up corporate wrongdoing.The two points of view represent competing visions of the current scandal over corporate behavior: executives who feel their credibility is at stake and investors angered by a cascading series of financial losses and a string of accounting failures.While both sides praised Mr. Bush's focus on the need for integrity and ethical behavior among chief executives, from that point on, opinions diverged. Institutional investors felt more sweeping changes in boardroom rules and accounting oversight were needed while others, mainly business leaders, said they opposed any move toward greater regulation.''I was hoping for more commitment to regulatory reform and to corporate governance reform in light of what happened,'' said Felix Rohatyn, the longtime Wall Street financier and former ambassador to France. ''There are still too many holes in our regulatory dikes. They must be fixed; otherwise a very important national asset, namely our financial markets, will be badly damaged.''Mr. Rohatyn has advocated, among other changes, putting institutional investors on corporate boards and reporting stock options granted to top executives on income statements, items that were not on the White House's agenda.By contrast, chief executives were lavish in their praise.''We needed this speech because people are losing confidence,'' said George David, chief executive of the United Technologies Corporation, a diversified manufacturer in Hartford. ''Some bad things happen and people say the system is broken. It's not. A huge percentage of corporate America is honest and his speech reinforced that.''Robert S. Miller, chief executive of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, amplified on that. ''The president struck a nice bipartisan balance. He talked about doubling prison terms and going after the bad apples rather than imposing new burdens on the majority of American businesses.''</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/12/business/company-news-united-technologies-reaffirms-forecast-for-the-year.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">COMPANY NEWS; UNITED TECHNOLOGIES REAFFIRMS FORECAST FOR THE YEAR<date>Published: February 12, 2002</date><text>United Technologies reaffirmed yesterday that it expected to earn $4.32 a share this year.

Lanza, the chief executive of L-3 Communications, an aerospace and communications company in New York, received a not-too-surprising telephone call from military officials. ''They asked us, 'Can you do the following things, and how long will it take you to do it,' '' Mr. Lanza said. ''They are in the planning process. And they need to know about our ability to deliver certain products.'' That planning process is about war: the Pentagon is preparing a shopping list for the global struggle against terrorism promised by President Bush. As a result, scores of military contractors, from giants like Lockheed Martin to smaller companies like L-3, could be among the corporate beneficiaries of the devastating attacks of Sept. 11. Even as those assaults have sent the stock market plummeting and caused havoc for much of American business, prospects for the military-industrial complex are looking stronger than they have in years. Overnight, political opposition in Congress to huge increases in Pentagon spending has vanished, along with concerns about dipping into surplus Social Security funds. Consequently, what had seemed to the industry like a disappointingly small military budget just two weeks ago is now climbing toward unanticipated heights, providing a lift for military contractors and a quick Keynesian stimulus for the economy. Beyond the buildup for war, winners and losers in the race for Pentagon money will also be determined by the outcome of Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's efforts to transform the military. His goals have included improving intelligence, expanding long-strike capabilities and making the forces lighter, faster and more high-tech. But the process has faced stiff resistance from some commanders and lawmakers who fear Mr. Rumsfeld wants to starve programs for modernizing conventional ships, planes and howitzers to nurture untried products, like space planes or remotely piloted submarines. ''The services are going to want to try to use some money to address their modernization needs,'' said Jacques S. Gansler, an under secretary of defense in the Clinton administration who now teaches public policy at the University of Maryland. ''And that's where you get a conundrum over whether to buy a new tank, or equipment you'd like to have for 21st-century warfare against terrorists. You'll have a battle between those two options.'' The budget numbers tell the story. Three days after the attack, Congress overwhelmingly approved $40 billion in emergency funds, with $10 billion to $15 billion for the armed services. In the next few weeks, Congress is also expected to approve, with little dissent, a $33 billion increase in the Pentagon budget, raising it to $329 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. And before final votes on the 2002 spending plan are even cast, the Pentagon is expected to ask for an additional $15 billion to $25 billion. There is bipartisan support for that, too. ''Capitol Hill is prepared to do whatever the Pentagon wants,'' said Gordon Adams, a budget official in the Clinton administration who is now director of security policy studies at the Elliot School of International Security Studies at George Washington University. Much of the initial wave of money will go toward rebuilding the smoldering hole left in the Pentagon by the hijacked airliner, paying for heightened security at military installations worldwide and preparing for retaliatory strikes. That will mean buying new bullets, cruise missiles, boots, reconnaissance equipment and spare parts. But many analysts and military officials say they expect there to be a significant amount of money left over after those basic needs are met. The service chiefs and senior lawmakers will probably want to spend those funds on favored weapons programs, like Boeing's F-18 E and F fighters, United Defense's Crusader artillery system, and Northrop Grumman and General Dynamic's DD-21 stealth destroyer. It will not matter if those systems are not clearly useful in the war on terrorism, the analysts say. ''There is a heightened sense of danger out there,'' said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer with the Lexington Institute, a military policy organization based in Arlington, Va.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/31/business/company-news-carrier-is-cutting-600-jobs-at-2-sites-in-tennessee.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">COMPANY NEWS; CARRIER IS CUTTING 600 JOBS AT 2 SITES IN TENNESSEE<date>Published: August 31, 2001</date><text>The Carrier unit of the United Technologies Corporation is eliminating 600 jobs at two operations in Tennessee because of declining orders.

Purchase Of Honeywell Now Appears Near Collapse<date>Published: June 15, 2001</date><text>General Electric's planned acquisition of Honeywell International appeared near collapse today after G.E. said that its final concessions would probably not satisfy European regulators.While people close to the talks said that an agreement was still possible before the July 12 deadline set by the European Commission, General Electric's statement was unusually blunt.''The European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada,'' said John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman and chief executive.The turn of events led to internal meetings today at United Technologies about the possibility of making a bid for Honeywell, people close to the company said. United Technologies, an old-style conglomerate that makes Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines and Otis Elevators, has opposed G.E.'s proposed deal and was close to an agreement to buy Honeywell in October only to be outbid by G.E. at the last minute.The proposed Honeywell acquisition, valued at $45 billion, would be the first big American deal to be blocked solely by European regulators. The Europeans worry that the combined company could control too much of the market for aviation products and could direct far too much business to itself.The standoff comes at a sensitive moment in United States and European relations. President Bush's recent decision to begin proceedings that could lead to sharp restrictions of steel imports drew sharp criticism from European leaders. And the aviation industry, with products and services made by General Electric and Honeywell, has been a longstanding subject of contention between Washington and Brussels. Mr. Welch discussed the status of the talks today with Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff, ahead of the European-United States summit meeting.When he announced the deal and postponed his retirement last year, Mr. Welch said the combination would sail through regulatory approval.In his statement today, he said: ''We have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point. This shows you are never too old to get surprised.''The United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, said the United States had a strong interest in seeing the G.E.-Honeywell deal treated fairly by European regulators, but gave no indications of what, if anything, might be done.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/04/business/company-news-united-technologies-buys-an-air-conditioning-business.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">COMPANY NEWS; UNITED TECHNOLOGIES BUYS AN AIR-CONDITIONING BUSINESS<date>Published: April 04, 2001</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that its Carrier air-conditioning unit had bought the heating and air- conditioning business of the closely held Climatic Corporation, to expand in the Southeast.

He expected to win. He came in third in his class.Was he mad? Distraught? Disheartened, at least? ''I was disappointed,'' was as far as Mr. David would go.Emotional outbursts are just not part of George David's behavioral repertoire. Take his reaction to General Electric's John F. Welch Jr. Just as United Technologies, the company Mr. David has headed since 1994, was about to announce a merger with Honeywell International, Mr. Welch, the chairman of G. E., topped Mr. David's $40 billion offer by $5 billion. Months of planning, of due diligence, of negotiations, went down the drain.So, when Mr. David ran into Mr. Welch in Florida a few days later, did the sparks fly? ''He acted totally professional,'' Mr. Welch recalled. ''I like the guy, and I think he likes me.''Here is Mr. David's take on it: ''I'm not sore. Jack and I are voracious competitors but we have an easy relationship.'' But, with a twinkle in his eye, he added, ''It was nice of Mr. Welch to validate our business judgment and to overpay.''It was vintage George David: calm, controlled, competitive, but willing to accept defeat -- all while probably negotiating another deal. ''We have 50 people working on mergers full time, and we probably have $3 billion to $4 billion in deals in various stages,'' he said.United Technologies is doing fine on its own for now. It has reported increased earnings for 28 consecutive quarters, it is a market leader in most of its businesses, and its stock has steadily risen during Mr. David's six-year tenure.Still, losing Honeywell was a blow. It would have doubled United Technologies' size, and given it the huge market capitalization that investors favor. And, it would have created an aerospace business that could have given G. E. some truly heavy competition. ''We would have trumped G. E.'s ace,'' Mr. David said.So, it was a setback, and a bad one. But at 58, Mr. David has managed to turn more than one apparent loss into a victory.He was an executive with Otis Elevator when United Technologies took over that company in 1976, and he had expected to lose his job. ''I was overtitled, overpaid and underexperienced,'' he said. Nonetheless, Mr. David rose to become United Technologies' president in 1992, and chief executive two years later.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/23/business/general-electric-buying-honeywell-in-45-billion-deal.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">GENERAL ELECTRIC BUYING HONEYWELL IN $45 BILLION DEAL<date>Published: October 23, 2000</date><text>Correction AppendedThe General Electric Company has agreed to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer, for $45 billion in stock, capping several intense rounds of deal making that broke up an impending merger between United Technologies and Honeywell.As part of the agreement, John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, will defer his planned retirement from April until the end of 2001 to see the deal through and manage his company's largest acquisition. G.E. expects the transaction to be completed by early next year.The deal brings Honeywell -- itself formed by a merger between Honeywell Inc. and Allied Signal -- into General Electric's portfolio of disparate businesses, including the manufacture of aircraft engines and competition in network television through its NBC unit. Honeywell, based in Morristown, N.J., produces aerospace systems, power and transportation products, specialty chemicals, home security systems and building controls.It will close its 550-employee headquarters, though 1,750 others in various businesses and laboratories on its leased Morristown campus will stay where they are for now.G.E. does expect the deal to yield significant cost savings, but the companies have not determined how many members of its combined work force of 460,000 might lose their jobs.G.E.'s directors approved the deal yesterday after Honeywell's board voted on Saturday evening in favor of being acquired by G.E., the nation's largest old-time conglomerate. The combination must be approved by regulators both in the United States and Europe. They are likely to scrutinize the acquisition and possibly force divestitures of certain assets.Under the terms of the transaction, G.E. will pay 1.055 shares for each of Honeywell's roughly 817 million fully diluted shares, valuing each Honeywell share at $55.39, or about 17 percent more than its Friday closing price of $47. Honeywell's stock increased nearly 11 percent on Friday as investors speculated that G.E. planned to trump United Technologies' offer for the company. People close to the deal said G.E. would also assume about $3 billion in debt.''This is certainly a better deal for shareholders than the United Technologies deal,'' said David Bleustein, an analyst with PaineWebber.G.E.'s offer is 9.2 percent higher than United Technologies' scuttled offer of about $50.32 a share.Correction: October 24, 2000, Tuesday A headline on the continuation of a front-page article yesterday about the purchase of Honeywell International by General Electric misstated the price in some copies.

Breaks Up $40 Billion Deal for Honeywell<date>Published: October 21, 2000</date><text>A counteroffer from General Electric's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., broke up United Technologies' deal to buy Honeywell International yesterday, setting off a rush of activity as other suitors considered bidding for all or part of Honeywell.Siemens A.G. of Germany, for one, is weighing its options, according to executives close to the company. And, while the acquisition-minded Tyco International denied that it planned to bid for Honeywell, executives close to Tyco said it might bid on the parts of Honeywell that G.E. or another suitor might not want.Honeywell was silent yesterday, and its board is expected to meet over the weekend to discuss all of its options.General Electric was no more forthcoming. ''There's nothing we can say, so I decline comment,'' said Gary Sheffer, a G.E. spokesman. Mr. Welch faxed his offer to Honeywell's management before Honeywell's board met to consider the $40.3 billion bid from United Technologies. When United Technologies learned of the G.E. approach, it withdrew its offer rather than get into a bidding war. Executives close to the deal say United Technologies is unlikely to rejoin the fray.By midafternoon analysts and investors alike seemed to believe that G.E. would be the ultimate winner.Honeywell stock, which had been steadily climbing all morning as investors waited for confirmation of the United Technologies deal, continued its steady ascent after that deal was scuttled. Honeywell closed at $47, up $10.88.Shares of G.E., meanwhile, took a beating after news of its bid for Honeywell emerged, closing down $3.13, to $52.50. Stock of United Technologies, which was down as much as $7 when the purchase of Honeywell seemed imminent, regained some of its lost ground. It closed at $65, down $3.Although analysts would still like to see United Technologies grow by acquisition, most say the company remains on solid ground without a deal.Parts of Honeywell are as good a fit for G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., as they were for United Technologies. Both G.E. and Honeywell make plastics and chemicals and power generation systems. GE Aircraft Engines is a major player in wide-bodied jets and other commercial aircraft, while Honeywell's strength is in avionics and business jet engines. Both companies make regional aircraft engines, but the overlap is smaller than it would have been between Honeywell and United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney unit.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/20/business/2-manufacturers-are-set-to-merge-in-40-billion-deal.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">2 MANUFACTURERS ARE SET TO MERGE IN $40 BILLION DEAL<date>Published: October 20, 2000</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation, one of the last old-style conglomerates that makes everything from jet engines to elevators, is expected to buy Honeywell International Inc. for about $40.3 billion in stock, according to executives close to the talks.Both boards are planning to meet today, the executives said. The companies acknowledged late yesterday that they were in talks, but declined to comment further. The executives said the companies hoped to announce the deal as early as today.The acquisition would create an industrial behemoth, bringing together United Technologies' Otis Elevators, Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines, Sikorsky helicopters and Carrier air-conditioners, with Honeywell's aerospace systems, power and transportation products, specialty chemicals and home security systems.Last year, Honeywell merged with Allied Signal.The combined concern, which merges two Dow Jones industrial companies, is expected to take the Honeywell name and have its headquarters in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, the executives said, though it remains unclear where it will be based. The executives suggested that the headquarters would not be in Hartford, where United Technologies is based, or in Morristown, N.J., where Honeywell is based.According to the executives, United Technologies has offered about 0.74 of a share, or $50.32, for each of the about 801 million outstanding shares of Honeywell, making the total purchase price $40.3 billion. That is a 39 percent premium above Honeywell's close yesterday of $36.13, up $2.44. Shares of United Technologies closed down 38 cents at $68.George David, the chairman and chief executive of United Technologies, would be chief executive of the combined company, while Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, Michael Bonsignore, would become chairman, the executives said.The companies hope to save about $1 billion annually by combining, the executives said, and add as much as 25 cents a share to earnings the first year after the merger.Although analysts had not predicted the deal, few were surprised by it. Wall Street had for some time been expecting United Technologies to announce an acquisition, and Honeywell's name has often made it onto the short list of possibilities. Honeywell has had a rough year both in terms of stock price and earnings, and several analysts have said it was vulnerable to takeover.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/17/business/company-news-united-technologies-to-acquire-specialty-equipment.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">COMPANY NEWS; UNITED TECHNOLOGIES TO ACQUIRE SPECIALTY EQUIPMENT<date>Published: October 17, 2000</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Specialty Equipment Companies, a maker of food-service refrigeration equipment, for about $600 million in a deal to extend the reach of its air-conditioning unit, the Carrier Corporation.

They said that buying the more expensive aircraft, which cost roughly five times as much, would throw the State Department's drug-enforcement budget out of whack.Then, in late December, White House officials confirmed a change of heart.Going beyond their aides' most ambitious recommendation, officials said, senior officials proposed immediately buying 30 of the helicopters they had once rejected, the Sikorsky UH-60L Blackhawk, at a cost of almost $400 million.It was Christmas not only for the much-criticized Colombian military, which is to receive the aircraft, but also for United Technologies Corporation, the Connecticut-based conglomerate that makes the Blackhawk and has been struggling with declining orders from the Pentagon.Now, however, the plan is drawing attention to the lobbying efforts of United Technologies, a major military contractor and political contributor, the political payoff for Democratic legislators from the state, and the policy choices implied in the $1.28 billion aid package that the White House has put forward for Colombia.The proposal also illuminates the political dynamics of what would be Washington's first large-scale involvement in a civil conflict in Latin America since the cold war, an initiative that has brought unlikely alliances on every side.''This would be a great relief package -- for the state of Connecticut,'' said Representative Cass Ballenger, a North Carolina Republican and a supporter of rival helicopter companies. Mr. Ballenger is one of several Republicans who have joined with some political liberals to urge the administration to consider substituting the cheaper Hueys it once championed for some Blackhawks.Even if the United States bought Colombia a handful of the Blackhawks and dozens of the rebuilt Hueys, Mr. Ballenger said wryly, ''you'd still have $100 million or $200 million left over to buy Democrats or Republicans or whatever you still needed'' to win approval of the plan.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/25/nyregion/metro-business-powered-by-fuel-cells.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Metro Business; Powered by Fuel Cells<date>Published: February 25, 2000</date><text>United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that it had sold a $1 million fuel-cell system that will produce electricity for the Conde Nast building, at 4 Times Square.The fuel cells generate 400 kilowatts and will provide part of the power used in the 48-story building.

It will seek to force the Europeans to repeal a regulation banning aircraft powered by engines they deem too loud or polluting. The appeal follows a breakdown in two-party talks between the United States and the European Union.The regulations, adopted by the European Parliament last year but suspended pending talks with the United States, are to be enforced beginning May 4. They would crack down on planes that use engine mufflers known as ''hush kits.'' The Europeans say the muffled engines still pollute more than new engines.Congress and the aviation industry have put pressure on the administration to get the European rule overturned. Companies including Federal Express, United Technologies and Northwest Airlines have complained about lost sales and a plunge in the resale value of older planes after the Europeans adopted the regulation.The House responded last March with a resolution that would ban the Concorde, the supersonic showcase of British Airways and Air France, from landing at United States airports. That has not become law, but the Clinton administration says it shows how the engine dispute could spiral into a larger trade war unless it is resolved soon.''We have to defend our interests now,'' Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said in describing why Washington decided to take the case to the aviation organization. ''We all want more quiet aircraft,'' he said, ''but we are not going to let Europe set the standards unilaterally.''Though the United States and Europe trade more than $300 billion in goods annually, they often seem more like adversaries than commercial partners. The two have feuded over steel, farm subsidies, genetically modified goods, enforcement of trade laws and a variety of other things. Last year, the Clinton administration imposed tariffs on Louis Vuitton handbags, pecorino cheese, Scottish cashmere and other luxury goods because the European Union would not change its rules for importing bananas.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/30/nyregion/metro-business-environmental-settlement.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Metro Business; Environmental Settlement<date>Published: November 30, 1999</date><text>United Technologies Corporation has agreed to pay nearly $169,000 in fines and to make environmental improvements worth about $500,000 after violations were discovered at 19 factories in New England, the Environmental Protection Agency announced yesterday.The agreement stems from an independent environmental audit completed by the company, which is based in Hartford, in 1997 and 1998.The audit was required by a 1993 consent decree to resolve actions brought against eight United Technologies units that had violated environmental laws throughout the 1970's and 1980's.As part of the 1993 settlement, the company agreed to conduct an extensive audit of its environmental management systems as well as compliance audits at all 19 of its New England plants.The compliance audit showed that although violations of the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and other environmental laws were still occurring at company plants, the company's level of compliance was much higher than it had been, the E.P.A.'s regional office in Boston said.Leslie Carothers, the company's vice president for environment, health and safety, said many of the violations were administrative.United Technologies agreed to invest $422,800 over the next two years to test new technologies to reduce pollution at its plating operations.

But today, Gov. John G. Rowland announced a proposal to build the stadium about two miles away in East Hartford, on a former airfield that United Technologies Corporation has offered to donate.It was only the most recent change of plans for a stadium here -- and not the last, cautioned the governor, who was stung last April when the New England Patriots pulled out of a deal to move to a stadium that was to have been the focal point for a redeveloped waterfront site called Adriaen's Landing.Today, an array of state and business leaders joined Governor Rowland at a news conference at the Capitol to say that it made more sense to build the stadium across the Connecticut River at the empty airfield, which is close to major thoroughfares, less likely to be fettered by environmental snags -- and free.United Technologies, the parent company of Pratt &amp; Whitney, wants to donate 75 acres of its 700-acre Rentschler Field, said George David, the corporation's chief executive.United Technologies stands to gain nothing more than a charitable tax write-off for the donation, Mr. David said. ''There are no strings attached,'' he said.The stadium would be used for University of Connecticut football games, as well as baseball and soccer.Mr. Rowland said that the proposed 240-foot-tall stadium would have dwarfed Adriaen's Landing, a project that is still expected to include a hotel, a convention center, stores and restaurants -- all intended to draw people downtown. He said that without the stadium there, developers would be able to use the site more creatively, perhaps adding more retail services, a smaller sports arena, a park, parking or an expansion of the convention center.''This gives us more flexibility at Adriaen's Landing, and expands our economic development opportunities,'' said Mr. Rowland. In hindsight, Mr. Rowland said, a stadium at Adriaen's Landing would have made the area less appealing to pedestrians.A stroller-friendly scale, however, was not a consideration during the city's negotiations with the Patriots, who were planning a stadium about twice as large. The team chose to stay in the Boston area.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/26/business/company-news-united-technologies-buying-engine-supplier.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">COMPANY NEWS; UNITED TECHNOLOGIES BUYING ENGINE SUPPLIER<date>Published: October 26, 1999</date><text>The United Technologies Corporation is buying Dallas Aerospace Inc. from the Fairfield Corporation for about $57 million in cash.

''These steps are intended to assure that we maintain our competitiveness'' in a worldwide downturn in aerospace, he said.A spokesman at the United Technologies headquarters in Hartford was unable to say how many of the 28,000 jobs in Connecticut would be affected in a consolidation shuffle. United Technologies is the largest private employer in Connecticut.Forty percent of the charges will be recorded by the company's Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engine unit. Pratt &amp; Whitney said last month that it would cut 1,500 jobs, move its North Haven, Conn., unit to East Hartford and move its military jet engine business to Connecticut from West Palm Beach, Fla. Pratt &amp; Whitney-Canada also eliminated 700 posts.In other previously announced job cuts by United Technologies units, the Hamilton Sunstrand aerospace unit said Tuesday that it would eliminate 1,500 positions. Sikorsky Aircraft, based in Stratford, Conn., has announced 1,100 job cuts; Carrier, 400, and Otis Elevator, 165.Most of the cuts announced yesterday will be in overseas employees, said Peter Dalpe, a company spokesman.United Technologies, which also makes air-conditioners and elevators, said its profits per share would meet Wall Street projections, rising 17 percent in 1999 and 15 percent next year.Carrier, the air-conditioner maker, said in July that it was moving a number of operations from Syracuse, to the Carrier headquarters in Farmington, Conn.As part of the revamping, United Technologies sold its auto parts units to the Lear Corporation last March for $2.3 billion. In June, United completed the purchase of Hamilton Sundstrand, a Connecticut-based aerospace products company, for $4.3 billion.Securities analysts have been impressed by the cost-cutting and sustained earnings growth. Michael T. Regan, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said the company's industrial units, including Otis Elevator and Carrier, were expected to take up the slack as aerospace declines.Philip Baggaley, a bond analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, said United Technologies was in strong competitive positions in most of its major businesses. But he said its Sikorsky division faced difficulties because there had been less consolidation of helicopter manufacturers, so ''there are not enough orders to go around.''Shares of United Technologies declined $2.25 yesterday, to $58.625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/22/nyregion/metro-business-aerospace-unit-to-cut-1500-jobs.html?ref=unitedtechnologiescorporation">Metro Business; Aerospace Unit To Cut 1,500 Jobs<date>Published: September 22, 1999</date><text>United Technologies Corporation, owner of one of the world's top aircraft-engine makers, says it will eliminate 1,500 jobs at its Hamilton Sundstrand unit by the end of next year to cut costs after its purchase of Sundstrand Corporation in June.The majority will be cut at plants in Connecticut and Illinois, which will lose about 600 and 500 jobs, respectively, said John Mayo, a spokesman for Hamilton Sundstrand. The total represents about 8.3 percent of the unit's 18,000 workers.The move is part of a larger reorganization at United Technologies. Its Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft-engine unit said last month that it planned to trim at least 1,500 jobs and move its military jet-engine work to Connecticut from Florida.The moves are intended to help the unit balance a projected decline in aerospace sales and production in the next several years.''The current aerospace and industrial sales declines, as well as an ongoing industry consolidation, are continuing, and we are aggressively reducing our costs to meet these challenges and create a more efficient and integrated company,'' Ron McKenna, the president of Hamilton Sundstrand, said in a statement.United Technologies will reduce the number of electronics aerospace plants in the United States to four from six, the company said.</text></article></page></root>
