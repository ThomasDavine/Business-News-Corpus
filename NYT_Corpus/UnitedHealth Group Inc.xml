The UnitedHealth Group, which is among the industry’s largest companies, reported a robust 10 percent increase in its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, the company said on Wednesday morning. UnitedHealth is the first of the publicly held health insurers to announce its fourth-quarter results. UnitedHealth and the other insurers have been among the beneficiaries of the weak economy. The company has had to pay out fewer medical claims because fewer people have wanted to spend the money to see their doctor or undergo potentially expensive surgery like a knee replacement that could be put off until times are more flush. But analysts say investors may not see the strong results as reason enough to celebrate. The continued debate over the new health care law (to repeal or not to repeal) makes the future for the industry harder to predict, and the new law is expected to make life at least somewhat more difficult for these companies. Bloomberg News provided more detail in an article today.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/nyregion/27cuomo.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Andrew Cuomo’s Record as Attorney General Draws Mixed Views<date>Published: October 26, 2010</date><text>The letter arrived in the New York State attorney general’s office in late 2006 — a desperate note from a woman in Yonkers with ovarian cancer. Her health insurer’s reimbursements were so inexplicably low she was drowning in unexpected bills.Andrew M. Cuomo learned about the woman, Mary Reinbold Jerome, days later, soon after he was sworn in as the state’s 64th attorney general, and he quickly saw that her predicament was part of a much larger problem: more than a dozen large health insurers were routinely using flawed data to shortchange consumers for reimbursements on out-of-network medical costs. Over the next two years, Mr. Cuomo and his staff built cases against 12 companies and won settlements from them totaling $100 million. With that cash, Mr. Cuomo bankrolled what he called a bold experiment to cure a health care system that routinely gouged consumers: five upstate universities would design a new system for determining health care reimbursements, and a new nonprofit organization, not beholden to the insurers’ bottom lines, would operate it. But nearly two years after Mr. Cuomo took credit for ushering in “historic nationwide health insurance reform,” insurance companies are still using the flawed data to set payments to consumers, while the new system is under construction. Almost none of the money won in the settlements went to those who had been undercompensated. And the executive put in charge of monitoring the new reimbursement system — with a fee of $183,000 for what amounts to part-time work — is a handpicked official who had worked for Mr. Cuomo’s father when he was governor. “This is very much a work in progress,” Mr. Cuomo said of his efforts to reshape the reimbursement system. Mr. Cuomo, who succeeded Eliot Spitzer as the state’s top lawyer and is now the Democratic nominee for governor of New York, is widely credited with having built impressively on Mr. Spitzer’s considerable prosecutorial legacy: he recruited top-flight lawyers, like Steven M. Cohen, a former federal prosecutor, and pointed them at cases meant to protect consumers of all kinds, from New Yorkers hounded by unscrupulous debt collectors to college students ill served by the cozy relationships between educational institutions and lenders. Mr. Cuomo’s office also prosecuted one of the most significant public corruption cases in recent state history, exposing and winning the convictions of many of those caught up in a pay-to-play scheme involving millions of dollars of the state’s public pension funds. But the praise is neither universal nor complete, and there are many who assert that Mr. Cuomo has, not unlike his predecessor, been more interested in headlines than in undertaking the tedious chores needed to bring lasting reform, and that he has mishandled, sidestepped or prolonged some public integrity cases. For example, an investigation into whether the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and some public officials violated lobbying laws in their redevelopment efforts is still unresolved after two years. (Mr. Bloomberg last month endorsed Mr. Cuomo’s campaign for governor.) Also cited for criticism is Mr. Cuomo’s handling of an investigation requested by Gov. David A. Paterson into the Paterson administration’s intervention in a domestic violence case involving one of the governor’s aides. At the start of the investigation, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Paterson, both Democrats, were expected to be rivals to run for governor. Mr. Paterson soon dropped his candidacy, but Mr. Cuomo nonetheless appointed a former state judge to take over the politically charged inquiry. “This was his job,” said Lloyd Constantine, a lawyer and friend of Mr. Spitzer who has worked for two former attorneys general. Convinced that political expedience eclipsed duty, Mr. Constantine said: “You’re chief legal attorney of the state. You may not want to do this, but it’s your job.” On Wall Street, where Mr. Spitzer made his mark, making examples out of malefactors, Mr. Cuomo has been chastised by some for going after far fewer individual villains. His office, though, points to some big cases that took on Wall Street practices, like one he brought against the debt-rating agencies and another that forced the underwriters of auction-rate securities to agree to a $60 billion settlement. Mr. Cuomo’s team of lawyers also argue that they have done wonders with the office’s limited criminal powers and a $200 million budget that continues to get lopped by statewide budgetary pressures. “It’s about the cases,” Mr. Cohen said. “That’s become our mantra. We let the cases do the talking.” Mr. Cuomo’s campaign against health insurers over reimbursements, then, appears to underscore what some regard as the office’s strengths and others see as its shortcomings. There is no question the case was ambitious, that the financial settlements were significant, and that the one out of three Americans who buy policies that allow them to go out of network for care may finally get a square deal. But those who were harmed have, for the most part, been left to recoup their money through private lawsuits.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/unitedhealth-said-to-eye-1-5-billion-deal/?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">UnitedHealth Said to Eye $1.5 Billion Deal<date>July 28, 2010, 6:54 am</date><text>UnitedHealth Group is nearing an agreement to buy Executive Health Resources, a medical services firm backed by Abry Partners, for about $1.5 billion, three people with knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg News.

But large employers, as well, are starting to show some interest, and insurers and consultants expect that, over time, businesses of all sizes will gravitate toward these plans in an effort to cut costs. The tradeoff, they say, is that more Americans will be asked to pay higher prices for the privilege of choosing or keeping their own doctors if they are outside the new networks. That could come as a surprise to many who remember the repeated assurances from President Obama and other officials that consumers would retain a variety of health-care choices. But companies may be able to reduce their premiums by as much as 15 percent, the insurers say, by offering the more limited plans. “What we’re seeing is a definite uptick in interest because, quite frankly, affordability is the most pressing agenda item,” said Dr. Sam Ho, the chief medical officer for UnitedHealth’s health-care plans. Many insurers also expect the plans to be popular with individuals and small businesses who will purchase coverage in the insurance exchanges, or marketplaces that are mandated under the new health care law and scheduled to take effect in 2014. Tens of millions of everyday Americans will buy their coverage through those exchanges, a vast pool of new customers, including many of the previously uninsured, whom insurers expect will be willing to accept restrictions to get a better deal. “What this does is eliminate the Gucci doctors,” said Peter Skoda, the controller of the Haro Bicycle Corporation, a Vista, Calif., business that employs 30 people. Facing a possible 35 percent increase in its rates, Haro switched to an Aetna plan that prevents employees from seeing doctors at two medical groups affiliated with the Scripps Health system in San Diego. If employees go to one of the excluded doctors, they are responsible for paying the whole bill. “There wasn’t any pushback,” Mr. Skoda said. Haro’s employees are generally young and healthy, he said, and they rarely go to the doctor. Instead, they want to make sure they have adequate coverage if they go to the emergency room. The company’s premiums average $433 a month, Mr. Skoda said, with employees paying one-fourth of the expense. A few employees opted for more traditional coverage, enabling them to go where they please. But they are paying significantly higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs that could add thousands of dollars to their medical bills. The last time health insurers and employers sought to sharply limit patients’ choice was back in the early 1990s, when insurers tried to reinvent themselves by embracing managed care. Instead of just paying doctor and hospital bills, insurers also assumed a greater role in their customers’ medical care by restricting what specialists they could see or which hospitals they could go to. “Back in the H.M.O. days, it was tight networks, and it did save money,” said Ken Goulet, an executive vice president at WellPoint, one of the nation’s largest private health insurers, which is experimenting with re-introducing the idea in California. The concept was largely abandoned after the consumer backlash persuaded both employers and health plans that Americans were simply not willing to sacrifice choice. Prominent officials like Mr. Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton learned to utter the word “choice” at every turn as advocates of overhauling the system. But choice — or at least choice that will not cost you — is likely to be increasingly scarce as health insurers and employers scramble to find ways of keep premiums from becoming unaffordable. Aetna, Cigna, the UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint are all trying out plans with limited networks. The size of these networks is typically much smaller than traditional plans. In New York, for example, Aetna offers a narrow-network plan that has about half the doctors and two-thirds of the hospitals the insurer typically offers. People enrolled in this plan are covered only if they go to a doctor or hospital within the network, but insurers are also experimenting with plans that allow a patient to see someone outside the network but pay much more than they would in a traditional plan offering out-of-network benefits. The insurers are betting these plans will have widespread appeal in the insurance exchanges as individuals gravitate toward the least expensive options. “We think it’s going to grow to be quite a hit over the next few years,” said Mr. Goulet of WellPoint.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/health/14diabetes.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">An Insurer’s New Approach to Diabetes<date>Published: April 13, 2010</date><text>This could be one glimpse of the future of health insurance.The UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest health insurers, is teaming up with the Y.M.C.A. and retail pharmacies to try a new approach to one of the nation’s most serious and expensive medical problems: Type 2 diabetes. Rather than simply continuing to pay ever-higher medical claims to care for its diabetic customers, UnitedHealth is paying the Y.M.C.A. and pharmacists to keep people healthier. The result, they hope, will be lower costs and lower premiums for everyone. The insurer will announce on Wednesday that it will work with Y “lifestyle coaches” in seven cities to help people who are at risk for diabetes lower their odds of developing the disease by losing just a modest amount of weight. The Y already offers a program that has had success in clinical tests of such efforts, in 16-week programs that help people learn to eat better and exercise. The announcement is planned for a conference on diabetes being held this week in Kansas City, Mo., by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will also discuss a complementary effort by the C.D.C. to finance the Y programs in 10 additional locations around the country. The C.D.C. locations have not yet been chosen. The UnitedHealth effort is an example of the new role health insurers may take on after enactment of the federal health care law, as insurance companies are forced to cover people regardless of their medical condition. It is also a response to a growing demand by employers that insurers do more to manage health costs, beyond collecting premiums and paying doctors. An estimated 25 million people in this country have Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, which generally develops in adults as a result of obesity and poor diet. An additional 60 million people — one in four adults — are considered pre-diabetic and at high risk for developing the disease. By one estimate, the cost of treating both diabetes and pre-diabetes exceeds $200 billion a year. “This is an enormous problem,” said Dr. Ann Albright, who is overseeing the C.D.C.’s diabetes efforts. “Our data tells us it’s getting worse.” In a related effort aimed at people who are already diabetic, UnitedHealth plans to pay Walgreens pharmacists in the same seven cities to help teach people to better manage their conditions. The insurer says it hopes to expand the program to other pharmacy chains interested in providing education and counseling to diabetic individuals. UnitedHealth plans to introduce the program in Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton, Ohio, and in Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Phoenix and Tucson. It will be available at no cost to participants, and will be open to adults who are enrolled in health plans the company offers through employers. People eligible for the program in several of those cities could include some employees of General Electric, which has 304,000 workers worldwide. The company praised the program for looking beyond the 15 minutes that a patient typically spends with a doctor during an office visit, discussing a drug or treatment. Instead of focusing on paying for health care, said Dr. Robert Galvin, G.E.’s chief medical officer, “this is very emblematic of thinking about health.” UnitedHealth expects eventually to offer the program through other insurers and to people enrolled in its private Medicare and Medicaid plans. One insurer, Medica, a large Minneapolis health plan, has already signed on for its 600,000 members in Minnesota. UnitedHealth said it was investing tens of millions of dollars in this initiative, helping the Y develop an online curriculum and collect the data necessary to track the progress of the people enrolled in the program. The company says it will use its own data about the health of its members to identify people who are pre-diabetic and may not know it — and then tell them about the program. “This will absolutely pay for itself,” said Dr. Deneen Vojta, a senior executive at UnitedHealth. Both UnitedHealth and the C.D.C. want to expand on the success of a clinically proved program that has been offered by the Y. Based on evidence drawn from that program, people who are pre-diabetic and lose just 5 percent of their body weight can reduce their chances of developing the disease by almost 60 percent. The C.D.C. is also considering ways to encourage organizations beside the Y to develop similar programs. In the Y programs, UnitedHealth will pay on the basis of how many people participate as well as how much weight the people in the programs lose. After undergoing a more intensive 16-week course, individuals will participate in a yearlong maintenance course. “We have the experience,” said Neil Nicoll, the chief executive of the Y.M.C.A. of the USA, a federation of 2,700 Ys across the country whose goal is to develop more programs related to chronic disease like diabetes. “We’ve proven the model. We’ve proven that we can do it at substantially less cost.” For Marilyn Schenetzke, a retired 67-year-old who lives in Carmel, a suburb of Indianapolis, the Y course succeeded where other weight-loss programs had failed. At 5-foot-6, Ms. Schenetzke weighed 227 pounds. She had developed gestational diabetes, a temporary condition, when she was pregnant. And her grandfather was diabetic. In reading about diabetes, she realized she was at risk for developing the Type 2 version. And yet, she said, “my doctors had never said one word about it.” 1 2 Next Page »This could be one glimpse of the future of health insurance.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/health/policy/07health.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Obama Wields Analysis of Insurers in Health Battle<date>Published: March 6, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — To bolster the case for a far-reaching overhaul of the health care system, the Obama administration is seizing on a new analysis by Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, recommending that investors buy shares in two big insurance companies, the UnitedHealth Group and Cigna, because insurance rates are up sharply and competition is down.White House officials on Saturday said that the Goldman Sachs analysis would be a “centerpiece” of their closing argument in the push for major health care legislation. The president and Democratic Congressional leaders are hoping to win passage of the legislation before the Easter recess. Republicans remain fiercely opposed to the bill. The Goldman Sachs analysis shows that while insurers can be aggressive in raising prices, they also walk away from clients because competition in the industry is so weak, the White House said. And officials will point to a finding that rate increases ran as high as 50 percent, with most in “the low- to mid-teens” — far higher than overall inflation. The analysis could be a powerful weapon for the White House because it offers evidence that an overhaul of the health care system is needed not only to help cover the millions of uninsured but to prevent soaring health care expenses from undermining the coverage that the majority of Americans already have through employers. Republicans, however, could also point to the analysis as bolstering their contention that Democrats should be focused more on controlling costs and less on broadly expanding coverage to the uninsured. The research brief is largely based on a recent conference call with Steve Lewis, an industry expert with Willis, a major insurance broker. In the call, Mr. Lewis noted that “price competition is down from a year ago” and explained that his clients — mostly midsize employers seeking to buy health coverage for their employees — were facing a tough market, in which insurance carriers are increasingly willing to abandon existing customers to improve their profit margins. “We feel this is the most challenging environment for us and our clients in my 20 years in the business,” Mr. Lewis said, according to a transcript included in the Goldman brief. “Not only is price competition down from a year ago,” he added, “but trend or (health care) inflation is also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem more willing than ever to walk away from existing business resulting in some carrier changes.” The report also indicated that employers are reducing benefit levels, in some cases by adding deductibles for prescription drug coverage in addition to co-payments, and raising other out-of-pocket costs for employees as a way of lowering the cost of insurance without increasing annual premiums and employee contributions to them. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, is expected to discuss the Goldman analysis on two Sunday television talk shows, “Meet the Press” on NBC and “This Week” on ABC. In his call with Goldman, Mr. Lewis said beneficiaries were feeling the brunt of the changes to existing policies. “Visually to employees, they’re fairly significant,” he said. But the report also sounded cautionary notes that the administration will probably not want to highlight. Asked by Goldman analysts about the effort to pass major health care legislation, Mr. Lewis said many employers experiencing increases in their insurance costs were nonetheless apprehensive about the president’s proposal. “They’re very mixed in their reaction, quite candidly consistent with what we’re seeing in the polling numbers by party lines,” Mr. Lewis said. “I think most people would acknowledge that there’s a need for health care reform; employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look at what the Obama administration and the Democratic majority state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and rail at what may be termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that message and have much of that frustration and anger at our lack of solutions.” And yet, he said, there is little enthusiastic support from employers for the Democrats’ proposals. “Many of them still view the legislation and the partisanship coming out of Washington as possibly the medicine worse than the disease,” he said. “So many employer groups that we’re talking to feel like it would be a shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to health care reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe nothing is better than something in this current environment.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/have-a-medical-question-text-a-group-of-doctors/?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Have a Medical Question? Text a Group of Doctors<date>February 3, 2010, 5:45 pm</date><text>Patients, journalists, financial analysts, pharmaceutical executives and doctors could at times benefit from having a panel of physicians to whom they could pose questions. Truth On Call, a San Francisco start-up, assembles such a group virtually, by letting people text questions to physicians and then collecting the doctors’ responses. The paid service, rolled out in January, is now open to members of the media, health care industry and financial firms. Truth On Call plans to offer the service to patients in a few months and, later on, to caregivers in developing countries who are seeking advice from doctors in the United States. Those asking questions pay a minimum of $50 to ask one question of one doctor, though at this point it is only open to those who want to pose questions to large groups, because of the cost to the company. Truth On Call taps into the phenomenon that differentiates Twitter from other online communication tools — the ability to ask a question of a broad, unknown audience and see what comes back. Some doctors, for example, have used Twitter to pose questions about a perplexing case and get responses from doctors they do not know. “Information is being exchanged very, very quickly in people’s personal and professional lives, but health care has yet to tap into the feed,” said Rosina Samadani, who founded the company. “This is a way for folks to get answers from thousands of physicians within minutes or hours.” Dr. Samadani — who has been a health care consultant for 12 years at McKinsey and Capella Advisors, a firm she started — hopes to eventually use Truth On Call to connect doctors in developing countries with those in the United States. Someone in rural India, for example, could get real-time advice about a patient from a group of doctors in the United States. Doctors sign up to participate at Truth On Call’s Web site. The company verifies that the physician is registered with the federal database of doctors who can prescribe medicine and verifies identity by sending a text message to his or her cellphone. Doctors receive $10 for each question they answer, and Truth On Call will send the checks to their address or to a charity of their choosing. Reporters have asked doctors about their views on the health care bill, for example, or queried neurosurgeons on whether they limit their own cellphone usage because of concern about effects on the brain. A pharmaceutical company has asked gynecologists whether a competitor’s ad has affected which birth control pill they prescribe, and a financial firm considering an acquisition of a company that makes a gastroparesis drug asked intensive care doctors how pressing an issue gastroparesis was. The fees for asking questions can quickly add up. Texting 100 doctors with a 24-hour response time costs $5,000, covering the doctors’ $10 fees plus text-messaging fees and payment to Truth On Call. That might work for big companies, but it could make the service prohibitively expensive for patients to use, unless they ask questions of just a few doctors. Other tech start-ups have developed less expensive ways for patients to see doctors virtually. For example, American Well and UnitedHealth Group’s OptumHealth division offer 10-minute, one-on-one doctor visits over video chat for $45.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/have-a-medical-question-text-a-group-of-doctors/?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Have a Medical Question?

Multimedia Enlarge This Image Mark Graham for The New York Times A screen shot of that exam, which is not of an actual patient. Dr. Crow says the NowClinic system allows him to pick up on nonverbal cues, similar to an in-person visit. OptumHealth, a division of UnitedHealth Group, the nation’s largest health insurer, plans to offer NowClinic, a service that connects patients and doctors using video chat, nationwide next year. It is introducing it state by state, starting with Texas, but not without resistance from state medical associations. OptumHealth believes NowClinic will improve health care by ameliorating some of the stresses on the system today, like wasted time dealing with appointments and insurance claims, a shortage of primary care physicians and limited access to care for many patients. But some doctors worry that the quality of care that patients receive will suffer if physicians neglect one of the most basic elements of health care: a physical exam. “This is a pale imitation of a doctor visit,” said David Himmelstein, a primary care doctor and associate professor at Harvard Medical School. “It’s basically saying, ‘We’re going to give up any pretense of examining the patient and most of the nonverbal clues that doctors use.’ ” Others, including Rashid Bashshur, director of telemedicine at the University of Michigan Health System, say online medicine is a less expensive way of providing routine care. “The argument that you need the ‘laying on of hands’ to practice medicine is an old and tired argument that simply has no credibility,” he said. “There are two constants in medicine: change and resistance to change.” Christopher Crow, a family physician in Plano, Tex., who used the system during its test period, said, “NowClinic gives you the ability to have that gut feel if something is wrong, in tone or facial expression or body language, that you have when you walk in the door with a patient.” Many patients who do not have primary care physicians nearby use the emergency room for routine problems. Wait times for patients needing immediate attention have increased 40 percent, in part because of overcrowding, according to a study by Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance. In Texas, 180 counties do not have enough physicians, 70 percent of patients cannot obtain a same-day visit with their primary care doctor, and 79 percent of emergency room visits are for routine problems, according to OptumHealth. “We are, through this technology, replenishing the pool of physicians and making them available to patients,” said Roy Schoenberg, chief executive of American Well, which created the system that OptumHealth is using. For $45, anyone in Texas can use NowClinic, whether or not they are insured, by visiting NowClinic.com. Doctors hold 10-minute appointments and can file prescriptions, except for controlled substances. Eventually they will be able to view patients’ medical histories if they are available. The introduction of NowClinic will be the first time that online care has been available nationwide, regardless of insurance coverage. American Well’s service is also available to patients in Hawaii and Minnesota, through Blue Cross Blue Shield, and to some members of the military seeking mental health care, through TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Some hospitals and technology companies provide similar services on a smaller scale, including Cisco, the networking equipment maker, which uses its videoconferencing technology to remotely connect employees with doctors. It is working with UnitedHealth Group to offer the service more broadly. The service has encountered resistance in states where it is already available. Texas law requires that before doctors consult with patients or prescribe medicine online or over the phone, they form a relationship through means like a physical examination. The Texas Medical Board, which regulates doctors in the state, is evaluating its telemedicine policies in light of new technologies. But Mari Robinson, executive director of the board, said that an online or telephone exam was inadequate if doctors and patients had not met in person and was “not allowed under our rules.” After American Well’s service began in Hawaii last year, lawmakers passed legislation that allowed doctors and patients to establish a relationship online, though the Hawaii Medical Association opposed the bill. “From our perspective, we still are a little bit concerned that a relationship can be established online with no prior relationship,” said April Troutman Donahue, the association’s executive director. American Well and OptumHealth predict that health care professionals will adapt. “This is new technology, so you have a lot of code written that doesn’t take these medical technologies into account,” said Rob Webb, chief executive of OptumHealth Care Solutions. Many patients seem ready to embrace the new technology. In a recent study, a Harvard research team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center found that patients were comfortable with computers playing a central role in their health care and expected that the Web would substitute for face-to-face doctor visits for routine health problems.

But some doctors worry that the quality of care that patients receive will suffer if physicians neglect one of the most basic elements of health care: a physical exam. “This is a pale imitation of a doctor visit,” said David Himmelstein, a primary care doctor and associate professor at Harvard Medical School. “It’s basically saying, ‘We’re going to give up any pretense of examining the patient and most of the nonverbal clues that doctors use.’ ” Others, including Rashid Bashshur, director of telemedicine at the University of Michigan Health System, say online medicine is a less expensive way of providing routine care. “The argument that you need the ‘laying on of hands’ to practice medicine is an old and tired argument that simply has no credibility,” he said. “There are two constants in medicine: change and resistance to change.” Christopher Crow, a family physician in Plano, Tex., who used the system during its test period, said, “NowClinic gives you the ability to have that gut feel if something is wrong, in tone or facial expression or body language, that you have when you walk in the door with a patient.” Many patients who do not have primary care physicians nearby use the emergency room for routine problems. Wait times for patients needing immediate attention have increased 40 percent, in part because of overcrowding, according to a study by Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance. In Texas, 180 counties do not have enough physicians, 70 percent of patients cannot obtain a same-day visit with their primary care doctor, and 79 percent of emergency room visits are for routine problems, according to OptumHealth. “We are, through this technology, replenishing the pool of physicians and making them available to patients,” said Roy Schoenberg, chief executive of American Well, which created the system that OptumHealth is using. For $45, anyone in Texas can use NowClinic, whether or not they are insured, by visiting NowClinic.com. Doctors hold 10-minute appointments and can file prescriptions, except for controlled substances. Eventually they will be able to view patients’ medical histories if they are available. The introduction of NowClinic will be the first time that online care has been available nationwide, regardless of insurance coverage. American Well’s service is also available to patients in Hawaii and Minnesota, through Blue Cross Blue Shield, and to some members of the military seeking mental health care, through TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Some hospitals and technology companies provide similar services on a smaller scale, including Cisco, the networking equipment maker, which uses its videoconferencing technology to remotely connect employees with doctors. It is working with UnitedHealth Group to offer the service more broadly. The service has encountered resistance in states where it is already available. Texas law requires that before doctors consult with patients or prescribe medicine online or over the phone, they form a relationship through means like a physical examination. The Texas Medical Board, which regulates doctors in the state, is evaluating its telemedicine policies in light of new technologies. But Mari Robinson, executive director of the board, said that an online or telephone exam was inadequate if doctors and patients had not met in person and was “not allowed under our rules.” After American Well’s service began in Hawaii last year, lawmakers passed legislation that allowed doctors and patients to establish a relationship online, though the Hawaii Medical Association opposed the bill. “From our perspective, we still are a little bit concerned that a relationship can be established online with no prior relationship,” said April Troutman Donahue, the association’s executive director. American Well and OptumHealth predict that health care professionals will adapt. “This is new technology, so you have a lot of code written that doesn’t take these medical technologies into account,” said Rob Webb, chief executive of OptumHealth Care Solutions. Many patients seem ready to embrace the new technology. In a recent study, a Harvard research team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center found that patients were comfortable with computers playing a central role in their health care and expected that the Web would substitute for face-to-face doctor visits for routine health problems.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/business/03insure.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Senate Pressing Insurers on the Amount of Premiums They Spend on Care<date>Published: November 2, 2009</date><text>The health insurance industry likes to cite figures showing that 87 cents of every dollar in premiums is spent on medical claims.

Instead, as little as 66 cents of each dollar paid in premiums goes toward doctor and hospital bills, while the rest covers administrative expenses, marketing and company profits, according to the analysis. The data come from an analysis of regulatory filings by the Senate Commerce Committee from the largest for-profit companies, including WellPoint, the UnitedHealth Group, Aetna and Cigna. They spent about 74 cents out of every dollar on medical care in the individual market, according to the information released by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat, who is chairman of the commerce committee. The insurers “need to tell us how they are spending their customers’ money,” Mr. Rockefeller said in a statement he released on Monday along with the committee’s analysis. “Are they spending it to make people well when they are sick and keep them healthy?” he asked. “Or is the money they charge going to profits, to executive salaries, and to figuring out how to deny care to people when they really need it?” The question of how much money insurers should spend paying medical claims is part of the health care debate in Congress. The legislation that may reach the House floor later this week would initially require insurers to spend at least 85 cents of every dollar in premiums on medical claims. Mr. Rockefeller said he planned to push for similar standards in the final legislation the Senate was now trying to merge from two separate bills. The percentage of premiums spent on medical claims is known in industry jargon as the “medical loss ratio.” According to the Senate analysis, the for-profit insurers’ average ratio in 2008 was 84 percent in policies offered to large employers, and 80 percent for small employers  those businesses with 50 or fewer workers. Individuals and small businesses have long complained they get less value for their money. But insurance companies generally do not disclose how much they spend in different segments of the market. The Senate analysis of the figures does not include information from California, because that state’s filings are not available through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In a letter containing the analysis sent to one of the insurers, Cigna, on Monday, Mr. Rockefeller accused the company of not fully disclosing its spending to regulators. “I believe insurers have an obligation to use consumers’ premium dollars in a way that maximizes the benefit to their policyholders,” he wrote. “I also believe that consumers have the right to know what insurance companies are doing with their money.” He wrote that Cigna “appears to have flouted these requirements and made it more difficult for regulators and consumers to hold you accountable for your conduct.” A Cigna spokesman said that the insurer was looking into the senator’s concerns, but that it had already provided Mr. Rockefeller with information that indicated it spent 93 cents out of every dollar it collected from individuals on medical claims. “Cigna always strives to submit its state insurance regulatory filings timely, accurately and in the manner required by state regulators,” the company said in a statement. Mr. Rockefeller, in his letter, said that an individual shopping for a health insurance policy would benefit from information about the relative value of the plans available, just as someone purchasing a car finds information about gas mileage helpful in choosing models. The insurance industry’s trade group, America’s Health Insurance Plans, said Monday that the 87-cent figure it cited as the industry average was based on information collected by the federal government and was an accurate reflection of how much of each dollar in premiums was spent on medical claims. The group supports widespread disclosure of these ratios but said it was opposed to legislation that would require insurers to spend a specific amount on medical claims. And a spokesman for the group argued that the figures were not a measure of how efficient or effective an individual health plan might be. “Having these arbitrary caps will undermine other reform efforts to improve patient care and cut health care costs,” including disease management programs and spending on technology that could not be counted toward medical claims spending said the spokesman, Robert Zirkelbach. In his statement, Mr. Rockefeller said the committee’s analysis “reveals that while health care costs are spiraling upwards, consumers are paying more and getting less, and the insurance industry doesn’t want anyone to know what they are up to.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 3, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.The health insurance industry likes to cite figures showing that 87 cents of every dollar in premiums is spent on medical claims.

Sure enough, he and Wall Street would end the decade in ruin. Back East, the financier Saul Steinberg celebrated his 50th birthday in 1989 with a $1 million party in the Hamptons. “Honey, if this moment were a stock, I’d short it,” he said when toasting his wife. He would soon suffer a stroke and see his company go bankrupt. Steinberg sold his vast New York apartment to the private equity titan Stephen Schwarzman. In February 2007, Schwarzman marked his 60th birthday with a highly visible multimillion-dollar bacchanal in the Park Avenue Armory. Though Schwarzman hasn’t suffered much since  he is tied for 50th on the new Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans  his bash presaged the bust to come. He became, as James Stewart wrote in The New Yorker, “the designated villain of an era on Wall Street  an era of rapacious capitalists and heedless self-indulgence.” It’s in this context that you have to wonder what some of the Obama era’s most moneyed and White House-connected lobbyists were thinking as they preened before a Washington Post reporter recently for two lengthy articles. We’re not even nine months into the new administration, yet these swaggering, utterly un-self-aware influence peddlers seem determined to prove that nothing except the party affiliations has changed in the Beltway’s pay-for-play culture since Tom DeLay. If these lobbyists were stocks, I’d short them. One of the articles focused on Heather Podesta  “The It Girl of a New Generation of Lobbyists”  who lobbies for health care players like Eli Lilly, HealthSouth and Cigna. Podesta is half of what The Post has called a “mega-lobbying” couple. Her husband, with his own separate (and larger) lobbying shop, is Tony Podesta, the brother of John Podesta, the Clinton White House chief of staff who ran the Obama transition. Back in November, Tony Podesta told The Times that only “very unsophisticated” clients would hire his firm because of his brother’s role in assembling the new administration. That encyclopedic and ever-expanding list of “unsophisticated” clients includes Amgen and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity  and that’s just among the A’s. His business was up 57 percent from last year in the first six months of 2009. Heather Podesta’s was up 65 percent. When we first meet Heather Podesta in The Post, she is being bussed on the cheek by Charles Rangel at his August birthday party at New York’s Tavern on the Green. In keeping with the usual pattern of blowback, it took only one day after the article appeared for The Times to report that Rangel, the ethically challenged chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was guilty of yet another lapse: He’d neglected to list at least $500,000 in assets on his 2007 Congressional disclosure form. As if that were not karmic retribution enough, Tavern on the Green filed for bankruptcy just days after that. The second Post article, on the front page two weeks ago, described the scene, as well as the rabbit ragu, at Ristorante Tosca, the lobbyists’ hangout on F Street in downtown Washington. The Post did not mention that it is just four blocks away from the location of the now defunct Signatures, the restaurant whose owner, Jack Abramoff, was the go-to fixer of the DeLay “K Street project” before scandal brought him down. The stars of Tosca’s “Power Section,” we learned, include the Podestas, Tom Daschle (“not technically a registered lobbyist” but, as The Post put it, “a ‘special policy adviser’  wink wink”) and Steve Elmendorf (who “eats lunch out only at Tosca”). Elmendorf was chief of staff to the former Democratic House leader Dick Gephardt. A quick visit to opensecrets.org reveals that Elmendorf Strategies’ client list includes Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, among other players in the coming battle over financial regulation reform. Then again, as The Nation details in its current issue, Gephardt has also lobbied for Goldman, among many other corporate clients in opposition to the populist policies he once championed. Barack Obama promised a change from this revolving-door, behind-closed-doors collaboration between special interests and government. He vowed to “do our business in the light of day”  with health care negotiations broadcast on C-Span  and to “restore the vital trust between people and their government.” He said, “I intend to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over.” That those lobbyists would so extravagantly flaunt their undiminished role shows just how little they believe that a new sheriff has arrived in Dodge. In his scathing Wall Street Journal column on The Post articles last week, Thomas Frank crystallized the gap between Obama’s pledge and this reality. “There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery’s version of the Barack Obama ‘Hope’ poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.” That’s no joke: It was donated by Tony and Heather Podesta. Obama’s promise to make Americans trust the government again was not just another campaign bullet point; it’s the foundation of his brand of governance and essential to his success in office. At the first anniversary of the TARP bailout of the banks, we can see how far he has to go. Americans’ continued suspicion that Washington is in cahoots with powerful interests in joints like Tosca is contributing to their confusion and skepticism about what’s happening out of view in the battle over health care reform. The public is not wrong. The administration’s legislative deals with the pharmaceutical companies were made in back rooms. Business Week reported in early August that the UnitedHealth Group and its fellow insurance giants had already quietly rounded up moderate Democrats in the House to block any public health care option that would compete with them for business. UnitedHealth’s hired Beltway gunslingers include both Elmendorf Strategies and Daschle, a public supporter of the public option who nonetheless does some of his “wink, wink” counseling for UnitedHealth. The company’s in-house lobbyist is a former chief of staff to Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader. Gephardt consults there too. But it’s not as if the Republicans now have the public’s back. DeLay may be reduced these days to violating public taste rather than the public trust on “Dancing With the Stars,” but back on Capitol Hill, his successors keep the K Street faith. In their campaign to kill the public option, G.O.P. leaders often cite data from the Lewin Group, a research company, which has projected that 88 million Americans might quit their private insurance plans if given a government alternative. (The Congressional Budget Office puts the figure at the far less earthshaking 10 to 11 million.) Lewin, which repeatedly insists it’s still a nonpartisan outfit, was actually bought by a subsidiary of UnitedHealth in 2007. The Huffington Post reported in August that John Boehner and Eric Cantor  who use Lewin’s findings to scare voters about a “government takeover” of health care  are big recipients of UnitedHealth campaign cash. Next up will be the overhaul of financial regulations. With job seekers now outnumbering job openings 6 to 1 in America, many still wonder why most of the big-dog culprits who helped speed the national meltdown  from lying and gambling bankers to shyster subprime mortgage packagers to executives at delinquent ratings agencies  have not shared their pain. In his speech marking the anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ failure, Obama chastised Wall Street for having taken irresponsible risks. But of course it is already back doing exactly that. Meanwhile, we’re hearing of behind-the-scenes Congressional softening of perhaps the most promising component of the White House’s modest financial regulatory package, a Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Real-estate brokerages are being exempted from its purview, and banks will not be required to offer “plain vanilla” mortgages. As in health care, the question of what the White House will really fight for in financial reform remains open. While the ostentatious daily predators’ ball at Ristorante Tosca is a bad omen, we don’t know yet whether that omen is for the lobbyists, or the Obama administration, or both. This is history that the president still has the power to write. It will be written in the bills he will or won’t sign into law. We can only hope that he learned an important lesson from his stunning failure to secure Olympic gold for his political home of Chicago last week. If the Olympic committee has the audacity to stand up to a lobbyist as powerful as the president of the United States, then surely the president of the United States can stand up to the powerful interests angling to defeat his promise of reform.

The procedures are rendered suspect by conflicts of interest and look as if they have been manipulated to shortchange patients by hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade. A tough settlement negotiated between New York’s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, and the UnitedHealth Group early this year will clean up much of the mess  not only in New York but in other states as well. Still, there are loose ends that need attention, so it is helpful that the Senate commerce committee has held two hearings to explore the need to expand and secure what Mr. Cuomo has achieved. The hearings were a useful reminder of how badly the industry behaved in using a UnitedHealth subsidiary to calculate the “reasonable and customary” charges by physicians in a particular region. When patients leave the network, insurers typically pay about 70 percent of these charges and the patient pays the remaining 30 percent  plus any additional amount charged by a doctor above the supposedly reasonable charge. Linda Lacewell, who led Mr. Cuomo’s investigation, testified that the industry engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices to understate the “reasonable and customary” rate and thus keep its reimbursements low. Although the industry denies any such wrongdoing, UnitedHealth agreed to cough up $350 million to settle a class-action suit and agreed to shift responsibility for the calculations to an independent nonprofit organization. Eleven insurers, including some of the largest, have agreed to help finance the new database and use its findings wherever they operate. That should go a long way toward cleaning up dubious practices, and New York is working on a new regulation to codify what insurers must do. But New York’s settlement won’t reach all insurers in all states. The Senate commerce committee will need to explore what further steps may be required to force insurers to use either the new database or some other measure that is reliable and free of conflicts of interest. All insurers should enable customers to determine, in advance, how much they will have to pay for services outside their network. More Articles in Opinion » A version of this article appeared in print on April 8, 2009, on page A24 of the New York edition.There has been a justifiable cloud in recent years over the way the insurance industry decides how much to pay for the services of doctors who are outside a company’s network. The procedures are rendered suspect by conflicts of interest and look as if they have been manipulated to shortchange patients by hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade. A tough settlement negotiated between New York’s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, and the UnitedHealth Group early this year will clean up much of the mess  not only in New York but in other states as well. Still, there are loose ends that need attention, so it is helpful that the Senate commerce committee has held two hearings to explore the need to expand and secure what Mr. Cuomo has achieved. The hearings were a useful reminder of how badly the industry behaved in using a UnitedHealth subsidiary to calculate the “reasonable and customary” charges by physicians in a particular region. When patients leave the network, insurers typically pay about 70 percent of these charges and the patient pays the remaining 30 percent  plus any additional amount charged by a doctor above the supposedly reasonable charge. Linda Lacewell, who led Mr. Cuomo’s investigation, testified that the industry engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices to understate the “reasonable and customary” rate and thus keep its reimbursements low. Although the industry denies any such wrongdoing, UnitedHealth agreed to cough up $350 million to settle a class-action suit and agreed to shift responsibility for the calculations to an independent nonprofit organization. Eleven insurers, including some of the largest, have agreed to help finance the new database and use its findings wherever they operate. That should go a long way toward cleaning up dubious practices, and New York is working on a new regulation to codify what insurers must do. But New York’s settlement won’t reach all insurers in all states. The Senate commerce committee will need to explore what further steps may be required to force insurers to use either the new database or some other measure that is reliable and free of conflicts of interest. All insurers should enable customers to determine, in advance, how much they will have to pay for services outside their network.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01health.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Health Insurers, Poised for Round 2<date>Published: February 28, 2009</date><text>GO ahead, take a guess: Which company has developed a 2,000-page strategic plan and gathers its senior executives almost every other working day to talk about how well they are doing?

The answer is Aetna, the Hartford-based company that is one of the nation’s largest health insurers. Almost every business in the country is feeling buffeted by the recession. But for health insurance companies, the bleak economy is only part of the problem: the changing of the guard in Washington is an equal if not more dangerous threat. Together, these forces could deal a body blow to a business model that was already teetering. Health plans are losing millions of members who say they can no longer afford their products. Some big employers are becoming increasingly frustrated  and vocal  about how much they spend on health benefits. Smaller ones are being crushed by ever-rising health care costs. On top of that, the Republicans who pushed to expand the role of private players in the health care system have largely been replaced by Democrats who want to overhaul it. As the conversation intensifies in Washington about health care reform, no one knows for sure what role the insurance industry will play in a revamped system. President Obama, along with the Democratic majorities in Congress, may simply rewrite the rules, forcing insurers to take all comers as customers, including those who previously would have been rejected because of poor health. The government may sharply cut how much it pays insurers to take care of the elderly. And, in what some people say would be a clear step toward a government-run system, there is even discussion about expanding the Medicare program, now limited to the elderly and the disabled, so that anyone could enroll in it. Whatever the path, President Obama has made clear that changes are coming. “We can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold,” he said in his address last week to Congress. Later in the week, he outlined a plan to slash billions in payments now going to insurers. The insurers are “as vulnerable politically as they have been in the last 10 to 15 years,” said Sheryl R. Skolnick, an analyst at CRT Capital Holdings in Stamford, Conn. Given the current sentiment, the insurers understand that they won’t be able to beat back all efforts at sweeping change, as they did so successfully during the Clinton administration. Instead, they are scrambling to make sure they are not perceived as obstructing the goal of making the country’s health care more affordable and accessible. “We have to transform the system,” said Ronald A. Williams, Aetna’s chairman and chief executive, who has been among the most outspoken in supporting significant changes. “There’s a huge opportunity.” Stephen J. Hemsley, the chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, another large insurer, based near Minneapolis, said his company “was open to reform.” “The issue is around how,” he said. Insurers, of course, are eager to influence the debate, and the industry trade association offered its own proposals last year. They include some important concessions, including the idea of requiring insurers to cover everyone. The insurers have also been participating in groups discussing what changes are necessary, and have been taking part in closed-door discussions with members of the staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, about reaching a consensus on how Congress should proceed. Of course, any drop in the number of uninsured, now 46 million, could translate into more paying customers. Under the stimulus bill signed into law last month, for example, the government provides for significant subsidies to help more people afford to keep employer-based coverage once they lose their jobs. But the industry faces a more profound challenge: to prove to its customers  and to the government  that it is more than a middleman between the doctors and hospitals providing the care and those who pay for it. “The health plans are going into a very dangerous time because many of them have destroyed the perception of value they were trying to create,” Ms. Skolnick said. BEFORE the last year or so, health insurers were thriving. By assembling large networks of hospitals and doctors, the insurers negotiated steep discounts and still offered patients a choice of where to go for care. After flirting with managed care in the early 1990s to reduce costs, the insurers largely abandoned those efforts after patients and doctors complained. Although health care costs have continued to climb faster than inflation, insurers were typically able to pass along the increases to employers or individuals. With the Congressional overhaul of the Medicare program in 2003, the industry won an important source of additional business. Insurers who enrolled the elderly in private health plans were paid about 14 percent more than the government typically spent under traditional Medicare for service that at times was nearly identical. UnitedHealth, for one, seized this opportunity, signing up 1.7 million members in its Medicare Advantage plans. But in trying to bring down health care costs, Congress and the White House are likely to stop being so generous. In a television interview in January, Mr. Obama described the industry’s participation in Medicare as an example of government programs “that don’t work.” 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 1, 2009, on page BU1 of the New York edition.GO ahead, take a guess: Which company has developed a 2,000-page strategic plan and gathers its senior executives almost every other working day to talk about how well they are doing?

Test Health Care Plan<date>Published: February 6, 2009</date><text>Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio UnitedHealth Group International Business Machines Corporation Go to your Portfolio » Try, try again. The giant insurer UnitedHealth Group is testing a new model of health care that many policy experts say holds great promise but has yet to prove itself. An earlier trial of the model by UnitedHealth, in Florida, never got off the ground because doctors refused to participate. This time, however, the insurer is teaming up with seven doctors’ groups to make another attempt, in Arizona, at the prodding of one of the state’s big employers, I.B.M. UnitedHealth will try giving doctors more authority and money than usual in return for closely monitoring their patients’ progress, even when patients go to specialists or require hospitalization. The insurer will also move away from paying doctors solely on the basis of how many services they provide, and will start rewarding them more for the overall quality of care patients receive. The new approach, which is also being tested in various guises by other insurers around the country, is known as the “medical home” model of health care. Many experts hope it will prove one of the best ways to rein in the nation’s runaway medical costs, while making people healthier. The theory is that by providing a home base for patients and coordinating their treatment, doctors can improve care, prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room, reduce hospitalizations and lower overall medical spending. “This gives us the opportunity to create a model to allow family physicians to practice the way we used to practice in the past,” said Dr. Jim Dearing, a family practitioner in Phoenix who is among the physicians who have agreed to participate. In Florida, UnitedHealth tried a similar experiment about a year and a half ago, only to meet resistance from doctors, who thought they were being asked to shoulder much of the burden with no guarantee the experiment would be successful. The insurer did not closely consult with the doctors in designing the pilot program, and the physicians argued that there was not enough help to pay for any necessary changes like improving their computer systems. The doctors would have received more money only if the pilot project achieved its goals. Many Florida doctors said they thought the insurer was asking them to do too much on faith. They were particularly skeptical about working with UnitedHealth, which has a reputation of being a tough negotiator and slow to pay claims. “Physicians really do not like UnitedHealth, so much so they just wouldn’t work with them,” said Dr. Michael Wasylik, a surgeon who is an official with the Florida Medical Association who follows health insurance issues. In Arizona, where UnitedHealth is I.B.M.’s sole health plan, providing coverage for 11,000 of the company’s employees and their dependents, I.B.M. urged the insurer to give medical homes another try. I.B.M., which paid $21 million last year for its Arizona coverage, is among the nation’s employers that have been increasingly vocal about their dissatisfaction with the health system, in which they pay more money each year, regardless of the quality of the care their employees receive. “What we buy is garbage,” said Dr. Paul Grundy, I.B.M.’s director of health care transformation, who has become a major proponent of the medical home concept. In this experiment, UnitedHealth has worked closely with the doctors. And perhaps most importantly, the insurer has agreed to bear some of the initial costs of developing a medical home, including hiring a consultant to advise doctors on how to change their practices. “We learned the hard way,” said Dr. Sam Ho, a chief medical officer for UnitedHealth. “You just can’t hang up a sign.” UnitedHealth has already spent more than $1 million on three medical home experiments this year. The other two are in Colorado and Rhode Island. But the company says the Arizona pilot is getting the bulk of its money and attention. The experiment will initially involve about 7,000 patients who are the patients of 26 doctors at the seven medical groups. I.B.M. employees will be only a small portion of the total, which will also include Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries that UnitedHealth covers in the state. Giving patients a medical home is meant to fix some of the major shortcomings of how health care is delivered and paid for in this country. Insurers now typically reward doctors for how much they do  how many tests or procedures they perform  rather than how effective their care is. Doctors are not paid to help their patients navigate myriad specialists, and no one is held accountable for making sure that patients’ care is available whenever needed. “If the patient can’t get into your office when sick and lands in the emergency room, it doesn’t matter that you did the blood test in your office,” said Dr. Terry McGeeney, the chief executive of the consulting unit hired by UnitedHealth to work with the Arizona practices. The unit is a for-profit business run by the American Academy of Family Physicians. In Arizona, Dr. Dearing and other physicians will work with the consultants to figure out how better to oversee patients with conditions like diabetes. The doctors’ groups selected for the experiment were ones that had already shown signs of being able to function like medical homes. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 7, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio UnitedHealth Group International Business Machines Corporation Go to your Portfolio » Try, try again.

New York State’s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, and UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest health insurers, have agreed to set up a new system for calculating out-of-network payments. UnitedHealth also has agreed to pay $350 million to settle class-action lawsuits brought by the American Medical Association and other groups on behalf of patients and doctors who claimed to be shortchanged for services provided out of network. Before approving the settlement, the courts will have to decide if the amounts agreed to are enough. Typically, when patients use non-network doctors, their insurance company agrees to pay 70 percent to 80 percent of the “reasonable and customary” charges for a given medical service in the same geographic area. If the doctor’s bill is higher than that rate, the patient must make up the difference or the doctor must settle for less. The rub comes in defining what is reasonable and customary. That calculation for most of the industry is made by a company called Ingenix, which conveniently is owned by UnitedHealth. The whole system is rendered suspect by an obvious conflict of interest: If Ingenix pegs the customary rates low, it keeps insurance reimbursements low and shifts more of the cost to the patient. Investigators for Mr. Cuomo contend that UnitedHealth and Ingenix have been manipulating the data through a variety of stratagems to keep the customary rate calculation low  and the insurance payments low. Based on their own data collection and calculations, the investigators estimated that insurers have systematically underpaid New Yorkers for medical services by 10 percent to 28 percent, depending on where they lived. UnitedHealth neither admits nor denies any wrongdoing, but the company does acknowledge the inherent conflict of interest and is paying substantially to put the issue to rest. As a result of the agreement, future reimbursements should be less subject to manipulation and a lot more transparent. UnitedHealth is planning to close its Ingenix databases and shift responsibility to an independent nonprofit organization  possibly a university-level school of public health  that will be the sole arbiter of data collection and calculation methodologies. UnitedHealth will contribute $50 million to help get the new system operating. Aetna has separately agreed to contribute $20 million. Both UnitedHealth and Aetna will use the new database. The new organization will also create a Web site where consumers around the country can find out the prevailing charges for out-of-network medical services in their area.

We urge other big insurers to contribute to this new organization and use the new database. The potentially corrupting influence of industry financing should be mitigated by putting Mr. Cuomo in charge and possibly setting up an endowment to keep the new organization independent. New York’s attorney general deserves thanks for forcing the industry to adopt a fairer and more transparent system for determining out-of-network reimbursements. It has been a long time coming.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio UnitedHealth Group Go to your Portfolio » Not so fast, said one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs. She says the money is not enough and has filed an objection with one of the judges overseeing the cases. “We believe the amount agreed to is inadequate and does not reflect as meaningful a settlement as could be negotiated,” said the lawyer, Barbara Quackenbos, whose firm is one of several handling the cases on behalf of patients and doctors. The UnitedHealth announcement came after a related settlement the company announced earlier this week with New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, in which the company agreed to stop operating the databases used by the insurance industry to calculate payments to patients when they use doctors outside the insurer’s preferred network of physicians. In Thursday’s announcement, UnitedHealth hailed the proposed class-action settlement as resolving numerous lawsuits around the country by patients and doctors claiming that the out-of-network payments were too low for many years. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement that provides closure on these matters,” Mitchell E. Zamoff, a senior lawyer for UnitedHealth, said in a statement. But the objections of Ms. Quackenbos and some of the other lawyers involved make it less clear whether the two federal judges, one in New York and the other in New Jersey, overseeing the lawsuits will approve the settlement as outlined by UnitedHealth. Earlier this year, in a case involving similar issues but a much smaller insurer, Health Net, the same New Jersey judge approved a $255 million settlement. Ms. Quackenbos, whose Woodbridge, N.J., firm Wilentz, Goldman &amp; Spitzer represented plaintiffs in that case, said that by the Health Net standard, the UnitedHealth settlement should be larger than $350 million. The proposed settlement covers three lawsuits against UnitedHealth, including one brought in federal court in New York by the American Medical Association and others. Asked later in the day about the objections of Ms. Quackenbos, the company issued a statement: “This agreement was the product of vigorous arm’s-length negotiations and is supported by the American Medical Association, the Medical Society of New York and experienced class counsel. The New York attorney general commented favorably on the settlement today. We are confident the agreement will be approved by the court.” Mr. Cuomo had indeed referred to the settlement Thursday, as he announced his own agreement with another insurer, Aetna, on the industry database issue. Asked later about the objection of Ms. Quackenbos, he said the exact amount of any settlement was a matter of private litigation and subject to final court approval. Insurers typically agree to pay 70 to 80 percent of the “reasonable and customary” local market rate for out-of-network medical services. An investigation by Mr. Cuomo’s office concluded that the database had understated the true market rates of medical care by up to 28 percent. The proposed settlement with UnitedHealth covers those patients with out-of-network claims and their doctors whose reimbursements were determined using the customary and reasonable rates. If it is approved, the $350 million will be distributed to both patients and doctors, although the details of how the money will be allocated have not been completed. Anyone who is eligible under the settlement will be notified in writing or through advertising, a UnitedHealth spokesman said. Aetna, another big insurer in New York, announced on Thursday an agreement with Mr. Cuomo’s office to contribute $20 million toward the new databases. UnitedHealth has agreed to contribute $50 million. Both have agreed to use the new databases. Mr. Cuomo said he would try to persuade the rest of the insurance industry to support and use the new databases under the independent operator as a way of helping patients in the future. “We will not stop until the entire industry has been reformed in this regard,” he said. Aetna faces some lawsuits over the same issues as UnitedHealth. The company says they are still pending and it plans to defend itself vigorously against the accusations.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio UnitedHealth Group Go to your Portfolio » Not so fast, said one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs. She says the money is not enough and has filed an objection with one of the judges overseeing the cases. “We believe the amount agreed to is inadequate and does not reflect as meaningful a settlement as could be negotiated,” said the lawyer, Barbara Quackenbos, whose firm is one of several handling the cases on behalf of patients and doctors. The UnitedHealth announcement came after a related settlement the company announced earlier this week with New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, in which the company agreed to stop operating the databases used by the insurance industry to calculate payments to patients when they use doctors outside the insurer’s preferred network of physicians. In Thursday’s announcement, UnitedHealth hailed the proposed class-action settlement as resolving numerous lawsuits around the country by patients and doctors claiming that the out-of-network payments were too low for many years. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement that provides closure on these matters,” Mitchell E. Zamoff, a senior lawyer for UnitedHealth, said in a statement.

Cuomo, has ordered an overhaul of the databases the industry uses to determine how much of a medical bill is paid when a patient uses an out-of-network doctor. A statement from Mr. Cuomo’s office said the industry had engaged in “a scheme to defraud consumers” by systematically underpaying the nation’s patients by hundreds of millions of dollars over the last decade. The move, to be announced Tuesday, is part of a settlement with the insurance giant UnitedHealth Group, which operates the industry databases. It results from a yearlong investigation by Mr. Cuomo’s office that concluded the data had understated the true market rates of medical care by up to 28 percent. The settlement will have a nationwide impact because UnitedHealth, the biggest health insurer in New York, operates the databases used by the entire industry, through its Ingenix business unit. The deal calls for creation of a new independent database, to be run by a university that is still to be selected. Because insurers typically reimburse patients for only 70 to 80 percent of the “reasonable and customary” cost of medical services when they visit doctors outside the insurer’s designated network of physicians, the patient can get shortchanged if the insurer understates the prevailing local fees. The patient might receive a doctor’s bill for $100, for example, and expect the insurer to pay at least $70. But if the insurance database says that doctor bill should have been only $72, based on local rates, the patient might get back less than $55. According to Mr. Cuomo, the databases consistently understated the local “reasonable and customary” rates, which Ingenix collects from insurers. The report of the investigation’s findings described the industry calculations as “created in a well of conflicts” that produced information that was “unreliable, inadequate and wrong.” In an interview Monday, Mr. Cuomo said: “For years this database was treated as credible and authoritative, and consumers were left to accept its rates without question. This is like pulling back the curtain on the wizard of Oz. We have now shown that for years consumers were consistently low-balled to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.” UnitedHealth did not acknowledge any wrongdoing and said it stood by the quality of the information in the database. “While questions have been raised about the data itself, this agreement does not address those questions,” said Mitchell E. Zamoff, a senior lawyer for UnitedHealth. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the attorney general that addresses concerns about the independence of the database products and provides increased transparency that will help consumers make more informed decisions about their care.” Under the agreement, UnitedHealth will pay $50 million to finance the creation of the new database, which will be intended to determine the prevailing costs of medical care in specific regions. Although the university to operate that database has not yet been selected, Mr. Cuomo said he would prefer it to be based in New York. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth’s Ingenix unit is allowed to continue running the operations. No criminal charges have been sought in the case. Nor was UnitedHealth required to pay restitution to consumers, although the disputed reimbursements are the subject of class-action lawsuits around the country. The attorney general’s agreement tries to address one of the major frustrations of patients in dealing with health insurers when they use a doctor outside of the insurer’s network: the puzzling gap between a doctor’s bill and what the insurer says it will cover. The inability to decipher the insurer’s calculations can be overwhelming to patients with serious medical conditions. Mary Jerome, a professor at Columbia who was found to have ovarian cancer in 2006, said she had been left with unreimbursed medical bills amounting to tens thousands of dollars. Her complaints to the attorney general’s office helped spur the investigation. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Health » A version of this article appeared in print on January 13, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.In a settlement with one of the nation’s biggest insurers, New York’s attorney general, Andrew M.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio UnitedHealth Group Go to your Portfolio » Called UnitedHealth Continuity, the product is not actual medical insurance, but is aimed at people who may have insurance now but are worried they may lose it  and may not be able to obtain replacement insurance on their own. They may expect to retire early, for example, before they qualify for Medicare. Or they are worried about the possibility of losing their job and their health coverage. People who are already sick will generally not be eligible for the new product. Those who do pass a medical review, will pay 20 percent each month of the current premium on an individual policy to reserve the right to be insured under the plan at some point in the future. “What this product is designed to do, for a very modest premium, is to essentially protect your insurability for the future,” said Richard A. Collins, the president of UnitedHealth’s individual insurance unit, who says he is the first policy holder. His monthly fee is $50. Some health policy experts question whether UnitedHealth Continuity is a good way for consumers to spend their money. They acknowledge that people who are forced to buy insurance on their own face a daunting task. If they are not healthy, such people may find any available coverage too expensive. And most states let insurers refuse to sell new individual policies to anyone with a pre-existing medical condition. But if changes to the health insurance system do occur under the Obama administration, they say, UnitedHealth’s new product may become obsolete. “As an individual, you’re betting against health reform,” said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of national health policy for the Pacific Business Group on Health, a California group of employers who provide health coverage for their workers. Mr. Lee notes that there is serious talk in Washington of having private insurers agree to offer individual coverage to anyone, regardless of their health status. People who choose to pay for the UnitedHealth guarantee could find that the insurance industry will eventually be providing the same thing free. “It’s an attempt to have a market solution to a market failure,” Mr. Lee said. Mr. Collins says he is unconcerned about the possibility of health reform, given the uncertainties surrounding any government efforts. “Until something happens, this is a really good tool,” he said. UnitedHealth, which announced the UnitedHealth Continuity product Tuesday at an investors’ conference in New York, plans to begin promoting it in coming weeks. It is initially available in 25 of the 40 states where UnitedHealth currently sells individual insurance, which do not include New York and New Jersey. The company is applying to sell it in the other 15 states, including Connecticut, where it now sells to individuals. The monthly fees for reserving the right to UnitedHealth’s insurance will vary, depending on people’s age and sex, where they live and how generous a coverage plan they select. A 50-year-old male in Columbus, Ohio, who planned to eventually take an individual policy in which he would be obliged to pay the first $3,500 in medical bills would pay $32 a month for the right to eventually get that coverage  or 20 percent of a policy that now costs $159 a month. But it is uncertain exactly how he much he could end up paying for the guarantee, or for the medical coverage itself in the future. The premiums, and the monthly fees, are likely to increase over time. And people attracted to the new product could eventually develop costly medical ailments, experts say, so enrollees might eventually have to pay higher premiums than people able to join plans open only to the healthy. But UnitedHealth says that the upfront monthly fees it collects could help defray some of those higher medical expenses down the road, if they do occur. People who lose their employer-provided coverage do have other options. Under the federal Cobra law, they can continue their employer-based coverage for a time after losing or leaving their jobs. And some states have insurance programs available even for those who are at risk of incurring high medical bills. Private insurers are increasingly interested in coming up with new plans that offer coverage even to those individuals with pre-existing conditions, said Bob Vineyard, an insurance broker in Atlanta. He said he expected such plans to be introduced next year. There are people for whom the new UnitedHealth Continuity product will make sense, Mr. Vineyard said, like someone who expects to work on contract for employers that offer health benefits but who anticipates gaps in that coverage. But Mr. Vineyard said he did not expect the Continuity plan to have widespread appeal. Many people, he said, especially those who are already struggling in the current economy, may not want to spend the money for the coverage. “I think it’s got very, very limited application,” he said. Some financial planners are also lukewarm to the idea of spending extra money for a guarantee. Neil Brown, a financial planner for Burkett Financial Services in West Columbia, S.C., compared such a purchase to sleeping with a life preserver for fear of drowning. Some advocates for changing the health insurance system say that rather than expecting individuals to spend hundreds of dollars a year for a guarantee they may not need, the government should do more to make sure everyone has access to coverage. “This product is taking advantage of the lack of sensible health reform that could easily solve this problem,” said Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. But Mr. Collins of UnitedHealth argues that Continuity is a way for consumers to make sure they can obtain medical insurance that may be better than anything the government comes up with. “I think it’s a terrific hedge,” he said.

AARP and UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest insurers, have voluntarily suspended sales of the policies, which pay fixed cash benefits  often much less than consumers had expected  for selected services. The investigation will be conducted by Elizabeth Rowe Costle, who was the insurance commissioner of Vermont from 1992 to 2003, when Howard Dean was governor. At issue are insurance plans that were sold by UnitedHealth and carry the AARP brand. More than a million people have bought the policies, which have names like AARP Medical Advantage, Essential Plus and Hospital Indemnity Plan. The senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said marketing of the products was often misleading because it suggested that they offered comprehensive coverage. “In fact,” Mr. Grassley said, “there’s no basic protection against high medical costs. The products may leave consumers seriously in debt if they need intensive medical care.” The criticism is potentially embarrassing to AARP because the organization has long taken pride in its role as a champion of its members and consumers in general. It has criticized “hard-sell tactics” of private insurers and has accused the Bush administration of overstating the value of private health plans offered to Medicare beneficiaries. William D.

Bonnie Burns, an insurance counselor at California Health Advocates, an education and advocacy group, said: “These limited-benefit policies have been a problem for many years. Uninsured people buy them thinking they are equivalent to major medical coverage, but they are not.” For example, one of AARP’s Medical Advantage plans pays a maximum of $5,000 for surgical procedures that may cost two or three times that amount. The marketing materials highlight coverage for relatively low-cost procedures. A consumer guide to AARP’s Medical Advantage plans says they “can be a real lifesaver for early retirees, part-time workers or people who just need to supplement their current health insurance.” Though known in Washington as a potent lobby, AARP is also a huge business that offers travel services, life and homeowner’s insurance, mutual funds and credit cards. Its operating revenue last year was $1.2 billion, more than 40 percent of which came from royalties, according to its 2007 financial statement. Senator Grassley said he wanted AARP to disclose the profits it had made from sales of its limited-benefit insurance products, which are managed by a taxable subsidiary of AARP Inc., the parent organization.

The UnitedHealth Group, which announced disappointing first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, said the weakening economy was causing fewer businesses and employees to sign up for its health insurance. UnitedHealth, whose stock fell sharply on the report, also cut its overall profit outlook for 2008. “We are clearly being impacted by the declining economic outlook,” Stephen J. Hemsley, the company’s chief executive, told investors Tuesday. While he acknowledged the company’s own missteps, Mr. Hemsley said that fewer employers  particularly small businesses  were offering health coverage to their workers, and that when they did, fewer employees were choosing to enroll. As one of the nation’s largest insurers and the first to report earnings this period, UnitedHealth’s results have raised anxiety about the industry’s challenges. While some analysts say UnitedHealth has simply hit a trough in the industry’s normal business cycle, others are worried about more fundamental challenges to the insurance business model. In recent years, despite soaring medical costs, insurers have made big profits by keeping premiums well ahead of health care inflation. But analysts say that business strategy may be reaching its limits, with companies finding it harder to raise prices without losing substantial numbers of customers. “The market is not growing  it’s shrinking,” said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst for CRT Capital Holdings in Stamford, Conn. The market for employer-purchased coverage remains a large one, accounting for 158 million people. But Ms. Skolnick says that UnitedHealth, like many insurers, has priced its product beyond the reach of too many people and is now fighting with its competitors over a shrinking pool of customers. Investors in insurance stocks have been particularly anxious since WellPoint, another big player, warned last month that it expected disappointing first-quarter earnings. UnitedHealth’s profit report on Tuesday, which felt short of expectations, started a sell-off of its shares, which carried over to smaller declines in the stock of competitors like Aetna and WellPoint. Shares of UnitedHealth fell $3.66, or nearly 10 percent, to $34.15, which was near the 52-week low of last month. UnitedHealth earned $994 million, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of $20 billion for the first quarter. Although that was a 5 percent increase in earnings per share over last year, the company cut its 2008 profit outlook by 40 cents, to $3.55 to $3.60 a share. It cited, in part, the decline of its core commercial insurance business, estimating it may lose about 700,000 customers this year. That would reduced its core commercial business to about 10 million insured people. The main issue facing UnitedHealth is how much it can protect its profits as it loses customers for its traditional health insurance. “The issue for them is growth, and where is the growth going to come from?” asked Les Funtleyder, the health care strategist for Miller Tabak &amp; Company, who rates the stock as neutral. Analysts disagree on whether UnitedHealth has already weathered the worst of the business cycle, or is at the onset of what could be two to three years of a difficult environment. Matthew Borsch, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, thinks the competition for customers is likely to make it hard for insurers like UnitedHealth to raise prices. The economy makes it even harder, said Charles Boorady, an analyst with Citigroup Investment Research. But while Mr. Boorady said he expected more earnings disappointments from other insurers  WellPoint is scheduled to report results on Wednesday and Aetna on Thursday  he predicts the cycle will be on the upswing as soon as next year, as profits stabilize. And while he says UnitedHealth’s shares could continue to be a poor performer for a time, he judges them to be cheap at the current price. UnitedHealth has also struggled since the departure of the company’s chief executive, William W. McGuire, who agreed to leave in October 2006 after being caught up in an options trading scandal. The company has received sharp criticism from many of its customers as well as the hospitals and doctors with whom it contracts for care. Regulators are also looking into some of the company’s business practices, including an inquiry by the New York state attorney general into the UnitedHealth unit that helps insurers determine how much of a doctor’s bill to pay. “It’s the litany,” said Ms. Skolnick, who argued that the company has expanded into too many businesses to be well managed. “There’s too much going on.” On Tuesday’s conference call some of the company’s major shareholders raised doubts about some of management’s decisions, arguing that UnitedHealth should pay shareholders a sizable dividend on shares instead of buying it back, or should consider selling some of its businesses that might be worth more as separate companies. “We have not executed well and have not executed well over the last two years,” said Mr. Hemsley, who emphasized that the company would consider a variety of moves. Mr. Boorady said UnitedHealth had not been as receptive as it should be to outside ideas, saying executives were “tone deaf to their customers and their shareholders.” And even if companies like UnitedHealth are not convinced that they need to do anything fundamentally different, Mr. Funtleyder said, there is a chance that the politicians will. For the insurers, that might not be a bad thing, he said. A new administration in Washington could decide to address the increasing number of uninsured Americans by asking the private insurers to play a role. The companies would benefit from a new pool of potential customers. “The hail Mary may be that we turn to some sort of universal care,” he said. Still, he recommends holding off on buying shares since he, too, thinks that there could be a tougher environment ahead. “There’s no sense in buying now if there’s more risk to come,” he said.

A crucial drug, H.P. Acthar Gel, that had been selling for $1,600 a vial would now cost $23,000. The price increase, put in place over last Labor Day weekend, also jolted employers that provide health benefits to their workers and bear the brunt of drug costs. As it turned out, the exclusive distributor of H.P. Acthar Gel is Express Scripts, a company whose core business is supposed to be helping employers manage their drug insurance programs and get medicines at the best available prices. But in recent years, drug benefit managers like Express Scripts have built lucrative side businesses seemingly at odds with that best-price mission. A growing portion of their revenue comes from acting as exclusive or semi-exclusive distributors of expensive specialty drugs that can cost thousands of dollars. And the prices of such medicines are rising much faster than for the mainstream prescription drugs available through a wide variety of distributors. Critics say that distributing specialty drugs with ever-higher prices runs counter to the best interests of the employers that hire companies like Express Scripts. ''We are headed right down into conflict alley with these exclusive arrangements,'' said Gerry Purcell, an Atlanta-based health benefits consultant to big employers. As exclusive or semi-exclusive distributors of specialty drugs, the benefit managers ''can raise the prices at will,'' Mr. Purcell said, ''and the employer will have little chance but to pay the bill.'' Express Scripts' main competitors, CVSCaremark and Medco Health Solutions, have also built lucrative side businesses in specialty drugs. So have some of the biggest insurers that provide medical benefits to corporate America, including UnitedHealth Group, Wellpoint, Aetna and Cigna. When asked about the potential conflicts, Express Scripts and the other companies -- which are known as pharmacy benefit managers -- tend to describe themselves as mere middlemen with little influence over what the drug makers choose to charge. Steve Miller, an Express Scripts executive vice president, said of the H.P. Acthar Gel episode: ''The increase was a manufacturing decision. I can't comment on that.'' The pharmacy benefit managers say that keeping a lid on employers' drug costs is still their top priority. And they defend their involvement with specialty drugs, saying it helps them keep better track of the medicines' use. ''I don't believe it is a conflict,'' said Dave Rickard, an executive vice president of CVS Caremark. ''We saved clients $115 million last year that would have been spent on specialty drugs that were not appropriate.'' But CVS Caremark, meanwhile, sold nearly $6 billion in specialty drugs last year through its pharmacy benefit management business -- nearly 14 percent of the company's annual revenue. The main drug benefit managers make as much as 10 to 15 percent on each sale of a specialty drug, whose prices can range from $5,000 a year for certain anemia drugs to $389,000 in the case of Soliris, a drug for a rare blood disorder, whose distributors include Express Scripts' specialty drug unit, CuraScript. Spending on specialty drugs rose 16.5 percent in 2006, growing twice as fast as traditional drug spending, and totaled about $62 billion -- which was about 23 percent of overall drug sales in this country, according to Charles Boorady, a Citigroup health care analyst. Big employers and organizations including General Motors, Caterpillar and Calpers, the large California public employees health and pension group, say their spending on specialty drugs is growing at double the rate of the rest of their drug benefits for employees. In some cases, employers are starting to push back. A group of large- and medium-size companies like Kinder Morgan Energy, a Houston pipeline company, and Enodis, an international restaurant equipment maker with United States headquarters in Florida, recently pushed CVS Caremark to agree to hand back $15 to the employers on each prescription filled for all specialty drugs listed in a Caremark contract.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E4D8123DF930A35757C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Insurer Signals Confidence In Criticized Cholesterol Drug<date>Published: April 3, 2008</date><text>The UnitedHealth Group, the largest United States insurer, is recommending that patients stay on the cholesterol pill Vytorin because the company has found ''no safety issues.'' The company will not charge a higher co-payment for Vytorin than for other brand-name cholesterol medicines, signaling confidence in a pill that a panel of cardiologists this week said should not be used until patients try and fail with other drugs. Vytorin is a combination pill that includes Zetia from Schering-Plough and Zocor from Merck. A study released on Sunday found that Vytorin was no better at reducing plaque in neck arteries than Zocor alone, a medicine available generically at a fifth of the cost. Schering has lost $21 billion in market value since a preliminary report on the study was released in January. ''There were no safety issues raised in January or now,'' Brian Solow, medical director of clinical services at Prescription Solutions, UnitedHealth's pharmacy group, said Wednesday. ''The last thing we want to do is see patients stopping their medication when they need it.'' UnitedHealth, based in Minnetonka, Minn., charges the lowest co-payments for generics, including a version of Zocor, in insurance plans sold to patients enrolled in Medicare prescription plans. The second, more expensive pricing tier includes Vytorin and Lipitor from Pfizer. ''Lipitor will accomplish the same goal as Vytorin,'' Mr. Solow said. The insurer has not required patients to try an alternate cholesterol-lowering drug before Vytorin in the past and has no plans to do so at this time, Mr. Solow said. Vytorin and Zetia had more than $5 billion in sales last year, making them Schering's most important product group.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/opinion/18mon1.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">A Rip-Off by Health Insurers?<date>Published: February 18, 2008</date><text>Have health insurers been systematically cheating patients and doctors of fair reimbursement for medical services? That is the disturbing possibility raised by an investigation of the industry’s arcane procedures for calculating “reasonable and customary” rates. Skip to next paragraph The Board Blog Additional commentary, background information and other items by Times editorial writers. Go to The Board » The investigation, by the New York State attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, and his staff, suggests that these procedures  used by major insurance companies to determine what they will pay when patients visit a doctor who is not in the company’s network  may be rigged to shortchange the beneficiaries. When patients visit an out-of-network doctor, insurers typically agree to pay 80 percent of the reasonable and customary rate charged by doctors in the same geographic area. The patient is stuck with the rest, and as any patient knows, that rate always seems to fall short of what their own doctor is charging. If the attorney general’s investigators are right, we can understand why. The numbers are mainly compiled by an obscure company known as Ingenix, which  as it turns out  is owned by UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest health insurers. Ingenix collects billing information from UnitedHealth and other health care payers to compile a database that is then used by the insurers to determine out-of-network reimbursement rates. This system is an invitation for abuse. UnitedHealth owns the company whose database will affect its costs and profitability, so both have a strong financial interest in keeping reimbursement rates low. Even Ingenix seems unwilling to stand behind its numbers. In licensing its database to insurers, it stresses that the data is “for informational purposes only” and does not imply anything about “reasonable and customary” charges. Yet that is precisely what the health insurers use the data for, as Ingenix knows, according to investigators. Mr. Cuomo and the American Medical Association, which has a long-standing suit filed against Ingenix and various UnitedHealth companies, claim that the data is manipulated. They claim that health insurers and Ingenix disproportionately eliminate high charges, thus skewing the numbers for customary charges downward. Mr. Cuomo also says that Ingenix pools the charges for services performed by low-paid nurses and physician assistants with those performed by high-paid doctors. And he says the company fails to account for the patient’s condition and type of facility where the service was provided  factors that can drive up costs. He also contends that Ingenix uses outdated information, which would guarantee that reimbursement rates will always lag behind medical inflation. The A.M.A.’s more detailed legal complaint also charges that the database dilutes prices in high-cost locations by combining them with low-cost areas, and includes prices that reflect in-network discounts. The attorney general’s investigators did their own survey and concluded that $200 is the fair market rate in New York City and Nassau County for a 15-minute consultation with a doctor for an illness of low to moderate severity. Ingenix, the investigators said, calculated the rate as $77, of which United would pay $62, leaving the patient to pay $138. UnitedHealth disputes those numbers, so the attorney general will need to offer a fuller explanation of how they were derived. Mr. Cuomo has announced his intention to sue UnitedHealth, Ingenix and three other subsidiaries, and has subpoenaed data from 16 other health insurers. Whatever that investigation unearths, it is already clear that the system for calculating “reasonable and customary” charges ought to be reformed by making it truly independent and objective. No consumer can reasonably trust numbers generated by a company whose loyalties and financial interests lie with the health insurers.

Not only is the number big and round  by far the largest giveback by corporate executives ever  but the recovery sets a standard of behavior for other companies and boards when performance pay is later shown to have been based on ephemeral earnings. UnitedHealth shareholders have certainly suffered. The company restated 12 years of earnings in the amount of $1.5 billion as a result of the backdating and said it had struck a $55 million settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. The stock is just about where it was in March 2006 before a Wall Street Journal article first questioned the timing of option grants made to Dr. William W. McGuire, UnitedHealth’s longtime chief executive. So it seems only appropriate that Dr. McGuire will cough up options worth $418 million in addition to the almost $200 million in options he has already forfeited. The agreement also bars him from joining the board of a public company for 10 years. Don’t fret for Dr. McGuire, though. He still holds options worth around $800 million. In a statement, he said he was happy to have the matter resolved; he neither admitted nor denied the backdating accusations. Even more significant about this deal is that it will force boards to institute clawback provisions in all employment agreements with top officers and then enforce them. “Every single time another executive agrees to a clawback or another board insists on one  especially if it’s made public  it just makes it harder for other executives not to agree to them or other boards not to insist on them,” said Michael Melbinger, a partner at Winston &amp; Strawn and head of its executive compensation practice. The UnitedHealth case is also an example of the value of an effective special-litigation committee. Many such committees, convened by boards in response to accusations of impropriety at their companies, often seem most interested in whitewashing questionable actions. They rarely work as hard as the committee at UnitedHealth did to get to the bottom of the mess. The committee members were Kathleen A. Blatz, former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, and Edward C. Stringer, a former justice of that court. Both were unusually eager to get shareholders’ views on the problems at UnitedHealth, said Chad Johnson, a partner at Bernstein, Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann, one of two law firms that represented nine public pension funds that sued UnitedHealth and 20 of its officers and directors over the backdating. Indeed, the committee’s 80-page report said that while UnitedHealth had genuinely tried to resolve weaknesses in option-granting practices and other oversight breaches, the pension fund plaintiffs had provided proposals aimed at keeping the company in the forefront of transparency and accountability. The committee urged UnitedHealth to consider them seriously. “We have an important governance aspect of this case that is still the subject of negotiation,” said Karl Cambronne, lead counsel at Chestnut &amp; Cambronne in Minneapolis. One aspect of the UnitedHealth settlement and litigation committee report disturbed Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains. That was the committee’s forgiving treatment of two UnitedHealth directors and members of the compensation committee that oversaw Dr. McGuire’s option grants and employment agreement. They are Thomas H. Kean, the former governor of New Jersey, and Mary O. Mundinger, dean of health policy at Columbia University’s nursing school. The litigation committee called their performance on the compensation committee “disappointing,” but decided not to take legal action against them. “If the directors aren’t held accountable in some shape or form and aren’t at least heavily criticized in the special litigation committee report, that is a mixed message,” Mr. Foley said. “That you can have a situation this bad, with write-offs and tax impacts and recoveries this big, and the directors still aren’t liable  what does that say about their accountability?” DON NATHAN, a UnitedHealth spokesman, said that neither Mr. Kean nor Ms. Mundinger would comment. But he said the board has set up a committee of representatives from four of the company’s long-term institutional investors to advise on director candidates and qualifications. That, too, is a step in the right direction; most boards shut out investors on the topic of director nominees. Even so, that the outcome of the UnitedHealth case is so remarkable is a distressing indication of how far shareholders still have to go to hold executives and directors accountable. Luckily, some are up to the task. “We think this is a really important case,” said Kevin B. Lindahl, general counsel for the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado, one of the plaintiffs. “We think it is important for major shareholders to stand up against corporate abuse and to improve company governance on behalf of all shareholders.” More Articles in Business »INVESTORS everywhere should applaud the deal struck last week by the UnitedHealth Group to recover nearly $1 billion in pay from former executives involved in the company’s option backdating mess.

Multimedia Graphic The Settlements The payback is on top of roughly $198 million that Mr. McGuire, an entrepreneur who built UnitedHealth, had previously agreed to return to his former employer. The total  $618 million  includes money that Mr. McGuire will return as part of separate settlements reached yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission and UnitedHealth shareholders. The forfeitures are the first time regulators have successfully employed corporate governance rules put in place after the collapse of Enron that force executives to disgorge ill-gotten gains. As part of the settlement with the S.E.C., Mr. McGuire will pay a $7 million fine and will be barred from serving as a director of a public company for 10 years. He will, however, be allowed to keep stock options valued at more than $800 million, including many that have been sharply criticized. The developments are the most significant to date since federal regulators started looking into the backdating of stock options. More than 120 companies have come under scrutiny for granting options to executives on dates when the companys share price was low, a tactic that guaranteed the maximum profit when the options were exercised. The settlement comes a year after the furor over compensation forced Mr. McGuires resignation from UnitedHealth, the nations largest health insurer. In a statement yesterday, Mr. McGuire said that he was pleased to put the controversy behind him. The last 18 months have been an extraordinarily challenging period for my family, and I am pleased to have reached a resolution, he said. UnitedHealth remains embroiled in the scandal over improperly granted options. The S.E.C. said its inquiry at UnitedHealth is continuing. So far, the company has restated its earnings by $1.5 billion and announced a $55 million settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. S.E.C. officials, as a matter of policy, declined to comment whether any specific executives or directors were under scrutiny. In October 2006, UnitedHealths top lawyer, David J. Lubben, and a former director, William G. Spears, abruptly resigned. In August 2006, the company board appointed a special litigation committee to review claims brought against the company related to improper backdating. Yesterday, this committee concluded that all claims against current and former officials should be dropped. The committee reached settlements with Mr. Lubben, who will give back about $30 million and Mr. Spears, who agreed to arbitration. UnitedHealth has maintained its support of its current chief, Stephen Hemsley, even though he voluntarily agreed to give back or reprice millions of improperly dated options, at a cost of nearly $240 million. Most companies implicated in backdating controversies so far are Silicon Valley start-ups or firms with technology roots, where options with favorable dates were considered a recruitment tool. UnitedHealth, which has a market capitalization of $66 billion, is one of the few blue-chip companies to face the issue, and its problems underscore how prevalent the practice has been. UnitedHealth has gone through operating strains since Mr. McGuire left, as it tried to integrate several large acquisitions, including Oxford Health Plans, and took on the largest number of enrollees in the new Medicare Part D drug plan while cutting costs. Shareholder advocates cheered the decision and the use of the S.E.C.s willingness to claw back ill-gotten stock sales and bonuses. I think this is terrific, said John A. Hill, chairman of the trustees at Putnam Funds, the mutual fund giant. I think it sets the standard for similar events that may occur in the future, said Mr. Hill, who is a critic of what he regards as excessive executive pay. Chad Johnson, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann, a law firm that represented six of the nine public pension funds that sued UnitedHealth Group and 20 executives and directors, said: This result significantly raises the bar on corporate accountability. It sends a message to top-level executives that you cant take money from the company and shareholders and not expect to be held accountable by institutional investors. The roughly $900 million to be repaid by the executives is remarkable on several counts. First, the figure exceeds the profits generated by the executives as a result of the backdating schemes, Mr. Johnson said. In addition, the recovery in the case is far greater than amounts received in other settlements reached with companies in the recent past. Individuals sued in cases related to the Enron failure, for example, paid $13 million. And the backdating case involving Mercury Interactive generated $117 million in recoveries. Shareholders sued UnitedHealth and the 20 executives and directors in the spring of 2006, after the companys options granting practices were questioned in an article in The Wall Street Journal. The lawyers for the nine state pension funds conducted an investigation and later filed suit. The shareholder action got a big lift in March 2007 when James M. Rosenbaum, the federal judge overseeing the case in Minnesota, refused to grant the defendants motion to dismiss the case and allowed discovery to proceed. That allowed lawyers for the pension funds to review internal documents. Mr. Johnson said the special litigation committee formed by the UnitedHealth directors was more aggressive than similar committees convened at other troubled companies because it carefully weighed the input of investors.

Their biggest gamble involves the lucrative Medicare Advantage part of the business: doctor networks that are managed by the insurers, in contrast to regular Medicare in which members can choose virtually any doctor, who is paid directly by the government. One in five of the nation’s 43 million Medicare enrollees is now in the Medicare Advantage program, which the Bush administration says has brought more choices and better benefits to the federal health system. And if Humana and UnitedHealth have their way, tens of thousands more will be attracted to Medicare Advantage during the enrollment period now under way. “Given the aging of the baby boomers, it will be a growth opportunity for many years to come,” Humana’s chief executive, Mike McAllister, told analysts recently. But Medicare Advantage has become a political target, because  whatever its vaunted enhancements  it costs the federal government 12 percent more for each enrollee, on average, than the regular Medicare system. Many in Congress, as part of the negotiations over next year’s federal budget, are trying to scale back payments to Medicare Advantage. The Congressional critics see the policies as an extravagance whose main beneficiaries are insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth. And if the Democrats do well in next year’s elections, particularly in the White House race, there could be even bigger changes to Medicare  and to private insurers’ role in the system. “If the Democrats win the presidency and win a bigger margin in Congress, these Medicare Advantage plans are going to remain a big fat target,” said Frank B. McArdle, head of the Washington office of Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. So far, though, Humana and UnitedHealth seem undeterred. In the Medicare sign-up period now under way, Humana hopes to add at least 200,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees to its current 1.1 million. UnitedHealth already has 1.3 million Medicare Advantage customers and is pushing for many more as it markets those policies in a partnership with AARP. Like other big insurers, Humana and UnitedHealth are trying to cope with a sales slump in the private-sector parts of their business  as corporate customers in many cases are cutting back on the medical coverage they give employees. Humana has had virtually no growth in commercial members this year, while UnitedHealth’s commercial business had a net loss of 60,000 in the third quarter. But unlike Humana and UnitedHealth, other big insurers have been reluctant to seek growth by climbing out further on the Medicare limb. The others tend to see the government program as a high-risk business, subject to changes in federal payments and procedures. Among the other top five insurers  Wellpoint, Aetna and Cigna  none derive more than 5 percent of their profits from Medicare. UnitedHealth, in contrast, will get about 15 percent of this year’s projected pretax profit of $7.48 billion from Medicare. And Humana is transforming itself into a big-time government contractor. It will get almost three-fourths of its projected $1.28 billion in pretax profit this year from Medicare, mainly from the Advantage program, according to analysts. Certainly there is a lot of money to be made from Medicare Advantage. If the program goes unchanged, government spending on it is projected to exceed $100 billion annually by 2009. Under Medicare Advantage, the insurer provides coverage through a network of doctors, and the government pays the insurer a flat annual fee per enrollee. That federal payment varies from county to county, but it averages about $9,000 per enrollee nationwide. The Medicare Advantage plans typically offer rich benefits to enrollees, including low premiums  or in some cases no premiums  as well as low deductibles and low co-payments for members who go to doctors and hospitals in their plan’s network. People in the traditional federal program, by contrast, can go to any doctor who takes Medicare, a flexibility that many people prefer. But they will pay monthly premiums of $96.40 in 2008, and they must pay 20 percent of the cost of doctor visits, hospital outpatient bills and diagnostic tests like X-rays. Medicare managed care plans, which were first introduced in the 1970s to try to save money and make care more efficient, have undergone various revisions. Because the public had soured on the idea of H.M.O.’s and the insurers had shut many of the Medicare plans, finding them unprofitable, Congress sweetened the deal for insurers in 2003 by providing billions of dollars in subsidies. Medicare Advantage plans currently account for nearly 9 million of the 43 million Medicare beneficiaries. The Bush administration says that enrollees generally like the plans and that they make health care more accessible for minority, low-income and rural residents. But Medicare Advantage has strayed far from its original cost-containment goals. The plans’ 12 percent markup for the taxpayer  based on calculations by both the Congressional Budget Office and the federal Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  have made them a political target. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 5, 2007, on page C1 of the New York edition.Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Medicare Dependents Add to Portfolio Humana Incorporated Cigna Corp Aetna Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » With the commercial health insurance business in the doldrums, UnitedHealth, the nation’s biggest medical insurer, and Humana, the No. 4 player, have bet heavily on the federal Medicare program. Their biggest gamble involves the lucrative Medicare Advantage part of the business: doctor networks that are managed by the insurers, in contrast to regular Medicare in which members can choose virtually any doctor, who is paid directly by the government. One in five of the nation’s 43 million Medicare enrollees is now in the Medicare Advantage program, which the Bush administration says has brought more choices and better benefits to the federal health system. And if Humana and UnitedHealth have their way, tens of thousands more will be attracted to Medicare Advantage during the enrollment period now under way. “Given the aging of the baby boomers, it will be a growth opportunity for many years to come,” Humana’s chief executive, Mike McAllister, told analysts recently. But Medicare Advantage has become a political target, because  whatever its vaunted enhancements  it costs the federal government 12 percent more for each enrollee, on average, than the regular Medicare system. Many in Congress, as part of the negotiations over next year’s federal budget, are trying to scale back payments to Medicare Advantage. The Congressional critics see the policies as an extravagance whose main beneficiaries are insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth. And if the Democrats do well in next year’s elections, particularly in the White House race, there could be even bigger changes to Medicare  and to private insurers’ role in the system. “If the Democrats win the presidency and win a bigger margin in Congress, these Medicare Advantage plans are going to remain a big fat target,” said Frank B. McArdle, head of the Washington office of Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. So far, though, Humana and UnitedHealth seem undeterred. In the Medicare sign-up period now under way, Humana hopes to add at least 200,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees to its current 1.1 million. UnitedHealth already has 1.3 million Medicare Advantage customers and is pushing for many more as it markets those policies in a partnership with AARP. Like other big insurers, Humana and UnitedHealth are trying to cope with a sales slump in the private-sector parts of their business  as corporate customers in many cases are cutting back on the medical coverage they give employees. Humana has had virtually no growth in commercial members this year, while UnitedHealth’s commercial business had a net loss of 60,000 in the third quarter. But unlike Humana and UnitedHealth, other big insurers have been reluctant to seek growth by climbing out further on the Medicare limb. The others tend to see the government program as a high-risk business, subject to changes in federal payments and procedures. Among the other top five insurers  Wellpoint, Aetna and Cigna  none derive more than 5 percent of their profits from Medicare. UnitedHealth, in contrast, will get about 15 percent of this year’s projected pretax profit of $7.48 billion from Medicare. And Humana is transforming itself into a big-time government contractor. It will get almost three-fourths of its projected $1.28 billion in pretax profit this year from Medicare, mainly from the Advantage program, according to analysts.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic The Cost of Care Family members responsible for ailing loved ones provide not only hands on care but often reach into their own pockets to pay for many other expenses of care recipients, including groceries, household goods, drugs, medical co-payments and transportation. That nudges the average cost of providing long-distance care to $8,728 a year. These caregivers, spending on average 10 percent of their household income, manage the financial burden by taking out loans, skipping vacations, dipping into savings or ignoring their own health care. These findings and others, to be released today, came from a telephone survey of 1,000 adults caring for someone over age 50 who needs help with activities like bathing, using the toilet, preparing meals, shopping or managing finances. It is the first detailed look at out-of-pocket spending among the estimated 34 million Americans providing care for older family members or friends and builds on a 2004 study. The survey was conducted by the National Alliance for Caregiving, a research and policy organization, and Evercare, a division of the UnitedHealth Group, which coordinates long-term care for 150,000 clients. The report urges government assistance for family caregivers, whether through tax deductions, tax credits or other stipends. Typically, when people talk about services for caregivers, they mean respite care, support groups and things like that, said Gail Gibson Hunt, president of the National Alliance for Caregiving. They dont think of the financial side being tied into the burden. If youre spending 10 percent of your income, thats part of whats weighing on you, and policymakers havent paid enough attention to that. Until now, all estimates of out-of-pocket spending were based on a single question buried in a broad 2004 survey of family caregivers, according to Ms. Hunt and Donna Wagner, a gerontologist at Towson University in Maryland who analyzed the data for the new report. The 2004 survey, also the work of the National Alliance for Caregiving, had asked 1,247 caregivers to estimate their out-of-pocket expenses. Half said that they did have such expenses, averaging $2,400 a year. By comparison, the new survey  with 29 questions devoted to this one subject  produced a markedly different result. Of the 1,000 respondents, only 2 said they had never laid out any money. The rest said they spent on average $5,531 a year, or 10 percent of their salary. The burden was heavier for those who earned less, 20 percent for respondents with incomes of $25,000. Melissa Phillips, 45, a stay-at-home mother in Clayton, Ind., has spent $6,000 a year since her father moved from his own home into an assisted-living center, largely on groceries, incidental expenses and medical equipment like a wheelchair and a riser for the toilet seat. She helps out a bit with the monthly rent so his savings last longer and will pick up the slack if he runs out of money. For Mrs. Phillips, a respondent in the survey, her present circumstances are an improvement over the 10 months before her father left his own house, when he was in and out of the hospital. She and her three children moved in with him, disrupting their home schooling, while her husband remained at home. Costs ran higher then, Mrs. Phillips said, because she paid her fathers larger-than-usual utility bills, as well as gasoline and restaurant meals for her own family when she was running back and forth to the hospital. But since Mrs. Phillips did not have a paying job, she lost no income  unlike the 37 percent of survey respondents who had to quit work or reduce their hours because of their care-giving responsibilities. That compares with 16 percent in the 2004 research. These are among other findings in the latest survey: ¶The most common expenses for caregivers are household goods and food (42 percent of respondents), transportation (39 percent), medical co-payments and pharmaceuticals (31 percent), clothing (21 percent), and home repair and maintenance (13 percent). 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in National »The out-of-pocket cost of caring for an aging parent or spouse averages about $5,500 a year, according to the nations first in-depth study of such expenses, a sum that is more than double previous estimates and more than the average American household spends annually on health care and entertainment combined.

McGuire, its former chairman and chief executive. United States District Judge James M. Rosenbaum said the suit's accusation -- that the company inflated its share price by not disclosing the backdating of employee stock options -- ''lies at the core of the plot'' of ''The Sting,'' the 1973 film with Paul Newman and Robert Redford as con men who bet on horse races after they are run. Accusations that the company backdated options to maximize executive compensation led to the departure last November of Dr. McGuire, a medical doctor who built the company, based in Minneapolis, into one of the nation's largest insurers. He was the biggest recipient of stock options. Mr. McGuire's lawyers sent Judge Rosenbaum a letter disputing his ruling. Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement Fund, sued to recover damages from any changes in the stock price from backdating of options. In bringing up ''The Sting,'' Judge Rosenbaum noted in his ruling denying the motion to dismiss that he had ''not the slightest opinion as to whether such shenanigans occurred here.'' But if contentions by Calpers that executives ''were playing a game with a stacked deck'' are true, then ''this case is incredibly simple,'' he said. ''When awarded options, with deliberately selected grant dates that were already in the money,'' he wrote, ''defendants were playing a game they knew they could not lose; and, unsurprisingly, defendants won.'' UnitedHealth has acknowledged that some stock option grants were probably backdated favorably, but a spokesman, Don Nathan, said that the plaintiffs would have a hard time proving harm since they benefited from an explosion in the stock price between 1994 and 2002, the period at issue.

But there is another reason: the significant controversy in the field of emergency medicine about the use of tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. While the benefits of tPA in treating heart attacks have been definitively established, the benefits are not as clear-cut for stroke. The studies that established the use of tPA in stroke were less than ''gold standard'' studies. In fact, the efficacy in stroke was determined only through data-mining, as the authors went back in after their original study was completed to salvage some useful information. The study, as originally designed, didn't establish any benefit from the use to tPA. The authors then came up with a three-hour window of treatment, which provides some benefit for some patients but poses significant risks for others. For this emergency doctor, and for many of my colleagues, the use of tPA to treat stroke is a choice that is reluctantly, if ever, made, and none of the major emergency medicine associations in North America have endorsed it as ''standard of care.'' Arman Afagh, M.D. Riverside, Calif., May 30, 2007 To the Editor: Your article about stroke treatment highlights an important opportunity for the medical community to close the gap between what should happen and what does happen. For patients, families and society at large, the opportunity is captured in two words: blood pressure. Aggressive, sustained treatment of high blood pressure is the best thing patients and their doctors can do to prevent stroke and its complications. It would have more bang for the buck at the societal level than any other intervention. Lewis G. Sandy, M.D. Senior Vice President Clinical Advancement UnitedHealth Group Minnetonka, Minn., May 29, 2007 To the Editor: ''Lifesaving Opportunities Missed, Before and After Stroke'' says that tPA ''could help half of all stroke patients,'' but that ''only 3 percent to 4 percent'' receive it. This is true despite advances in imaging and treatment delivery. The statistic remains a source of frustration for the medical community and should be a point of concern for all of us. The first part of the solution lies in federal research money. Though stroke ranks first in causing disability and third in causing death, it ranks 71st out of 215 disease categories for National Institutes of Health financing. Also, because of misinterpreted symptoms and denial, patients commonly arrive at the emergency room after the three-hour window when tPA works. Stroke education is imperative for patients, family members and the community that each hospital serves. Such efforts are under way at Columbia University and other academic institutions. Without engagement of the public, the promise of better treatment may be deliverable to only a small percentage of those who need it. Randolph Marshall, M.D. Acting Director, Stroke Division Columbia University Medical Center New York, May 29, 2007 To the Editor: As a vascular neurologist and chairman of the Stroke Council of the American Heart Association, I am aware of the significant gaps in stroke treatment. Because ''time lost is brain lost,'' systems need to be put in place to assure that all patients get appropriate treatment as quickly as possible. The federal Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act, which has been passed by the House and is pending in the Senate, would help achieve this goal. It calls for educating the public about stroke symptoms and supports coordinated, statewide stroke care systems. This bill would help the medical community provide the best available care. Larry B. Goldstein, M.D. Director, Duke Stroke Center Durham, N.C., May 30, 2007 To the Editor: I am an emergency room doctor, and almost every stroke patient I see has a pre-existing condition -- like high blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco abuse and high cholesterol -- that hasn't been properly addressed. While tPA clot-busting treatment and M.R.I. scans are valuable, the emphasis always seems to be on the new and high-tech. That's where the money is, not only for doctors, but also for hospitals and makers of drugs and medical equipment. Spending 30 minutes with a patient to work on reducing risk factors is not rewarded, recognized or reimbursed. Our payment system perversely discourages prevention. Treating strokes with modern technology and medicines is important, but the real payoff is in fully supporting prevention. We now spend too much too late with too little to show for it. Dan Morhaim, M.D. Owings Mills, Md., May 28, 2007 To the Editor: The reason hospitals do not consider strokes to be ''moneymakers'' is that the real cost comes not in the catastrophic event but in the hours of physical therapy required later. Insurers pay for a limited number of these visits because of the conventional medical view that after a year, stroke victims rarely achieve more gains. Yet neurologists and neurophysiologists have recently discovered that stroke patients can continue to make significant recovery even several years after an incident. My wife suffered a severe stroke at 53, almost four years ago, and she is still gaining movement on her left side. The medical treatment community is lagging behind the science of this disease.

Skip to next paragraph Kiichiro Sato/Associated Press Marc Dann has been a vocal critic of the UnitedHealth Group and the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation. Related Whats Happened to the Lawyers Who Worked for Spitzer? (May 18, 2007) With Mr. Spitzer now in the governors mansion, is there another state regulator trying to take up his badge? A strong candidate for the new Spitzer might be Marc Dann, the new attorney general of Ohio. Since taking office in January, Mr. Dann has sharply criticized the UnitedHealth Group over its ousted former chief executive, William W. McGuire, who is accused of backdating more than $2.3 billion in stock options, and he has revived an investigation of Marsh &amp; McLennan, looking at whether the company violated the states antitrust laws. He is also trying to rally other state attorneys general to join him in cases affecting investors before the Supreme Court. Mr. Dann demurs when asked whether he is trying to emulate Mr. Spitzer. Certainly there was a vacuum, Mr. Dann said. The two men spoke on the phone during the campaign, and Mr. Dann received a small check from Mr. Spitzer. I almost framed it, and didnt cash it, he said. I never worked on Wall Street, Mr. Dann said, but what I do is look out my window every day and see some of the devastation thats been reaped on the Midwest and the Rust Belt by people who are only looking out for the bottom line, sometimes to the extent of making business decisions that violate fraud laws or civil laws or even our criminal laws. While Ohio is a long way from Wall Street, the state has played a major role in securities class actions. The states public pension funds, when combined, are the third largest in the country, after California and New York, and as a result, Ohio often ends up as the lead plaintiff in shareholder lawsuits. Jay Eisenhofer, the Ohio pension funds lawyer in its case against UnitedHealth, said that Mr. Dann is taking a similar tack as Mr. Spitzer, but with a focus on changing how boardrooms handle their obligations to investors. I look at him as being more of an activist in the area of corporate governance, Mr. Eisenhofer said. When Mr. Dann took office, Ohio was already lead plaintiff in several prominent cases, one of them being the UnitedHealth Group case. Shareholders have sued the company, its board and executives in an effort to revoke the stock options that were granted to Mr. McGuire. Mr. Dann accused a special committee set up by UnitedHealth of dragging its feet in deciding whether action should be taken against Mr. McGuire. Mr. Dann traveled to Minneapolis to meet with the special committee. The committee, made up of two retired Minnesota judges, then canceled the meeting. Days later, Mr. Dann wrote a letter accusing the committee of inexcusable arrogance. Before entering the Ohio Senate in 2003, Mr. Dann, 45, ran a storefront law office in a strip mall, where his general practice ran the gamut from divorces to workers compensation and personal bankruptcies. You could drive up to my law office, he said. In 2005, Mr. Dann made a name for himself by becoming a tenacious critic of the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation, which was then embroiled in a statewide scandal for taking $50 million in money set aside for injured workers and investing it in rare coins. Mr. Dann sued Bob Taft, the governor at the time, to demand public records relating to those investments, and he fought the case to the Ohio Supreme Court. (The court ruled for the governor, and Mr. Dann never got the documents.) He fought to the end, said C. J. Prentiss, former minority leader of the state Senate, who called him a gentle bear. Although known as a tough fighter, he almost cried on the Senate floor while championing an anti-bullying bill for the states schools, telling painful stories of his chubby youth. Many, if not most, state attorneys general aspire to become governor some day, but, at least for now, Mr. Dann does not appear to have that in his sights. He was born to be the A.G., Ms. Prentiss said. His most ambitious effort thus far has been persuading 23 state attorneys general to sign onto a brief arguing against a brief filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case before the United States Supreme Court. At issue is the interpretation of a provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The S.E.C. is urging the court to adopt a standard that would make it harder for shareholders to prevail in fraud lawsuits against publicly traded companies and their executives. The commission argued that the litigation reform act required investors to show by evidence a high likelihood that the defendant possessed the intent to violate the law. Well, I was just enraged, Mr. Dann said. I want to make sure that we are out there with our amicus brief so that we can maybe shame them. At some point I would hope they would take a position on the side of the investors. Or stay out. More Articles in Business »As New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer won national attention by becoming the new sheriff in finance, taking on Wall Street and mutual funds and the insurance industry.

Yes, literally — or so say two New York hospitals, which have filed a racketeering lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group and several of its affiliates.I don’t know how the case will turn out. But whatever happens in court, the lawsuit illustrates perfectly the dysfunctional nature of our health insurance system, a system in which resources that could have been used to pay for medical care are instead wasted in a zero-sum struggle over who ends up with the bill. The two hospitals accuse UnitedHealth of operating a “rogue business plan” designed to avoid paying clients’ medical bills. For example, the suit alleges that patients were falsely told that Flushing Hospital was “not a network provider” so UnitedHealth did not pay the full network rate. UnitedHealth has already settled charges of misleading clients about providers’ status brought by New York’s attorney general: the company paid restitution to plan members, while attributing the problem to computer errors. The legal outcome will presumably turn on whether there was deception as well as denial — on whether it can be proved that UnitedHealth deliberately misled plan members. But it’s a fact that insurers spend a lot of money looking for ways to reject insurance claims. And health care providers, in turn, spend billions on “denial management,” employing specialist firms — including Ingenix, a subsidiary of, yes, UnitedHealth — to fight the insurers. So it’s an arms race between insurers, who deploy software and manpower trying to find claims they can reject, and doctors and hospitals, who deploy their own forces in an effort to outsmart or challenge the insurers. And the cost of this arms race ends up being borne by the public, in the form of higher health care prices and higher insurance premiums. Of course, rejecting claims is a clumsy way to deny coverage. The best way for an insurer to avoid paying medical bills is to avoid selling insurance to people who really need it. An insurance company can accomplish this in two ways, through marketing that targets the healthy, and through underwriting: rejecting the sick or charging them higher premiums. Like denial management, however, marketing and underwriting cost a lot of money. McKinsey &amp; Company, the consulting firm, recently released an important report dissecting the reasons America spends so much more on health care than other wealthy nations. One major factor is that we spend $98 billion a year in excess administrative costs, with more than half of the total accounted for by marketing and underwriting — costs that don’t exist in single-payer systems. And this is just part of the story. McKinsey’s estimate of excess administrative costs counts only the costs of insurers. It doesn’t, as the report concedes, include other “important consequences of the multipayor system,” like the extra costs imposed on providers. The sums doctors pay to denial management specialists are just one example. Incidentally, while insurers are very good at saying no to doctors, hospitals and patients, they’re not very good at saying no to more powerful players. Drug companies, in particular, charge much higher prices in the United States than they do in countries like Canada, where the government health care system does the bargaining. McKinsey estimates that the United States pays $66 billion a year in excess drug costs, and overpays for medical devices like knee and hip implants, too. To put these numbers in perspective: McKinsey estimates the cost of providing full medical care to all of America’s uninsured at $77 billion a year. Either eliminating the excess administrative costs of private health insurers, or paying what the rest of the world pays for drugs and medical devices, would by itself more or less pay the cost of covering all the uninsured. And that doesn’t count the many other costs imposed by the fragmentation of our health care system. Which brings us back to the racketeering lawsuit. If UnitedHealth can be shown to have broken the law — and let’s just say that this company, which is America’s second-largest health insurer, has a reputation for playing even rougher than its competitors — by all means, let’s see justice done. But the larger problem isn’t the behavior of any individual company. It’s the ugly incentives provided by a system in which giving care is punished, while denying it is rewarded.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/business/06healths.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Forecast Is Cut by UnitedHealth<date>Published: February 6, 2007</date><text>The UnitedHealth Group cut its 2007 revenue forecast yesterday after determining that membership in its full-service Medicare plans for older patients would probably decline “modestly” this year. The company lowered its Medicare Advantage projection for the second time in two months, even as a rival health insurer, Humana, said it picked up 100,000 such Medicare members in January alone. UnitedHealth’s new Medicare Advantage forecast led analysts to speculate that the company’s performance has suffered as it tries to emerge from a stock options scandal.

UnitedHealth said it expected Medicare Advantage membership to decline in the first quarter by fewer than 100,000 people.

UnitedHealth did not disclose earnings per share or give comparisons to last year. The company is still trying to sort out the accounting for its stock options and has said that its historical financial results would be restated.

A Piper Jaffray analyst, Melissa Mullikin, said that figure was low by historical standards but not as low as last year’s 7 percent. UnitedHealth also reduced to 80,000 to 100,000 the number of customers it expects to add to its Medicare Advantage insurance, down from the about 180,000 it previously predicted. The chief executive, Stephen J.

Tuckson, senior vice president of UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest insurers. “It’s a careful balance of public and private solutions.” The proposal, unveiled Thursday after more than two years of work, was endorsed by 16 groups including AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kaiser Permanente, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. Other coalition members endorsing the proposal were Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, and America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers. The proposal comes at a possible turning point in the debate over national health insurance, which has been an elusive goal for Democrats since the New Deal. In the past few years, businesses of all sizes have said that health costs are cutting their profits and hurting their ability to compete. Politicians of both parties predict that the health care issue will figure prominently in the 2008 presidential campaign. Without waiting for Congress, states like Massachusetts and California are expanding coverage, but want help from Washington. As a first step, the 16-member group, known as the Health Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured, urged Congress to put more money into the Children’s Health Insurance Program and create tax breaks for the purchase of private insurance covering children. Money for the program is running low, and many children are eligible but not enrolled. Members of the coalition said their proposal would cost $45 billion in the first five years. They did not estimate the cost of insuring millions of adults in later years, nor did they suggest how to pay the costs. Dr. Tuckson said that “the cost of inaction is higher than the cost of action.” Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, said, “Our agreement transcends political and ideological boundaries.” But tensions bubbled below the surface, showing how difficult it could be to translate the recommendations into law. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Service Employees International Union and the National Association of Manufacturers participated in the coalition for more than a year but did not endorse the final report. The deepest divisions came over how to pay for expanded coverage and who should foot the bill. Andrew L. Stern, president of the service employees’ union, supports health insurance for all but has said that the “employer-based system of health coverage is over” and that it “is collapsing, crushed by out-of-control costs.” By contrast, members of the coalition said they wanted to preserve and build on that system. E. Neil Trautwein, former assistant vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the proposal had “little reference to fiscal realities.” JoAnn C. Volk, a policy analyst at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said she favored expanding government programs. “But tax credits would not guarantee access to comprehensive coverage and could leave consumers with high out-of-pocket costs,” Ms. Volk said. Suzanne DeFrancis, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “We all share the goal of helping people get health insurance. The administration believes this can be done best by helping people buy their own insurance, rather than creating a new government entitlement to health care or raising taxes.” More than eight million children are uninsured. At least two-thirds are eligible for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. One way to cover these children would be to enroll them automatically in Medicaid or the children’s insurance program if they qualified for food stamps or reduced-price school lunches, the coalition said. In general, Medicaid is available to children under 19 in families with incomes below the poverty level, about $16,600 for a family of three. The coalition said Congress should provide tax credits to families with incomes from 100 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level, to help them buy coverage for children. The coalition offered longer-term recommendations, saying that states should have the option to expand Medicaid to cover all adults with incomes below the poverty level. “Day after day, there is debate and discussion,” Dr. Tuckson said. “Day after day, people die. We are sick and tired of the debate. We are focusing on what is achievable.” More Articles in National »WASHINGTON, Jan. 18  A broad coalition of business and consumer groups, doctors, hospitals and drug companies laid out a major proposal on Thursday to provide health coverage to more than half of the nation’s 47 million uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families. “This is a proposal not for mandates but for incentives,” said Dr. Reed V.

Next came a small glossary of new terms, so those without accounting or law degrees could wrap their brains around the concepts. There was “backdating,” which is retroactively setting a stock option’s grant price to a date when the stock price was lower, to “bake in” a profit. This led to dozens of financial restatements and abrupt departures of officials — including one chief executive, Jacob Alexander of Comverse Technologies, who fled to Namibia to escape fraud charges. There was also “bullet-dodging,” or delaying an options grant until just after the release of bad news to take advantage of an expected lower price. The practice is so hard to prosecute that many lawyers consider it bulletproof. And then there was something known as “spring-loading,” or awarding stock options ahead of positive news to reap an instant paper profit. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission seemed divided on this one. One commissioner called it smart business, suggesting it was a legal way for companies to get a bigger bang for each stock grant. Others called it flat-out securities fraud, raising the issue of insider trading. Federal regulators have yet to bring a spring-loading case, though a company called Cyberonics has drawn attention for making a large option grant to its chief executive just hours after a regulatory panel recommended approval of its implant to treat depression. Such a case could help reshape laws molded from a 40-year-old case involving a Texas oil company that awarded options before a big discovery. Officials have had fun with the wacky legal lexicon. “Spring-loading sounds like the type of thing you ask your kids not to do inside the house,” said Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman. And “backdating sounds like something that you wouldn’t want your daughter to do anywhere.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/business/01health.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Options Blocked<date>Published: December 1, 2006</date><text>A federal judge in Minnesota has temporarily blocked Dr. William W.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Illustration by The New York Times Multimedia Graphic A Matter of Timing That appears to be what happened at Symbol Technologies and Mercury Interactive, and federal securities regulators are now sifting through options data at other companies for evidence of similar tax-avoidance schemes. The Securities and Exchange Commissions stock options inquiry has so far focused on the practice of pushing back the grant date on stock options, which can guarantee profits when the grants are exercised. Its interest in exercise dates may signal an emerging front in its widening investigation into stock option abuses at more than 100 companies, from Silicon Valley start-ups to well-known giants like Apple Computer and UnitedHealth Group. The Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service are separately examining dozens of companies. As those cases have progressed, at least 46 executives and directors have been ousted from their positions. Companies have taken charges totaling $5.3 billion to account for the impact of improper grants, according to Glass Lewis &amp; Company, a research firm that advises big investors on shareholder issues. And further investigations, indictments and restatements are expected. Securities regulators are now focusing on several cases where it appears the exercise dates of the options were backdated, according to a senior S.E.C. enforcement official, who asked not to be identified because of the agencys policy of not commenting on active cases. Besides raising disclosure and accounting problems, backdating an exercise date can result in tax fraud. Tax avoidance is a big issue, said Marc A. Siegel, research director of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, an independent forensic accounting advisory firm in Rockville, Md. There is no real excuse for intentionally trying to misreport an exercise date. An option grant gives the holder the right to buy shares of stock in the future at a predetermined exercise price. If the current market price is higher than the price at which the option was granted, the option holder captures the gain. Profits from options are subject to income tax when the options are exercised. Backdating an exercise date can reduce that tax burden. By reporting an exercise date with a lower price than the date on which the options were actually exercised, executives may understate their gains and lower their income tax. It may also cause their companies to take improper tax deductions, leading to reporting problems down the road. In other cases, executives can benefit by reporting an exercise date with a higher price than the one on which the options were acquired. Instead of acquiring their new shares with cash, executives sometimes use stock to pay the cost of converting their options, including the taxes on the profits. A higher market price means that the executive needs fewer shares to pay those costs. As with backdated grants, improper adjustments of exercise dates are most likely to have taken place during the dot-com boom of the 1990s and to have subsided in 2002, when more stringent reporting requirements were introduced. And, as with the backdating inquiry, it appears that federal investigators are combing through data to identify patterns, where executives consistently exercised their stock options at a favorable price, like a monthly or quarterly low. In suspicious cases, investigators may follow up by requesting brokerage firm records and other transaction documents from companies to see if the actual and reported exercise dates match up. Because backdating exercise prices involves false financial reporting and improper accounting, the cases fall under the S.E.C.s oversight. But in similar investigations, S.E.C officials have alerted the Internal Revenue Service of possible tax issues in the securities cases they were examining. The practice of backdating exercise prices first emerged in two of the first investigations into improper options practices. Both Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, and Linda Chatman Thomsen, the agencys enforcement director, cited the abuse in their testimony before Congress last month. In 2004, as part of a broader case of accounting fraud, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. accused several former executives at Symbol Technologies, a producer of bar code equipment, of manipulating their option exercise dates. Federal prosecutors and regulators accused Leonard Goldner, Symbols former general counsel, of devising a plan that let him and a handful of other senior executives push back the option exercise dates on the filings used to report stock acquisitions, without the knowledge of the companys board or shareholders. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »In the latest twist in the stock options game, some executives may have changed the so-called exercise date  the date options can be converted to stock  to avoid paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in income tax, federal investigators say. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Illustration by The New York Times Multimedia Graphic A Matter of Timing That appears to be what happened at Symbol Technologies and Mercury Interactive, and federal securities regulators are now sifting through options data at other companies for evidence of similar tax-avoidance schemes. The Securities and Exchange Commissions stock options inquiry has so far focused on the practice of pushing back the grant date on stock options, which can guarantee profits when the grants are exercised. Its interest in exercise dates may signal an emerging front in its widening investigation into stock option abuses at more than 100 companies, from Silicon Valley start-ups to well-known giants like Apple Computer and UnitedHealth Group. The Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service are separately examining dozens of companies. As those cases have progressed, at least 46 executives and directors have been ousted from their positions. Companies have taken charges totaling $5.3 billion to account for the impact of improper grants, according to Glass Lewis &amp; Company, a research firm that advises big investors on shareholder issues. And further investigations, indictments and restatements are expected. Securities regulators are now focusing on several cases where it appears the exercise dates of the options were backdated, according to a senior S.E.C. enforcement official, who asked not to be identified because of the agencys policy of not commenting on active cases. Besides raising disclosure and accounting problems, backdating an exercise date can result in tax fraud. Tax avoidance is a big issue, said Marc A. Siegel, research director of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, an independent forensic accounting advisory firm in Rockville, Md. There is no real excuse for intentionally trying to misreport an exercise date. An option grant gives the holder the right to buy shares of stock in the future at a predetermined exercise price. If the current market price is higher than the price at which the option was granted, the option holder captures the gain. Profits from options are subject to income tax when the options are exercised. Backdating an exercise date can reduce that tax burden. By reporting an exercise date with a lower price than the date on which the options were actually exercised, executives may understate their gains and lower their income tax. It may also cause their companies to take improper tax deductions, leading to reporting problems down the road. In other cases, executives can benefit by reporting an exercise date with a higher price than the one on which the options were acquired. Instead of acquiring their new shares with cash, executives sometimes use stock to pay the cost of converting their options, including the taxes on the profits. A higher market price means that the executive needs fewer shares to pay those costs. As with backdated grants, improper adjustments of exercise dates are most likely to have taken place during the dot-com boom of the 1990s and to have subsided in 2002, when more stringent reporting requirements were introduced. And, as with the backdating inquiry, it appears that federal investigators are combing through data to identify patterns, where executives consistently exercised their stock options at a favorable price, like a monthly or quarterly low. In suspicious cases, investigators may follow up by requesting brokerage firm records and other transaction documents from companies to see if the actual and reported exercise dates match up. Because backdating exercise prices involves false financial reporting and improper accounting, the cases fall under the S.E.C.s oversight. But in similar investigations, S.E.C officials have alerted the Internal Revenue Service of possible tax issues in the securities cases they were examining. The practice of backdating exercise prices first emerged in two of the first investigations into improper options practices. Both Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, and Linda Chatman Thomsen, the agencys enforcement director, cited the abuse in their testimony before Congress last month. In 2004, as part of a broader case of accounting fraud, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. accused several former executives at Symbol Technologies, a producer of bar code equipment, of manipulating their option exercise dates. Federal prosecutors and regulators accused Leonard Goldner, Symbols former general counsel, of devising a plan that let him and a handful of other senior executives push back the option exercise dates on the filings used to report stock acquisitions, without the knowledge of the companys board or shareholders. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/business/21five.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">The Dow Soars, and Consumer Prices Sink<date>Published: October 21, 2006</date><text>GOOD week for the stock market.

Several statistics suggested inflation was slowing, but the latest corporate scandal accelerated. DOWN, BUT NOT OUT A New York judge ordered Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, to return as much as $100 million of the $139.5 million payout that he received when he resigned in September 2003. Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said Mr. Grasso did not disclose to other directors on the board of the exchange how salary increases had caused his pension and savings to balloon. The judge also said Mr. Grasso violated his contract by withdrawing millions from his retirement fund before he retired. The judge did not directly address the central claim in a lawsuit brought by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, that Mr. Grassos pay was unreasonable under the states not-for-profit law. But the ruling bolstered Mr. Spitzers argument that the exchanges board was not fully informed about Mr. Grassos compensation. Mr. Grasso said he would appeal, which would further delay a nonjury trial that had been scheduled to start last month. DOWN, BUT STILL UP Falling energy prices helped bring consumer prices down by half a percentage point in September, the Labor Department said, although the so-called core inflation rate  excluding food and energy prices  rose 0.2 percent, as it did in July and August. Economists and stock traders took the Consumer Price Index report, and another that said the number of new building permits fell in September for the seventh consecutive month, as evidence that the economy was slowing and that higher interest rates would not be needed soon. That optimism was tempered by the Labor Departments news that the core consumer inflation rate is running at 2.9 percent for the year  the highest level in almost 11 years. Federal Reserve policy makers will discuss interest rates on Tuesday and Wednesday; they are expected to keep rates at 5.25 percent. DOUBLING DOWN With sales growth in the United States slowing, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $1 billion for Trust-Mart, a group of Taiwanese-owned supermarkets in China, to become the biggest foreign chain in that rapidly expanding market. Acquiring Trust-Mart, which has more than 100 stores across China, pulls Wal-Mart even in China with Carrefour, the giant French retailer. The purchase also reverses Wal-Marts recent pullback abroad. In the last year, Wal-Mart has pulled out of Germany and South Korea, and has failed to make much headway against strong competitors in Japan and Britain. By more than doubling the number of stores Wal-Mart owns in China, this deal will help it secure lower prices from suppliers. That, in turn, could lead it to double in size again by 2010, one analyst said. DOUBLING UP The Chicago Mercantile Exchange agreed to buy its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, for $8 billion, creating a global derivatives goliath that dwarfs other capital markets. The merged exchange would meld the Mercantile Exchanges strengths  as a major market for interest rate contracts, currencies and livestock  with the Board of Trades dominance of Treasury bond futures, grain contracts and now ethanol. Executives at both companies said they had been engaged in serious merger talks almost as soon as the Board of Trade first sold shares to the public a year ago. Once the merger is completed, probably in the middle of 2007, the exchanges will consolidate in the Board of Trades landmark 44-story Art Deco tower in Chicago. THE FINAL OPTION Dr. William W. McGuire, who built the UnitedHealth Group into one of the nations two largest health insurers, was forced to resign and give up a portion of the $1.1 billion he holds in stock options. A law firm hired by UnitedHealth to investigate its stock option grants concluded that the program was riddled with poor controls and conflicts of interest that permitted executives to backdate their options grants to maximize their compensation. Dr. McGuires departure came amid a federal investigation into whether more than 100 companies backdated stock options. Backdating lets companies pretend to have given options to managers just before stock prices jump, assuring the executives quick profits without having met performance goals that would benefit all shareholders. Scores of companies are rushing to restate their results to reflect lower profits and higher taxes attributable to suspicious options grants. REGULATOR FALLS Lester M. Crawford, former chief of the Food and Drug Administration, pleaded guilty to conflict of interest and lying about stock he and his wife owned in companies the agency regulates. Dr. Crawford sold stock in several companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Medtronic and Boston Scientific, before the Senate approved his nomination in July 2005. But he and his wife, Catherine, retained shares in Sysco, PepsiCo and Kimberly-Clark, each of which has businesses regulated by the agency.

So let’s talk about private-sector scandals instead — specifically, the growing scandal involving backdated stock options, which this week led to the resignation of William McGuire, the chief executive of UnitedHealth Group.To understand the issue, we need to go back to the original ideological justification for giant executive paychecks. In the 1960’s and 1970’s, C.E.O.’s of the largest firms were paid, on average, about 40 times as much as the average worker. But executives wanted more — and professors at business schools provided a theory that justified much higher pay. They argued that a chief executive who expects to receive the same salary if his company is highly profitable that he will receive if it just muddles along won’t be willing to take risks and make hard decisions. “Corporate America,” declared an influential 1990 article by Michael Jensen of the Harvard Business School and Kevin Murphy of the University of Southern California, “pays its most important leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then that so many C.E.O.’s act like bureaucrats?” The claim, then, was that executives had to be given more of a stake in their companies’ success. And so corporate boards began giving C.E.O.’s lots of stock options — the right to purchase a share of the company’s stocks at a fixed price, usually the market price on the day the option was issued. If the stock went up, these options would pay off; if the stock went down, they would lose their value. And so, the theory went, executives would have the incentive to do whatever it took to push the stock price up. In the 1990’s, executive stock options proliferated — and executive pay soared, rising to 367 times the average worker’s pay by the early years of this decade. But the truth was that in many — perhaps most — cases, executive pay still had little to do with performance. For one thing, the great bull market of the 1990’s meant that even companies that didn’t do especially well saw their stock prices rise. Then there were the tricks that companies used to ensure lavish executive pay even if the stock simply seesawed up and down. For example, after a downward move in the stock price, executive stock options would often be repriced or swapped — that is, the price at which the executive had the right to buy stocks would be reduced to the new market price. Heads the C.E.O. wins, tails he gets another chance to flip the coin. What the backdating scandal reveals is that for many executives even that wasn’t enough. To ensure that executives profited from newly issued options, companies would pretend that the options had in fact been issued at an earlier date, when the stock price was lower. Thus a contract that Mr. McGuire signed in December 1999 included a grant of one million stock options dated back to Oct. 13, the day UnitedHealth’s stock price reached its low point for the year. What’s wrong with backdating stock options? There’s a tax evasion aspect, but the main point is the bait-and-switch. The public was told that gigantic executive paychecks were rewards for exceptional performance, but in practice executives were lavishly paid simply for showing up at the office. And in some cases even that wasn’t required. Cablevision Systems gave options to a deceased executive (in other words, to his heirs), backdating them to make it appear that he had received them while still alive. The moral of the story is that we still haven’t come to grips with the epidemic of corporate misgovernance revealed four years ago by the Enron and WorldCom scandals, then drowned out as a political issue by the clamor for war with Iraq. Even now, we’re still learning how deep the rot went. And there’s no reason to believe that the problem has been solved. Three years ago, Warren Buffett declared that reining in runaway executive pay was the “acid test of corporate reform.” Well, executive compensation, which fell briefly after the Enron and WorldCom scandals, has shot right back up. So we’re still waiting for serious corporate reform. And don’t tell me that everything must be O.K. because stocks have been rising lately. Remember, they rose even faster in the 1990’s — and the 1920’s.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/business/17options.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Old Options Still Haunt an Insurer<date>Published: October 17, 2006</date><text>When Stephen J. Hemsley joined UnitedHealth Group after 23 years with the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, he was greeted with a grant of 400,000 stock options dated shortly after he started in June 1997. Skip to next paragraph There was just one thing: the options carried a stock price based on the market price five months earlier, when he did not yet work for UnitedHealth, one of the largest health insurers in the country. The difference in dates effectively created a built-in gain of $7.26 for every share. Mr. Hemsley, who was chief financial officer at Andersen, said that he didnt recall focusing at the time that his options carried a discounted price and that there was not enough evidence to determine if the grant was actually backdated. But the episode, recounted in a 14-page report into UnitedHealths option practices, does raise some questions about Mr. Hemsley, who has taken the reins at UnitedHealth from Dr. William W. McGuire, who was forced to resign Sunday amid criticisms of how stock options were awarded. That obviously raises credibility issues, said Patrick McGurn, a corporate governance expert at Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm. We are seeing a lot of modified Sergeant Schultz defenses here, he said, referring to a character in the 1960s television series Hogans Heroes. They are not claiming to know nothing, but only part of what went on. Mr. Hemsley has not been accused of any wrongdoing. And the investigation by an outside law firm, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale &amp; Dorr, that was commissioned by UnitedHealth largely exonerates Mr. Hemsley, accepting his word that he never focused on his stock option grants and that had he had little or no role in the negotiation and authorization of a subsequent stock option megagrant. UnitedHealth declined to make Mr. Hemsley available for comment. His lawyer did not return calls seeking comment. In shaking up management, the board of UnitedHealth appeared to opt for a middle way between a clean sweep and retaining top executives who could continue the strong track record of Dr. McGuire. Mr. Hemsley is a skilled operations executive who helped execute Dr. McGuires strategies. Working together, the two helped take UnitedHealths stock price up more than 500 percent since mid-1997. And with lavish pay packages, both got very rich. Dr. McGuire banked more than $500 million during his 15 years as UnitedHealths chief executive and currently holds more than $1.1 billion worth of stock options. Mr. Hemsley has taken home more than $135 million and likely holds more than $500 million worth of stock options. As a result of the recent options problems, both voluntarily agreed to re-price all the options they were awarded from 1994 through 2002 to the annual high share price, eliminating any extra financial benefits from the improper grants. That move would take back only a tiny portion of the value of their outstanding options, but not affect the hundreds of millions of options each has already cashed out. Dr. McGuires option holdings will be reduced by about $100 million to a little over $1 billion, according to Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant. Mr. Hemsleys options will likely be reduced by an even smaller amount. Shares of UnitedHealth fell 2.5 percent yesterday, to $47.54. UnitedHealth is among the biggest of the more than 100 companies that have acknowledged possible problems with their options practices. And despite the ouster of Dr. McGuire, United Healths troubles are far from over. The Justice Department, the office of the Minnesota attorney general, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service all have investigations into the companys stock option practices. The company will also have to restate earnings, lowering past results by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. The investigation by Wilmer Cutler focused on 29 option grants that accounted for nearly 450 million stock options that the company granted between 1994 and 2002. Most of those grants, their report concluded, were likely backdated after investigators found that nearly 80 percent of the total number of options were granted at the second, third, or lowest price of the quarter. The odds of such a finding appear to defy the possibility of pure chance. The report absolves most of the directors from legal responsibility, but is critical of Dr. McGuire. It contends he authorized or sought the approval of the compensation committee for option grants at opportune times when the companys share price was depressed, including several times to directly benefit himself. The report indicates that investigators had little evidence to suggest that Mr. Hemsley, who had served as UnitedHealths president and chief operating officer, had direct knowledge of stock option problems or other improprieties. But the report does raise flags on whether he should have known more. Of the nine grants Mr. Hemsley was awarded between 1997 and 2002, for example, nearly half were issued when the stock was at or near a trough, according to an analysis of his stock option grants. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »When Stephen J.

McGuire, a medical entrepreneur who built the UnitedHealth Group into a colossus in its field, was forced to resign from the company yesterday and to give up a portion of the $1.1 billion he holds in harshly criticized stock options. Skip to next paragraph UnitedHealth, one of the nations two largest health insurers, also dismissed its general counsel and a member of its board in what amounted to a sweeping overhaul of its governance practices and leadership ranks. The options that Dr. McGuire had been granted over the years have led to criminal and civil investigations and public disapproval. In a sweeping report released yesterday that was highly critical of management, a law firm hired by UnitedHealth to investigate the timing of stock options concluded that the company was riddled with poor controls and conflicts of interest. The report, which the company posted on its Web site, found that UnitedHealth had backdated options to maximize employees compensation. The company said yesterday that the disputed options would be repriced from the lowest share price for the years in question to the highest prices, scaling back the earnings of Dr. McGuire and others. The company did not say precisely how much its executives would give up. The developments are the most dramatic to date since federal regulators started looking into the widespread practice of backdating stock options. More than 100 companies have come under scrutiny over the unlikely coincidence of stock options being granted again and again to senior executives on dates when the companys share price was low, a tactic that guaranteed the maximum profit when the options were turned into cash. Executives at several companies have already been forced to resign, and at UnitedHealth Group, it was announced that five other directors would be forced out over the next three years. At UnitedHealth, there was significant evidence that options were backdated for employees at all levels of the company between 1994 and 2002. But among the most substantial and egregious, according to the law firms report, were those awarded to Dr. McGuire, the companys longtime chairman and chief executive. Of the 12 options grants issued to Dr. McGuire, three just happened to be priced at the stocks lowest price that year. The Justice Department, the Minnesota Attorney Generals office, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service are all investigating UnitedHealths options practices. Most of the companies implicated in backdating controversies so far are Silicon Valley start-ups or firms with technology roots, where options with favorable dates were considered a recruitment tool in the dot-com boom. UnitedHealth, which has a market capitalization of $66 billion, is one of the few large blue-chip companies to stumble over the issue, and its problems underscore how prevalent the practice has been. Scrutiny over backdating also comes at a time of increasingly loud criticism of excesses of executive pay. At UnitedHealth, even the man named to replace Dr. McGuire as chief executive has been a beneficiary of backdated options: Stephen J. Hemsley, who has been Dr. McGuires top lieutenant, will lose a sizable portion of his options, the company said. Mr. Hemsley has voluntarily agreed to reprice all options awarded through 2002 to the annual high share price for each year, and to take any other appropriate action to eliminate any possible financial benefit from options-related issues, UnitedHealth said. Other senior UnitedHealth executives, including Dr. McGuire and the resigning general counsel, David J. Lubben, will take similar actions, the company said. In a lengthy and somewhat contrite statement after a board meeting yesterday, UnitedHealth announced that it would take a series of steps recommended by an outside law firm, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale &amp; Dorr, which had been hired by a special committee of UnitedHealth directors. The seven-month investigation led to a showdown that ended late yesterday after Dr. McGuire and the UnitedHealth board was presented with the findings. In their report, investigators from Wilmer Cutler found that most of the 29 stock grants that accounted for nearly 450 million stock options that the company awarded between 1994 and 2002 were likely backdated. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Dr. William W. McGuire, a medical entrepreneur who built the UnitedHealth Group into a colossus in its field, was forced to resign from the company yesterday and to give up a portion of the $1.1 billion he holds in harshly criticized stock options. Skip to next paragraph UnitedHealth, one of the nations two largest health insurers, also dismissed its general counsel and a member of its board in what amounted to a sweeping overhaul of its governance practices and leadership ranks. The options that Dr. McGuire had been granted over the years have led to criminal and civil investigations and public disapproval. In a sweeping report released yesterday that was highly critical of management, a law firm hired by UnitedHealth to investigate the timing of stock options concluded that the company was riddled with poor controls and conflicts of interest. The report, which the company posted on its Web site, found that UnitedHealth had backdated options to maximize employees compensation. The company said yesterday that the disputed options would be repriced from the lowest share price for the years in question to the highest prices, scaling back the earnings of Dr. McGuire and others. The company did not say precisely how much its executives would give up. The developments are the most dramatic to date since federal regulators started looking into the widespread practice of backdating stock options. More than 100 companies have come under scrutiny over the unlikely coincidence of stock options being granted again and again to senior executives on dates when the companys share price was low, a tactic that guaranteed the maximum profit when the options were turned into cash. Executives at several companies have already been forced to resign, and at UnitedHealth Group, it was announced that five other directors would be forced out over the next three years.

UnitedHealth Group, an insurance giant based in Minnesota, had a small presence in New York until 2004, when it bought Oxford. Last year, Oxford and United told thousands of doctors in New York that if they wanted to stay in or join one of the two insurers’ networks, they had to be in both. The suit, filed on Tuesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, says that that requirement violates state antitrust law and laws against unfair and deceptive trade practices. The plaintiffs are the Medical Society of the State of New York and several individual doctors practicing in New York City and on Long Island. They say that Oxford and United’s new rules, known as an “all-products” requirement, force doctors to do business with an insurer they dislike  because its payments are low, its paperwork is cumbersome or it does not cover some services  or risk losing many of their patients. And in many cases, they contend, Oxford and United have breached contracts with doctors. “This is the first time the Medical Society has brought a lawsuit expressly challenging an all-products provision,” said Donald R. Moy, the group’s general counsel. “Some other insurers have similar practices, but this is the most egregious one,” Mr. Moy said. In an exchange of e-mail messages, Maria Gordon Shydlo, a spokeswoman for Oxford and United  which still operate under separate names  said that the new system had improved customer service. She said it had added 6,600 doctors to United’s provider network in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and 3,800 doctors to Oxford’s network, while fewer than 1 percent of the combined companies’ providers had dropped out rather than accept the new requirement. “Our customers and employer groups now have had access to a broader network of physicians and providers on an in-network basis,” she said. But she did not address the allegations that the companies had violated state law or that they had breached contracts. In part, the suit reflects doctors’ frustration with the growing power of a handful of insurers, fueled by a series of mergers that has left consumers with fewer choices. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, the largest health insurer in New York, was taken over this year by WellPoint, the largest in the country; Oxford became part of United, the nation’s second-largest; GHI and HIP plan to merge; and there have been several takeovers of small insurers by larger ones. But the complaint is also the latest in a string of accusations by hospitals, doctors, patients and state regulators in New York, who say that Oxford and United subject doctors and hospitals to harsher and more unfair practices than other insurers. In 2000, the Medical Society filed suits against several insurers, charging them with unethical practices in their dealings with doctors. Most of those were consolidated in federal court with similar cases filed by doctors’ groups in other states. Most of the major insurers settled and agreed to change some practices; United has not settled. Mr. Moy said the society’s only other significant continuing suit against an insurer was also against United, challenging its definitions of “usual and customary” charges for medical care.

She was wrong  by almost $5,000. She had her operation at a hospital that was in Oxford Health Plans network. But Oxford, her insurer, says that because the surgeon was outside its network of doctors, the hospital bill as a whole would also be considered out of network, and therefore subject to less coverage. Oxford says its coverage policy is straightforward and properly communicated to its customers. But some health care experts say this policy is so unusual that they have never seen it before, and the hospital industry calls it the latest in a string of unfair practices by Oxford and its parent company, UnitedHealth Group, that are designed to avoid paying what is owed. The Healthcare Association of New York State, the main lobbying group for the states hospitals, has filed a complaint over Ms. Grecos case with Attorney General Eliot Spitzers office, which is looking into the matter. The groups leaders say they cannot recall ever making such a complaint against an insurer. Oxford, one of the largest insurers in the metropolitan area, insists that everyone involved should have understood in advance how it would handle Ms. Grecos bills. It was spelled out in the certificate of coverage the member receives when they sign up for the plan, said Maria Gordon-Shydlo, a spokeswoman for Oxford. Ms. Greco, 45, had surgery at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre, N.Y., a hospital in Oxfords network, so she expected everything except the surgeons fee to be completely covered. Instead, she learned months later that she was being charged a $1,000 deductible and 30 percent of all remaining costs, more than $4,700 in all. When she received the bill, she and her husband were both recovering from major medical treatment, they were out of work, they expected to lose their health insurance within months and they were trying to sell their home. We had no idea how we were going to pay it, she said. I just sat at the kitchen table and cried. Ms. Greco said, Its an unreasonable policy that an in-network hospital suddenly becomes an out-of-network hospital just because you use a different doctor. Officials at the hospital and the Healthcare Association said they had never heard of such a practice until she complained to them. They say they have since learned of a few insurance policies with similar provisions, but that in those cases, the rules are more clearly stated. Ms. Grecos troubles began more than two years ago, when she and her husband, Richard, were living in Smithtown, N.Y. Mr. Greco, an accountant and business consultant, had lymphoma and was forced to stop working. He had endured chemotherapy and was awaiting a bone marrow transplant. Expecting their insurance policy to run out in a few months, Ms. Greco had gastric bypass surgery in June 2004 at Mercy, using a surgeon she had met. My biggest concern was, because I was very overweight and he had a catastrophic illness, we werent going to be able to get insurance again, she said. She knew she had to pay 30 percent of the surgeons fee because he was not in Oxfords network, but she thought that everything else would be covered completely. She learned otherwise in the bill from Mercy. Mercy also stood to lose because of Oxfords position. Hospitals generally charge insurers higher prices for out-of-network patients than for others. When a hospital joins an insurers network, they negotiate a contract that includes much lower charges, and Mercy had such a contract with Oxford. Oxford paid the hospital based on the lower, in-network rates, even though the insurer told Ms. Greco that the service was out of network. And even at those lower rates, Oxford declined to pay the full amount, saying that Ms. Greco was responsible for the deductible, plus 30 percent of the remainder. Ms. Greco and the hospital say the only information Oxford gave them in advance about her operation was in written notices authorizing the surgery, which said nothing about her treatment being out of network. Oxford does not dispute that. Ms. Gordon-Shydlo said that when the surgeons office called Oxford to authorize the surgery, the insurer explained that hospital services would be considered out of network. But the surgeon had little reason to focus on coverage for the hospital bill. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in New York Region »Irene Greco knew she would have to pay from her own pocket to use the surgeon she wanted, rather than one in her insurers network, but she thought she knew how much the additional cost would be.

The company, based in Minnetonka, Minn., declined to discuss inquiries into its stock options practices, which have hurt its shares, beyond saying that a panel of its board members was still reviewing the issue. Net earnings rose 26 percent, to $974 million, or 70 cents a share, from $770 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 68 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Last year’s results were restated to account for new stock option expensing rules. Revenue jumped 57 percent, to $17.92 billion, above analyst estimates of $17.88 billion. The company cited its recent acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems and business from Medicare Part D, a new federal government program that provides prescription drug benefits to older people. UnitedHealth said its consolidated medical care ratio  an important profit barometer that measures medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues  improved a half-percentage point from the first quarter, to 82 percent. Enrollment in the company’s health care services stands at about 70 million, including 28.3 million in plans that provide broad benefits, the company said. “I think they’re the best positioned fundamentally of any of the H.M.O.’s,” said Les Funtleyder, an analyst at Miller Tabak &amp; Company. “The only issue  and it may turn out to be a nonissue and it may turn out to be a massive issue  is what’s going on with the options, and no one can answer that to any certainty right now.” UnitedHealth said in May it might have to restate past net earnings by as much as $286 million as it reviewed stock option practices that led to options worth about $1.6 billion for its chief executive at the end of 2005.

The case was perhaps the most closely watched corporate crime trial of the decade. GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY -- Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling did in fact deceive investors about the real financial straits at Enron, the once-highflying energy company that imploded in a wave of accounting scandals, as a midlevel executive once predicted. After hearing four months of testimony and deliberating for five days, jurors convicted Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman and for many years its chief executive, on six counts of conspiracy and fraud. He is 64 and could be sentenced to as much as 45 years in federal prison. The jury also convicted Mr. Skilling, who was an important adviser to Mr. Lay and was briefly Enron's chief executive, on 19 counts of conspiracy, fraud, insider trading and making false statements; it found him not guilty on nine counts, mostly insider trading. Mr. Skilling, 52, faces a maximum term of 185 years. Separately, in a nonjury trial, Federal District Judge Simeon T. Lake found Mr. Lay guilty of bank fraud for not telling Bank of America that he intended to use $75 million in personal loans to buy stock. Judge Lake said he would sentence Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling on Sept. 11. Both men were released on $5 million bond until then. FEEDING FRENZY -- Having been outflanked in its effort to acquire the London Stock Exchange, the NYSE Group, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, turned its attention to Euronext, the pan-European exchange, which it offered to buy for as much as $10.2 billion. If successful, the takeover would create the first trans-Atlantic stock exchange. Almost as soon as the NYSE offer was broached, another exchange, Deutsche Börse of Germany, stepped up and offered to buy Euronext for about $10.6 billion. Euronext, which runs stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Portugal, as well as a derivatives exchange in London, dismissed the German offer because it is partly payable in Deutsche Börse stock. Exchanges are interested in merging because that gives them access to more investors, which makes the exchanges more attractive to companies with stock to sell. NYSE's move may encourage the Nasdaq Stock Market to accelerate its incremental takeover of the London Stock Exchange. In a series of transaction, Nasdaq has amassed a 25 percent stake in the London market. TIMING IS EVERYTHING -- Federal investigators expanded their inquiry into how some companies granted stock options to their senior executives, suspecting that they may have been backdated to guarantee the executives the biggest possible gains. More than 20 companies have received subpoenas from the Justice Department seeking information on their executive stock option plans going back as far as a decade. The UnitedHealth Group is the biggest company to acknowledge receiving a subpoena so far. Many others are technology companies, including Juniper Networks and the KLA-Tencor Corporation. Legal experts say it is unclear whether backdating option awards is illegal, but several groups of investors have filed class-action lawsuits against companies suspected of the practice. UnitedHealth has told its shareholders that it may have to restate its results for the last three years, acknowledging a ''significant deficiency'' in its options program. SUSPICIOUSLY SMOOTH -- Senior executives at Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of mortgages, ''deliberately and systematically'' manipulated the company's financial results for years as part of an $11 billion accounting scandal, federal regulators concluded. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, said the manipulation was intended to smooth fluctuations in the company's earnings, letting Fannie Mae regularly meet or exceed earnings targets set by Wall Street and thus set in motion large bonuses for its executives. Ofheo said Franklin D. Raines, the former chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, was paid $90 million from 1998 to 2003. At least $52 million was tied to his meeting earnings targets that regulators say were reached by manipulating accounting.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/business/18united.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">U.S. Subpoenas UnitedHealth on Stock Options<date>Published: May 18, 2006</date><text>By Reuters The health insurer UnitedHealth Group said yesterday that it had received a subpoena from the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, requesting documents from 1999 relating to the granting of stock options. The company also said it had received a request from the Internal Revenue Service for documents from 2003 relating to stock options and other compensation for executive officers named in its annual proxy statements. UnitedHealth said it would cooperate with both offices. Last week, UnitedHealth said it might have to restate past earnings by as much as $286 million as it reviewed stock option practices.

UnitedHealth said it would cooperate with both offices. Last week, UnitedHealth said it might have to restate past earnings by as much as $286 million as it reviewed stock option practices. The health insurer also said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal inquiry into its stock option granting practices. It said previously that it had received a call from S.E.C. staff members on the issue. UnitedHealth has been under scrutiny for possible backdating of options. Backdating occurs when a company sets the grant price for the stock option retroactively to maximize potential profit to the recipient. The company has granted unexercised stock options to its chief executive, William W. McGuire, worth some $1.6 billion as of the end of 2005, according to the company's proxy statement filed April 7.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/business/12united.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">UnitedHealth May Restate Its Earnings<date>Published: May 12, 2006</date><text>By Reuters The health insurer UnitedHealth Group said yesterday that it might have to restate past earnings by as much as $286 million as it reviews stock option practices that led to a $1.6 billion windfall for its chief executive.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic: Many Plans, Few Winners The figures provided a snapshot of a business that has been plagued by start-up problems, but could prove to be a fast-growing and profitable enterprise for insurers. More than 80 companies are offering more than 1,400 prescription drug plans around the country. But three companies  UnitedHealth, Humana and WellPoint  account for 52 percent of the enrollment. And the top 10 companies have 80 percent of the total. Two strategies have proved particularly effective for the market leaders. UnitedHealth has the exclusive right to use the AARP name on one of its prescription drug plans, and its marketing strategy relies heavily on that brand. Humana, by contrast, is marketing itself as the low-price provider in most regions, offering premiums of less than $2 a month in several states, including Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota. Beneficiaries face a May 15 deadline to sign up for drug coverage. People who miss the deadline will generally not have another opportunity until November and may then face higher premiums as a penalty for late enrollment. John K. Gorman, a former Medicare official who is now a health care consultant, said: "UnitedHealth, through its alliance with AARP, and WellPoint are winning on brand recognition. Humana and another company, MemberHealth, are winning on price. The AARP brand is a license to print money. When seniors are confused and scared about making the wrong choice, brand recognition and trust go a long, long way." When Congress created the drug benefit in 2003, lawmakers had no idea how many insurers would enter the market. By March 2005, it was clear that many companies saw an opportunity, with the aging of the population. In addition, they said, federal subsidies minimized the financial risks for insurers in the first few years of the program. About 13.9 million of the 42 million Medicare beneficiaries are now in prescription drug plans. UnitedHealth has 3.8 million subscribers, or 27 percent of the total. Humana has 2.4 million, or 18 percent, and WellPoint has 1 million, or 7 percent. Companies with the next largest shares are MemberHealth, with 924,100 subscribers (7 percent); WellCare Health Plans, with 849,700 (6 percent); and Coventry Health Care, with 596,100 (4 percent). UnitedHealth has the largest enrollment in 29 states, including California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Humana has the largest enrollment in 13 states, including Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have the largest enrollment in Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey and Oklahoma. Most of the companies that sell stand-alone drug coverage also offer managed-care plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans, which provide comprehensive health coverage, including drug benefits. Insurers say that the Medicare Advantage business is more profitable and that they hope people who sign up for drug plans will move into managed care. About 5.9 million people are in Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage, the Bush administration reported on Friday. UnitedHealth had the most beneficiaries, 1.2 million, 20 percent of the total. The UnitedHealth numbers include people who signed up for products offered by PacifiCare, which merged with United in December. Other big participants in this segment of the market include Kaiser Permanente, with 821,500 subscribers, accounting for 14 percent of all enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans; Humana, with 792,500 subscribers (13 percent); Highmark, with 226,400 (4 percent); Health Net, with 167,400 (3 percent); and WellPoint, with 133,800 (2 percent). Medicare officials said they expected to see some consolidation of the market for drug coverage next year, as insurers drop out of the business or gobble up competitors. Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has said he expected to see fewer drug plans in the market next year. Comparatively small numbers signed up for the stand-alone drug plans offered by two large insurance companies. Aetna got 286,900 subscribers, or 2 percent, while Cigna got 170,900, or 1 percent.

McGuire, the chairman and chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, said on Tuesday that he had asked his board to stop awarding new stock options to senior executives. Mr. McGuire's announcement follows reports in The Wall Street Journal that he and some other UnitedHealth executives were granted options dated at or near the stock's yearly low points before 2002  maximizing the executives' profit when the options were exercised later. Mr. McGuire held more than $1.6 billion in unexercised options at the end of 2005, according to regulatory filings. UnitedHealth, the nation's second-biggest health insurer after WellPoint, also reported on Tuesday that its first-quarter profit climbed 21 percent and that its revenue jumped almost 58 percent, propelled by its acquisition of PacifiCare. Mr. McGuire said in a conference call that he was recommending that the board "forgo for the foreseeable future further equity-based grants or awards for our most senior and longest-tenured executives, for whom equity positions are well-established from prior years of service." Mr. McGuire has led the company since 1989. He said the company's board would consider the idea at its next meeting, in early May. He also said he was recommending that the board cap some executive retirement plans and get rid of noncash perks. Mr. McGuire benefits from personal use of the company's aircraft, The Journal reported on Tuesday. This month, UnitedHealth, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., disclosed that a committee of its independent directors was looking into its "current and historic stock option grant practices" in the midst of an inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission. "I can say that, to my knowledge, every member of management in this company believes that, at the time, we collectively followed appropriate practices for those option grants which affected all of our employees, not simply selected executives, and that such activities were within guidelines and consistent with our stated program objectives," Mr. McGuire said. If the director's review finds they did not, "the board and I along with the rest of the management team will ensure appropriate remedial action is taken to protect fully the shareholders' interest," he said. He did not directly answer an analyst's question about whether he backdated stock options, which would not necessarily be illegal. "We sleep with good conscience," he said. Mr. McGuire was paid $8 million last year and did not exercise any stock options. But he exercised $114.5 million in options in 2004, propelling him to the No. 3 spot on the Forbes list of best-paid chief executives. UnitedHealth shares dropped $2, or 3.9 percent, to close at $49.67 on the New York Stock Exchange, down from a high of $64.61 in December. In its earnings report, UnitedHealth said its profit rose to $899 million, or 63 cents a share, for the January-March period, from $743 million, or 55 cents a share, during the period last year.

Analysts blame profit-taking by big investors who have sold their insurance stocks and transferred their bets to commodities and energy. A leading insurer, UnitedHealth Group, is to report first-quarter results on Tuesday, with other major competitors issuing earnings data over the next few weeks. The sector is expected by a Citigroup analyst, Charles Boorady, to report a drop of 2 percent in earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2005 though an 11 percent increase over last year's first quarter. Phillip Seligman, a health care analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, is a bit of a skeptic. "After tremendous growth in stock prices throughout the industry," he said, "the question is whether we will see similar growth going forward. Many investors do not expect that." But some analysts say that the prices of United and WellPoint, the two largest health insurers, have dropped low enough to rekindle investor interest, at least for short-term buyers. "WellPoint and UnitedHealth are getting into an attractive valuation level," said Larry Feinberg, a managing partner at Oracle Partners, a health care hedge fund that does not now own the stocks. After a losing day in the sector Monday, WellPoint rose 51 cents yesterday, to $73.19. That was down from a 52-week closing high of $80 in December, but well above a split-adjusted closing low of $58.51 last April. UnitedHealth gained $1.91 yesterday, to $53.46. The stock reached a 52-week closing high of $63.79 in December and a split-adjusted closing low of $44.30 in April 2005. Several analysts said United's share price had not been helped by a confirmation in its proxy statement last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission was questioning the timing of stock options granted by senior executives, among those at other companies. United said in the proxy that a committee of independent directors would review its options practices. United has had significant growth in the number of members in high-deductible insurance plans, which come with relatively low monthly premiums and may be offered through an employer. But the company has said it expects to report 150,000 fewer members in its large-employer commercial business for the first quarter  not counting members acquired through the acquisitions of other insurers. For one thing, it has lost some business covering state employees. Sheryl R. Skolnick, an analyst with the CRT Capital Group, said the increase in high-deductible policies meant less revenue for each member but "not necessarily that much lower profit, because it is a much skinnier benefit package." Sometimes, people end up not using the coverage their health plans provide for catastrophic problems, she noted, so the insurer's costs may be minimal because the policies tend to cover fewer routine services. Because the companies are getting deeper into government business with the advent of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, their financial results will be complicated by government spending patterns. The insurers will provide drug coverage for millions of new Medicare customers this year, but the subsidies to pay for those purchases are not likely to arrive until later in the year. Profit margins on these members are expected to be slim, though the companies see them as a chance to expand more lucrative types of Medicare-related business. For United, the largest participant in the insurance market for older people, including 4.3 million Part D drug customers, first-quarter profit is likely to be 58 cents a share, down from 62 cents in the final quarter of 2005. But analysts say United has assured them that profit for the full year will be $2.85 to $2.90 a share, compared with $2.36 in 2005, counting the expected Part D money. Mr. Boorady of Citigroup said in his report that in the first quarter, some investors were avoiding insurers like United and Humana, which have the biggest Part D memberships, and moving to Aetna and Cigna, with much smaller Part D enrollment. "Aetna is among the best-run commercial plans," he said, and Cigna is in a turnaround phase that may provide "upside earnings surprises." President Bush has requested cuts in Medicare spending in his latest budget, but Congess is unlikely to approve such cuts in an election year, in the view of Ira S. Loss of Washington Analysis, which monitors federal agencies for investors. What's more, Mr. Bush has been a strong defender of the insurers, and they have been given incentives in the form of generous managed-care payments under Medicare to encourage the companies' participation in the Part D program. Congressional Democrats say that federal payments for Medicare H.M.O.'s and other Medicare insurance programs could be reduced by $40 billion over 10 years if such subsidies were curtailed. But many analysts do not expect any trimming, even if the Democrats gain seats in Congress in November's elections. "In a couple of years, they will be ripe for budget-cutting," Mr. Loss said, "but as long as Bush is around, he will be in a strong position to protect them." More Articles in Business »After five years of stock market gains, shares of health insurance companies have been on a slide so far this year, down 8.6 percent since Jan. 1, as measured by a Standard &amp; Poor's index of health insurers. Analysts blame profit-taking by big investors who have sold their insurance stocks and transferred their bets to commodities and energy. A leading insurer, UnitedHealth Group, is to report first-quarter results on Tuesday, with other major competitors issuing earnings data over the next few weeks. The sector is expected by a Citigroup analyst, Charles Boorady, to report a drop of 2 percent in earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2005 though an 11 percent increase over last year's first quarter. Phillip Seligman, a health care analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, is a bit of a skeptic. "After tremendous growth in stock prices throughout the industry," he said, "the question is whether we will see similar growth going forward. Many investors do not expect that." But some analysts say that the prices of United and WellPoint, the two largest health insurers, have dropped low enough to rekindle investor interest, at least for short-term buyers. "WellPoint and UnitedHealth are getting into an attractive valuation level," said Larry Feinberg, a managing partner at Oracle Partners, a health care hedge fund that does not now own the stocks. After a losing day in the sector Monday, WellPoint rose 51 cents yesterday, to $73.19. That was down from a 52-week closing high of $80 in December, but well above a split-adjusted closing low of $58.51 last April. UnitedHealth gained $1.91 yesterday, to $53.46. The stock reached a 52-week closing high of $63.79 in December and a split-adjusted closing low of $44.30 in April 2005. Several analysts said United's share price had not been helped by a confirmation in its proxy statement last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission was questioning the timing of stock options granted by senior executives, among those at other companies. United said in the proxy that a committee of independent directors would review its options practices. United has had significant growth in the number of members in high-deductible insurance plans, which come with relatively low monthly premiums and may be offered through an employer. But the company has said it expects to report 150,000 fewer members in its large-employer commercial business for the first quarter  not counting members acquired through the acquisitions of other insurers. For one thing, it has lost some business covering state employees. Sheryl R. Skolnick, an analyst with the CRT Capital Group, said the increase in high-deductible policies meant less revenue for each member but "not necessarily that much lower profit, because it is a much skinnier benefit package." Sometimes, people end up not using the coverage their health plans provide for catastrophic problems, she noted, so the insurer's costs may be minimal because the policies tend to cover fewer routine services. Because the companies are getting deeper into government business with the advent of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, their financial results will be complicated by government spending patterns. The insurers will provide drug coverage for millions of new Medicare customers this year, but the subsidies to pay for those purchases are not likely to arrive until later in the year. Profit margins on these members are expected to be slim, though the companies see them as a chance to expand more lucrative types of Medicare-related business. For United, the largest participant in the insurance market for older people, including 4.3 million Part D drug customers, first-quarter profit is likely to be 58 cents a share, down from 62 cents in the final quarter of 2005. But analysts say United has assured them that profit for the full year will be $2.85 to $2.90 a share, compared with $2.36 in 2005, counting the expected Part D money. Mr. Boorady of Citigroup said in his report that in the first quarter, some investors were avoiding insurers like United and Humana, which have the biggest Part D memberships, and moving to Aetna and Cigna, with much smaller Part D enrollment. "Aetna is among the best-run commercial plans," he said, and Cigna is in a turnaround phase that may provide "upside earnings surprises."

If only the real world would cooperate. My father is 92 years old, lives in a nursing home and takes 10 prescription drugs, paid for from his savings and Social Security income. His medicines cost him $636.88 a month, or $7,642.56 a year.

He currently gets a discount on his drugs because he has a Medigap policy, which he buys for $93.23 a month from AARP to cover some health care costs not picked up by Medicare. Without the AARP Medigap discount, his drugs would cost nearly 40 percent more: $1,044.72 a month, or $12,536.64 a year. So how does he - or actually, my sister and I, who manage his affairs - slash through the dozens of Medicare drug plans available in the part of suburban Washington where he lives? How do we decide whether he should sign up for any of them and, if so, figure out the best plan for him? My sister, Martha Bari, to avoid the onerous research she was fearing, considered simply choosing an insurer with a trusted name. A likely candidate was UnitedHealthcare, the company used by the AARP Medigap program. But when I looked at the Medicare Web site the research tool there seemed easy to use. The site lets the user compare drug plans, based on the information one enters. I called Martha and told her I wanted to give it a try. It turns out that you really do need a computer to sort through drug plans because there are so many variables. What drugs are you taking? Where do you live? What plans are in your area? Are you willing to switch to generics if they are an option? Do you care which pharmacy supplies your drugs? Do you want to order them by mail? Are you in a nursing home that uses only one pharmacy? Those considerations can affect the price you will be charged. And, depending on how big a discount a plan offers, you may be better off with one that does not cover all of them but that deeply discounts the drugs it does cover. In terms of your out-of-pocket expenses, such a plan might work better than a plan that covers every drug but offers smaller discounts. I set to work, blithely thinking I could sort things out in half an hour. I discovered, instead, that it took two days to get the information I needed before even starting to use the Medicare Web site. First I had to find out what drugs my father was actually taking and how much he paid for them. Initially, Martha and I understood that my father was taking eight drugs. Only after checking with the nursing home did she get the complete list of 10. Then I called AARP to find out exactly what type of Medigap plan my father has and what it covers. Next came a call to the pharmacy to find out what the drugs would cost without my father's AARP discount, which involved providing a list of the medications and then waiting for a callback with the prices. And how would my father's Medigap policy be affected if he signed up for the Medicare drug plan? Would the Medigap plan pick up some of his leftover drug costs? And if it no longer covered his drugs, would his Medigap premium decrease? I eventually learned in a phone conversation with Jim Pogue, who manages AARP insurance for the UnitedHealth Group, that my father's Medigap plan would provide discounts on any drug not covered by a Part D plan. But the Medigap premium would remain the same whether or not he needed the supplemental drug coverage. That meant that unless a Medicare plan was cheaper than the $7,642.56 a year my father pays for his drugs with the AARP discount, he might as well not sign up for a new plan. Finally, after two days and many phone calls, I had the information I needed. And the actual process of comparing drug plans was fun - a breeze, in fact. Last Friday, I plugged my father's drugs into the Medicare Web site. I specified their doses and the preferred pharmacy, which is 35 miles from his nursing home but the only one the nursing home will use. Voila! I got a list of 42 plans. They were ranked in order, based on what my father's total annual out-of-pocket expense for his drugs would be, including the monthly drug premium and the annual deductible for each plan. I had the ability to compare any three plans side by side, in as many combinations as I chose. The variations were astonishing, with the estimated yearly cost varying by more than 100 percent. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in Business &gt;Signing up my father for a Medicare drug plan should be simple, especially because the Medicare.gov Web site is well designed and easy to use.

Fred and Ethel Mertz. They're not likely to knock Paris Hilton or Brad and Angelina off the cover of People.

Skip to next paragraph Fred and Ethel Mertz, arguing over the Medicare drug plan in an ad. While the total expenditures are anyone's guess at this point, in the next few months hundreds of millions of dollars are likely to be spent trying to get millions of older Americans to sign up for the new Medicare prescription drug benefits that take effect on Jan. 1. The federal government itself is prepared to spend $100 million this year on the informational effort. Under Medicare rules, the advertising could not begin until this past weekend. But because the federally subsidized Medicare drug plans will be sold and administered by private industry, insurers and pharmacy chains are now making a big push to grab shares of the new business. It will not be an easy sell, though. To begin with, the target audience - elderly and disabled people - is largely well outside the 18-to-34-year-old demographic that typically attracts marketers' time and money. Among other considerations, reaching older people means using heavier-than-usual components of daytime television and direct mail, according to Frank McCauley, head of retiree marketing for Aetna. And the call to action will be a challenge: trying to persuade the elderly to sift through dozens of drug insurance plans, each with its own complexities, to find the one that works, most affordably, for them. Premiums range from less than $2 to more than $60 a month, depending on where a person lives and the range of drugs available on preferred lists. The added amounts of out-of-pocket co-payments will also vary widely. "All of this is a communication nightmare," said Ann Stuchiner, a marketing executive in New York at the advertising agency Foote Cone &amp; Belding, which does not have clients in the Medicare sweepstakes. In some cases, depending on whether a patient's drug needs will land them in the "doughnut hole" - a gap in which patients are responsible for paying 100 percent of drug bills between $2,250 and $5,100 annually, while still paying the monthly premium for the drug benefit - a consumer may conclude that there is no point in participating in the new Medicare program. Assuming, of course, a consumer can figure out how to make that calculation in the first place. "It's a very complicated plan to explain to people who have a range of health literacy and a range of computer literacy," Ms. Stuchiner said. "Physicians and pharmacies need to be very well educated. That's who seniors are going to turn to, but they don't know very much either." As a result, many of the TV ads will emphasize the friendly and familiar. In a national campaign that started running over the weekend and relies on computer-altered film clips from the "I Love Lucy" series of the 1950's, the Mertzes (the late actors Vivian Vance and William Frawley) squabble about a Medicare subscription drug plan offered by PacifiCare, a California insurer seeking customers nationwide.

By adding PacifiCare's 3.3 million enrollees, UnitedHealth will have 25.7 million members. That would make it a bigger competitor to the leader in health insurance, WellPoint, which has 27.7 million members and was created by last year's $16.5 billion merger of WellPoint and Anthem. But UnitedHealth's chief executive, Dr. William McGuire, said yesterday that gaining size was not as important in the deal as expanding the company's presence in Medicare and in Western states where PacifiCare is strong. Skip to next paragraph G. Paul Burnett/The New York Times Dr. William McGuire, the chief executive of UnitedHealth Group. If shareholders and state and federal regulators approve the deal, PacifiCare, based in Cypress, Calif., would operate as a wholly owned unit of UnitedHealth, which is based in Minneapolis. UnitedHealth would gain an array of services for the rapidly growing Medicare population, including private Medicare-subsidized insurance plans, Medigap supplemental coverage for people who subscribe to conventional fee-for-service Medicare and the new Medicare drug coverage benefit that begins next January. During the next decade, 10 million people will join the ranks of Americans 65 and older, who now number 36.7 million, Dr. McGuire said yesterday in a telephone interview. The merger, he said, will advance "the notion of being able to take care of people in a boundaryless world through all stages of life from newborns to the elderly across the country." PacifiCare currently has 705,000 Medicare enrollees through its Secure Horizons unit, which has H.M.O.'s in California, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington State, Oregon and Nevada. UnitedHealth has 320,000 enrollees in Medicare plans and 3.8 million others to whom it provides Medigap coverage under a partnership with AARP, the big advocacy group for people age 50 and older. Wall Street analysts noted that UnitedHealth was acquiring a widely known brand in Secure Horizons while also obtaining PacifiCare's small managed-care prescriptions unit, with 5.6 million members. UnitedHealth has been providing drug benefits through Medco Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefits giant with 60 million people covered. Dr. McGuire said Medco would remain UnitedHealth's primary drug manager for commercial customers. But the prospect of the PacifiCare deal's eventually altering that arrangement helped send Medco's stock tumbling yesterday by more than 4 percent, closing yesterday at $50.75, down $2.15. UnitedHealth Group and PacifiCare have filed an array of Medicare drug plans with the government ahead of next year's start of that federal program. United already planned to offer Medicare drugs in partnership with Walgreens - both in stores and by mail. "They have a brand portfolio that would probably make Procter &amp; Gamble weak in the knees if it was in that business," said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. Under the agreement announced yesterday, each PacifiCare share will be exchanged for 1.1 shares of UnitedHealth Group plus $21.50 in cash - an arrangement that values PacifiCare at $80.05 a share, or a 10 percent premium over its closing price on Tuesday. Yesterday, PacifiCare's stock closed at $77.09, up $4.41. UnitedHealth's stock rose 27 cents, to $53.50. Dr. McGuire, who has been chief executive since 1990, has expanded UnitedHealth with a string of acquisitions, including last year's deals for Oxford Health Plans and Mid-Atlantic Medical Services on the East Coast. UnitedHealth last year also acquired Definity Health, a small technology-driven company that offers services for medical savings plans that have high annual deductibles and enable healthy people to accrue money for their eventual medical needs. UnitedHealth prides itself on using databases, the Internet and technology like magnetic-swipe medical identification cards to "save money, lower costs and make things simpler for consumers," Dr. McGuire said. "We are really intent on cutting down on hassle." Analysts noted that there are risks in expanding the company's Medicare business because the field is subject to abrupt changes in deficit-stressed federal budgets. PacifiCare, for example, cut its Medicare business by 40 percent after Congress limited increases in payments in the late 1990's. By 2003, the cuts had been restored, bringing profitability to PacifiCare, whose $85.7 million in net income for this year's first quarter was up 28 percent from a year earlier, exceeding analysts' forecasts. 1 2Next Page &gt; Correction: July 8, 2005, Friday: A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems omitted the date for the figures, which ranked health insurers by enrolled membership.

UnitedHealth has 320,000 enrollees in Medicare plans and 3.8 million others to whom it provides Medigap coverage under a partnership with AARP, the big advocacy group for people age 50 and older. Wall Street analysts noted that UnitedHealth was acquiring a widely known brand in Secure Horizons while also obtaining PacifiCare's small managed-care prescriptions unit, with 5.6 million members. UnitedHealth has been providing drug benefits through Medco Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefits giant with 60 million people covered. Dr. McGuire said Medco would remain UnitedHealth's primary drug manager for commercial customers. But the prospect of the PacifiCare deal's eventually altering that arrangement helped send Medco's stock tumbling yesterday by more than 4 percent, closing yesterday at $50.75, down $2.15. UnitedHealth Group and PacifiCare have filed an array of Medicare drug plans with the government ahead of next year's start of that federal program. United already planned to offer Medicare drugs in partnership with Walgreens - both in stores and by mail. "They have a brand portfolio that would probably make Procter &amp; Gamble weak in the knees if it was in that business," said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. Under the agreement announced yesterday, each PacifiCare share will be exchanged for 1.1 shares of UnitedHealth Group plus $21.50 in cash - an arrangement that values PacifiCare at $80.05 a share, or a 10 percent premium over its closing price on Tuesday. Yesterday, PacifiCare's stock closed at $77.09, up $4.41. UnitedHealth's stock rose 27 cents, to $53.50. Dr. McGuire, who has been chief executive since 1990, has expanded UnitedHealth with a string of acquisitions, including last year's deals for Oxford Health Plans and Mid-Atlantic Medical Services on the East Coast. UnitedHealth last year also acquired Definity Health, a small technology-driven company that offers services for medical savings plans that have high annual deductibles and enable healthy people to accrue money for their eventual medical needs. UnitedHealth prides itself on using databases, the Internet and technology like magnetic-swipe medical identification cards to "save money, lower costs and make things simpler for consumers," Dr. McGuire said. "We are really intent on cutting down on hassle." Analysts noted that there are risks in expanding the company's Medicare business because the field is subject to abrupt changes in deficit-stressed federal budgets. PacifiCare, for example, cut its Medicare business by 40 percent after Congress limited increases in payments in the late 1990's. By 2003, the cuts had been restored, bringing profitability to PacifiCare, whose $85.7 million in net income for this year's first quarter was up 28 percent from a year earlier, exceeding analysts' forecasts. 1 2Next Page &gt; Correction: July 8, 2005, Friday: A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems omitted the date for the figures, which ranked health insurers by enrolled membership.

But some analysts see trouble ahead. The share prices of three of the largest insurers - WellPoint, UnitedHealth Group and Cigna - reached 52-week highs early this month, at the peak of a two-year surge in the stocks of managed care companies. But since April 7, the big insurers have led the way down as a Standard &amp; Poor's index of managed care stocks fell 8.4 percent while the broader S.&amp; P. 500-stock index slipped only 3.3 percent. It did not help when UnitedHealth, the second-largest managed care company, reported that it had added fewer members in the first quarter than it forecast. Some investors paid more attention to that than to the 41 percent profit increase UnitedHealth reported for the quarter. UnitedHealth was showing the effects of a national trend. Although 175 million Americans are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance, further declines in manufacturing jobs and a spotty economic recovery have braked increases in enrollment. And by the latest count, the number of people without health insurance has risen to 45 million. "Enrollment growth in the industry has slowed to a crawl," said Joseph D. France, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. So investors will be paying close attention today and tomorrow to the enrollment data for the first quarter to be reported by WellPoint and Aetna as part of their financial results. WellPoint, the largest managed care company, with 28 million people enrolled, is expected today to report a 14 percent increase in profit, to $1.83 a share, from the first quarter a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial. Aetna, the third largest, with 13.7 million enrollees, plans to report its results tomorrow. The analysts' consensus is $1.07 a share, up 22 percent from last year. UnitedHealth, with 22.4 million members in its medical care programs, is widely admired for its strong management and its strategic moves into new product lines. One expanding business is sales to large employers offering their workers high-deductible policies combined with health savings accounts, although the 135,000 new members in the first quarter were a relatively modest addition by UnitedHealth standards. United's sharply higher profit was helped by lower-than-expected medical costs for hospitals and drugs. Patients spent less time in hospitals, possibly reflecting a push by insurers for prompt discharges, as well as higher co-payments required of patients. Drug outlays dropped as some doctors stopped prescribing Vioxx, Celebrex and similar expensive painkillers amid concern about their cardiovascular risks. And analysts say managed care stocks also benefited when many investors responded by bailing out of drug stocks and putting their money into organizations like WellPoint and UnitedHealth. Whether this tide will soon turn is hard to predict. But movements in and out of drug stocks can make very big waves, said Jason Nogueira, a managed care analyst at T. Rowe Price. He said that the market capitalization of Pfizer, the biggest drug company, was greater than the combined market value of all the managed care companies. Charles A. Boorady, an analyst at Smith Barney who is bullish on managed care, said some investors returning to pharmaceutical stocks might have contributed to the recent decline in H.M.O. share prices. He is forecasting strong earnings growth for managed care companies from 2006 to 2008, mainly as a result of Medicare drug coverage, which begins next year and will represent a new line of business for insurers that administer some of those drug plans. But Sheryl R. Skolnick, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners, said the new Medicare drug benefit was still "a great unknown opportunity." Companies that have said they will participate, including Aetna, UnitedHealth and WellPoint, expect to generate new profits, but, she said, "until the bids are formulated and awarded, nobody knows how much to expect." Certainly the new drug coverage presents plenty of risk for the insurers. They will receive a fixed monthly payment for each Medicare member, and it will be up to the companies to keep their costs below those payments. "There are danger signs out there," said Matthew Borsch, a Goldman Sachs analyst. He discounts the Medicare potential, except for PacifiCare and Humana, which al ready have lots of Medicare beneficiaries and so are ready to take on more. Medicare will be only "an incremental positive" for most of the companies, Mr. Borsch said. "It doesn't transform the earnings picture." He is more concerned about chances that nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, many sitting on fat surpluses, will eventually cut prices and force competitors to follow suit. "We are pointing to a downside risk in the second half of 2005," he said. Mr. France at Banc of America Securities is also gloomy. "The business is going to get more difficult, after five years of expanding margins," he said. "We think 2006 will be tough."</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EEDE113EF936A25757C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">COMPANY NEWS; UNITED HEALTHCARE'S EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS<date>Published: April 15, 2005</date><text>UnitedHealth Group said yesterday that first-quarter earnings rose 41 percent from a year ago, driven by higher premiums and strong customer growth.

While many companies have toned down anti-shareholder practices, investors must remain vigilant for executives and boards that are still in the Stone Age. Advertisement That is the conclusion drawn by researchers at GovernanceMetrics International, a two-year-old independent research firm in New York that scrutinizes corporate governance practices for institutional shareholders. "For too long governance screening hasn't been part of the investment process," said Gavin Anderson, chief executive of GovernanceMetrics. "But investors are realizing that this is another area they need to monitor." The firm has just finished examining practices at 3,220 companies around the world. Of those companies, only 34 received GovernanceMetrics's highest rating of 10. Happily for American investors, most of these - 27 - were United States companies. These companies, Mr. Anderson noted, have outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index by an average of 11.13 percent for the 12 months ended Feb. 28. The average American company earned a rating of 7 from GovernanceMetrics. Other good news: the number of independent directors at the companies has climbed to 55 percent from 52 percent in 2003. And fewer companies have chairmen who are also chief executives: 39 percent, versus 47 percent in 2003. But GovernanceMetrics found questionable practices at many companies. Executive pay was the No. 1 culprit, at least in the United States. Pay issues accounted for 31 percent of the red flags it issued on domestic companies, versus 6 percent of those issued on European companies. Only 5 percent of Asian companies exhibited pay problems. Of course, lapses in governance do not necessarily lead to poor performance at a company. But enough investors have lost big money in companies where conduct was questionable that governance should be a constant consideration. Just look at Krispy Kreme, the formerly faddish doughnut maker. A hot stock for many years, Krispy Kreme has lost 81 percent of its value in the past year as its accounting has come under scrutiny. In June 2003, GovernanceMetrics gave Krispy Kreme relatively low marks for its policies, ranking it 4 out of 10 over all. Then, in January 2004, the firm dropped its rating to 2.5. In July, Krispy Kreme disclosed that securities regulators were investigating its accounting. The firm's recent study has turned up red flags at a number of companies. For example, it assigned demerits to UnitedHealth Group, a manager of organized health systems, because of the employment agreement it has struck with its chief executive, Dr. William W. McGuire. The agreement requires the company's shareholders to make generous annual payments to Dr. McGuire if he is terminated, no matter the reason. And if he dies after his departure, his surviving spouse is entitled to half the benefit. Dr. McGuire would have received $5.1 million a year under this plan if he had retired at the end of 2003. Mark F. Lindsay, a spokesman for UnitedHealth, objected to GovernanceMetrics's criticism, saying that the payout represented Dr. McGuire's pension and was modest when compared with the lofty returns shareholders in the company have received as a result of his leadership. "His compensation reflects our corporate performance and that has been, without equivocation, superlative," Mr. Lindsay said. Indeed, UnitedHealth's stock is up almost 50 percent over the last 12 months. Large companies getting below-average overall ratings from GovernanceMetrics include Molex Inc., which makes electronic equipment, and K-Swiss, the athletic shoe manufacturer. Molex received a 2.5 rating from the research firm because of board independence issues and a questionable internal control and financial reporting structure. Indeed, last Nov. 15, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Molex's outside auditor, resigned when it identified errors in accounting for inventory that had overstated the company's income. Molex recorded a charge of $5.8 million as a result but said that an investigation by its audit committee had found no wrongdoing.

The contract represented about 5.5 percent of Perot's revenue and gross profit, the company said. While it did not expect the loss to have a material impact on financial results during the next 15 months, Perot said the outsourcing work with Harvard Pilgrim would end within the following 12 months.

The program, to begin in the fall, will be offered for at least two years and is intended to cover uninsured part-time and temporary workers, contractors, consultants and early retirees, who typically are not eligible for employer health plans. The sponsors, which include General Electric, I.B.M., McDonald's and Sears, Roebuck, will begin promoting the low-cost plans in April and May to 3 million eligible workers, about 7 percent of the 45 million uninsured Americans. They hope that several hundred thousand people will sign up at the start. The employers will not subsidize the coverage, but their participation created a pool of potential participants sufficiently large to justify lower insurance rates than individuals would have to pay on their own. These options, to be offered to part-time employees, are not intended to replace employer-paid health plans that are already in place for full-time workers. The sponsors also acknowledged that these low-cost plans will not by themselves solve the problem of the uninsured. The plans will range widely in cost from $5 a month for a card that provides users with discounts for doctors and pharmacies to more than $300 a month for a high-deductible plan that covers major medical and hospital expenses. UnitedHealth Group will offer the four lowest-cost options in all 50 states. UnitedHealth and Humana will offer the major medical policies in states where they have been approved by regulators. Cigna will offer the program's major medical option in Arizona. "Nothing like this has ever been done before," said Andy Slavitt, a UnitedHealth executive. The 60 employers are supporting this program because they say they ultimately pay for the uninsured as hospitals pass on their costs for nonpaying patients. They expect the program to help reduce employee turnover and increase productivity among part-timers. The low-cost options, they said, could also help older employees maintain some form of health coverage if they choose to stop working full time but cannot afford $25,000 or more a year to buy their own coverage. Leaders in the group expressed hope that government policy makers might consider this approach in making health coverage more affordable. It may also be a way for employers to stave off proposed state mandates for coverage of uninsured workers. In a referendum last fall, California voters overturned a 2003 law requiring companies to buy health insurance for workers and their families. "We have a model that doesn't require enabling legislation," said Tom Beauregard, a health strategy specialist at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. "The private sector can't wait for the government to act." Beginning in September, all participants in the program will receive a card providing discounts from doctors, pharmacies and hospitals. As an example, the card alone, without other benefits, will cost a 19-year-old woman working part time in Orlando, Fla., about $5 a month. The discounted price of a month's supply of the widely used cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, for example, would be $106.25, or $7.65 off the average retail price, UnitedHealth Group said. For three different levels of monthly premiums, from $50 to $110, the Florida woman and her dependents would be covered for a varying number of medical services, including $450 a year for visits to doctors and deeper discounts on 10 drug prescriptions a year. For higher premiums, $264 and $303 a month, she could get a high-deductible major medical policy with a health savings account. In recent surveys, uninsured workers said they would appreciate having a low-cost discount card. "Mothers wanted a card so they could take a child to a pediatrician instead of an emergency room," said Greg A. Lee, senior vice president of Sears, which has 100,000 part-time employees. Mr. Lee, who led a committee that developed the low-cost package under the auspices of the HR Policy Association, a group of senior officials of large companies, said the association hoped that more companies would join the original 60 corporate sponsors. "If we can make the pool even larger, there is a good chance we will be able to continue to lower the price," he said. The association plans to introduce the program at a conference of employers and consultants in Washington on Monday. For many uninsured workers, the premiums for even the high-deductible plans that some employers offer are unaffordable. "The average person who makes $30,000 a year spends $1,500 more than they make and has less than $500 in assets," Mr. Slavitt of UnitedHealth said. "Offering them insurance with a deductible is equivalent to not providing insurance at all." Older employees thinking of retiring before they become eligible for Medicare are often "stunned to find that their health care premiums could easily be $20,000," said Jack Mollen, a senior vice president of EMC, an information management and storage technology company based in Hopkinton, Mass. "With the baby boomers getting older, companies will want to have programs that encourage more senior employees to go to part-time work or consulting," he added. The appeal for early retirees is "the No. 1 sweet spot" in the program, said Dr. Robert S. Galvin, director of global health care for G.E. Although most G.E. employees have comprehensive health coverage, he notes that the company has acquired a number of small companies that can participate in the low-cost program. "We will be offering it," he said. Dr. Galvin said the sponsors of the new program had asked the insurers to join G.E. and other large employers that were trying to persuade doctors and hospitals to meet quality and efficiency standards. Workers in the low-cost program will also be able to compare health care providers on the program's Web site, he said. "Being uninsured doesn't mean you want to be uninformed," Dr. Galvin said. Mr. Beauregard of Hewitt Associates said the number of uninsured people would rise significantly in the next five years as employment continues the shift from manufacturing with strong unions to nonunion service jobs, often in small companies that do not offer health benefits. Even large businesses, he noted, are dropping retiree medical coverage. "It is extraordinarily important," he said, "to address the issue of the uninsured for social, economic and even moral reasons."</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/21/business/businessspecial3/21health.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Increase in Quarterly Earnings for UnitedHealth Group<date>Published: January 21, 2005</date><text>y Bloomberg News UnitedHealth Group, the nation's second-largest health insurer behind WellPoint, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings increased 46 percent after it added members through acquisitions. Profit this year will rise more than forecast, the company said. Advertisement Net income increased to $739 million, or $1.09 a share, from $507 million, or 83 cents, the company said. It was expected to earn $1.08 in the quarter, the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Revenue surged 40 percent to $10.5 billion. The company, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., relied on acquisitions rather than job growth to increase membership by 3.38 million last year, sending quarterly revenue past the $10 billion mark for the first time. UnitedHealth gained customers in New York and Washington, with deals like its $4.6 billion purchase of Oxford Health Plans in July. "The best way to grow membership in a slower economy is by acquisitions, and they've done that," said Michael Obuchowski, a money manager at Altanes Investments in New York, which owns UnitedHealth shares. "They are in the beginning of truly benefiting from their investments of the last several years, especially in terms of employing technology to slow down the growth in health care costs." Shares of UnitedHealth, the first of the big United States insurers to release fourth-quarter results, fell $1.65, or nearly 2 percent, to $86.63. They rose 51 percent last year. "Maybe some traders expected more of an upside," Mr. Obuchowski said. "The numbers were not only strong but pointing to some really positive trends." Shares of WellPoint fell $3.56, or 2.9 percent, to $120.04. UnitedHealth said profit this year would be in the range of $4.75 to $4.80 a share, 5 cents more than forecast. It earned $3.94 a share last year. The company said it spent about 78.8 cents of each dollar it received in premiums on medical care for members, unchanged from the fourth quarter in 2003. For the full year, UnitedHealth spent about a penny a premium dollar less on care compared with 2003. Administrative costs consumed about 15.1 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with about 16.7 percent a year earlier. Increases in medical costs have begun to slow nationwide as employers shift costs to workers in the form of higher co-payments and deductibles. Slowing increases in prescription drug spending have had the biggest impact on leveling off costs, according to William W. McGuire, the chief executive of UnitedHealth. Steven Sean Hill, a fund manager at First Investors, which has about 175,000 shares of UnitedHealth, said, "UnitedHealth did fine." The UnitedHealth divisions that focus on providing health care services for state Medicaid programs and Americans over the age of 50 had combined revenue of $9.32 billion, an increase of 44 percent from the year earlier. Revenue from the company's Ingenix business, which provides software that large employers can use to track changes in spending across their entire range of employee benefits programs, rose 20 percent to $214 million.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/business/30place.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">A Diverse UnitedHealth Keeps Growing<date>Published: November 30, 2004</date><text>he UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest health insurance company, said yesterday that it would spend $300 million in cash to buy Definity Health, a smaller health technology company specializing in health plans that allow consumers leeway in directing their medical spending. The price - not a big number for UnitedHealth - was the latest move in the company's strategy of diversification from its signature managed care business. The acquisition will immediately add 500,000 customers, including many who work for large companies, UnitedHealth said. Definity, a privately held company based in Minneapolis, is profitable and expects revenueof $100 million in 2005. UnitedHealth's headquarters are in nearby Minnetonka, Minn. Investors in UnitedHealth, who appreciate the company's success in reporting earnings growth of 30 percent, quarter after quarter, have pushed up the share price more than 50 percent in the last year. Yesterday, the stock declined 90 cents, to close at $82.98, after reaching $84.35 intraday, briefly surpassing the 52-week high of $84.21. Health care experts said UnitedHealth was early in recognizing that the supply of new members for the managed care industry was drying up. "The migration into managed care plans is over," said Kenneth Sperling, a senior health care expert at Hewitt Associates, the benefits consulting firm near Chicago, "and stealing share" basically by cutting prices "is not very profitable." So the company has spread into new fields to please investors by keeping revenue and earnings growing. One promising area is high-deductible, low-premium health plans for employers and individuals who are increasingly resisting spiraling increases in health costs. Some of the high-deductible plans are linked to a health savings account that can help consumers pay their out-of-pocket costs. In 2002, United bought a bank and debit card operation to serve the accounts. But the savings account plans are off to a slow start and may not hit their stride until 2006, according to a recent Hewitt survey of large employers. Without waiting for the savings-linked plans to take off, UnitedHealth and some other big insurers are buying companies that are expert in producing and marketing high-deductible plans to individuals and small businesses. Late last year, UnitedHealth bought Golden Rule Financial, which sells policies to individuals, and in September, Pacificare, a California-based insurer, bought American Medical Security, a small company that generated 30 percent of its sales to individuals from high-deductible plans, according to Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. The high-deductible plans, she said, are much like the old major medical and catastrophic health coverage that many people relied on before the surge in health maintenance organizations and preferred provider networks. Among other large managed care companies, Aetna has developed its own savings-related plans, and Cigna and Anthem separately announced partnerships with J. P. Morgan Chase to handle the accounts. UnitedHealth, with 18 million managed care members, is the largest health insurer - at least until the completion of Anthem's announced merger with WellPoint Health Networks. Phillip Seligman, an equity research analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, said the decision to buy Definity increased United's already formidable expertise in marketing high-deductible health plans. Definity, he said, would help United use its information technology "to create any one of thousands of permutations of health plans with the right prices." "Somebody needs something special, they can immediately put that into their software, and out comes the whole plan," Mr. Seligman said. The $300 million cost of Definity Health caused no strain for UnitedHealth, which says it expects $3.8 billion in cash flow from operations this year. Earlier in the year, United completed the purchase of two East Coast health care companies, Oxford Health Plans, for $4.7 billion in cash and stock, and Mid Atlantic Medical Services for $2.95 billion in cash and stock. United is looking for earnings growth per share around 32 percent in 2004, after strong results exceeding 30 percent in 2003, a spokesman, John Penshorn, said. In 2005, it is talking about earnings growth 20 percent to 21 percent higher than this year, which would be $4.70 to $4.75 a share. Analysts note that over the years, the company has regularly understated its earnings forecasts.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/business/13health.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Bush Health Savings Accounts Slow to Gain Acceptance<date>Published: October 13, 2004</date><text>resident Bush has made health savings accounts one of his central campaign remedies for the nation's health care problems, but so far employers and workers have been slow to accept the accounts as an alternative to conventional health insurance. People around the nation are now taking part in the annual enrollment season for health care plans, but only a tiny fraction of employers are offering the new plans. The plans let workers create tax-free savings accounts to use for medical costs, combined with lower-cost, high-deductible insurance to cover major medical care. Most employees who already have health benefits said in an insurance industry survey that they would be reluctant to switch even if they were offered one of the new plans. The UnitedHealth Group, for example, the nation's largest health insurer, representing employers who cover more than 18 million workers, expects only about 150,000 of those employees to choose health savings accounts for 2005. Aetna, the second-largest underwriter of employer health care plans, says that only 38 of the hundreds of employers it covers are offering the savings plans for 2005. The plans, which were inserted without full House or Senate debate into last fall's 700-page Medicare legislation, are meant to provide basic, high-deductible insurance while letting people accumulate money tax-free to be spent on medical services or saved to pay for future health care needs. President Bush, who is expected to discuss the plans again tonight in the domestic policy debate with Senator John Kerry, extolled them in last Friday's debate. "You own your own account,'' he said. "You can save tax-free.'' But nonpartisan health policy experts say the plans are apparently too new and untested to appeal to many employers and may simply not be financially feasible for middle-income families. "It's hard to imagine that a guy who makes $50,000 a year is going to have $2,000 for him and his family to stick in this plan," said Ira S. Loss, a health policy expert with Washington Analysis, a business consulting firm. Insurance brokers say the accounts appeal primarily to lawyers, doctors and partners in small businesses who may welcome tax-free savings accounts for themselves. Many small businesses may like the plans as a way to reduce their own outlays for employee health insurance. Some employers are offsetting their lower insurance premiums by contributing some money into workers' savings plans. But a drawback for employers, experts say, is that workers can take their accounts with them when they change jobs - undermining the employee loyalty and retention companies seek to cultivate by providing health coverage in the first place. Among individuals, the accounts may be unattractive to hard-pressed lower-income workers and families with a chronic illness to manage. "People with chronic conditions will not be able to save anything," said Anne K. Gauthier, vice president of Academy Health, a nonprofit research organization that held a conference last fall on consumer-driven health care. In a recent survey of 500 registered voters with insurance conducted for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group in Washington, 62 percent of those surveyed said they would not be likely to exchange their current coverage for a health savings account. As for employers, a survey recently conducted jointly by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, 6 percent of all companies said they were very likely to offer some type of high-deductible plan linked to a savings account in the next two years, while 21 percent said they were "somewhat likely" to do so. Big employers, with 5,000 or more workers, were more likely to offer the option: 22 percent said very likely and 28 percent somewhat likely. The Bush administration recently announced that it was adding health savings account plans to the health insurance options available to federal employees. But industry consultants said that most employers were mainly biding their time, waiting for the new health plans to establish a track record. Consultants note that consumer-managed health accounts that are similar in some ways to the new saving plans, and have been available for several years, have not attracted many subscribers.

Anderson, has resigned, Northwest said yesterday, completing the turnover in chief executives in the tumultuous airline industry since the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Mr. Anderson, 49, told Northwest's board on Thursday that he would become an executive vice president for the UnitedHealth Group, a health care company based in Minnetonka, Minn., on Nov. 1. Advertisement Northwest named its president, Douglas M. Steenland, 53, as its new chief executive. He has served with Mr. Anderson since he became chief executive in 2001. The airline, based in Eagan, Minn., said Mr. Anderson would remain on its board. Northwest is the nation's fifth-largest airline, with 38,000 employees and hubs in Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis, along with extensive Asian routes. With Mr. Anderson's departure, all seven of the nation's major airlines have replaced their chief executives or announced their departure in the last three years. Continental's chief executive, Gordon M. Bethune, will step down at the end of the year. Five of those jobs have changed hands just this year - at Delta, Continental, Northwest, US Airways and Southwest. When Mr. Bethune departs, the most-senior chief executive in the industry, at least in terms of longevity, will be Glenn F. Tilton of United, who took charge in September 2002. The departure of Mr. Anderson, a former prosecutor, was unexpected. He declined to speak to reporters yesterday. But he told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune that his tenure at Northwest, where he had served as chief executive since February 2001, had been "a great run." Mr. Steenland, also a lawyer, joined the airline in 1991. He said he was not surprised that all seven big airlines had changed leaders in such a short period. "There's no question that it's a challenging job," he said, "and it's a challenging business." Mr. Steenland's biggest challenge, analysts said, will be to nail down $950 million in wage and benefit concessions the airline has unsuccessfully sought from its unions. Northwest has been pushing for the cuts for more than a year, but has met resistance from union leaders who question whether the airline really needs them to survive. The airline has $2.6 billion in cash, more than Delta, and three times what US Airways has. Still, Northwest's employee pension plans are underfunded by $3.7 billion, and it has lost $1.2 billion since 2001. Northwest is in active talks with its pilots' union on the first stage of cost cuts and hopes to wrap up talks sometime this fall, Mr. Steenland said. "That is the main near-term issue facing Northwest, and will continue to be so," said Philip A. Baggaley, the airline industry analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's. In August, S.&amp; P. cut its rating on Northwest's debt to B, with a negative outlook, meaning it could be cut again. Mr. Steenland said the cost cuts were particularly critical in the face of bankruptcies at United and US Airways and a potential Chapter 11 filing at Delta. United and US Airways, which filed for its second bankruptcy in two years last month, have been able to cut their labor costs significantly, as has American, which won concessions from its unions last year by threatening its own bankruptcy filing. "What happens at the other carriers needs to be used at Northwest," he said. "Our employees see that and clearly know at the end of the day that we have to be competitive and we have to have'' the same the labor costs as competitors, Mr. Steenland said. Mr. Steenland said he was concerned about the industry's big carriers, which have been battered this decade by factors beyond their control like high fuel prices and customers' curtailing their travel because of fears of terrorism and outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. "At some point, the rubber band has to break," he said. "It's hard to see how every airline out there remains in business."</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/02/business/02care.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Class-Action Status Is Upheld for Doctors Suing Insurers<date>Published: September 2, 2004</date><text>n appeals court upheld class-action status yesterday for a lawsuit brought on behalf of at least 600,000 doctors contending that six of the nation's largest health insurers regularly reduce payments for medical services. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, ruled that the defendants - WellPoint Health Networks, UnitedHealth Group, Prudential Insurance, PacifiCare Health Systems, Health Net and Humana - must stand trial on charges of violating the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. Health insurance lawyers had said that the appeals panel ruling would be crucial to the case's outcome. Advertisement The judges, Gerald B. Tjoflat, Stanley F. Birch and Alfred T. Goodwin, upheld a ruling by Judge Federico A. Moreno of Federal District Court in Miami. For a related group of state cases, however, they reversed Judge Moreno's ruling for class-action status. A California lawsuit, which was not appealed, retains its class-action status. In their suit, the doctors argue that the companies wrongfully underpaid them in various ways, including the use of computer programs that routinely denied parts of their fees. After reviewing the accusations, the appeals panel said, "It is ridiculous to expect 600,000 doctors across the nation to repeatedly prove these complicated and overwhelming facts." Explaining the importance of the appeal, Stephanie Kanwit, a lawyer for a health insurance trade association in Washington, said last December that "class action is absolutely the crucial issue." She added that the doctors' cases were "not provable on a case-by-case basis." Archie Lamb, one of the 175 plaintiffs' lawyers in the case, said it would go to trial on March 6 in Miami. Kent Jarrell, a spokesman for the defendants, said they still thought the plaintiffs' claims should not be considered as a class action, leaving open the possibility of a further appeal that could delay the trial. Mr. Jarrell added that the defendants were "confident that we will win at trial based on both the heightened standard of proof," which he said the appeals ruling called for, "and the evidence." Referring to the number of parties in the case, the appeals panel called on Judge Moreno to prevent them from regressing into a war that the panel said could be "nasty and brutish." Two managed care companies, Aetna Inc. and the Cigna Corporation, have settled with the plaintiffs, which include the medical associations of California and Texas. Aetna agreed to pay the plaintiffs $120 million; Cigna agreed to pay $85 million. Mr. Lamb said those payouts could grow to $500 million to $1 billion depending on follow-up claims by individual doctors. The lawyers have been awarded an additional $55 million, he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/21/business/company-news-unitedhealth-expands-ties-to-british-health-service.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">COMPANY NEWS; UNITEDHEALTH EXPANDS TIES TO BRITISH HEALTH SERVICE<date>Published: May 21, 2004</date><text>The UnitedHealth Group is expanding its connection with Britain's National Health Service, and eventually wants to provide more health care services for other European governments.

Insurers like UnitedHealth, which currently has about 2.5 million customers in the New York region, are increasingly looking toward such acquisitions as a way of adding customers.Although a relatively small player, insuring just 1.5 million people, Oxford has a strong presence in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The company had previously been in merger discussions with WellChoice, the parent of the New York giant, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield.The New York State attorney general's office has already requested information about the UnitedHealth-Oxford merger, including detailed membership information, said Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for the attorney general. The combination ''does raise concerns for our office,'' she said.A spokesman for UnitedHealth declined to comment. Calls to Oxford were not returned.In calling for the federal review of the merger, the American Medical Association cited what it sees as the increasing power of health insurance plans in markets across the country. ''All the red flags are up right now,'' said Dr. Donald Palmisano, the president of the association, who has concluded from his own analysis of the merger that it would reduce the level of competition in the New York metropolitan area enough to warrant the attention of the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.Doctors say they are particularly concerned about some recent mergers between already powerful players, including the combination of the nation's two largest publicly traded Blue Cross companies, Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks.''We hope regulators will apply the antitrust laws to these giant mergers,'' said Dr. Palmisano, who argued that doctors could not negotiate with such powerful forces. The consolidation among the health plans has led to higher premiums as well as increased profits for the companies, he said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/business/unitedhealth-agrees-to-deal-for-oxford.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">UnitedHealth Agrees to Deal For Oxford<date>Published: April 27, 2004</date><text>UnitedHealth Group agreed yesterday to acquire Oxford Health Plans for $4.7 billion in stock and cash, giving UnitedHealth, one of the nation's largest health insurers, a greater presence in the New York metropolitan area.Health insurers are consolidating as slow job growth makes it difficult to attract new customers without slashing premiums.In the New York region, in particular, the weakness in the economy had analysts anticipating that Oxford would have a harder time attracting new customers. Oxford insures 1.5 million people, mostly in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.''We're quite interested in seeing the impact of a rebounding New York economy,'' said William W. McGuire, UnitedHealth's chief executive, in a conference call with analysts yesterday afternoon.Mr. McGuire said in an interview that he expected his company, which currently provides health benefits for more than 20 million people in 50 states, would be able to attract large corporations with headquarters in the New York area and with workers throughout the country. Such companies were largely out of reach for Oxford, he said, which focuses on small to midsize employers.UnitedHealth, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., will offer 0.64 of one of its shares for each Oxford share, plus $16.17 in cash, with the transaction expected to close in the fourth quarter. The price is a 14 percent premium over Oxford's share price at the close of trading on Friday.Oxford, based in Trumbull, Conn., has long been considered a takeover target because of its large market share in the New York area. Just last week, talks collapsed between Oxford and WellChoice, the parent of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. Analysts had predicted that another bidder would quickly surface.''This is a big market with lots of opportunity,'' said Charles G. Berg, Oxford's chief executive, in a conference call with analysts yesterday evening to discuss Oxford's first-quarter earnings.Mr. Berg will be the chief executive of the combined company's Northeast region.Oxford's shares, up 97 percent in the last 12 months, rose $4.05 yesterday to close at $54.94 a share, after reports of the planned merger with UnitedHealth. The combination was announced after the close of trading.The merger is just the latest combination among health insurance companies. Last October, the nation's two largest publicly traded Blue Cross companies, Anthem and WellPoint, announced a $16.4 billion merger.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/13/business/company-news-medco-health-renews-contract-with-unitedhealth-group.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">COMPANY NEWS; MEDCO HEALTH RENEWS CONTRACT WITH UNITEDHEALTH GROUP<date>Published: January 13, 2004</date><text>The pharmacy benefits company Medco Health Solutions Inc. said yesterday that it had renewed a contract worth $7 billion with the health insurer UnitedHealth Group.

The doctors contend that the health insurance companies regularly cut back on payments for medical services and often refused to permit the doctors to carry out the procedures they thought best.The defendants include the United Healthcare unit of the UnitedHealth Group, Coventry Health Care, Wellpoint Health Networks, Humana, Pacificare Health Systems and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Two other managed-care companies, Aetna and Cigna, settled with the doctors and withdrew from the suit earlier this year.Aetna agreed to pay the plaintiffs $120 million, and Cigna agreed to pay $85 million. Both companies said they would make changes in operating practices demanded by the doctors.In the latest ruling, Judge Moreno rejected motions by the companies seeking to dismiss the doctors' claims under the antiracketeering law, which provides for triple damage awards if the claims are proved.Stephanie Kanwit, a managed-care industry lawyer, said a more important decision would come later in Atlanta, where the defendants have asked the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to overturn an earlier ruling by Judge Moreno that granted class-action status to the doctors' suit.''We are hopeful that the 11th Circuit will find that the plaintiffs cannot be a class,'' said Ms. Kanwit, a lawyer for AAHP-HIAA, a health insurance trade group in Washington.''Class action is absolutely the crucial issue,'' she added. ''The cases are not provable on a case-by-case basis.''But Archie Lamb, the lead lawyer for the doctors, said the case would go to trial next summer regardless of whether the appeals court rules. Judge Moreno has set a trial date in June.Mr. Lamb said that if the appeals court ruled that the doctors were not properly certified for a class action, lawyers would take the cases back to state courts in 20 states, a cumbersome process that could add millions of dollars in legal costs.Dr. Jack Lewin, chief executive of the California Medical Association, said Judge Moreno's ruling was ''very encouraging for all of America's physicians.'' He added, ''This case represents the beginning of a new and positive relationship between physicians and the nation's health plans.''</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/business/insurers-ready-to-sell-medical-savings-accounts.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Insurers Ready to Sell Medical Savings Accounts<date>Published: December 09, 2003</date><text>Probably no one was more surprised that Congress added tax breaks for health savings accounts to the new Medicare law than John C. Goodman, a conservative Texan who has been avidly promoting medical accounts for a decade.The measure, a favorite of Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, and Representative Bill Thomas, chairman of the conference committee, was added to the bill, later dropped and finally restored during negotiations.''People thought it would be gone at the end,'' Mr. Goodman, president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a research group in Dallas, said yesterday as President Bush was signing the legislation. ''Frankly even I thought that was going to happen.''Under the new law, consumers will be able to obtain relatively inexpensive health insurance policies with high deductibles combined with savings accounts. The contributions to the accounts will be tax deductible, the money will accumulate year after year tax free, and it can be withdrawn to pay for a variety of medical expenses.But while insurers could only guess and gamble on the outcome in Congress, at least two of the nation's biggest insurance companies were ready to seize the opportunity.Only days before the bill passed, the UnitedHealth Group, the largest insurer, bought the Golden Rule Insurance Company, a pioneer in selling medical savings accounts, a less-favored version of the accounts, for $500 million. Aetna, which already had 45,000 members in high-deductible health plans that include savings accounts, jumped in yesterday with a plan to add 100,000 more under the new law.''Over a million people are currently covered by a variety of consumer-driven health plans, most of which involve a spending or savings account,'' said Tom Beauregard, a health care consultant with the Hewitt Associates consulting firm. As employers shift an increasing share of health costs to workers, a growing number need to put aside money to pay those bills, he said.Mr. Gingrich said he knew of several other insurance companies, in addition to United and Aetna, that plan to introduce similar types of coverage by Jan. 1, when the provision takes effect.Some Wall Street analysts view the accounts as a threat to the existing health care system. ''This provision gives employers a door to discontinue health care as an employee entitlement,'' Charles Boorady, a securities analyst at Smith Barney, wrote in a research report yesterday.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/business/managed-care-companies-win-ruling.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Managed Care Companies Win Ruling<date>Published: April 08, 2003</date><text>The UnitedHealth Group and PacifiCare Health Systems, the managed care companies, have won a Supreme Court decision allowing them to send a dispute with doctors to arbitration, at least initially.An arbitrator, not a court, should first consider whether agreements between the companies and doctors bar remedies that would be available if a claim were decided in federal court, the justices ruled 8 to 0.UnitedHealth, the biggest health insurer in the nation, and PacifiCare are fighting claims they violated a federal racketeering law by delaying payments to doctors.A lower court blocked the companies from enforcing arbitration agreements signed by the doctors because an arbitrator would not be able to award the triple damages available under the racketeering law.Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that it would be premature to consider whether the agreements can be enforced ''since we do not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations.''The lawsuit was certified in September as a class action representing about 600,000 doctors.Gregory Coleman, the lawyer for UnitedHealth, called the ruling ''a very solid, direct win, and we're very pleased by that.''Joe Whatley, the lawyer for the doctors, said the court showed it preferred that arbitrators interpret any ambiguities in an agreement.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/business/some-concerns-thrive-on-medicaid-patients.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Some Concerns Thrive On Medicaid Patients<date>Published: February 19, 2003</date><text>As President Bush presses Congress to let private insurers take over more of Medicare and Medicaid, a handful of for-profit managed care companies are already hard at it, running state programs for five million low-income people in Medicaid plans.Despite yawning deficits and Medicaid budget cuts in many states, the companies involved in managed care are thriving, and some of the nation's biggest private health insurers are expanding their Medicaid operations. The UnitedHealth Group, the largest, has added 375,000 Medicaid members in the last year and Wellpoint Health Networks, the fourth largest, has added more than 600,000 in the last three years.Pocketing a set monthly payment for each Medicaid member, the companies sign up the most common types of Medicaid recipients: children with relatively few health care needs and women that they try to guide through uncomplicated low-cost pregnancies.The companies say they are prospering by providing services tailored to the needs of low-income people, including tracking down hard-to-find families who do not have telephones.But some hospitals and doctors say the companies also profit by denying more claims than most insurers. Hospitals in New Jersey said the Medicaid companies rejected claims for hospital stays up to three times as often as other managed care plans.And like some other managed care insurers, the Medicaid companies can be slow to approve expensive treatments for people with serious medical problems, patient advocates say.Another concern, Medicaid experts say, is whether some plans provide enough help for low-income people who need it. ''If plans are taking people who don't know how to come in and use services, because of language problems or the location or just plain knowledge problems, it means you collect the capitation, and don't have to provide the service,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Family Foundation's Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. Capitation is the payment for each member.Medicaid, which covers 47 million people, is the nation's largest health system. It pays for about 4 births in 10 and provides health care for one of every 3 children.There are 38 states that now require some form of Medicaid managed care, and 23 million Medicaid recipients are members of health maintenance organizations.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/25/business/india-is-regaining-contracts-with-us.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">India Is Regaining Contracts With U.S.<date>Published: December 25, 2002</date><text>After slowing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, outsourcing by American companies to Indian concerns or to their own Indian units has begun to pick up.The new contracts span the technology-related spectrum, going well beyond the software code writing of the last decade to include chip design, product development, call centers, consulting and other support services. They give Indian companies the opportunity to expand their repertory with work that holds much promise for future growth. And they account for a significant chunk of business in India, especially here in Bangalore and the country's other high-technology cities.In just the last few months, dozens of Indian concerns have garnered contracts from big American companies to take over pieces of their operations. A unit of the Bangalore-based Wipro, India's third-largest software and services exporter, will be handling some of the worldwide reservation services for Delta Air Lines, a move that Delta expects will save $12 million to $15 million annually.India's top software company, Tata Consultancy Services, or T.C.S., part of India's Tata conglomerate, has signed up Lehman Brothers -- in a $70 million-a-year deal shared with Wipro -- as well as J. P. Morgan Chase, Fidelity Investments and GE Medical Systems. The local unit of Cognizant Technology Solutions, a custom software developer and services provider in Teaneck, N.J., has contracts for projects from MetLife, to upgrade its human resources administration system and streamline some computer applications, and from the UnitedHealth Group and Sallie Mae, the student loan provider.For the American companies, which account for more than two-thirds of the work coming to India, the country has several advantages. Though wages in India have been rising, they still tend to be much lower than in the United States. That is particularly attractive in the current global economy, cost-sensitive executives say, as they follow the outsourcing path set in the early 1990's by technology companies from Silicon Valley seeking cheaper software coding operations.India also has a large, well-educated, English-speaking work force with one of the world's largest clusters of engineers and programmers.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/07/business/some-tentative-first-steps-toward-universal-health-care.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">Some Tentative First Steps Toward Universal Health Care<date>Published: December 07, 2002</date><text>Worried that the growing number of uninsured patients will undermine the nation's health care system, insurance executives across the country are pressing for new steps toward universal health care.Many health plans are developing or offering insurance with lower premiums and slimmer coverage to attract customers who cannot afford more comprehensive policies. Executives at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana are pressing state legislators to raise the cigarette tax to subsidize basic coverage. Another insurer, Blue Shield of California, proposed a plan this week for health insurance for all state residents. And Dr. William W. McGuire, chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, the largest private insurer, has written to every member of Congress calling for ''essential health care for all Americans.''Health insurers, which have long ranked high among the country's most disliked businesses, frame many of their proposals in public policy terms. But they also have strong business reasons to become involved in the debate over helping the uninsured. They want to add young, healthy members to their insurance pools to spread the cost of caring for the sick. They are also eager to add members whose premiums would be paid with tax money or government subsidies.Several insurance executives also said pressures generated by the uninsured were raising a threat to the system that could lead to government intervention if insurers did not develop a plan first.''If we don't do something in a darn hurry about the uninsured, the whole health care system in this country is going to collapse and the government will step in,'' said Chuck Butler, a vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana. ''People will say, enough is enough.''Dr. Jay Crosson, executive director of physician groups at Kaiser Permanente, the largest nonprofit insurer, said, ''As insurance becomes less affordable, more and more people will be upset and frightened, and the industry will find itself drawn into the political process.''Most health insurers are thriving, keeping ahead of rising hospital charges and doctor fees by raising premiums as much as 30 to 40 percent a year for small companies and 17 percent and higher even for large employers. But the increases, combined with disappearing jobs, are leading many people to drop health insurance and, not incidentally, adding to the unpopularity of insurance and managed care companies.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/19/business/company-news-unitedhealth-agrees-to-acquire-americhoice.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">COMPANY NEWS; UNITEDHEALTH AGREES TO ACQUIRE AMERICHOICE<date>Published: June 19, 2002</date><text>The UnitedHealth Group said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire AmeriChoice, a privately held Medicaid services provider, for $530 million in stock.

Most working families, who have relatively low medical bills, could save money under the plans. But those with several thousand dollars in medical expenses could wind up paying much more. Few experts on health care are familiar with the plans. But some health benefits experts who do know of them warn that they could be more unfair than current plans to people who are sick and that they could discourage people who need care from getting it. The insurers preparing to offer the plans within a year include Aetna, Humana, Cigna, the UnitedHealth Group and Wellpoint Health Networks. Some are already testing the new plans on their own employees or even with a few companies. And several small insurance companies began offering the new plans at a few companies earlier this year. The new plans typically require a family to pay an annual premium of $1,000 to $1,400, slightly lower than the cost of traditional managed care. Families then receive an allowance of $2,000 to $3,000 each year to spend on medical expenses, including drugs. But after they have spent that, they have to cover every cost above that cap, sometimes up to $5,000 or more. After the higher amount is reached, the employer picks up most of the bills. In addition, instead of covering all but a few dollars of the cost of each drug prescription, some of the new plans will require employees to cover a much bigger portion of the cost. The difference between the new plans and those currently covering many Americans is striking. As one example, a family of three with $5,000 in medical bills and chronic medical conditions requiring several widely used prescription drugs could pay $5,634 themselves, compared with $3,420 under a traditional managed care plan, according to industry consultants. ''The effect will be to shift more of the costs into the pockets of the sick people,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University. ''The insurance industry has decided that if you are sick, you ought to eat the costs. It's a very dubious social policy.'' The plans also offer online information to help consumers make their own medical decisions, including descriptions of different diseases and treatments, data on the costs of numerous treatments, and a network of doctors and hospitals that employees can use to keep their medical costs down. A family that keeps its medical bills lower than the allowance can roll over any unspent money to pay medical bills in future years. But for a family that uses up the allowance, the plans stop paying entirely until a ceiling is reached. At one company offering the new plans, employees who use only network doctors are responsible for a deductible of $1,000 to $5,000 in medical expenses beyond their allowance of $2,000, depending on the premium they are willing to pay. If they go to doctors outside the network, their deductible could rise even higher. For employees whose medical expenses exceed the allowance and the deductible, the plan typically covers all medical costs provided by a network of doctors and hospitals. Employees who go to doctors and hospitals outside the network are covered for 70 to 80 percent of charges up to $1,000. After that, the plans typically cover all expenses. Prescriptions often become a much heavier expense. Currently, employers usually offer a separate drug plan that covers all but a few dollars of a medication. Under some of the new plans, employees must draw on their allowance to buy medications, whether they are the low-priced generic drugs or expensive brand name medications. After they exhaust the allowance, employees have to cover the full cost of any drugs until the deductible is met. For example, a year's supply of Serevent, a widely used asthma treatment, could be nearly $800 instead of the $120 to $360 that is an employee's current share in many drug plans. An employer would begin to pay more only after an employee had used up the health care allowance and deductible. The insurers say the plans are intended to help companies save money at a time when their employees' medical costs have been surging, up 10 to 15 percent or more in each of the last two years. Many companies are seeking ways to transfer to employees more of the costs, especially of drugs, which have been the fastest-rising medical cost.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/27/business/company-news-unitedhealth-group-profits-up-27-in-quarter.html?ref=unitedhealthgroupinc">COMPANY NEWS; UNITEDHEALTH GROUP PROFITS UP 27% IN QUARTER<date>Published: October 27, 2001</date><text>The UnitedHealth Group, a managed health care company, said yesterday that its third-quarter profits rose 27 percent, benefiting from higher insurance premiums in the face of rising medical costs.
