The average analyst estimate was $3.48 a share, according to Thomson Reuters, though the company had said this month that it would report a profit similar to the $7.7 billion it earned in the second quarter. Shares of Chevron closed 0.6 percent higher at $109.64 on Friday, within sight of their record high of $110, hit on Thursday. Third-quarter sales rose 26 percent to $61.26 billion, while its oil and gas output fell to 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 2.74 million a year ago. Getting production to grow remains a nagging problem for all the big oil companies. Chevron expects an increase of 100,000 to 150,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, driven by production in Thailand and the Gulf of Mexico from projects that are either new, upgraded or repaired. The profit growth was driven by oil prices. Benchmark Brent crude averaged $112 per barrel in the quarter, up from $77 last year. Chevron also recorded a gain of about $500 million from the sale of its British refinery to Valero Energy. This week, the company increased its dividend for the second time this year, by 3.8 percent. Pat Yarrington, the company’s chief financial officer, said this reflected confidence in its net cash position of $10.6 billion, though she acknowledged some investors would prefer more share buybacks and said the board would always consider that. Chevron bought back $1.25 billion worth of its own stock in the third quarter, and it expected to buy back about the same amount in the fourth quarter, she said.Chevron said on Friday that its quarterly earnings more than doubled, beating Wall Street forecasts, but the oil company, America’s second-largest, again lowered expectations for full-year output.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/nyregion/documents-in-chevron-suit-show-lobbyists-contacts-with-cuomo.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Documents in Chevron Suit Show Lobbyist’s Contacts With Cuomo<date>Published: October 10, 2011</date><text>Two years ago, Andrew M. Cuomo, then New York’s attorney general, unexpectedly jumped into a legal fight over an issue that had little to do with the state: damage to the Amazon rain forest from oil drilling.Mr. Cuomo, now the governor of New York, subtly threatened to investigate Chevron, which is the defendant in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit over the Amazon damage that has stretched out for nearly 18 years. Mr. Cuomo indicated that he decided to get involved because Chevron might have violated state law in its handling of the litigation. But now, newly disclosed documents point to another factor. “Andrew has no interest in doing this,” a lobbyist for the plaintiffs, Ecuadorean villagers who live in the polluted area, wrote in an e-mail in 2009. “He is doing this for me. Because I asked.” The lobbyist, Karen Hinton, a former Cuomo aide, was paid $10,000 a month by those representing the Ecuadoreans, in part to obtain Mr. Cuomo’s vocal support, according to the records and interviews. The plaintiffs’ representatives also helped persuade the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, to speak out against Chevron. Mr. DiNapoli has repeatedly called for Chevron to settle the suit, saying it jeopardizes the state pension fund’s $780 million investment in Chevron stock. The e-mail and other documents emerged recently in the legal battle over the Amazon drilling. They offer a rare window into the way business is often conducted in Albany’s back rooms, with well-connected lobbyists penetrating the inner circle of politicians like Mr. Cuomo and Mr. DiNapoli. Ms. Hinton worked for Mr. Cuomo when he was housing secretary in the Clinton administration. Ms. Hinton and her husband, Howard Glaser, who also worked for Mr. Cuomo in Washington, contacted Mr. Cuomo and his staff about Chevron, the records show. Mr. Glaser is currently one of Governor Cuomo’s most powerful aides, the director of state operations; he was in private business in 2009. In interviews last week, Mr. Cuomo’s office and Ms. Hinton played down the e-mails. They said there was nothing untoward about Mr. Cuomo’s involvement in the Amazon litigation. “The attorney general’s office often seeks information from corporations after allegations of wrongdoing,” Mr. Cuomo’s communications director, Richard Bamberger, said. “The accusations against Chevron were widely documented for years.” For the Ecuadoreans, who are represented by Steven Donziger, a lawyer in New York, the backing was a coup. Mr. Donziger had for years tried to win the lawsuit over the Amazon drilling. In 2009, he was pursuing a strategy of trying to enlist prominent public officials in the United States to turn up the pressure on Chevron. After Mr. Cuomo was contacted, Mr. Cuomo sent a pointed letter to Chevron in May 2009, asking whether the company had disclosed the risks of the litigation in its securities filings. Mr. Cuomo wrote that as New York’s attorney general, he had a duty to investigate “financial fraud and material misstatements.” He noted that “New York State and New York City public pension funds hold substantial Chevron shares,” and “many New Yorkers are also shareholders.” Mr. Donziger publicized the letter widely through the group Amazon Watch, which informed Chevron shareholders that Chevron was “the target of an official fraud investigation by the New York State attorney general.” (In fact, Mr. Cuomo’s office later determined that Chevron’s disclosure was adequate and quietly dropped the matter.) The plaintiffs in Ecuador have sought billions of dollars from Chevron in litigation that has been heard in courts in South America and the United States. The case goes back to the 1970s, when Texaco was exploring oil fields with the Ecuadorean state oil company. The villagers sued in 1993, claiming Texaco had left an environmental mess that was causing illnesses. Chevron bought Texaco in 2001, after Texaco had performed a $40 million remediation and the government released it from liability. In February 2011, an Ecuadorean judge ordered the company to pay as much as $18 billion, a decision that Chevron is fighting on several fronts. Chevron filed a countersuit this year contending that lawyers for the plaintiffs had fraudulently conspired to use public officials and media pressure to force Chevron to settle. A victory for Chevron in the countersuit could help the company in its appeal on the main litigation. The records disclosed in the countersuit feature evidence that representatives for the plaintiffs discussed trading on personal connections with Mr. Cuomo to get him involved. 1 2 Next Page »Two years ago, Andrew M.

The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Pablo Fajardo, said they expected to start collecting by the first quarter of 2012 the damages that a court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, ordered Chevron to pay. “We can now at least dream there will be justice and compensation for the damage, the environmental crime, committed by Chevron in Ecuador,” he said. “Chevron remains confident that once the full facts are examined, the fraudulent judgment will be found unenforceable and those who procured it will be required to answer for their misconduct,” the oil company said in a statement on its Web site Monday. Chevron has appealed the decision, issued in February, and Mr. Fajardo said he expected an appeals court ruling in Ecuador in the next few months. In New York, United States District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan had barred collection of the award, after determining that Chevron could prove that lawyers had manipulated a corrupt legal system in Ecuador. The company had argued that the plaintiffs would collect the judgment before an appeals process was completed. But a lawyer for the plaintiffs told the appeals court in oral arguments Friday that they would not try to recover damages until the appeal in Ecuador was completed. The award followed nearly two decades of litigation. The plaintiffs blamed Texaco, a subsidiary of Chevron since 2001, for environmental contamination and illnesses resulting from its operation of an oil consortium from 1972 to 1990 in the country’s lush rainforest.A federal appeals court on Monday vacated an order by a New York judge that barred an $18 billion judgment in Ecuador against Chevron related to contamination in the Amazon.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/business/global/04chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Four Killed in Explosion at Chevron Refinery in Britain<date>Published: June 3, 2011</date><text>LONDON — A storage tank exploded at a British oil refinery owned by Chevron, killing four workers and seriously injuring another, officials said Friday. The explosion at the Pembroke refinery in southwest Wales occurred Thursday evening while maintenance work was being carried out, the Dyfed Powys police said in a statement. It is still unclear what caused the blast. “Paramedics have confirmed that four people lost their lives as a result of the incident,” chief superintendent Gwyn Thomas said. “Officers are now in the processes of informing the next of kin and will support the families throughout this difficult time.” Greg Hanggi, general manager at the refinery, said another worker was hospitalized with serious injuries. All five victims were contractors. “The loss of our co-workers has come as a huge shock to us all,” Mr. Hanggi said in a statement. “We will take every step possible to determine the series of events that led to this tragic incident and ensure that any lessons learnt from it will be integrated into the business and shared with our industry partners.” Chevron, based in California, agreed in March to sell Pembroke, which specializes in processing heavy, lower-quality crudes, to the Texas-based oil company Valero Energy. The sale was set to be completed later this year. Paul Bray, a Chevron spokesman, said that the refinery was operational Friday and that most employees were at work. “Given the very sad events some feel it is difficult to work today and we have counselors on site,” he said. “We don’t anticipate any disruption of supply.” He also said that the tank in question was not full at the time of the explosion. Police said that there was no health or safety risk for the public as a result of the explosion. The resulting fire was extinguished and an investigation is now underway, police said. “Any material released into the atmosphere as a result of the blast was immediately dispersed,” the police said. “The wind was blowing off shore, away from residential areas.” Eyewitnesses reported hearing a “massive bang” and saw plumes of black smoke following the blast, the BBC reported on its Web site. Fuels from the Pembroke refinery are distributed in Britain and the United States. The refinery turns out 3.5 million gallons, or more than 13 million liters, of gasoline a day, according to the Chevron Web site.

Democrats had hoped that directing the savings toward the deficit would make it harder for Republicans to reject it. In the 52-to-48 vote, 3 Democrats joined 45 Republicans in opposing the bill, which was supported by the Obama administration and fiscal watchdog groups that saw the tax help for the oil industry as wasteful. Forty-eight Democrats, two independents and two Republicans backed it. Energy-state Democrats criticized the initiative, saying it was misdirected and would do nothing to ease gasoline prices and could cost American jobs. “Why are we harming an industry — five large oil and gas companies that work internationally, that employ 9.2 million people in the United States directly?” asked Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. “Why are we doing it?” Republicans, who on Wednesday will push their own plan to open more areas to oil drilling and speed government permits, said the Democratic proposal would contribute to higher prices and increase dependence on foreign oil even though a recent Congressional Research Service report predicted any impact on prices would be negligible. “Clearly, this is not a serious effort to address the price of gas at the pump,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Under the proposal, Democrats would have eliminated five different tax breaks enjoyed by the multinational oil companies, producing an estimated $21 billion over 10 years. More than $12 billion would have come from eliminating a domestic manufacturing tax deduction for the big oil companies, and $6 billion would have been generated by ending their deductions for taxes paid to foreign governments. Critics suggest that the companies have been able to disguise what should be foreign royalty payments as taxes to reduce their tax liability. The bill would also deny the companies the ability to deduct some intangible drilling and development costs. The bill would have applied to BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The White House lent strong support to the effort though the president in the past has recommended applying revenue generated by ending the tax breaks to the development of alternative energy sources. “The administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to reduce federal deficits, the nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies,” the White House said.  Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, portrayed the vote as one that revealed the values of Republicans. “Instead of defending oil companies, Republicans should be defending the American taxpayer,” Mr. Reid said. “We believe this is the kind of wasteful spending that will lead to an agreement on reducing the debt.” While most Republicans have opposed eliminating the tax breaks as a back-door tax increase, some, including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman, have indicated a willingness to consider the idea. Also on Tuesday, Senate Democrats wrote to the Federal Trade Commission seeking an inquiry into whether domestic oil refiners had reduced production to drive down the gasoline supply and drive up prices. “This is just another piece of the puzzle that we need to get at as we try to take away taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and hold Big Oil accountable for whatever may be going on in the supply chain that is hurting the families that I work for,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.WASHINGTON — The Senate on Tuesday blocked a Democratic proposal to strip the five leading oil companies of tax breaks that backers of the measure said were unfairly padding industry profits while consumers were struggling with high gas prices.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/opinion/15sun1.html?ref=chevroncorporation">A Big Whine From Big Oil<date>Published: May 14, 2011</date><text>With gas at $4 a gallon, oil at $100 a barrel and profits at near-record levels, it is hard to feel sympathy for the oil industry. Yet sympathy is what the C.E.O.’s of the five biggest companies asked for when they appeared Thursday before a Senate hearing on a Democratic proposal to eliminate about $2 billion in tax breaks for the Big Five.Exxon’s Rex Tillerson called the proposal “misinformed and discriminatory.” ConocoPhillips’s James Mulva, in a letter, called the idea “un-American” because it would supposedly cost American jobs, raise consumer prices and discourage investment — a position he reasserted during the hearings. The other three companies at the witness table, BP America, Shell and Chevron, raised similar complaints. How absurd are their claims? Utterly absurd. Take investment. In 2005, with oil nearing $60 a barrel, Mr. Mulva and other top executives told a Senate committee that the companies did not need the tax breaks to keep exploring for oil. Congress left them in place. Now that the Senate seems serious about getting rid of them, he and his colleagues have changed their tune — even though their companies obviously need them even less at $100 a barrel. Or take prices at the pump. In a memorandum to Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that eliminating the tax benefits would have virtually no effect on the price of gasoline. The impact on industry profits — the Big Five earned a robust $35 billion in the first quarter of this year alone — would be trivial. The report also addressed one more industry claim: that ending the tax breaks for the oil companies alone would be discriminatory. Most of the breaks — deductions for well depletion, intangible drilling costs and the like — are unique to the industry. The exception is a deduction for domestic production, designed to encourage all manufacturing companies to invest in this country. But as the research service pointed out, industry is not going to stop drilling on American territory as long as the oil is there and yielding big dollars. These subsidies are clearly unnecessary, and returning $2 billion to the Treasury would be a good thing. But more than anything, one has to wonder why the oil companies are fighting so hard for a comparatively small amount of cash, at least for them. The only explanation we can come up with is that they have always gotten what they wanted and expect to do so now, so why not? The House is certainly tripping over itself to do the industry’s bidding. Last week, it passed two more irresponsible bills accelerating drilling permits and authorizing leasing in long-protected waters of the north and central Atlantic coasts, the Southern California coast and Alaska, including Bristol Bay. It is as if the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico had never happened. It is imperative that the Senate block the House’s drilling and leasing plans, and that President Obama veto them if the Senate caves. And both the Senate and the president should keep pressing to eliminate the tax breaks. Three-fourths of Americans responding to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said they want to end them. Obviously, $4-a-gallon gas has something to do with this. But there is also an elemental matter of fairness here. As Mr. Obama put it in his radio address a week ago, when the oil companies are making huge profits and people are suffering and deficits are growing, “these tax giveaways aren’t right. They aren’t smart. And we need to end them.”With gas at $4 a gallon, oil at $100 a barrel and profits at near-record levels, it is hard to feel sympathy for the oil industry. Yet sympathy is what the C.E.O.’s of the five biggest companies asked for when they appeared Thursday before a Senate hearing on a Democratic proposal to eliminate about $2 billion in tax breaks for the Big Five.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/13oil.html?ref=chevroncorporation">At Senate Hearing, Oil Executives Defend Tax Breaks<date>Published: May 12, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Executives of five of the largest oil companies on Thursday defended the $2.1 billion they receive each year in tax breaks, but said they would be willing to give them up as part of a comprehensive reform of the tax code.At a three-hour Senate Finance Committee hearing that was largely political theater interrupted occasionally by a serious tax policy discussion, the oil industry executives said their current tax breaks were not subsidies but legitimate tax deductions, shared in some cases with other industries. Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said that the provisions, such as a tax deduction for certain types of manufacturing, were not “special incentives, preferences or subsidies for oil and gas, but rather standard deductions applied across all businesses in the United States.” He said that eliminating the provision just for the oil industry would be “misinformed and discriminatory.” Under questioning from Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the panel’s chairman, Mr. Tillerson said that he would support repeal of the manufacturing tax credit and other tax incentives, as long as all businesses were treated the same. “Repeal it for everybody, gone,” he said. “Everything for everybody everywhere ought to be on the table.” At issue was a Democratic-sponsored bill to rescind roughly $2 billion of the $4 billion in tax incentives the oil industry now enjoys annually, with the money dedicated to deficit reduction. Mr. Tillerson shared the witness stand with top executives of the four other biggest multinational oil companies, John S. Watson of Chevron; Marvin E. Odum of the United States division of Shell; H. Lamar McKay of BP America; and James J. Mulva of ConocoPhillips. Collectively, the five companies reported more than $35 billion in first-quarter profits, and are on a pace to set record profits for the year. Their profits, their tax treatment and gasoline that in many areas is over $4 a gallon have made them juicy targets for Democrats seeking political points and painless revenue. The bill, which is expected to come to a vote on the Senate floor next week, is unlikely to command a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Even if it passes, it has little chance in the Republican-dominated House, which seems more inclined to provide the oil companies more access to public lands and waters than to clamp down on their tax incentives. The House passed the third of three Republican pro-drilling bills on Thursday. The measure would force the Interior Department to open large tracts of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts to oil exploration and to set annual production goals. The administration and most Democrats opposed it, saying that the Deepwater Horizon accident a year ago demonstrated the dangers of offshore operations. The Senate tax bill’s chief sponsor, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, demanded that Mr. Mulva apologize for a ConocoPhillips press release on Wednesday that called the tax proposal “un-American.” “I think that’s beyond the pale,” Mr. Menendez said. “I was hoping you would come here and apologize for that.” “Nothing was intended personally,” Mr. Mulva said. “So the bottom line is you’re unwilling to apologize,” Mr. Menendez said. “So I’ll continue to take offense.” Most Republicans, along with Democratic senators from energy-producing states, appear sure to oppose the plan. One oil-state Democrat, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, said this week that oil and gas subsidies accounted for less than 13 percent of all United States energy subsidies. The ranking Republican on the finance committee, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, suggested that Democrats were playing a cynical game, seeking to blame oil companies while, he asserted, intending to raise gasoline prices to force reduced consumption. “So while the American people ask Congress to do something about high gas prices,” he said, “the response of Democrats is to rail against oil executives, to mask the fact that their policy is actually to make the price at the pump more painful.” He called the hearing a “dog and pony show” and displayed a blown-up picture of a dog riding a pony, to underscore his argument that the hearing was just a chance for Democrats to score political points, without doing anything about high gas prices or a sensible energy policy. Mr. Odum of Shell said in an interview after the hearing that he was disappointed that the discussion focused on the relatively small value of the oil industry’s tax breaks and not on the broader question of how to address the deficit and expand domestic production of oil and gas. “The piece I take the most exception to, once you get past some of the theater aspects of the setting, is that it’s such a narrow view,” he said. “If the purpose is to address the deficit and the long-term health of the economy, the bigger picture is more important. And that is to produce more oil and gas and get the revenue streams and jobs from that.” Brian Knowlton contributed reporting.WASHINGTON — Executives of five of the largest oil companies on Thursday defended the $2.1 billion they receive each year in tax breaks, but said they would be willing to give them up as part of a comprehensive reform of the tax code.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/round-up-the-usual-c-e-o-s/?ref=chevroncorporation">Round Up the Usual C.E.O.'s<date>May 11, 2011, 11:28 am</date><text>Doug Mills/The New York TimesFrom left, executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell and BP being sworn last June before testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It has been nearly a year since the chief executives of the five biggest multinational oil companies were hauled before a committee of Congress for a ritual flaying. Last June, the heads of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and ConocoPhillips were called by the House Energy and Commerce Committee to testify on the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which at the time was still pouring 50,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico. On Thursday, the same Big Five executives will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to explain why they need more than $4 billion a year in tax breaks even as they are raking in near-record profits (more than $35 billion in the first quarter of 2011 alone). The cast of characters is the same: Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil; John S. Watson of Chevron; Marvin E. Odum of the United States division of Shell; H. Lamar McKay of BP America; and James J. Mulva of ConocoPhillips. These Congressional set pieces feature the dark-suited villains of the day (tobacco executives, bankers, oil company chieftains) standing in a row taking an oath to tell as much of the truth as their lawyers will allow. The legislative scorecard is mixed. The tobacco companies were brought to heel by state attorneys general, not by Congress. The Obama administration and Congress are still wrestling over bank regulation and consumer financial protection. Neither the House nor the Senate has passed comprehensive legislation dealing with offshore oil drilling. And despite the current angst over high gasoline prices, it is unlikely that Democrats can muster enough votes in both chambers to take away the oil companies’ favorable tax treatment. For those who want to follow the action, the hearing is scheduled for Thursday at 9 a.m. and can be watched at the Senate Finance Committee’s Web site.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/business/30chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron Profit Rises as Unrest Lifts Oil Prices<date>Published: April 29, 2011</date><text>The Chevron Corporation said Friday that its first-quarter profit rose 36 percent as economic growth and supply disruptions drove crude prices above $100 a barrel.Net income rose to $6.21 billion, or $3.09 a share, from $4.55 billion, or $2.27, a year earlier, Chevron said.

The move is part of a broader strategy to improve shareholder returns. In February, the company approved a $13.5 billion capital program, the bulk of which will go toward exploration and production. Only about 9 percent will be devoted to refining and marketing — activities like getting gasoline to the consumers at the pump. The company sells gasoline in Europe and the United States, mainly under the Phillips 66 and Conoco brands. “This year’s capital budget reflects our emphasis on building the upstream business,” the chief executive, James J. Mulva, said in a statement in February. “We expect competitive returns from our increased investments in North American and Australian unconventional resource projects.” The company is also involved in Canadian oil sands projects. In a related initiative, the company has been aggressively buying back shares. Last year, ConocoPhillips announced plans to buy back as much as $5 billion worth of shares. With $4 billion repurchased, ConocoPhillips said in February that it would buy back an additional $10 billion of stock. “We are executing the plan set out last year to improve returns and create value through disciplined capital spending, noncore asset sales and growing production per share,” Mr. Mulva said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our unique approach prioritizes value creation over low margin production growth and is designed to position the company for higher returns and increased shareholder distributions in the future.” In the last two years, shares of ConocoPhillips have gained more than 80 percent, outperforming rivals like BP, Chevron and Exxon Mobil as well as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/using-solar-power-to-extract-oil/?ref=chevroncorporation">Using Solar Power to Extract Oil<date>February 24, 2011, 4:54 pm</date><text>GlassPoint GlassPoint has built a greenhouse with lightweight mirrors that it says could also be used to make steam for electricity production. A California company has begun using solar power to squeeze oil out of an old oil field, flooding the underground rock with steam that comes from the sun’s heat instead of from burning natural gas. The technique was tried in the 1980s by the Atlantic Richfield Company, but GlassPoint Solar, of Fremont, Calif., which cut the ribbon on a pilot project Thursday, says its plant is the only one of its kind now operating. Other companies have discussed such projects. The process is cheaper than using natural gas, even at today’s depressed prices for that fuel, and trims the carbon footprint of the gasoline, according to GlassPoint. The pilot plant, completed in January in Kern County, is very modest, occupying less than an acre and producing only about a million B.T.U.’s per hour. But the company says it could quickly be replicated on a larger scale and could eventually displace 80 percent of the natural gas used to produce a barrel of oil. GlassPoint said that at a full-size plant, its technology could produce steam at a cost of $3 per million B.T.U., compared with a market price of gas today of around $4 per million B.T.U. Whether GlassPoint can get that far remains unclear. The company has no track record in the oil industry and has had three different business strategies in less than two years. Formerly known as CleanBoard, GlassPoint changed its name in October 2009 when it abandoned plans to use a solar-powered factory to make gypsum-based wallboard and said it would work with other wallboard manufacturers. Last year, it refocused its business yet again on using solar power to extract oil. Rod MacGregor, GlassPoint’s chairman, said that burning natural gas to make steam for oil recovery was the largest single use of natural gas in California. About 40 percent of California’s oil is produced through such “enhanced oil recovery,” and the steam can account for as much as two-thirds of the production cost of such oil, according to GlassPoint. The amount of steam needed to produce a barrel of oil varies according to the age of the field, but two million B.T.U. per barrel is typical. Several companies use curved mirrors to focus the sun’s light to make steam, but on Thursday, GlassPoint unveiled a radically different design, one it says could also be used to make steam for electricity production. In existing steam-electric solar plants with curved mirrors, the mirrors sit on heavy, rigid frames so that they will not be deformed by wind and can survive storms. GlassPoint has built a greenhouse and suspended extremely lightweight mirrors from the skeleton of the building. The greenhouse is kept at higher air pressure than the outside environment, so no dust can come in, reducing the problem of cleaning the mirrors. A robot crawls across the glass roof to wash it. The wash water is collected for reuse, an important point since many old oil fields are in deserts. A different solar energy company, BrightSource Energy, is building a solar steam system at a Chevron oil field project in Coalinga, Calif. It is supposed to go into service in the second half of this year. Using solar power for oil recovery makes moot one of solar’s most difficult characteristics, its intermittency, according to John O’Donnell, vice president of GlassPoint. “You’re heating a cubic mile of rock,’’ he said. “It doesn’t matter if you heat it up a little higher in the day.’’ In the pilot project, the greenhouse is too far from the wellhead to send the steam by pipeline, so it is preheating the water, which will then be boiled by natural gas, reducing natural gas use but not as much as in a mature production facility. Another advantage, according to Mr. MacGregor, is that the well is not fussy about steam quality, in contrast to a steam turbine that makes electricity, which demands constant temperature and pressure. “If there are hot water droplets in the steam stream, the rock won’t care, but a turbine certainly would,’’ he said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/world/americas/18briefs-Ecuador.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Ecuador: Appeals Filed in Chevron Case<date>Published: February 17, 2011</date><text>The plaintiffs suing Chevron for contaminating the Amazon rain forest appealed a court ruling ordering Chevron to pay over $9 billion in damages, saying Thursday that more money would be needed to clean up the mess.

But on Thursday they took a step in the direction of drilling again by unveiling a new well-blowout plugging and spill containment system. Soon after the spill, a consortium organized by ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips began a $1 billion project to create such a system. An interim plan is now ready. BP later joined the group, and a final plan is expected by early 2012. The effort includes a capping stack that can fit over a leaky well, contain the leak and pour chemical dispersants over the spill. Inspectors for the Interior Department agency in charge of regulating the industry have observed testing of the cap and are reviewing test results. “We’re open for business today,” said Clay Vaughn, an ExxonMobil official and leader of the consortium. The Interior Department is not hurrying to judgment, although officials say they believe permits will be issued in the next few months. At a conference at Rice University last week, Michael Bromwich, who as head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement is the top federal regulator on offshore drilling, said the government was working cooperatively with the industry. But he expressed doubts that permitting would be as speedy in the future as it was before the BP blowout. “It would simply be irresponsible” to go forward before a new and improved containment plan was in place, he said. In a statement on Thursday, the bureau cautiously welcomed the announcement by the consortium, known as Marine Well Containment Company. “The need to demonstrate well control and containment capacity for deepwater drilling was made clear by the Macondo blowout,” a spokeswoman, Melissa Schwartz, said in a statement. “We appreciate Marine Well Containment Company’s significant progress to address this issue,” she said, “and we continue to encourage them to make their containment system available as quickly as possible to deepwater operators so that new, responsible oil and gas drilling in deepwater can proceed.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/world/americas/16ecuador.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Ecuadoreans Plan Spasm of Lawsuits Against Chevron<date>Published: February 15, 2011</date><text>CARACAS, Venezuela — Armed with a $9 billion ruling against Chevron in Ecuador but little chance of collecting it there, representatives for Ecuadorean villagers said Tuesday that they were looking at waging legal battles against the company in more than a dozen countries where it operates, hoping to force Chevron to pay.The latest salvo, coming only a day after an Ecuadorean judge ordered Chevron to pay one of the largest environmental awards ever, suggests that the legal battle between villagers and oil executives, which began in 1993, is far from over. The case stems from oil pollution in the Ecuadorean rain forest, but Chevron does not operate there and has no significant assets in the country. It was Texaco, which Chevron acquired in a merger in 2001, that was accused of widespread environmental damage before pulling out of Ecuador in the early 1990s. Chevron has much larger operations elsewhere in Latin America, and the plaintiffs’ strategy of pursuing the company across the region could open a contentious new phase in the case — one that would test Ecuador’s political ties with its neighbors and involve some of Washington’s most prominent lobbyists and lawyers. Advisers to the plaintiffs said Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela would be obvious candidates to pursue Chevron assets, but they acknowledged it would not be easy. Venezuela, for instance, is a close Ecuadorean ally and its president, Hugo Chávez, is a frequent critic of the United States. But Chevron has extensive operations in Venezuela and enjoys warmer ties with Mr. Chávez’s government than just about any other American company. The plaintiffs also face an uphill struggle collecting damages in the United States, at least immediately, given that a judge in New York this month temporarily prevented enforcement of the Ecuador awards. Still, legal advisers said they were prepared to try to collect damages in the United States as well. A confidential memo prepared by the Washington law firm Patton Boggs recently released under court order laid out the plaintiffs’ strategy, which foresees using a European industrial espionage firm to investigate Chevron’s assets around the world. “The fact that Chevron has agreed to ‘play ball’ in Venezuela, while the company’s peers have universally rejected the unfavorable contract terms imposed by the Chávez government, may portend difficulty there,” said the memo, code-named “Invictus.” “Nonetheless, the populist Chávez government remains a natural ally” of the plaintiffs. In the memo, lawyers also identified the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Angola, Canada and several other countries where Chevron has significant assets as potential targets. In the Philippines, it even suggested using the services of Frank G. Wisner, the retired diplomat and a foreign affairs adviser for Patton Boggs, who recently waded into the crisis in Egypt as an envoy for the Obama administration. Citing the Invictus memo, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York argued that the plaintiffs were seeking to use a “worldwide, full-court press” to extract a settlement against a company of considerable importance in providing energy supplies to the United States economy. Chevron said it did not intend to pay a dime. “We intend to resist enforcement anywhere where the plaintiffs seek to take what we perceive to be a fraudulent judgment,” said Kent Robertson, a Chevron spokesman. Beyond the temporary protection issued by Judge Kaplan, Mr. Robertson noted a decision by a panel of international arbitrators in The Hague that granted the company a preliminary injunction that might also block enforcement of the judgment. But Ecuadorean lawyers said they did not consider themselves under the jurisdiction of either the American court or the arbitrators. Referring to the arbitration process, one of the lawyers, Pablo Fajardo, said, “This is part of the Chevron legal strategy to delay and obstruct.” Duncan Hollis, associate dean of the Temple University law school, said it was logical for the plaintiffs to take their battle to other countries in the region because “there is some commonality in Latin American legal systems.” But, Mr. Hollis added, “there is no international law about how one court is supposed to enforce the judgments from another nation’s court.” For now, the case moves forward in the Ecuadorean courts. Three judges will hear appeals from both sides. The Amazon coalition intends to appeal the amount of the damages, while Chevron will appeal the entire ruling. “I don’t know if we will be broadcasting” our legal argument, Mr. Robertson said. But he added: “It is the illegitimate nature of the ruling. The scientific evidence demonstrates that this is a meritless outcome.” The final appeal will go to a national appeals court, a process that could take months. Then the fight may move to several countries simultaneously. Advisers to the villagers and forest tribes said they hoped to extract Chevron money from many countries until they reach the final judgment total. The ruling’s impact is already being felt in Ecuador and beyond as a cautionary tale of the environmental and legal aftermath of oil exploration. Alberto Acosta, a former oil minister in Ecuador, called the ruling “a historical precedent.” It is “a reminder that we have to defend ourselves from the irresponsible activity of extraction companies, both oil and mining,” Mr. Acosta said.

The award against Chevron “is one of the largest judgments ever imposed for environmental contamination in any court,” said David M. Uhlmann, an expert in environmental law at the University of Michigan. “It falls well short of the $20 billion that BP has agreed to pay to compensate victims of the gulf oil spill but is a landmark decision nonetheless. Whether any portion of the claims will be paid by Chevron is less clear.” Both sides said they would appeal the ruling, setting the stage for months and potentially years more of legal wrangling in the closely watched case, which has already been marked by claims of industrial espionage and fraud, and remarkably bitter disputes among the various lawyers involved. Legal experts said that the size of the award and the attention the case has focused on environmental degradation were likely to encourage similar suits. The 188-page ruling found Chevron responsible for damages of about $8.6 billion, and perhaps double that amount if Chevron fails to publicly apologize for its actions within 15 days. The judge also ordered Chevron to pay $860 million, or 10 percent of the damages, to the Amazon Defense Coalition, the group formed to represent the plaintiffs. Pablo Fajardo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, called the ruling a “triumph of justice,” but said it still fell short. “We’re going to appeal because we think that the damages awarded are not enough,” he said in a telephone interview. The plaintiffs were seeking as much as $113 billion, according to a report recently submitted to the court. A Chevron spokesman, Kent Robertson, called the decision “illegitimate and unenforceable.” He said Chevron would appeal through the Ecuadorean legal system, and would not pay the damages. “This is the product of fraud,” he said. “It had always been the plan to inflate the damages claim and coordinate with corrupt judges for a smaller judgment.” He suggested that the timing of the ruling, a week after Chevron filed a lawsuit against the plaintiffs’ lawyers, was not coincidental. He said it was coordinated between the plaintiffs and the court, which had previously accepted an expert environmental opinion that Chevron contended was partly ghost-written by representatives of the plaintiffs, who include villagers and Indian tribes in northeastern Ecuador. The plaintiffs have denied any collaboration with the judge and said they merely provided information for the expert’s report as the court encouraged both sides to do. Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, reported a net profit of $19 billion last year. In addition to its appeal in Ecuador, the company hopes to block enforcement of the judgment in American courts. “It might as well be Monopoly money, given all the respect that Chevron will show it,” said Ralph G. Steinhardt, professor of law and international affairs at George Washington University Law School. “There is a legal regime for enforcing foreign judgments but there is a lot of discretion for U.S. judges to suspend the enforcement of foreign judgments.” The decision was the latest installment in a legal soap opera in which Chevron and lawyers for Ecuadorean peasants have sued and countersued over oil pollution in Ecuador’s rain forest. The origins of the case go back to the 1970s, when Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron, operated as a partner with the Ecuadorean state oil company. The villagers sued in 1993, claiming that Texaco had left an environmental mess that was causing illnesses. Chevron bought Texaco in 2001, before the case was resolved. Chevron has been playing hardball for at least the last two years. It produced video recordings from watches and pens wired with bugging devices that suggested a bribery scheme surrounded the proceedings and involved a judge hearing the case. The judge was forced to resign, although it was later revealed that an American behind the secret recordings was a convicted drug trafficker. Chevron appeared to gain the upper hand again when it won a legal bid to secure the outtakes from a documentary about the case, “Crude,” in which Steven Donziger, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, is seen developing strategy and discussing the judicial system and how it operates. Mr. Donziger appeared boastful about meetings with judges and other Ecuadorean officials. Last week, Chevron filed a suit against dozens of people involved in the case, charging that they conspired to extort the company for $113 billion by making up evidence and trying to manipulate the Ecuadorean legal system. At the company’s request, an American judge issued a temporary restraining order to block any judgment for at least four weeks. A day later, international arbiters ordered Ecuador to suspend the enforcement of any judgment. Almost lost in the various disputes related to the lawsuit is the fact that Chevron and plaintiffs have agreed that oil exploration contaminated what had been largely undeveloped swaths of Ecuadorean rainforest. The plaintiffs claim that Chevron must be held responsible for damage where Texaco once operated. Chevron, however, argues that Texaco carried out a cleanup agreement with the Ecuadorean government and that much of the damage was done after Texaco left in the early 1990s, actions for which it should not be held responsible. “The judge recognized the crime committed,” said Guillermo Grefa, head of a Quichua Indian community who claims that Texaco’s oil contamination created respiratory problems among his people. “For us, this is very little. For us, the crime committed by Texaco is incalculable.” Simon Romero reported from Caracas, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

Mr. Berlinger’s film chronicles a lawsuit brought by a group of Ecuadoreans who say that the Lago Agrio oil field — initially run by Texaco, which Chevron now owns — polluted their water supply, and he has been locked in a legal battle against Chevron for months. In May, the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Berlinger would have to give his raw footage, about 600 hours of it, to Chevron. The company said the material would show an improper collaboration between the plaintiffs’ lawyers in the Ecuadorean lawsuit and an expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court as a neutral party. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled in July that Mr. Berlinger would have to turn over only a portion of the footage, now totaling more than 500 hours. In a separate ruling in September, the district court ordered Mr. Berlinger to submit to depositions. In a decision issued on Thursday concerning Mr. Berlinger’s contention that he was protected as a journalist from being compelled to share his materials, the Second Circuit judges said they did not find the argument, which his lawyers presented to the court in July, to be persuasive. “Given all the circumstances of the making of the film,” the judges wrote, “as reasonably found by the district court, particularly the fact that Berlinger’s making of the film was solicited by the plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio litigation for the purpose of telling their story, and that changes to the film were made at their instance, Berlinger failed to carry his burden of showing that he collected information for the purpose of independent reporting and commentary.” Lawyers for Chevron have said that the version of “Crude” shown at the Sundance Film Festival showed the neutral expert, Carlos Beristain, meeting with the plaintiffs and their lawyers before he was appointed by the court. But when the film was later released to theaters, that scene had been edited out. It would later be revealed that it was deleted at the plaintiffs’ request. A member of their legal team wrote to Mr. Berlinger after the Sundance festival and asked that he “remove the images that we discussed.” The lawyer added, “This is so serious that we could lose everything, or a great deal, just because of these minuscule shots.” In response to the new ruling, Mr. Berlinger wrote in an e-mail that it was a “misunderstanding of the circumstances surrounding the production of this film in particular and the nature of long-term investigative documentary reporting in general.”A federal appeals court has ruled that Joe Berlinger, a filmmaker who was ordered to hand over footage from his 2009 documentary “Crude” to the Chevron Corporation, cannot invoke a journalist’s privilege in refusing to do so because his work does not constitute an act of independent reporting.

The candid footage has come to light because Chevron’s lawyers persuaded a federal judge in New York to force a filmmaker who chronicled the legal fight, Joe Berlinger, to turn over more than 500 hours of outtakes from his film, “Crude.” The ruling has drawn wide attention because Mr. Berlinger and lawyers for the plaintiffs had argued that the outtakes were protected, in much the same way that journalists are generally not required to turn over their notebooks if they are subpoenaed in a lawsuit between other parties. The ruling, which came last May and was largely upheld by a court of appeals this summer, is being seen as a cautionary tale for lawyers who invite in documentary filmmakers to tell the story of their legal fights. Chevron has used the outtakes in case after case in the United States tied to the sprawling suit, in which plaintiffs in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, claim that oil exploration by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001, left local waters toxic. A report submitted to the court in Ecuador puts the damage at $113 billion. Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs’ side of the suit, said the core of the litigation is that “Chevron’s reckless drilling practices and its fraudulent remediation resulted in the massive contamination of the environment and the deaths and illnesses of thousands of people.” The clips, however, “have sent shock waves through the nation’s legal communities,” one federal judge said in an opinion. Another court last month called them “extraordinary evidence” that suggests that lawyers “presented false evidence and engaged in other misconduct.” In one outtake, when a dinner companion asks Mr. Donziger if the judge will be killed if he rules against his side, Mr. Donziger says, “He thinks he will be, which is just as good.” In another, he talks about evidence of toxic contamination that is all “smoke and mirrors.” Chevron contends that still other clips and documents show that the plaintiffs ghostwrote a crucial environmental report by a supposedly independent expert and worked with the government to prosecute two Texaco lawyers who helped get Ecuadorean officials to sign off on the company’s cleanup efforts in 2001. Randy M. Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, said, “This is a series of smoking guns that’s more like a five-alarm fire.” Stuart D. Karle, a lawyer who specializes in media and international law, said the video, like the clip where Mr. Donziger refers to intimidating the judge, seems to play into Chevron’s hand. “It’s impossible for some of the stuff to see the context in which it has a benign explanation,” Mr. Karle said. “This guy gave them a great big stick and said, ‘Beat the hell out of me with it.’ ” But Ms. Hinton, the spokeswoman for the plaintiffs’ lawyers, disagreed. She said the outtakes were “of little relevance to the lawsuit in Ecuador” and called Chevron’s accusations “a sideshow and a distraction from the real fraud the company is committing in Ecuador.” As for the ghostwriting accusations, the plaintiffs have argued that the court allowed a degree of contact and contribution from both sides. Mr. Donziger, aside from the statement provided by Ms. Hinton, declined to comment. Mr. Berlinger, the filmmaker, said the outtakes “do not demonstrate anything other than the types of interactions you would expect when an independent documentary crew is embedded for nearly three years with their subjects.” Chevron’s demand for the outtakes began with an early look at the film. The company’s lawyers noticed that the version at the Sundance Film Festival showed Carlos Beristain, a physician and psychologist, at a meeting with the plaintiffs and their lawyers before the Ecuadorean court appointed him to serve as an independent expert for the environmental report. By American legal standards, that meeting could undercut claims of neutrality. In the film’s commercial release, Mr. Beristain had been edited out. Mr. Mastro said, “We found the substituted scene and said: ‘Wow. If that was in the film, what else was out there that didn’t make it into the film?’ ” Alliances between filmmakers and lawyers are becoming increasingly common, with recent films tied to cases involving Dole Food, Coca-Cola and Unocal. The movie about Dole — “Bananas!” — told the story of Nicaraguan banana workers who claim they were left sterile by pesticides. Lawyers for Dole showed clips from the film depicting rallies that a California judge said showed that the plaintiffs had “stirred up and manipulated the frantic and forlorn populace” to create “an atmosphere of intimidation and fear.” She threw out a $2.3 million verdict for the plaintiffs, citing fraud. Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Dole, said defendants would increasingly fight plaintiffs’ use of documentaries to promote their cause and force settlements. “The ‘Crude’ and Dole cases are going to make this a strategy that defendants are going to fight back against, hard,” Mr. Boutrous predicted. Filmmakers say the Berlinger case worries them. Alex Gibney, the director of “Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer,” said he had successfully fended off similar subpoenas for outtakes from two of his other documentaries, “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room” and “Casino Jack and the United States of Money,” about the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Mr. Gibney said he was concerned about an erosion of trust with interview subjects. “I want to create that safe space where people feel like they can talk to me because they trust me to use their remarks in a way that’s properly contextualized,” he said. If any on-camera remarks that were not intended to be a part of the journalistic record are open to scrutiny in a legal case, “it’s a big problem,” Mr. Gibney said. Mr. Berlinger wrote in an e-mailed response to questions that he was concerned that when younger filmmakers learned of “my astronomical legal bills,” they might be scared off of such films entirely. Floyd Abrams, an expert in First Amendment law who wrote a brief fighting the demand for the outtakes by Chevron on behalf of journalism organizations, including The New York Times, said that regardless of how revealing the clips were, the court’s broad order was mistaken. “It is essential to the creative process that outtakes — even nonconfidential ones — be generally protected from disclosure and that they be ordered produced only when they are truly needed for use in a litigation,” he said, even if some of the outtakes are useful to those seeking them. In one of the “Crude” outtakes, Alexis Mera, the Ecuadorean president’s chief legal adviser, raises a concern others might have after the Chevron ruling. “Why are they filming?” Mr. Mera blurts out in a meeting with plaintiffs’ lawyers. “That seems to me to be completely improper.”The film clips look like evidence from a sting operation: in one, a lawyer plans a huge protest at a courthouse because the judges “make decisions based on who they fear the most.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/sports/01woods.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Tiger Woods Returns to World Challenge for First Time in Two Years<date>Published: November 30, 2010</date><text>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — Tiger Woods jumped on the question by the sportscaster Jim Hill on Tuesday the way Hill, a former N.F.L. defensive back, used to jump on receivers’ routes.“With all the talk about this past year,” Hill began, “are you tired of it or is it. ...” “Yes,” Woods interjected.

It is Woods’s first competitive event in Southern California since 2008, when he won the United States Open in San Diego. Woods sat out his tournament in 2008 with a knee injury and was conspicuously absent last year, withdrawing because of injuries sustained in a car accident last November that pulled back the curtain on his serial adultery. A year marked by seismic changes in his life — a divorce, a new swing coach, the loss of his No. 1 world ranking — will officially end in a place that conjures warm memories of a more innocent time. “This is home,” said Woods, who grew up in Orange County and used to make the hourlong drive here with his father, Earl, as a child to watch Greg Norman’s event. Woods, 34, has known Hill since 1981. As Hill recalled, he did an on-camera interview with Woods, who was 6 at the time, in which he asked Woods why he liked golf so much. Woods did not answer, so Hill repeated the question, at which point Woods turned to his father and told him he had to go to the bathroom. Hill laughed and said he still has the exchange on film. Over the years, Hill added, he has playfully threatened Woods with unearthing it. At the end of the 25-minute news conference, Woods stepped from the podium and into an embrace with Hill that, despite being on an impossibly tight schedule, Woods seemed in no hurry to extricate himself from. Woods insisted he is the new old Tiger. “It’s been difficult,” he said, referring to the past year, “but also it’s been very rewarding at the same time. It forced me to look deeper into myself and look where — how I grew up and how those things didn’t match with the person who I am, and getting back to that, getting back to how my parents raised me, basically.” Woods has won this event four times, most recently in 2007. He did not record a victory in 12 PGA Tour starts in 2010, the first time since he turned professional in 1996 that he failed to win a tournament. He said repeatedly that he was very excited about the future because of the work he had done on and off the course. On the driving range, Woods has completed a major swing change involving less of a weight shift and more rotation. In his personal life, he has submitted to treatment for a undisclosed addiction and devised a strategy, he said, for steering clear of any relapse. “It’s creating boundaries,” Woods said, “and like I said from the very get-go, there was some boundary failure.” His news conferences remain the same as they were, with Woods in a stilted dance with reporters in which he keeps everybody at arm’s length. He talked about trying to become a little better “each and every day” and spoke of being a “new man,” without elaborating. In “His Father’s Son,” a recently published book on Woods by Tom Callahan, the golfer’s former swing coach, Hank Haney, is quoted saying he would not have been surprised if Woods had followed the example of Michael Jordan and left his sport after the death in 2007 of his father, a former Green Beret. “When Earl died, I thought there was a strong possibility Tiger was going to give it all up to go in the service,” Haney said. Asked if he had entertained the notion, Woods said, “I didn’t.” When pressed, he added: “Well, I’ve always wanted to become a Seal. That’s something that I told my dad from the very get-go, either I’m going to become a professional golfer or I’m going to become a Navy Seal.” Woods continues to view golf as his calling, and it is obvious the sport continues to hold his attention. He was never more expansive than when addressing the mechanics of his swing. Woods’s facial expression softened and his voice took on a less protective, more professorial tone, as he explained: “I’m getting to the same impact position a different way, and that is very different. But also some of the motor patterns when I feel impact, I’ve been here before. So that’s not new.” His inner Urkel also was evident on the practice green when Woods spent several minutes engaged in a discussion with Sean O’Hair, with both taking half swings with their putters to help illustrate their points. Woods has an insatiable desire to learn from other athletes who are the best in their fields. During the 2008-9 N.B.A. season, he phoned Kobe Bryant out of the blue. Bryant said they had a meal together when the Lakers played at Orlando and picked each other’s brains. “His attention to details is the greatest,” Bryant said Sunday after the Lakers’ loss to Indiana. Bryant, who weathered a scandal when he was accused of rape in 2003, said he had not spoken to Woods since Woods crashed his car and his life swerved out of control. Bryant moved beyond his scandal, and the fallout from it, one day at a time, and that is what Woods is trying to do. “Just live it day by day,” Woods said. “That’s all I can do.”</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/science/earth/26parking.html?ref=chevroncorporation">In California, Carports That Can Generate Electricity<date>Published: November 25, 2010</date><text>SAN JOSE, Calif. — And California begat cars, and the cars begat asphalt parking lots. And the lots spawned electricity, transforming the hills and the deserts.Ersatz roofs made of solar panels have sprouted above dozens of school parking lots in the state, altering vistas and promoting a philosophy of green thinking among the young. Yet the primary driver of the solar roofs is economic. By forming partnerships with banks and other backers, school districts get guarantees of reliably cheap electricity for their buildings for as long as 20 years. The institutions, which finance the systems and sell the electricity back to the schools, also receive tax incentives from the federal and state governments. So far, solar carports have been installed at some 75 elementary, high school and community college campuses in California, the majority of them in the San Francisco area. Some are designed as a broad fan of panels canting slightly upward and supported by a single pole; more often they are an ode to rectilinearity, parallel to the asphalt and supported by a line of poles between the rows of parking spaces. Walter Hood, a designer based in Oakland, said he sees the seeds of a new suburban aesthetic in the proliferation of the photovoltaic panels. “It’s an interesting piece of infrastructure,” he said, adding, “So maybe in the future we’re thinking of parking lots as something that is always covered.” Schools were not the first to move in this direction. Leading the way in this re-creation of the suburban landscape was Google, which added solar canopies to the parking lots at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., three years ago. Some come with outlets for solar-charging electric cars. “At the Googleplex, the P.V. is almost acting like a grove of trees,” Mr. Hood said. But schools are now at the leading edge of the trend. “This will soon be the norm,” said Michelle O’Shea, a science teacher at Leland High School in southwestern San Jose, where the parking lot went solar a year ago. “It will be hard to imagine that we didn’t do this.” For students, the new structures can offer an education in how clean electricity is generated. “Schoolchildren are growing up with it, so it becomes ingrained in their perception of how a society functions,” said Brad Parker, a consultant on a solar carport project for the San Luis Coastal Unified School District in central California. And interest in the systems is growing. “I’ve gotten calls from Hawaii, from Canada, from all over California,” said John Cimino, the director of maintenance, operations and transportation for the Milpitas Unified School District, northeast of San Jose. The solar panels fulfill 75 percent of his district’s annual electricity needs during the school year, he said, and 100 percent of its summer needs. The company that brokered the district’s deal was Chevron Energy Solutions, a subsidiary of Chevron and perhaps the most active of a dozen such intermediaries working around California. The same company helped create a 2.1-megawatt parking lot system on the Fresno campus of California State University. Brian Swanson, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, the utility that serves most communities in the Bay Area, said that the overall capacity of school-based photovoltaic systems there grew nearly fivefold from 2008 to 2009, to 15.5 megawatts from 327 kilowatts. This year, the cumulative total was 20 megawatts, enough to power 3,500 homes. Yet in the Southern California city of Lancaster, a single parking-lot solar system being constructed by the Antelope Valley Unified School District could reach 9.6 megawatts, according to Mat Havens, the district’s director of facilities. The estimated savings over the 20-year life of a generating contract can run from $12 million for a district like Milpitas (although savings last year were a much more modest $51,000) to $40 million for Antelope Valley. Yet solar parking lots are not solely a California or Southwest phenomenon. In New Jersey, two elementary schools and a middle school in Newark plan to install them in addition to rooftop photovoltaic installations on the school buildings. Boonton High School in Morris County, N.J., is building solar coverings for its parking lots to supplement photovoltaic systems being installed on the roofs of its ice rinks. While the solar parking lots have generally been welcomed by local residents, people in one town in San Luis Obispo County were less receptive. A community advisory board in the small coastal town of Los Osos voted 8 to 1 to oppose the panels on parking lots at a local middle and elementary school, with one panel member warning of “visual blight.” Indeed, the current generation of solar carports does have a utilitarian feel and the bare-bones aesthetic of a Quonset hut. But Mr. Hood, the Oakland designer, suggested that designers could work with manufacturers to change that, treating the photovoltaic materials as a potentially beguiling “surface treatment” rather than a mere assemblage of panels. “They are becoming more ubiquitous in our landscape,” he said. “It’s not just parking lots.” From schools to offices to malls, photovoltaic arrays could one day become as familiar as fire hydrants, Mr. Hood said. “Once they become ubiquitous, they disappear,” he added.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/business/energy-environment/17FUEL.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Energy, and Plenty of It, for Decades to Come<date>Published: November 16, 2010</date><text>HOUSTONTHREE summers ago, the world’s supertankers were racing across the oceans as fast as they could to deliver oil to markets growing increasingly thirsty for energy. Americans were grumbling about paying as much as $4 a gallon for gasoline, as the price of crude oil leapt to $147 a barrel. Natural gas prices were vaulting too, sending home electricity bills soaring. A book making the rounds at the time, “Twilight in the Desert,” by Matthew R. Simmons, seemed to sum up the conventional wisdom: the age of cheap, plentiful oil and gas was over. “Sooner or later, the worldwide use of oil must peak,” the book concluded, “because oil, like the other two fossil fuels, coal and natural gas, is nonrenewable.” But no sooner did the demand-and-supply equation shift out of kilter than it swung back into something more palatable and familiar. Just as it seemed that the world was running on fumes, giant oil fields were discovered off the coasts of Brazil and Africa, and Canadian oil sands projects expanded so fast, they now provide North America with more oil than Saudi Arabia. In addition, the United States has increased domestic oil production for the first time in a generation. Meanwhile, another wave of natural gas drilling has taken off in shale rock fields across the United States, and more shale gas drilling is just beginning in Europe and Asia. Add to that an increase in liquefied natural gas export terminals around the world that connected gas, which once had to be flared off, to the world market, and gas prices have plummeted. Energy experts now predict decades of residential and commercial power at reasonable prices. Simply put, the world of energy has once again been turned upside down. “Oil and gas will continue to be pillars for global energy supply for decades to come,” said James Burkhard, a managing director of IHS CERA, an energy consulting firm. “The competitiveness of oil and gas and the scale at which they are produced mean that there are no readily available substitutes in either one year or 20 years.” Some unpleasant though predictable consequences are likely, of course, as the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico this spring demonstrated. Some environmentalists say that gas from shale depends on drilling techniques and chemicals that may jeopardize groundwater supplies, and that a growing dependence on Canadian oil sands is more dangerous for the climate than most conventional oils because mining and processing of the sands require so much energy and a loss of forests. And while moderately priced oil and gas bring economic relief, they also make renewable sources of energy like wind and solar relatively expensive and less attractive to investors unless governments impose a price on carbon emissions. “When wind guys talk to each other,” said Michael Skelly, president of Clean Line Energy Partners, a developer of transmission lines for renewable energy, “they say, ‘Damn, what are we going to do about the price of natural gas?’ ” Oil and gas executives say they provide a necessary energy bridge; that because both oil and gas have a fraction of the carbon-burning intensity of coal, it makes sense to use them until wind, solar, geothermal and the rest become commercially viable. “We should celebrate the fact that we have enough oil and gas to carry us forward until a new energy technology can take their place,” said Robert N. Ryan Jr., Chevron’s vice president for global exploration. Mr. Skelly and other renewable energy entrepreneurs counter that without a government policy fixing a price on carbon emissions through a tax or cap and trade, the hydrocarbon bridge could go on and on without end. So what happened to shift the energy world so drastically the last few years? Is the shift reversible once the economy picks up? The recession throttled the world’s demand for energy, particularly in the United States and Europe, but that tells only part of the story. Periodic jolts, like the Arab oil embargoes in the 1960s and 1970s, are likely to recur in a world with unpredictable actors like Iran. Access to oil and gas may always be limited by geopolitics, especially in places like the Middle East. Just in the last few days, the decline in the dollar spurred a new spike in oil prices, along with those of other commodities. Yet, the outlook, based on long-term trends barely visible five years ago, now appears to promise large supplies of oil and gas from multiple new sources for decades into the future. The same high prices that inspired dire fear in the first place helped to resolve them. High oil and gas prices produced a wave of investment and drilling, and technological innovation has unlocked oceans of new resources. Oil and gas from ocean bottoms, the Arctic and shale rock fields are quickly replacing tired fields in places like Mexico, Alaska and the North Sea. Much depends, of course, on government policies in the coming decades. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization that advises industrialized countries, projected this month that global energy demand would increase by an astounding 36 percent between 2008 and 2035, assuming the broad policy commitments already announced by governments were exercised. Oil demand is projected to grow to 99 million barrels a day in 2035, from 84 million barrels a day in 2009.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/business/energy-environment/10chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron to Buy Atlas Energy for $3.2 Billion<date>Published: November 9, 2010</date><text>Chevron on Tuesday became the latest energy company to set its sights on unconventional natural gas exploration, announcing that it had reached an agreement to acquire Atlas Energy for $3.2 billion.The deal gives Chevron a foothold in the coveted Marcellus Shale, a region in the Eastern states subject to several deals in the last year as energy companies have rushed to tap into what could potentially be one of the country’s most significant deposits of natural gas. The purchase of Atlas comes 11 months after Chevron’s larger rival, Exxon Mobil, agreed to pay $31 billion for XTO Energy, an energy producer known for its expertise in extracting gas from shale deposits. Chevron, the country’s second-largest energy company, agreed to pay a 37 percent premium for Atlas, an offer that analysts said was evidence of the importance the company has placed on the Marcellus Shale. Atlas shares rose 34 percent, to $42.50. “Chevron has been criticized for not being more aggressive, if you will, in getting into natural gas plays sooner and in a bigger way,” said Fadel Gheit, an oil and gas analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Company. “This is their answer.” Shares of other natural gas producers also rose. The Range Resources Corporation, the EQT Corporation and the Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation increased at least 4 percent in heavy trading. For its part, Atlas Energy’s allure lies in its 486,000 net acres of Marcellus Shale, which extends from West Virginia through Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and into New York State. Chevron will also get a 49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, a venture with the Williams Companies that owns more than 1,000 miles of natural-gas gathering lines serving the shale. “We are acquiring a company that has one of the premier acreage positions in the prolific Marcellus,” Chevron’s vice chairman, George L. Kirkland, said in a statement. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are hardly the only energy giants that have swooned over the big shale formation, whose gas reserves have only recently become accessible because of improved recovery technology. Reliance Industries of India has invested more than $2 billion this year in Marcellus, including a $1.7 billion venture that it formed with Atlas in April. In that deal, Reliance agreed to pay $340 million in cash and another $1.4 billion in a drilling carry in return for a 40 percent stake in about 300,000 net acres of the shale holdings. (Chevron will assume Atlas’s role in the venture.) Also this year, Consol Energy spent $3.5 billion to acquire 500,000 net acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia from Dominion Resources, and Royal Dutch Shell bought the assets of East Resources for $4.7 billion in cash, giving it 650,000 net acres of Marcellus Shale rights. Chevron is offering Atlas shareholders $38.25 a share in cash and a portion of more than 41 million units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, worth about $5.09 an Atlas Energy share. The offer totals $43.34 a share. Chevron will also take on $1.1 billion in debt; the deal is contingent on several restructuring transactions on Atlas’s part. The deal must also be approved by Atlas shareholders, including the billionaire investor Leon G. Cooperman and his son Wayne. The elder Mr. Cooperman’s Omega Advisors held an 8.9 percent stake as of June 30, while his son’s fund, Cobalt Capital Management, owned 5.5 percent. Wayne Cooperman, who said in telephone interview that his fund had owned Atlas for about a decade, described Chevron’s offer as bittersweet. He characterized Atlas as “the little company that nobody was really paying attention to” — until the recent frenzy to get access to the Marcellus reserves, that is. “I would have liked more,” Mr. Cooperman said, referring to Chevron’s premium. “Unfortunately, gas prices have been so low that it’s depressing the whole industry.” Indeed, in no small part because of the newfound supplies coming from shale exploration, natural gas prices have hovered around $4 a million British thermal units, down about 70 percent from their peak in July 2008. But Chevron’s deal is a vote of confidence that prices will rebound, and most analysts agreed with the logic behind the deal. “It’s almost refreshing to see a company and a management team doing what they ought to be doing,” said Mark Gilman, an energy analyst with the Benchmark Company, “and that is, it ought to be a regimen where you try to buy low and sell high, and not the reverse.” Jefferies &amp; Company is lead financial adviser to Atlas Energy and Deutsche Bank is co-financial adviser. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz is the legal adviser. Chevron is being advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/business/30bizbriefs-CHEVRONSPROF_BRF.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron’s Profit Falls On Drilling Moratorium<date>Published: October 29, 2010</date><text>The Chevron Corporation said that its income slipped nearly 2 percent in the third quarter on costs related to the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and hefty foreign exchange charges.

The results fell short of Wall Street expectations, and its shares fell $1.84, to $82.60. Chevron, which is based in New York, benefited from higher oil and gas prices and better profit margins in its refining business, but it also booked $367 million in foreign-currency expenses.

For several months Chevron has been locked in a legal battle with the filmmaker and subjects of ''Crude,'' a 2009 feature about a group of Ecuadorians who are suing the company, saying that oil fields established there by Texaco (now owned by Chevron) polluted their water supply. Chevron has argued that outtakes from ''Crude,'' depicting what the company says is improper interaction between lawyers for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and a neutral court-appointed expert, could be useful as Chevron fights litigation seeking $113 billion for environmental damage and the prosecution of two Chevron lawyers in Ecuador. Courts have previously ruled that the director of ''Crude,'' Joe Berlinger, must turn over some of his raw film footage to Chevron, and that Mr. Berlinger must submit to additional depositions in the case. In his order dated Wednesday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court said there was ''abundant evidence'' that Steven R. Donziger, an American lawyer representing the Ecuadorian plaintiffs, has acted ''at least primarily in capacities other than that of an attorney,'' and ''in major respects'' his role has been ''that of a political operative, not a lawyer.'' Denying the arguments of lawyers for Mr. Donziger, who said Chevron's subpoena was ''overbroad and unduly burdensome'' and seeking privileged material, Judge Kaplan cited scenes from Mr. Berlinger's outtakes in which Mr. Donziger says the Ecuadorians' lawsuit ''is not a legal case'' but ''a political battle'' and adds, ''At the end of the day, this is all for the Court, just a bunch of smoke and mirrors.'' Randy M. Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, said in a telephone interview, ''We're extremely gratified by the judge's decision,'' pointing to the judge's remarks on the ''extraordinarily revealing'' nature of Mr. Berlinger's outtakes. Representatives for Mr. Donziger said in a statement that they ''respectfully disagree with the court's decision on Chevron's discovery motion,'' adding that Chevron was trying to use ''false allegations to pry open all private communications between lawyers and their clients for the entire 17-year duration of this litigation.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

It provides another benefit, too: helping the Democratic congressman run something akin to a permanent political campaign. Joe Baca T-shirts and caps are given out at the charity’s events, where banners display his name. Local newspapers mention the charity’s donations, and cable stations show appearances by Mr. Baca and his family at functions his foundation supports. “It’s great,” said Laura Goodloe, 36, as she watched her 8-year-old son, Jordan, play at the arena in San Bernardino, Calif., where the Baca Foundation offered a free basketball clinic last month. “He is giving back to the community.” But unlike most private foundations, Mr. Baca’s gets little of its money from its founders’ pockets. Instead, local companies and major corporations that have often turned to Mr. Baca’s Washington office for help, and usually succeed in getting it, are the chief donors. A review by The New York Times of federal tax records and House and Senate disclosure reports found at least two dozen charities that lawmakers or their families helped create or run that routinely accept donations from businesses seeking to influence them. The sponsors — AT&amp;T, Chevron, General Dynamics, Morgan Stanley, Eli Lilly and dozens of others — contribute millions of dollars annually in gifts ranging from token amounts to a check for $5 million. Since 2009, businesses have sent lobbyists and executives to the plush Boulders resort in Scottsdale, Ariz., for a fund-raiser for the scholarship fund of Representative Steve Buyer, Republican of Indiana; sponsored a skeet shooting competition in Florida to help the favorite food bank of Representative Allen Boyd, Democrat of Florida; and subsidized a spa and speedway outing in Las Vegas to aid the charity of Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada. Just last month, they touted their largess with flags bearing their names near the tees at a golf tournament benefiting the foundation of Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina. Despite rules imposed in 2007 to curb the influence of special interests in Congress, corporate donations to lawmakers’ charities have continued, thanks to a provision that allows businesses to make unlimited gifts to them. And while business executives say they want to give to a good cause, their pattern of spending — contributions that often are not disclosed, in apparent violation of ethics rules — suggests another reason. Altria, the cigarette maker, for example, sent at least $45,000 in donations over a six-week period last fall to four charitable programs founded by House members — including Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, and Mr. Clyburn, the Democratic whip — just as the company was seeking approval of legislation intended to curb illegal Internet sales of its cigarettes. An Altria spokesman said the donations were not related to the measure, which all four congressmen backed. (The other two are Mr. Boyd and Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan.) Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, acknowledged that the company participates in lawmakers’ charitable events in part to get access to them and push its agenda. “We are not apologetic about it at all: it is part of our overall effort to work with policy makers,” he said. “Social settings are always a good way to get to know people.” Like Mr. Baca, other members of Congress benefit from the good will that their corporate-financed philanthropy generates among voters. The lawmakers defend the donations, saying they have no influence on the politicians’ positions on legislation or policy. They also say that they typically do not serve on the charities’ governing boards or solicit contributions themselves. “There is nothing improper here at all,” said Mark Hayes, a spokesman for Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who helped found two Indiana nonprofit groups that are supported by corporate contributions. “They are simply causes he believes in.” But some current and former lawmakers, as well as ethics officials on Capitol Hill, find the charitable donations troubling, calling them one of the last major unregulated fronts in the “pay to play” culture in Washington. The donations typically far exceed what companies are permitted to give to candidates in campaign contributions. The Office of Congressional Ethics, a House oversight group, twice last year investigated lawmakers’ charities, but took no action, in part because the House granted waivers exempting the congressmen from prohibitions against soliciting donations from companies with business before their committees.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/national-pension-bidding-for-colonial-pipeline/?ref=chevroncorporation">Korea's National Pension Bidding for Colonial Pipeline<date>August 23, 2010, 5:30 am</date><text>National Pension Service, South Korea’s state-run fund, is seeking to acquire a 23 percent stake in American pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline from Chevron, the fund said Monday according to Reuters.

Chevron said in a statement that interactions between lawyers for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and a court-appointed expert showed the parties “engaged in an illegal scheme to corrupt the proceedings in Ecuador.” Ilann M. Maazel, a lawyer whose firm represents the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said that neither Chevron nor Mr. Berlinger had provided his team with the film outtakes, and that lawyers for Chevron had similar access to court experts. “They cherrypick a couple of minutes and share it with the court, but they’re not willing to release all the tapes,” Mr. Maazel said in a telephone interview. He said that neither Chevron nor Mr. Berlinger would provide the outtakes to him.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D8143DF932A05754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=chevroncorporation">Net Income Triples for Chevron<date>Published: July 31, 2010</date><text>Chevron posted a threefold jump in profit on Friday, beating estimates as its refinery margins improved. The oil company raised its 2010 oil and gas production growth forecast to 3 percent. Energy giants like Chevron and its peers Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, which reported results on Thursday, have benefited from renewed demand for fuel as the global economy crawls out of the recession. Chevron's second-quarter net income jumped to $5.41 billion, or $2.70 a share, from $1.75 billion, or 87 cents a share, a year before. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.44 a share, according to the average on Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 32 percent, to $53 billion. Chevron has so far felt only a modest impact from the drilling moratorium now in place after the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico. George L. Kirkland, Chevron's vice chairman and head of upstream operations, told analysts in a call he saw the 2010 impact from the halt in drilling at less than 10,000 barrels a day. Mr. Kirkland said Chevron was pushing ahead with its deepwater plans in the Gulf of Mexico, and that final investment decisions on its Jack/St Malo and Big Foot oil projects would be made later this year ''assuming the moratorium is lifted.'' ''If this keeps sliding out in the unknowns, it will impact the projects,'' he added. Chevron owns half of Jack/St Malo, expected to produce 120,000 to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at its peak after starting in 2014, and 60 percent of Big Foot, which is expected to peak at 63,000 barrels after starting up in the next five years.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/global/27iht-renindo.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Indonesia Seeks to Tap Its Huge Geothermal Reserves<date>Published: July 26, 2010</date><text>BALI, INDONESIA — The 17,500 islands of the Indonesian archipelago, perched perilously on the arc of seismic activity known as the Pacific Ring, are plagued by unpredictable and often deadly volcanic eruptions. But there is an upside to living with fire: vast reservoirs of underground water, heated by the earth’s core, can be harnessed to generate electricity. Indonesia has more than 40 percent of the world’s geothermal reserves, enough to produce 28,100 megawatts over 30 years, equivalent to the power generated from burning 12 billion barrels of oil, according to revised figures released by the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry in March. Geothermal energy could conceivably power a significant part of this sprawling country of more than 227 million people. Currently Indonesia is turning out less than 1,200 megawatts from six geothermal fields scattered across Java, North Sumatra and North Sulawesi — a negligible percentage of its potential, putting it behind both the United States and the Philippines. But Indonesian officials have ambitious goals for geothermal generation. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has said that by 2025 he would like geothermal generating capacity to rise to 9,500 megawatts, or about 5 percent of the country’s total requirements. And tapping into geothermal resources— a low-carbon, clean alternative to the oil and coal that dominate Indonesia’s energy consumption — could help him realize another stated objective: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent over the next decade. To reach these goals, Indonesia will need an upsurge of foreign investment. In late April, Bali was the host of the 2010 World Geothermal Congress, which attracted technical experts, officials and investors from about 80 countries. “The Congress was a way of introducing Indonesia to the world and saying, ‘We’re open for business,”’ said Ted Saeger, energy and natural resources officer at the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. The conference opened with the signing of 12 geothermal-related contracts worth about $5 billion, ushering in the second phase of a fast-track government program to develop Indonesia’s power industry. This phase, estimated to cost $12 billion and scheduled for completion in 2014, calls for an increase in geothermal generating capacity to nearly 4,000 megawatts. A month after the congress, the U.S. commerce secretary, Gary Locke, led a trade mission to Indonesia of representatives from 10 clean technology companies looking for opportunities in geothermal development, particularly in the outer islands. Addressing an American Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Jakarta, Mr. Locke spoke about the prospects. “We cannot be so concerned about the initial cost,” he said. “Ultimately, the cost will go down, the technology will improve. “The benefit to the planet, and to our health, and to the quality of life of today’s people and future generations, is so critical,” he added. Yet his comments recognized a more problematic near-term reality. Technical risks, lengthy lead times and soaring exploration costs have deterred foreign investors seeking a quick return. Geothermal plants use wells to tap subterranean pockets of heated water, releasing pressurized steam capable of turning huge turbines. Operational and maintenance expenses are relatively low, but the initial investment in heat-extraction and power-generating technology is capital intensive, and additional infrastructure spending is often needed, for example to build access roads in remote and mountainous regions. By most estimates, moreover, preliminary geological surveys and exploratory drilling for a single plant can take seven to eight years. “You might put $20 to $40 million into digging holes just to find out what the capacity of your field is,” said Brett King of the law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, in Hong Kong, which has been involved in several geothermal deals. “No one will sign contracts until you know for sure.” During the 1990s, under former President Suharto, a dozen or so companies, local and foreign, began to develop geothermal power in partnership with PLN, the national power utility. But most of these projects collapsed under the weight of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and were canceled by Jakarta under pressure from the International Monetary Fund. Others were taken over by the government or renegotiated at lower prices, while a handful of cases went to arbitration. In the aftermath of that experience, the Indonesian government is no longer offering sovereign guarantees to honor power purchase agreements, and international investors have been slow to return. Regulatory and policy obstacles continue to plague the potentially lucrative sector. Investors are pushing the government to make long-term policy changes, particularly to its subsidy structure for fossil fuels. A low electricity tariff has also hampered progress, despite an average 10 percent rise this month. “Over the last year there has been a lot of policy movement to get the investment climate in shape for foreigners to come in,” Mr. Saeger, the U.S. Embassy official, said. “But key barriers remain,” he added, including “a confusing tendering process and land acquisition problems.”</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/business/global/23chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">In Asia, Nearly a Gulf’s Worth of Oil Awaits Transport<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>ATYRAU, Kazakhstan — Even as the petroleum industry continues drilling in the Gulf of Mexico at considerable expense and risk, a single field here in Central Asia stands ready to produce two-thirds as much oil each day as the entire gulf does, with less danger to the environment.But 30 years after its discovery, this field, known as the Tengiz, is still running at only about half speed. Blame geopolitics, not geology. The problem with the Tengiz field, whose lead operator is the American company Chevron, is not a matter of extracting the oil. More than 100 working wells have already been successfully drilled into the scrub brush desert of western Kazakhstan, near the Caspian Sea. The challenge is getting the oil to the market. The Tengiz field, one of the world’s largest known petroleum reservoirs, is tied to a 935-mile pipeline to the Black Sea that the Russian government has declined for years to expand. That refusal has held even though Chevron is a minority partner in the Russian-led pipeline, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, or C.P.C., which agreed a dozen years ago to more than double its carrying capacity when demand required. As a result, instead of the 600,000 barrels a day from the Tengiz field that the planners had envisioned by now, Chevron has been limited to pumping about 420,000 barrels through the C.P.C. pipeline to the Black Sea — the nearest entry point to international sea lanes. And Chevron has held off on further production investment that would raise the daily total to about a million barrels. (By comparison, the Gulf of Mexico’s daily output is about 1.5 million barrels.) For now, some of the Tengiz oil that cannot be accommodated by the pipeline moves via a costly bucket brigade of ships on the Caspian and overland railway tankers to the Black Sea. The effort has required Chevron to become Kazakhstan’s largest railroad operator. “If Chevron had our way and everything worked beautifully, we would have C.P.C. expanded five years ago,” said Guy Hollingsworth, managing director for Chevron in Europe and Asia, referring to the pipeline. But Chevron does not decide. As the pipeline’s controlling partner, Russia has declined to expand it while trying to line up investors and international rights-of-way for a second, separate pipeline that would provide the next leg of the oil’s journey by an overland link between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Besides further controlling the transport of oil in the region, Russia is seeking to bypass shipping through the Bosporus Straits in Turkey, the typical passage out of the Black Sea, which is a potential bottleneck already operating at full capacity for oil tankers. Russian pipeline negotiations have long been led by the former president and now prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, who has taken a keen personal interest in Eurasian energy politics. The standoff over the C.P.C. expansion is a reminder that while environmental concerns pose a big risk to oil production in the United States and its waters, global politics can pose their own business risks to the industry. In the years immediately after the breakup of the Soviet Union, many in the industry hoped the Caspian region could become a second Persian Gulf, lifting the fortunes of companies and countries and helping shift world oil supplies away from the Middle East. The Caspian basin “has been a success, but it hasn’t lived up to the exaggerated expectations,” Svante E. Cornell, research director for the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute at the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said. “One of the problems has been the Russian government’s unwillingness to expand the flow of oil,” Mr. Cornell said. Chevron is hardly the only company in the Caspian region plagued with transportation woes. Finding an outlet to world markets is a consuming headache of all the companies working in this foreboding, landlocked oil basin in Central Asia. The operator of a separate, gigantic Caspian oil field — a group whose partners include Exxon Mobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Total and Eni — has yet to negotiate a suitable route for exports. Neither has BP, which is managing a major gas field in this region. By comparison, Chevron’s troubles are more subtle. The Tengiz field is productive and profitable, but is not yielding nearly as much oil and money as it could be. Chevron executives emphasize, too, that while exports by rail are more expensive, there is value in having a diversified transportation system. Chevron won the Tengiz contract in 1993, signing a deal with Kazakhstan’s government, whose national oil company has a minority stake in the investor group developing the field. (Besides Chevron, with its 50 percent stake, Exxon Mobil and the Russian oil company Lukoil are also shareholders.) Despite the state oil company’s involvement, the group is periodically squeezed by the Kazakh government for additional taxes and fines to prop up the national budget — something that became more common during the recession. Just this month, for example, Kazakh authorities announced a new export tax of $2.73 a barrel, which will cost Chevron and its partners $1.6 million a day. The government also said it was conducting an investigation into illegal drilling, which could bring huge fines. The consortium has denied it deviated from the state-approved drilling plan.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E5D61031F931A15754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=chevroncorporation">4 Oil Firms Commit $1 Billion For Gulf Rapid-Response Plan<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>Four of the world's biggest oil companies said on Wednesday that they were committing $1 billion to create a rapid-response system to deal with deepwater oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, seeking to restore public confidence in the industry after the BP disaster painfully exposed how unprepared the industry was for a major accident. The voluntary effort, which involves building a set of modular containment equipment that would be kept on standby for emergency use, comes as oil companies seek to persuade the Obama administration to lift a temporary ban on deepwater drilling. The moratorium was imposed after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20 and spewed millions of gallons of oil into the gulf. Officials said the spill served as a wake-up call for the industry, which had invested billions of dollars to develop oil and gas resources in ever-deeper waters offshore but neglected to devise spill-response technology that could be effective in thousands of feet of water. Environmentalists, members of Congress and federal and state officials have already made it clear that the industry will face tougher regulations when drilling resumes. The emergency response plan is part of the oil industry's effort to show it can improve its safety procedures and shape the inevitable rules of conduct that will be imposed. The plan -- which was put together by Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell -- incorporates many of the lessons that BP was forced to learn the hard way in trying to cap a gushing oil well 5,000 feet below the ocean's surface. The four companies said their initiative would seek to include all the companies involved in offshore drilling in the gulf, including BP. Their initial financing of $250 million each will be used to build a set of containment equipment, like underwater systems and pipelines, that will be able to deal with a variety of deepwater problems and can be deployed rapidly in the event of a spill. The partners said it would take six months to get all the elements in place. The companies expect the system will be able to contain spills in water as deep as 10,000 feet and capture up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day, although that capacity could be increased if needed. ''It's doubtful we will ever use it, but this is a risk-management gap we need to fill in order for the government and the public to be confident to allow us to get back to work,'' Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman of Exxon, said in an interview. Critically, the new system is expected to be deployed within 24 hours of an offshore spill, and to be able to fully contain the oil spilled within weeks, said Sara Ortwein, a vice president of engineering at Exxon, which has taken the lead in setting up the spill plan. A new nonprofit entity, called the Marine Well Containment Company, will be created and be in charge of operating and maintaining this emergency capability. The entity, modeled in part after the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which was set up after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, will also finance research to look into new ways of tackling an underwater spill. It has taken BP nearly three months to finally cap its gushing oil well in the gulf, after repeated failures to plug the well using a series of jury-rigged devices. While drilling two relief wells to permanently seal its damaged well, BP has relied on inflatable booms, chemical dispersants, containment vessels and controlled burning to address the spill. ''One thing that has become clear is that we need to have a system that is flexible, adaptable and available for rapid response,'' Ms. Ortwein said in an interview. Oil companies hope the initiative, the product of four weeks of intensive efforts involving 40 engineers from the four companies, will help persuade government regulators and the administration to allow them to resume offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico as soon as possible. Oil companies are also seeking to deflect a series of bills being considered in Congress -- including one proposal that would force companies to drill a second well, called a relief well, alongside any new exploration well. Oil executives argue that such a proposal would not enhance safety offshore, but instead would double the risk because a relief well would be just as likely to blow up as an exploration well. The Interior Department agency that oversees deepwater drilling said Wednesday that the industry's new response plan was a ''move in the right direction.'' ''The BP oil spill has made it clear that oil and gas companies did not have the sufficient containment capacity to respond to a major spill,'' Michael R. Bromwich, the director of the department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said in a statement. ''We are encouraged that a number of companies recognize this issue and are taking steps to correct it.'' However, oil companies still face considerable skepticism about their ability to operate safely in the gulf. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of the industry's most vocal critics, described the plan as ''BP's current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint.'' When top oil executives appeared before Congress several weeks ago, Mr. Markey and other lawmakers forced them to admit that their spill response plans were outdated and woefully inadequate. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who has opposed the drilling moratorium, said Wednesday that the industry's initiative was badly needed. ''It is clear that we simply cannot afford three months of trial and error ever again,'' she said in a statement. The initiative is the first product of a larger discussion within the industry on how to improve safety in the gulf. Oil companies have set up an industrywide task force to consider new safety standards for offshore drilling, more frequent rig inspections, new requirements and certification for blowout preventers and improvements in well design. Frank Verrastro, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said an updated approach to safety in the gulf was overdue. ''Companies have used their technology to get into the deep water but they didn't have an adequate plan to intervene at these depths or to contain a large-scale spill,'' he said.

The new ruling, he said, had “preserved the basic standards for nonconfidential material.” He said he did not expect to pursue any further appeals. Beyond relief over a partial court victory, the striking change in Mr. Berlinger’s tone reflects a developing understanding of the law’s limits in shielding documentarians from becoming part of others’ lawsuits. “That’s what this fight was all about,” Mr. Berlinger said of the ruling’s limitation. “Just because it’s a big oil company doesn’t mean they don’t have a right to a certain amount of footage or a certain amount of discovery.” Mr. Berlinger and Chevron had been in conflict over “Crude,” a nonfiction feature that chronicles a legal fight waged by Ecuadoreans who sued Texaco (now owned by Chevron) over an oil field that they said contaminated their water. Chevron is seeking to have the litigation dismissed in Ecuadorean courts. It says that footage shot by Mr. Berlinger could help its cause by showing instances of improper collaboration between the Ecuadorean plaintiffs and court-appointed experts. Lawyers for Mr. Berlinger had argued that his unused footage was protected in the United States by the First Amendment and by legal precedents giving journalists some ability to shield confidential sources. But in his May ruling, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court in Manhattan said that Mr. Berlinger had not met his burden of showing whether any of his filmed material was subject to confidentiality agreements with his sources, and that the release forms he used with his subjects gave him “carte blanche to use all of the footage in his production.” On Wednesday a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan indicated it might narrow Judge Kaplan’s decision and require Mr. Berlinger to produce a smaller amount of material. And it did just that on Thursday. The panel ruled that Mr. Berlinger must turn over to Chevron “all footage that does not appear in publicly released versions of ‘Crude’ ” that depict the lawyers for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, private or court-appointed experts or current or former Ecuadorean government officials. Chevron may use this footage “solely for litigation, arbitration or submission to official bodies, either local or international,” the order said, and must reimburse Mr. Berlinger’s “reasonable expenses of sorting and duplication of footage.” Lawyers on both sides and legal experts cautioned that the implications of the appeals court’s ruling would not be completely clear until the court issues a fuller explanation of its reasoning in the coming days. Douglas E. Lee, a legal commentator for the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said the ruling represented “one more issue where the courts and, frankly, the media industry are having difficulty keeping up with technology.” The line between who is or is not a journalist, Mr. Lee added, “just isn’t as bright as it used to be.” But Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who wrote a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Mr. Berlinger that was signed by 13 news organizations, including The New York Times Company, said on Friday that it was “just not the law” that an investigative journalist cannot be compelled to turn over materials, confidential or otherwise. “The legal test is, is it likely to result in relevant evidence which cannot be obtained elsewhere?” Mr. Abrams said. Randy M. Mastro, a lawyer representing Chevron, said in an interview that this case was “the antithesis of the typical journalist’s privilege case.” The lawyers representing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs and other figures in the film, Mr. Mastro said, were people “who wanted to be on film, wanted to tell their story and wanted as much screen time as possible.” As a result, he added, “They had no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.” Mr. Berlinger said it had not been his goal to prevent Chevron from obtaining any of his unused film footage. “We have to be intellectually honest about the merits of laws that allow certain footage or certain reporters’ material, under certain conditions, to be turned over,” he said. “I believe there are times when it’s appropriate to turn it over.” For example, he pointed to the “Paradise Lost” documentaries he made with Bruce Sinofsky, about three young men in West Memphis, Ark., who were convicted of the murders of three 8-year-old boys in 1993. “If I had anything in my footage that would make the difference between a man sitting on death row or not,” Mr. Berlinger said, “I would want me or anybody else to be compelled to turn that over.” Eddie Schmidt, the president of the International Documentary Association in Los Angeles, agreed that the turning over of some footage in cases that “would help someone or change an outcome” would not have a long-term impact on “the trust-building nature that filmmakers and subjects have.” Maura J. Wogan, a lawyer representing Mr. Berlinger, said that it was her client’s “job, and duty and obligation” under the appeals court’s order to turn over the film footage as it specified, and that he “intends to do so as quickly as possible.” Mr. Mastro, the Chevron lawyer, said the “Crude” footage could be a “treasure trove” for his client, estimating that the lawyers representing the Ecuadoreans were on screen for “more than 70 percent of the film.” (Mr. Berlinger disputed Mr. Mastro’s calculation.) Mr. Berlinger said further appeal of the decision was unlikely. “We fought very hard to not worsen the precedent for investigative reporters, and in particular documentary filmmakers,” he said. “And to appeal this order would risk setting back the hands of time and ending up with a worse result.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/movies/15arts-APPEALSCOURT_BRF.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Appeals Court Hears Arguments Over Outtakes<date>Published: July 14, 2010</date><text>Lawyers appeared in front of a federal appeals panel in Manhattan on Wednesday for arguments about whether a filmmaker should be required to turn over to the Chevron Corporation roughly 600 hours of unseen footage from a documentary he made about a class-action lawsuit over pollution in the Amazon. In May a federal district judge ordered the filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, to turn over outtakes from “Crude,” the documentary that he made about the suit brought in Ecuador against Texaco — now owned by Chevron — charging that the company contaminated drinking and bathing water in Amazonian rain forests. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan had ruled that the footage could be subpoenaed because it fit the standard established by precedent: it was nonconfidential, was likely of relevance to the case being tried and could not be otherwise obtained by the defense. Maura J. Wogan, an attorney for Mr. Berlinger, vigorously disputed those determinations, telling a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that Judge Kaplan had issued “a broad and unprecedented order” that would result in a chilling effect on her client and on other journalists if upheld. Speaking a few minutes later, Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, told the judges that “this is a case about plaintiffs’ lawyers who decided that they wanted to star in a movie,” and so could not believe that their actions would remain private. As the proceeding progressed the judges signaled that they might narrow the focus of Judge Kaplan’s decision and perhaps require Mr. Berlinger to produce a smaller amount of material.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/business/16oil.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Oil Executives Try to Explain Differences From BP<date>Published: June 15, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The chairmen of four of the world’s largest oil companies broke their nearly two-month silence on the major spill in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday and publicly blamed BP for mishandling the well that caused the disaster.Seeking to insulate their companies from the continuing crisis in the gulf and the political backlash in Washington, the leaders of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and ConocoPhillips insisted at a Congressional hearing that they would not have made the mistakes that led to the well explosion and the deaths of 11 rig workers on April 20. “We would not have drilled the well the way they did,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil. “It certainly appears that not all the standards that we would recommend or that we would employ were in place,” said John S. Watson, chairman of Chevron. “It’s not a well that we would have drilled in that mechanical setup,” said Marvin E. Odum, president of Shell. The hearing was an opportunity for three dozen members of Congress to vent their frustration at top executives of the world’s largest privately owned oil companies. The occasion was reminiscent of the 1994 hearing before a panel of the same committee — the House Energy and Commerce Committee — at which the chief executives of the major tobacco companies were ritually grilled on the dangers of their products. Top banking executives recently got the same treatment. The oil company leaders presented a similar tableau on Tuesday — a group of middle-aged, dark-suited executives raising their right hands in preparation for nearly five hours of hostile interrogation. Democrats generally were seeking confessions of error and expressions of regret. Republicans focused more on the economic impact of the spill and the moratorium on most offshore drilling that President Obama imposed in the aftermath of the disaster. They sought assurances that deepwater drilling could resume safely. But even some Republicans were moved to join the attack on Lamar McKay, president of BP America and designated scapegoat of the day, who was seated at the witness table with the other executives. Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida, told Mr. McKay that he should resign; another Republican, Representative Joseph Cao of Louisiana, said, “In samurai days, we would just give you a knife and ask you to commit hara-kiri.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee that convened the hearing, demanded that Mr. McKay apologize for what Mr. Markey termed the incompetence and deceit that led to consistently low estimates of the size of the spill and the resulting damage. After weaving for a bit, Mr. McKay said meekly: “We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through. We are sorry for that and for the spill.” He refused repeated requests that he promise to place billions of dollars of BP’s profits in an escrow fund to pay damage claims, as members of Congress and Mr. Obama have demanded. “I cannot commit today one way or another to a fund,” he said. “We said we’ll honor all legitimate claims, and the full company stands behind that.” Until now, the other major oil companies had provided technical assistance to BP and refrained from criticizing the company’s handling of the disaster. Even as they watched their offshore rigs idled and their stock values fall, they had presented a united front. But that unity crumbled Tuesday before the House committee, mirroring growing private frustration with being linked to BP. Some executives have been angered at BP’s efforts to paint the gulf accident as an industrywide problem that will require industrywide reforms. The executives of the other companies asserted Tuesday that they believed BP was an outlier, cutting corners to save time and money in ways that they would not tolerate. The BP spill came just as the industry was about to realize a long-awaited goal of expanding offshore drilling to new parts of the gulf, the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Arctic. That is now all in question. Although most of the Congressional fire was aimed at BP on Tuesday, the other executives came under criticism as well, particularly for the response plans that they prepared for a major spill in the gulf. The five companies submitted virtually identical plans to government regulators and to the committee. The 500-page document, prepared by a private contractor, refers to measures to protect walruses and gives a phone number for a marine biologist who died five years ago. James J. Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said the citations were “certainly an embarrassment to Conoco,” adding, “Plans need to be updated more frequently.” Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, noted that each of the companies said it had planned for a much larger spill than the BP accident, even though it is clear that even a spill of the current size is beyond any company’s ability to handle. “BP failed miserably when confronted with a real leak,” Mr. Waxman said, “and Exxon Mobil and the other companies would do no better.” Mr. Tillerson admitted that the only way to deal with major spills was to keep them from occurring. “The point is,” he said, “we have to take every step to prevent these things from happening, because when they happen we are not well equipped to prevent any and all damage. There will be damage. There is no response capability that will ensure that you won’t have an impact.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/opinion/l14amazon.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Oil in the Amazon<date>Published: June 13, 2010</date><text>To the Editor: Bob Herbert makes an excellent comparison between BP’s disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and the experiences of indigenous peoples in the Ecuadorean Amazon (“Disaster in the Amazon,” column, June 5). As the Texaco case he mentions demonstrates, oil extraction has brought environmental disaster to large parts of the Amazon while providing little economic benefits to the indigenous peoples who live in the region. Despite this history of environmental and social disaster, exploitation of resources in the Amazon in Ecuador and Peru is expanding rapidly. Despite President Rafael Correa’s attempts to appear environmentally friendly and pro-indigenous, Ecuador is actually aggressively pursuing new extractions in the Amazon. Meanwhile, Peru’s government has been selling off new oil and gas concessions as quickly as possible. Concessions already cover more than 70 percent of the Peruvian Amazon. These sad facts explain the overwhelming opposition to oil and gas extraction by indigenous communities whose lands are being opened for exploitation without their consent.

But for many years, indigenous people from a formerly pristine region of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador have been trying to get relief from an American company, Texaco (which later merged with Chevron), for what has been described as the largest oil-related environmental catastrophe ever.“As horrible as the gulf spill has been, what happened in the Amazon was worse,” said Jonathan Abady, a New York lawyer who is part of the legal team that is suing Chevron on behalf of the rainforest inhabitants. It has been a long and ugly legal fight and the outcome is uncertain. But what has happened in the rainforest is heartbreaking, although it has not gotten nearly the coverage that the BP spill has. What’s not in dispute is that Texaco operated more than 300 oil wells for the better part of three decades in a vast swath of Ecuador’s northern Amazon region, just south of the border with Colombia. Much of that area has been horribly polluted. The lives and culture of the local inhabitants, who fished in the intricate waterways and cultivated the land as their ancestors had done for generations, have been upended in ways that have led to widespread misery. Texaco came barreling into this delicate ancient landscape in the early 1960s with all the subtlety and grace of an invading army. And when it left in 1992, it left behind, according to the lawsuit, widespread toxic contamination that devastated the livelihoods and traditions of the local people, and took a severe toll on their physical well-being. A brief filed by the plaintiffs said: “It deliberately dumped many billions of gallons of waste byproduct from oil drilling directly into the rivers and streams of the rainforest covering an area the size of Rhode Island. It gouged more than 900 unlined waste pits out of the jungle floor — pits which to this day leach toxic waste into soils and groundwater. It burned hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas and waste oil into the atmosphere, poisoning the air and creating ‘black rain’ which inundated the area during tropical thunderstorms.” The quest for oil is, by its nature, colossally destructive. And the giant oil companies, when left to their own devices, will treat even the most magnificent of nature’s wonders like a sewer. But the riches to be made are so vastly corrupting that governments refuse to impose the kinds of rigid oversight and safeguards that would mitigate the damage to the environment and its human and animal inhabitants. Pick your venue. The families whose lives and culture are dependent upon the intricate web of waterways along the Gulf Coast of the United States are in a fix similar to that of the indigenous people zapped by nonstop oil spills and the oil-related pollution in the Ecuadorian rainforest. Each group is fearful about its future. Both have been treated contemptuously. The oil companies don’t care. Shell can’t wait to begin drilling in the Arctic Ocean off the northern coast of Alaska, an area that would pose monumental problems for anyone trying to deal with a catastrophic spill. The companies pretend that the spills won’t happen. They always say that their drilling operations are safe. They said that before drilling off Santa Barbara, and in the rainforest in Ecuador, and in the Gulf of Mexico, and everywhere else they drill. Their assurances mean nothing. President Obama has suspended Shell’s Arctic drilling permits and has temporarily halted the so-called Arctic oil rush. What we’ve learned from the BP debacle in the gulf, and from the rainforest, and so many other places, is just how reckless and inept the oil companies can be when it comes to safeguarding life, limb and the environment. They’re dangerous. They need the most stringent kind of oversight, and swift and severe sanctions for serious wrongdoing. At the same time, we need to be searching with a much, much greater sense of urgency for viable energy alternatives. Treating the Amazon and the gulf and the Arctic as if they were nothing more than toxic waste sites is an affront to the planet and all life-forms that inhabit it. Chevron doesn’t believe it should be called to account for any of the sins Texaco may have committed in the Amazon. A spokesman told me that the allegations of environmental damage were wildly overstated and that even if Texaco had caused some pollution, it had cleaned it up and reached an agreement with the Ecuadorian government that precluded further liability. The indigenous residents may be suffering (they’re in much worse shape than the people on the gulf coast) but the Chevron-Texaco crowd feels real good about itself. The big money was made, and the trash was left behind.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E7DA1F3FF930A35755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=chevroncorporation">ARTS, BRIEFLY; Media Companies Support Filmmaker In Chevron Case<date>Published: June 3, 2010</date><text>A group of 13 media companies has filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Joe Berlinger, below left, the documentary filmmaker who is appealing a federal district judge's ruling that the oil company Chevron may subpoena the outtakes from his film ''Crude.'' The brief, filed on Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, by a group including NBC Universal, the Directors Guild of America, HBO and The New York Times Company, says the work of these companies ''will be seriously jeopardized'' by the judge's decision and its effect on journalists' privilege. Last month Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Berlinger would have to turn over more than 600 hours of footage from ''Crude,'' his documentary about the Ecuadorians who sued Texaco (now owned by Chevron), accusing it of contaminating their water. Chevron said Mr. Berlinger's footage could be helpful to the company as it seeks to have the suit dismissed and pursues an international treaty arbitration related to the litigation. The appellate court has ordered a hearing on Tuesday to consider the subpoena and stayed the subpoena until that hearing.

As part of its defense, Chevron demanded 600 hours of outtake footage from “Crude,” saying it could help the company show corruption and misconduct by the plaintiffs. The filmmaker argued that his work was protected by journalist privilege, which protects reporters and others in the newsgathering business from being compelled to reveal confidential sources or divulge confidential material. On Thursday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in New York granted the request for the subpoena. The filmmakers did qualify for the privilege, Judge Kaplan wrote, but the conditions for overcoming that privilege had been met. The judge’s decision sparked outrage among documentary filmmakers, who said it endangered their form of journalism. The filmmaker Michael Moore said the decision could have “a chilling effect.” “If something like this is upheld, the next whistle-blower at the next corporation is going to think twice about showing me some documents if that information has to be turned over to the corporation that they’re working for,” Mr. Moore said. “Obviously the ramifications of this go far beyond documentary films, if corporations are allowed to pry into a reporter’s notebook or into a television station’s newsroom.” But a lawyer for Chevron, Randy M. Mastro, said that those criticizing the subpoena were on the wrong side of established law concerning what kinds of materials can be obtained — and that whatever “Crude” is, it should not be considered journalism. “This isn’t about the First Amendment,” Mr. Mastro said. “This is about a plaintiffs’ lawyer who decided he wanted to star in a movie and gave a sympathetic filmmaker extraordinary access to the plaintiffs’ case and strategy.” The outtakes, he insisted, provide “a compelling video record of exactly the activities that these plaintiffs’ lawyers have engaged in to corrupt and taint the political process in Ecuador.” Ilann Maazel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, called the efforts by Chevron to get the outtakes “another last-minute attempt to delay the proceeding and avoid justice.” The company, he said, “twists the truth,” mischaracterizing the scenes from the film to make the plaintiffs’ actions appear to be corrupt. “The corruption is not in some 600 hours of videotape,” he said. “It’s in the ground and water of the rainforest for anyone to see and smell.” In his decision, Judge Kaplan acknowledged that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recognizes the existence of a “qualified privilege for journalistic information” and declared that “Crude” merits that protection. But that is only the beginning of the process, since the privilege does not grant absolute protection of materials. “It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re exempt from the subpoena,” said David Hudson of the First Amendment Center in Nashville. “It just means that there are hoops the party seeking the material has to jump through.” Judge Kaplan referred to those hoops in citing a 1999 case, Gonzales v. NBC, which upheld a District Court subpoena for outtakes from a “Dateline NBC” program that reported on what it called racially-based traffic stops by Louisiana law enforcement officers. Materials can be released, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held, if they are confidential, are likely to be relevant to a significant issue in the case and are not reasonably obtainable elsewhere. The conditions were met in this case, Judge Kaplan concluded; the outtakes, he wrote, “will contribute to the goal of seeing not only that justice is done, but that it appears to be done.” Experts in media law said Judge Kaplan’s opinion did not fall outside of the mainstream of First Amendment jurisprudence. Dave Heller, senior staff attorney at the Media Law Resource Center in Manhattan, said that if someone seeking a subpoena says the material is relevant to significant issues, “it’s appropriate for the judge to take that seriously.” However, Mr. Heller added that he was not sure this request should have been granted. “The common-sense reaction is, ‘This is just a documentary — it speaks for itself,’ ” he said. “It suggests that Chevron and the other defendants in Ecuador would have more than enough leads to follow up and question people to obtain relevant information to their litigation there, without imposing on the documentary filmmaker to compromise his relationship with his sources and disgorge his own unpublished material.” The film’s director, Joe Berlinger, said Judge Kaplan’s order came as a shock. “To have this broad request to turn over everything related to the case, to me, is just a trampling of the First Amendment and the journalist’s privilege,” he said. Even though the people on camera had agreed to participate in the film and had signed waivers, Mr. Berlinger argued, they still had a measure of confidentiality that should have counted for more in Judge Kaplan’s consideration of the case. “People who agree to be in a film don’t agree to have their lives exposed as if they agreed to be on a 24/7 Web cam, which is in essence what’s happening,” he said. He said he hoped the order could be overturned, but added: “At the end of the day, if I lose all my options, yeah I’m going to comply with the subpoena and turn it over. I’m the father of two children, and this is certainly not worth going to prison over.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E7D61730F934A35756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron Allowed to Subpoena Film<date>Published: May 7, 2010</date><text>A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday ruled that Chevron could subpoena footage from a documentary about the pollution of the Amazon rainforests of Ecuador and the oil company's involvement. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court said the director, Joe Berlinger, would have to turn over more than 600 hours of footage from his documentary ''Crude.'' The film, which was released last year, chronicles the Ecuadoreans who sued Texaco (now owned by Chevron), saying the operations of the companies' oil field at Lago Agrio contaminated their water. Chevron, which is pursuing an international treaty arbitration related to the lawsuit and is seeking to have the litigation dismissed, said Mr. Berlinger's footage could help the company. Lawyers for Mr. Berlinger argued that his footage was protected by his privilege as an investigative journalist, and that turning over the film would violate confidentiality agreements with his subjects as well as his First Amendment rights. In siding with Chevron, Judge Kaplan wrote that Mr. Berlinger had been unable to produce evidence that any of his filmed material was subject to any confidentiality agreements with his sources, and that the release forms the filmmaker used with his subjects gave him ''carte blanche to use all of the footage in his production.'' Judge Kaplan cited the maxim of the former Justice Louis D. Brandeis that ''sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,'' and wrote, ''Review of Berlinger's outtakes will contribute to the goal of seeing not only that justice is done, but that it appears to be done.'' Randy M. Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, said in a interview on Thursday, ''This evidence will be critical to determining Ecuador's violation of international law and its denial of due process and fair treatment to Chevron.'' Maura J. Wogan, a lawyer for Mr. Berlinger, said in a telephone interview, ''We're obviously very surprised at the court's lack of sensitivity to the journalist's privilege.'' She added, ''The decision really threatens grave harm to documentary filmmakers and investigative reporters.'' The lawyers for Mr. Berlinger said they would ask Judge Kaplan to stay the subpoena while they appeal the decision.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/business/01chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron Quarterly Profit Doubles<date>Published: April 30, 2010</date><text>The Chevron Corporation’s quarterly profit more than doubled, beating forecasts, as a rise in oil prices offset lower refinery earnings.The oil company’s chief financial officer, Patricia E. Yarrington, said on Friday that she saw some softening in the West Coast and Singapore refining markets going into the second quarter. “You may still have some sloppiness in the market,” she told analysts on a conference call, referring to how refining capacity under maintenance was coming back on line. Oil and gas production climbed to 2.78 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the quarter, up 120,000 barrels a day. The company increased its output in the United States, Nigeria, Angola and at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. Chevron is aiming for average production of 2.73 million barrels a day for 2010, and said it would discuss this outlook further at the second-quarter earnings conference call in July. Chevron and other oil companies’ offshore operations are coming under increased scrutiny because of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico at a BP well. The White House said it would not open new regions to drilling until the cause of the disaster had been determined. Ms. Yarrington said Chevron, a major Gulf of Mexico producer, was assisting BP and the government, but that it was too early to say how the situation would play out. First-quarter profit rose to $4.55 billion, or $2.27 a share, from $1.84 billion, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 34 percent, to $46.7 billion. Excluding $175 million in charges for job cuts, the company earned $2.36 a share, easily topping the $1.94 that analysts had expected, according to the average on Thomson Reuters. The company’s downstream, or refining and marketing business, posted profits of $82 million in the quarter, down from $136 million a year earlier, but far better than the $333 million loss the previous quarter. Most of the world’s major private-sector oil companies reported stronger-than-expected profits this week, though the market leader Exxon Mobil was hurt by a weak refining performance and a charge for health reform costs. Shares of Chevron closed down 85 cents, to $81.44.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/arts/27arts-CHEVRONVSFIL_BRF.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron Vs.

Chevron says the material may be useful in lawsuits accusing it of damaging the environment there. The filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, whose documentaries include “Paradise Lost” and “Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,” said he had been served with a request from Chevron for more than 600 hours of unused footage for his 2009 documentary “Crude.” The movie, seen in a scene above, chronicles Ecuadoreans who sued Texaco, which is now owned by Chevron, saying the companies’ practices at the Lago Agrio oil field resulted in the contamination of their drinking and bathing water. Mr. Berlinger, who is scheduled to appear in United States District Court in Manhattan on Friday, said Chevron’s request violated his First Amendment rights. If Chevron obtained his footage, he said, “It would have a serious chilling effect on these kinds of investigative films.” Randy M.

In a region that has been moving steadily from heavy industry to an economy dominated by information and services, Richmond remains home to a major oil refinery. So it might come as a surprise that the city is leading the Bay Area into the future of urban planning. Richmond is close to adopting a new vision for itself that makes the health of its residents a top priority. And this is not just some abstract document that will be circulated proudly among planning geeks at conferences while having no real effect on people’s lives. It comes with a plan of action that promises to change life on the streets of Richmond and shape development for years to come. “We definitely believe we are on the cutting edge of showing how a city can work on this level, in terms of its thinking, its planning, changing its policies to focus on the basic health needs of the community,” Mayor Gayle McLaughlin said in a recent interview. “We want to really turn around the years of pollution and neglect.” The plan lays out 10 goals that will be considered as part of nearly every city policy and be used to evaluate proposed housing, commercial and industrial developments. The broad hope is to create a walkable city where residents of all income levels have access to fresh fruits and vegetables, parks and open space, and good housing; where people strolling the sidewalks are safe from criminals and cars alike, and where the elderly and the disabled have access to public transportation that will take them to their medical appointments. These changes, city officials believe, will help reduce disparities between the health of Richmond’s residents and those who live nearby under better conditions, and will even reduce the differences among Richmond’s own neighborhoods. Richmond’s poverty rate is double the average in Contra Costa County, and the city’s residents have the county’s highest death rate from diabetes, a higher-than-average rate of children with serious asthma, and the second-highest rates for hospitalizations resulting from mental illness and drug abuse. A resident of Richmond is three times more likely to be murdered than someone living across the bay in San Francisco. Much of this social dysfunction is concentrated in just a handful of the city’s 35 neighborhoods. And two of those troubled neighborhoods — the Northern Iron Triangle and Belding Woods — are already part of a pilot project through which the city hopes to demonstrate how its new strategy will work in practice. Already, the city is making plans to improve parks, plant more trees along streets, enforce traffic rules more strictly and improve street lighting. Community gardens are popping up along a city greenbelt, the planning department is working on expanding farmers markets, and the city is cooperating with the county to ensure that every resident who is eligible for food stamps gets them. And when developers apply to build new projects in the city, the review will include an assessment of whether the proposals are consistent with the new goals, which will be part of the city’s general plan. Mike Ghielmetti, president of Signature Properties and chairman of the Home Builders Association of Northern California, said he did not believe that science had shown a clear connection between housing and afflictions like obesity and asthma. Suburban neighborhoods of the 1950s were even less walkable than today’s are, Mr. Ghielmetti said, but their residents were fitter. “Why is new housing being tasked with something that is perceived to be a community burden?” he asked. Mr. Ghielmetti suggested that cars, fast food, television shows and video games had more to do with obesity than housing and neighborhood design. “They’re going after the wrong party,” he said, referring to Richmond officials. But Mayor McLaughlin said builders and others were going to have to get used to a new way of doing business in the city. “We are moving away from depending on fossil fuels,” she said. Some day, she said, that Chevron oil refinery on the waterfront will be obsolete. She would love to see it converted to supplying renewable fuels to the region. If not, it would be a “very valuable piece” of real estate. For a park, perhaps. Or a walkable neighborhood, with great views. “We have come from a hundred years of planning decisions based on a massive and complex freeway system and heavy industry,” the mayor said, “and now we are planning for developments that are livable, walkable, bike-friendly, communities.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/business/10chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron Says It Will Cut 2,000 Jobs<date>Published: March 9, 2010</date><text>The Chevron Corporation said on Tuesday that it would cut 2,000 jobs this year and sell some overseas operations as it revamped its struggling oil refinery, marketing and transportation operations.The job cuts represent almost 12 percent of its 17,000 workers in the so-called downstream part of its business and just over 3 percent of its overall work force. Executives are still deciding where and when they will eliminate the jobs as they work to complete the reorganization by the third quarter, a spokesman, Lloyd Avram, said. Additional cuts are expected next year. Chevron said it would also seek bids for its Pembroke refinery in southwest Wales, and fuels marketing, aviation and lubricants businesses in the Caribbean and some markets in Central America. Oil refineries, which turn crude into gasoline, diesel and other fuels, struggled amid rising oil prices and falling demand last year. In addition, new refineries are being built. “Downstream conditions are likely to be difficult for the next several years,” Michael K. Wirth, executive vice president of Chevron’s global downstream business, said in a statement. An analyst at Argus Research, Phil Weiss, said Chevron was making the right move, but he questioned whether the producer would get a good price for the assets in the difficult business environment. Chevron has said it will reduce spending by $1 billion this year on downstream businesses, which include refining, marketing and transportation. In addition to seeking bids for the Pembroke refinery and for fuels marketing, aviation and lubricants businesses in the Caribbean and Central America, Chevron said it was reviewing refinery operations in Hawaii and other undisclosed operations outside South Africa, Mr. Avram said. The company, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., said severance charges were expected to be $150 million to $200 million on an after-tax basis in the first quarter.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/world/americas/12venez.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Sealing Shift, Chávez Gives Contracts to Western Oil Companies<date>Published: February 11, 2010</date><text>CARACAS, Venezuela  After clashing with foreign oil companies in recent years, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela has shifted strategy and awarded contracts to Western oil companies, hoping to increase his nation’s flagging oil production and pull the country out of a sharp economic downturn. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Juan Barreto/A.F.P. — Getty Images President Hugo Chávez, with Information Minister Blanca Eckhout, awarding oil deals. Chevron, the American oil giant, led a group of companies that won one of the concessions on Wednesday night, showing the resilience of trade ties between the nations. The United States remains the largest consumer of Venezuelan oil despite the deterioration of political relations over the last decade. Venezuela quietly began courting Western oil companies again in 2008 after nationalizing some of their assets, imposing higher royalties on them and subjecting their executives to raids by tax authorities. Even now, Venezuela is considered one of the riskiest countries in which to do business of any kind, and a number of major Western oil companies stayed out of the bidding. But the oil companies that participated are hoping to increase their access to the coveted Orinoco Belt, an area the size of Costa Rica in southern Venezuela that may contain one of the world’s largest recoverable oil reserves. The United States Geological Survey described the Orinoco Belt last month in a report as the largest petroleum accumulation it had assessed, containing an estimated 513 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Facing a decline in oil revenues and a dearth of foreign investment, Mr. Chávez seemed eager to address any lingering concerns the Western oil companies might have about operating in his country. “Dear friends, partners, allies, you know you have all the guarantees of our Constitution and our laws,” Mr. Chávez said Wednesday night in a ceremony at his palace, broadcast on state television, in which he thanked the foreign companies for bidding. In an unusual display of warmth given his friction with Washington, Mr. Chávez happily greeted a senior Chevron executive in attendance, Ali Moshiri, the company’s president of African and Latin American operations. Mr. Chávez conceded that differences remained with the Obama administration, but he also extended an invitation for President Obama to visit Venezuela’s southern oil region, telling Mr. Moshiri, “You bring him here.” Some foreign oil companies that had shown interest in the auction  including Royal Dutch/Shell, Brazil’s Petrobras and Total of France  opted not to bid. Mr. Chávez is moving ahead with nationalizations in other industries, like the seizure last month of stores controlled by the French retailer Casino, which appears to have scared foreign investors. Chevron, which maintains the warmest relations with Mr. Chávez of any American oil company, led a group that includes the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, winning access to one area in the Orinoco Belt. The Spanish oil company Repsol YPF led another group that won a separate contract in a partnership with the Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation of India and Petronas of Malaysia. A contract for a third area in the Orinoco Belt was not awarded, reflecting the reluctance of other oil companies to take part in the auction. The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to cede control in their ventures to Petróleos de Venezuela, Mr. Chávez’s national oil company, in addition to securing all the financing for their projects, which could require as much as $30 billion. If the two oil projects led by Chevron and Repsol are completed, they will each increase Venezuela’s oil production by about 400,000 barrels a day, a crucial amount for the long-term economic viability of Mr. Chávez’s government, which relies on oil for more than 90 percent of its export income. The dependence on oil has grown more acute during Mr. Chávez’s 11 years in power. Grappling with a steep drop in oil income since 2008, Mr. Chávez was forced last month to devalue the nation’s currency, the bolívar. Venezuela is also struggling with a galloping inflation rate of 27 percent, the highest in Latin America, and intensifying electricity blackouts. “It’s not that Chávez is suddenly embracing a market system or respect for property,” said Roger Tissot, an expert on Venezuela’s energy industry at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting firm specializing in Latin America. “He’s like a chameleon who can change his stripes when he realizes Venezuela’s long-term economic survival is at stake.” Some private energy executives here doubt that the oil projects will materialize, given the technical challenges of extracting the Orinoco Belt’s oil, which is heavy in impurities and hard to refine, and the uncertainty of doing business in Venezuela. Moreover, Mr. Chávez announced only the award of the deals; final operating agreements must still be negotiated and signed. Recent attempts to reach other oil production ventures with companies from China, Belarus, Russia, Italy and Vietnam have advanced slowly, if at all. But concessions made by Petróleos de Venezuela and the oil companies during the bidding process suggested the seriousness of both sides, some energy analysts said. The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to pay signing fees of about $500 million and $1 billion, respectively, as part of their bids. Some of the fees may be payable in installments, and possibly with vouchers used to offset losses from nationalizations. “Chávez was clear in stating that Venezuela and the companies need each other,” said David Voght, managing director of IPD Latin America, an energy consulting firm here. “When you decide to put down bonuses of $500 million and $1 billion, you are very serious about developing these projects.” Chevron in particular has a long history of doing business in Venezuela, opting to stay in the country in 2007 and become a minority partner with Petróleos de Venezuela after the government took control of foreign oil projects. Other American companies, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, clashed with Mr. Chávez and left.

The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to cede control in their ventures to Petróleos de Venezuela, Mr. Chávez’s national oil company, in addition to securing all the financing for their projects, which could require as much as $30 billion. If the two oil projects led by Chevron and Repsol are completed, they will each increase Venezuela’s oil production by about 400,000 barrels a day, a crucial amount for the long-term economic viability of Mr. Chávez’s government, which relies on oil for more than 90 percent of its export income. The dependence on oil has grown more acute during Mr. Chávez’s 11 years in power. Grappling with a steep drop in oil income since 2008, Mr. Chávez was forced last month to devalue the nation’s currency, the bolívar. Venezuela is also struggling with a galloping inflation rate of 27 percent, the highest in Latin America, and intensifying electricity blackouts. “It’s not that Chávez is suddenly embracing a market system or respect for property,” said Roger Tissot, an expert on Venezuela’s energy industry at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting firm specializing in Latin America. “He’s like a chameleon who can change his stripes when he realizes Venezuela’s long-term economic survival is at stake.” Some private energy executives here doubt that the oil projects will materialize, given the technical challenges of extracting the Orinoco Belt’s oil, which is heavy in impurities and hard to refine, and the uncertainty of doing business in Venezuela. Moreover, Mr. Chávez announced only the award of the deals; final operating agreements must still be negotiated and signed. Recent attempts to reach other oil production ventures with companies from China, Belarus, Russia, Italy and Vietnam have advanced slowly, if at all. But concessions made by Petróleos de Venezuela and the oil companies during the bidding process suggested the seriousness of both sides, some energy analysts said. The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to pay signing fees of about $500 million and $1 billion, respectively, as part of their bids. Some of the fees may be payable in installments, and possibly with vouchers used to offset losses from nationalizations. “Chávez was clear in stating that Venezuela and the companies need each other,” said David Voght, managing director of IPD Latin America, an energy consulting firm here. “When you decide to put down bonuses of $500 million and $1 billion, you are very serious about developing these projects.” Chevron in particular has a long history of doing business in Venezuela, opting to stay in the country in 2007 and become a minority partner with Petróleos de Venezuela after the government took control of foreign oil projects. Other American companies, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, clashed with Mr. Chávez and left.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/business/energy-environment/30chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Refinery Losses Cut Chevron Profit 37%<date>Published: January 29, 2010</date><text>The Chevron Corporation posted a 37 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit on Friday, missing analysts’ forecasts, as steep refinery losses offset gains from increases in oil prices and production.

I know  because I used to share that view. But today I have more nuanced feelings. Over the years I’ve joined the boards of two environmental groups, the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation International, serving alongside many business executives. As part of my board work, I have been asked to assess the environments in oil fields, and have had frank discussions with oil company employees at all levels. I’ve also worked with executives of mining, retail, logging and financial services companies. I’ve discovered that while some businesses are indeed as destructive as many suspect, others are among the world’s strongest positive forces for environmental sustainability. The embrace of environmental concerns by chief executives has accelerated recently for several reasons. Lower consumption of environmental resources saves money in the short run. Maintaining sustainable resource levels and not polluting saves money in the long run. And a clean image  one attained by, say, avoiding oil spills and other environmental disasters  reduces criticism from employees, consumers and government. What’s my evidence for this? Here are a few examples involving three corporations  Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola and Chevron  that many critics of business love to hate, in my opinion, unjustly. Let’s start with Wal-Mart. Obviously, a business can save money by finding ways to spend less while maintaining sales. This is what Wal-Mart did with fuel costs, which the company reduced by $26 million per year simply by changing the way it managed its enormous truck fleet. Instead of running a truck’s engine all night to heat or cool the cab during mandatory 10-hour rest stops, the company installed small auxiliary power units to do the job. In addition to lowering fuel costs, the move eliminated the carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to taking 18,300 passenger vehicles off the road. Wal-Mart is also working to double the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 2015, thereby saving more than $200 million a year at the pump. Among the efficient prototypes now being tested are trucks that burn biofuels generated from waste grease at Wal-Mart’s delis. Similarly, as the country’s biggest private user of electricity, Wal-Mart is saving money by decreasing store energy use. Another Wal-Mart example involves lowering costs associated with packaging materials. Wal-Mart now sells only concentrated liquid laundry detergents in North America, which has reduced the size of packaging by up to 50 percent. Wal-Mart stores also have machines called bailers that recycle plastics that once would have been discarded. Wal-Mart’s eventual goal is to end up with no packaging waste. One last Wal-Mart example shows how a company can save money in the long run by buying from sustainably managed sources. Because most wild fisheries are managed unsustainably, prices for Chilean sea bass and Atlantic tuna have been soaring. To my pleasant astonishment, in 2006 Wal-Mart decided to switch, within five years, all its purchases of wild-caught seafood to fisheries certified as sustainable. Coca-Cola’s problems are different from Wal-Mart’s in that they are largely long-term. The key ingredient in Coke products is water. The company produces its beverages in about 200 countries through local franchises, all of which require a reliable local supply of clean fresh water. But water supplies are under severe pressure around the world, with most already allocated for human use. The little remaining unallocated fresh water is in remote areas unsuitable for beverage factories, like Arctic Russia and northwestern Australia. Coca-Cola can’t meet its water needs just by desalinizing seawater, because that requires energy, which is also increasingly expensive. Global climate change is making water scarcer, especially in the densely populated temperate-zone countries, like the United States, that are Coca-Cola’s main customers. Most competing water use around the world is for agriculture, which presents sustainability problems of its own. 1 2 3 Next Page » Jared Diamond, a professor of geography at the University of California at Los Angeles, is the author of Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse. More Articles in Opinion » A version of this article appeared in print on December 6, 2009, on page WK12 of the New York edition.Los Angeles Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Alain Pilon THERE is a widespread view, particularly among environmentalists and liberals, that big businesses are environmentally destructive, greedy, evil and driven by short-term profits.

With millions of Filipinos still reeling from the effects of successive typhoons, the corporations were criticized as greedy, insensitive, callous and predatory. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Philippines | Oil and Gasoline The companies — Royal Dutch Shell, Petron and Chevron (known here under the brand Caltex) — increased the per-liter prices of diesel by 2 pesos, or 4 cents, an increase of about 6.7 percent. Gasoline prices went up 1.25 pesos a liter, or a 4.74 pesos a gallon, and kerosene by 1.50 pesos. According to the Ibon Foundation, an independent economic research group, the increases were the biggest of the year. The companies insist the increases reflect world oil prices; crude has risen from as low as $32.40 in December to about $79 this week. Changes in the price of fuel have been a touchy subject here since 1998, when the government passed the Oil Deregulation Law. In addition to taking away government control of pricing and opening the industry to foreign investment, the law removed longstanding government subsidies of oil products. Although the deregulation has been unpopular with voters, the government has not backtracked — until now. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo issued Executive Order 839 in the past week, demanding that the oil companies reduce their prices on the main island, Luzon, or face penalties. Many consumers praised the decision and her “political will” and said the decree could help millions of Filipinos recover from the recent calamities. But economists, business groups and industry analysts said the unprecedented intervention could scare investors away from the country, and create fuel shortages and a new black market. “This government seems to have lost its sense of what it should be doing,” said Peter Wallace, founder of the Wallace Business Forum, a consulting group that advises some of the largest multinational companies in the Philippines. The country, he said, “is attracting the lowest level of foreign investments among major countries in Asia. So you have to ask the question why it issued the executive order.” Mr. Wallace said if the government wanted to reduce the cost of fuel for consumers, it could have given out discount coupons to those directly affected by the typhoons. As it is, he said, “those with S.U.V.’s are the ones that will benefit from the price controls, not the poor people.” Except for Shell and Petron, which refine oil in the Philippines, all oil companies here import their finished products. Because the prices of these refined products are tied to world markets, the companies now might think twice about importing more, given the possibility of losses, said Benjamin Diokno, an economist and former budget secretary. “The wisdom of E.O. 839 will come to its severest test once oil product supply is disrupted,” Mr. Diokno wrote in BusinessWorld, a Manila newspaper. “For the oil firms who were enticed by the downstream oil industry deregulation law, this recent E.O. is a nightmare.” The oil companies have complied with the order, and rolled back prices. But they warned that the order might have grave consequences, among them “supply disruptions and negative impact on the investment climate in our country,” according to Roberto Kanapi, a Shell spokesman. Even now, just days after the order was announced, the oil companies are saying that their losses stemming from the directive will be large, with Petron alone estimating a 1.5 billion-peso loss in the fourth quarter. The government has not indicated when it might lift the executive order. Oil consumers, meanwhile, have welcomed the decree. Raul Concepcion, a Filipino industrialist who heads the nonprofit Consumer and Oil Price Watch, said the oil companies had it coming. The companies’ “predatory pricing” in the years since the Oil Deregulation Law was passed created the conditions that prompted the reimposition of price controls, he said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in World »MANILA — When the three largest oil companies in the Philippines increased the pump prices of diesel, gasoline and kerosene on Oct. 20, they set off more than the usual grumbling from consumers and transport groups. With millions of Filipinos still reeling from the effects of successive typhoons, the corporations were criticized as greedy, insensitive, callous and predatory. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Philippines | Oil and Gasoline The companies — Royal Dutch Shell, Petron and Chevron (known here under the brand Caltex) — increased the per-liter prices of diesel by 2 pesos, or 4 cents, an increase of about 6.7 percent. Gasoline prices went up 1.25 pesos a liter, or a 4.74 pesos a gallon, and kerosene by 1.50 pesos. According to the Ibon Foundation, an independent economic research group, the increases were the biggest of the year. The companies insist the increases reflect world oil prices; crude has risen from as low as $32.40 in December to about $79 this week. Changes in the price of fuel have been a touchy subject here since 1998, when the government passed the Oil Deregulation Law. In addition to taking away government control of pricing and opening the industry to foreign investment, the law removed longstanding government subsidies of oil products. Although the deregulation has been unpopular with voters, the government has not backtracked — until now. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo issued Executive Order 839 in the past week, demanding that the oil companies reduce their prices on the main island, Luzon, or face penalties. Many consumers praised the decision and her “political will” and said the decree could help millions of Filipinos recover from the recent calamities. But economists, business groups and industry analysts said the unprecedented intervention could scare investors away from the country, and create fuel shortages and a new black market. “This government seems to have lost its sense of what it should be doing,” said Peter Wallace, founder of the Wallace Business Forum, a consulting group that advises some of the largest multinational companies in the Philippines.

The lawsuit pits Ecuadorean peasants against Chevron over oil pollution in the Amazon and has been a major headache for the company for nearly a decade, producing a saga that underscores many of the hazards and ethical challenges of oil companies working in the developing world. The company appeared to gain the upper hand in August when it revealed video recordings  captured on watches and pens implanted with bugging devices  that suggested a bribery scheme involving Ecuadorean officials, and possibly even the judge hearing the case. But the company was put on the defensive again on Thursday, after lawyers for the peasants revealed that one of two men who made the tapes was a convicted felon. Court and other records provided by the plaintiffs show that Wayne Hansen, the American who helped make the recordings, was convicted of conspiring to traffic 275,000 pounds of marijuana from Colombia to the United States in 1986. He also was sued successfully in 2005 by a woman who accused him of unleashing his two pit bulls to attack her and her dog. The disclosure adds more questions about what motivated Mr. Hansen and an Ecuadorean partner to record meetings for Chevron’s use, which the company has characterized as an act of whistle-blowing by men offended by unethical behavior and evidence that the handling of the case had been flawed. “It’s another blockbuster development in a case that never runs short of them,” said Ralph G. Steinhardt, a professor at George Washington University Law School. “It doesn’t necessarily mean there was no bribery plan, but anything that undermines the credibility of the witness undermines the case of the party that would call that witness.” Trevor Melby, Mr. Hansen’s lawyer, did not deny his client had a criminal history, saying, “The thing about felony convictions is they follow you to the grave, but even if he had 15 felony convictions it wouldn’t change the tapes.” Mr. Melby said he was not being paid by Chevron. The origins of the case go back to the 1970s, when Texaco operated in partnership with the Ecuadorean state oil company to produce oil in the Amazon. Peasants filed suit in 1993, saying that the company, which had ceased to operate in Ecuador by then, had left an environmental mess that had caused illnesses among villagers. Chevron bought Texaco before the case could be resolved. Chevron has long said that it could not receive a fair hearing in Ecuador before a hostile judge and government. That argument seemed to be reinforced by the recordings obtained by Mr. Hansen and an Ecuadorean man who had worked as a contractor for the company. They showed an Ecuadorean political go-between working to obtain $3 million in bribes for environmental cleanup contracts to be awarded after the case ended. But it remained unclear why Mr. Hansen was involved in the discussions. The plaintiffs said that an inquiry into his background by a private investigator found that Mr. Hansen did not hold an engineering license, never finished college and showed no record of being qualified to remediate pollution as he portrayed to Ecuadorean officials in the tapes. Chevron has said it had no involvement in the videotaping, and company spokesmen have said Mr. Hansen was never their point of contact. “We’ve had no association with this guy,” said Donald Campbell, a Chevron spokesman. “This issue is the content on the video and the transcripts that we turned over to the prosecutor general of Ecuador and the U.S. Department of Justice, which shows inappropriate meetings by the judge in our case, extensive government interference in the trial and a bribe plot involving $3 million.” The other man involved in making the recordings, Diego Borja, has since been moved to the United States with his family at Chevron’s expense, and he has been receiving an undisclosed amount of living expenses.

Enlarge This Image Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Left, Washington Pesántez, Ecuadors attorney general, says the United States should investigate Chevron. Patricio García, at the center of a bribery case, claims Chevron entrapped him. Ever since the oil giant released videos in August that were secretly taped by two businessmen who seemed to have the ambition of feasting off the expected $27 billion in damages sought, Ecuadorean officials and Chevron have accused each other of gross improprieties, including espionage. The Ecuadorean judge hearing the case recused himself after he appeared in the recordings discussing the case and potential damages. He was returned to the case by another judge, but he was then removed again. The two mysterious businessmen, who used watches and pens implanted with bugging devices to make the recordings, have refused to explain their motivations for going to the furtive meetings in Quito and a jungle outpost to discuss a bribery plot. And now, with questions mounting, one of them has enlisted a lawyer who has represented Barry Bonds. In recent days the plot has thickened further. The Ecuadorean political go-between whose taped remarks about apportioning bribes put him in the middle of the scandal, Patricio García, said he was entrapped in a dirty-tricks campaign by Chevron. In an interview, he claimed that Chevron had masterminded an industrial espionage project, with digitally manipulated videos and gangsters disguised as entrepreneurs on the prowl for contracts, intended to smear him and Ecuador’s legal system. “This was all planned from the United States, by Chevron itself,” said Mr. García, 55, a businessman and former car mechanic. He chafed at any suggestion, as laid out in recordings made public by Chevron, that he had discussed a bribery scheme that was to include President Rafael Correa’s sister, Pierina Correa, and Judge Juan Núñez, who was then overseeing the case. It is not clear from the recordings and transcripts provided by Chevron whether any bribes were paid or whether Judge Núñez and Ms. Correa were aware of plans to try to bribe them. Ms. Correa has denied knowing Mr. García, or having anything to do with the plot, and Judge Núñez has also denied any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, governing party and government officials have characterized Mr. García as a man of little influence. Ecuador’s attorney general still somewhat echoes Mr. García’s interpretation of the events caught on the tapes, saying that Chevron’s contacts with the businessmen who discussed bribes mean the company should be investigated in the United States for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws bribery of foreign officials to obtain business. “It seems to me that Chevron’s strategy is to delegitimize the actions of our judges,” said Washington Pesántez, the attorney general. He added that he regretted that a resolution of the lawsuit, which has dragged on for 16 years, had been delayed by a month with the disclosure of the videos. “Justice that is delayed is not justice,” Mr. Pesántez said. The tapes were the latest turn in a legal marathon over oil contamination left by Texaco years before it was acquired by Chevron. On one tape, Judge Núñez seems to suggest that he plans to rule against Chevron and that damages could exceed $27 billion, making it potentially the biggest environmental suit in history. Whether Chevron avoided such an outcome by releasing the tapes may not become clear for months, or even years. Chevron gambled that the disclosure of the videos would enable it to cast doubt on the integrity of the trial and the honesty of the Ecuadorean legal system. But the tapes have also raised questions about its ties to the men who made the recordings, potentially opening the company to a new legal fight. Taping conversations without everyone’s permission is illegal in Ecuador, and trying to bribe foreign officials is illegal under American law. But shades of gray tinge nearly everything to do with the videos. For instance, Mr. García, the political go-between, said the businessmen who tied him to the bribery plot joked about recording their meetings with a wristwatch, potentially giving them a way out if scrutiny of their tactics intensifies. “For someone who is trying to figure out what you can learn from this, it’s not as though it yields a rational narrative,” said Ralph G. Steinhardt, professor of law and international affairs at George Washington University Law School, who has been following the case. “In trying to appreciate the complexities of this case, you need to have the skills of a poker player rather than the skills of a lawyer.” Chevron says that it neither coached nor paid the businessmen to make the tapes, and that it did not edit the material, though it did give one of the men, Diego Borja, an undisclosed amount for moving and living expenses so he could safely move his family out of Ecuador. Company spokesmen say that when Mr. Borja, an Ecuadorean logistics contractor working with an American businessman, brought tapes of three meetings to Chevron, company officials urged him not to go to more meetings because doing so could be dangerous. “Chevron had no involvement in the videotaping,” said Kent Robertson, a company spokesman. “Chevron referred this matter to the U.S. Department of Justice and Ecuador’s prosecutor general after making every reasonable effort to verify the evidence that was presented.” Mr. Borja went back for a fourth meeting, taped it, and gave more evidence to the company. But no one has yet explained what motivated him and his partner, Wayne Hansen, an American, to travel around Ecuador meeting officials and collecting evidence of a bribery scheme, especially one in which they stood to gain lucrative contracts. Neither the men nor their lawyers would talk, although Mr. Borja’s lawyer, Cristina C. Arguedas, who has represented Mr. Bonds and other elite athletes in connection with the investigation into performance-enhancing drugs, released a statement: “Diego is an outstanding and proud Ecuadorean who came forward on his own to expose corruption. He will answer all questions in a fair proceeding.” The video and transcripts have been open to interpretation. Still a mystery, for instance, is why supposedly well-connected Ecuadoreans with knowledge of the case would discuss bribes in exchange for government cleanup contracts to come out of a settlement in the Chevron case. Chevron hopes to delay any future payments for many years; since it has no major assets in Ecuador, it would not be easy to get it to pay, even if it lost. Had the Ecuadorean officials checked Mr. Borja’s background, they would have seen that he had been a contractor for Chevron for years.

Three weeks ago, Chevron accused the judge in the case of being involved in a $3 million bribery scheme and offered secretly videotaped footage as evidence that led to an Ecuadorean investigation. Claiming Ecuador’s government has violated a bilateral investment treaty between the United States and Ecuador, Chevron said on Wednesday that an arbitration proceeding had commenced before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague under United Nations trade law. “Because Ecuador’s judicial system is incapable of functioning independently of political influence, Chevron has no choice but to seek relief under the treaty,” Hewitt Pate, Chevron’s recently appointed general counsel, said in a company statement. Chevron says that in 1998, Ecuador and its state oil company, Petroecuador, released Texaco from further liability after Texaco’s remediation work was completed. But plaintiffs in the case argue that the release did not deal with private claims against the company. According to Chevron’s filing, the arbitration process will involve three arbitrators. Chevron has appointed Horacio Grigera Naón, from the college of law at American University, Washington, and a Chevron spokesman, Kent Robertson, said Ecuador would appoint a second who would work with Mr. Grigera Naón to appoint a third. The plaintiffs say Texaco dumped billions of gallons of polluted water in the jungle around where they live for more than two decades before leaving Ecuador in the early 1990s. The first legal action in the case was filed in New York in 1993, but the case was moved to Ecuador earlier this decade. An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year that Chevron should pay around $27 billion, including more than $8 billion in unjust enrichment. Steven Donziger, an American legal adviser to the plaintiffs, said the latest move by Chevron followed a series of setbacks in courts for the company in both countries. “Filing an international arbitration campaign at this point in time smacks of desperation and is a clear example of forum shopping,” Mr. Donziger said in e-mailed statement. As for the Ecuador case, Judge Juan Núñez sought to remove himself from it to allow for an investigation into Chevron’s claims against him, but Mr. Donziger said it had not been allowed. “The judge’s request for recusal has been denied,” Mr. Donziger told Reuters. “Our interest is not in who the judge is. Our interest is that the process be fair.” Chevron has faced increasing media scrutiny over the Ecuadorean case, with a documentary on the dispute opening in New York earlier this month.

Ecuador’s attorney general said Friday that he had requested that the judge in the contamination lawsuit against Chevron recuse himself after Chevron obtained audio and video recordings that appeared to link officials in the party of Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, to what Chevron claims was a bribery scheme connected to the case. The judge, Juan Núñez, whose name was mentioned in the recordings as a possible recipient in the bribery scheme, said he had handed the case over to his surrogate judge, Nicolás Zambrano, in the town of Lago Agrio in northern Ecuador. Judge Núñez said he had done nothing improper and described the videos, released by Chevron on Monday, as edited and digitally manipulated. The judge’s recusal is expected to cause delays in reaching a verdict. “It’s like the second shoe dropping,” said Ralph G. Steinhardt, a professor of law and international affairs at the George Washington University Law School, who has followed the case, potentially the world’s largest environmental lawsuit, involving as much as $27 billion in damages. “It’s a stunning turn of events that threatens to perpetuate what is already a very, very long proceeding.” He said the plaintiffs and the defendants deserved fair procedures, “without any appearance of corruption or prejudgment.” The recordings, made by a former Ecuadorean contractor for Chevron by using hidden recording devices, do not make clear whether Judge Núñez was involved in a bribery scheme  or even whether he was aware of an attempt to bribe him. The recordings also do not demonstrate whether any bribes were paid. But the recordings do appear to show the judge signaling a possible ruling against Chevron. Washington Pesántez, Ecuador’s attorney general, said he had asked the judge to step aside out of concern that Chevron might refuse to pay damages in the event of a guilty verdict over contamination at oil fields operated by Texaco, which Chevron absorbed in 2001, in remote areas of the Ecuadorean jungle. A ruling by Judge Núñez had been expected by the end of this year or in early 2010. Legal officials have begun investigating the recordings to determine if any laws were violated, either by those who were recorded, or by those who made the recordings. In a statement, Chevron said, “No judge who has participated in the type of meetings shown in the video recordings could possibly have rendered a legitimate decision.” It called for the annulment of all of the judge’s prior rulings in the case. If granted, an annulment would probably delay already protracted proceedings in Ecuador. Steven Donziger, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in areas where Texaco once operated, said the recusal would not necessarily hurt his case. “The judge recusing himself will allow the trial to get back to a focus on the evidence,” he said. “Chevron has done all it can to delay this procedure, but no matter what judge presides over the case, we are confident the evidence is such that we are going to win a judgment against Chevron for a cleanup.” Simon Romero reported from Caracas, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

A group of area residents is suing Chevron, contending that they have been harmed by oil contamination. The company faces up to $27 billion in damages. Related Times Topics: Ecuador | Chevron Corporation The videos, together with audio recordings obtained by businessmen using watches and pens implanted with bugging devices, appear to implicate Ecuadoran officials and political operatives, including possibly Juan Núñez, the judge overseeing the lawsuit, and Pierina Correa, the sister of Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa. The recordings indicate that an Ecuadoran political operative was working to obtain $3 million in bribes related to environmental cleanup contracts to be awarded in the event of a ruling against Chevron. It was not clear from the recordings and transcripts provided by Chevron, however, whether any bribes discussed in the recordings were actually paid or whether Judge Núñez was even aware of plans to try to bribe him. The tapes also did not demonstrate whether the president’s sister was aware of the scheme or had participated in it. But in a statement that Chevron says illustrates that the judge’s handling of the case is flawed, Judge Núñez said on one of the video recordings that he planned to rule against Chevron by January and that damages could exceed $27 billion. Judge Núñez, who presides over the case from a cramped office in the town of Lago Agrio in Ecuador, could not be reached for comment on Monday. The recordings, which Chevron placed on its Web site, are the latest twist in a 16-year legal battle over oil contamination of jungle areas in northern Ecuador. Mr. Correa, a left-wing economist who rose from obscurity to become Ecuador’s strongest president in recent memory, has repeatedly sided with the plaintiffs in the case, prompting a fierce lobbying effort by Chevron in Washington to strip Ecuador of American trade preferences. That effort failed in June when the Obama administration, seizing a chance to improve ties with Mr. Correa, allowed the preferences to continue. But the release of the recordings will focus more scrutiny on Mr. Correa, who has come under pressure over his clashes with the media and accusations of corruption involving another family member, his brother Fabricio Correa, a prominent businessman. Alexis Mera, a legal adviser to the president, dismissed the recordings as “approaching the level of defamatory libel.” He said Chevron was benefiting from the crime of intercepting conversations without authorization, reflecting “a terrible legal strategy.” Steven Donziger, a lawyer representing the group of Ecuadorans who are suing Chevron, contending that they had been harmed by the oil contamination, said: “I suspect this is a Chevron sting operation; there needs to be an investigation into Chevron’s role in this as much as the judge’s. I find it awfully odd that these individuals would secretly film meetings using James Bond devices like a spy watch and a spy pen. “At the end of the day this will not affect the underlying case,” Mr. Donziger said, “other than it might cause a short delay if the judge needs to be replaced.” Chevron said it had obtained the recordings from Diego Borja, an Ecuadoran who once worked as a logistics contractor for the company. The company said Mr. Borja had been working with an American businessman, Wayne Hansen, to secure water treatment contracts. Chevron said that neither man had been paid for the recordings, but that the company paid for Mr. Borja and his family to leave Ecuador because of concern about his safety. “I’d like to think he brought them to us out of respect for our company and concern for what seemed to be transpiring here,” Charles James, an executive vice president of Chevron, said of the recordings in a telephone interview. “We think this information absolutely disqualifies the judge and nullifies anything that he has ever done in this case.” In one of the recordings made in June, the political operative, Patricio García, who identified himself as an official in Mr. Correa’s political party, referred to $3 million in bribes to be split equally among the judge, the presidency and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Mr. Correa’s party, Mr. García said, would receive the $1 million payment on behalf of the plaintiffs. In the same meeting, Mr. García told Mr. Borja how to approach Ms. Correa, the president’s sister, about the bribe. “Tell Pierina clearly, ‘Madam Pierina, what we came to do beyond anything else is to participate, participate in the remediation. That’s why I want to make you part of this,’ “ he said. The recordings do not indicate whether Ms. Correa was aware of the efforts to include her in a bribery scheme. Nor is there confirmation that Mr. García was in fact in contact with her. Secret recordings of closed-door meetings have become a common feature of Ecuadoran politics. Mr. Correa, furious over the recent airing of a recording of a private conversation in his office with a cabinet minister and a member of congress, said he would request the shutdown of the television network that broadcast the recording. “This is an attack on national security,” he said. But while Mr. Correa takes such recordings seriously, it is not clear if the people whose conversations about contract bribes were recorded by Mr. Borja grasped the complexity of the Chevron lawsuit. For instance, appeals by Chevron could delay for years the payment of damages that could be used for water cleanup contracts. Still, the recordings offered a glimpse into the murky world of Ecuadoran politics and business. In another reference to Ms. Correa’s ability to ensure that the contracts would be forthcoming, Mr. García said, “Pierina knows absolutely everything.” He told Mr. Borja of a conversation he said he had with Ms. Correa, according to a transcript. “So she says: ‘Patricio, I just have to tell Rafael this one little thing, nothing else.

With natural gas falling to about a quarter of its value last year, “it really doesn’t make sense right now to be drilling those gas wells,” he said. Chevron said its net income amounted to $1.75 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the quarter. That compared with $5.98 billion, or $2.90 a share, a year earlier. The company said its net income suffered from a weak United States dollar, amounting to $453 million in reduced earnings. That compared with an income benefit of $126 million in the comparable period last year. Chevron said revenue fell 51 percent, to $40.2 billion, from $81 billion. “The demand for refined products remained generally weak,” the chief executive, David J. O’Reilly, said in a statement. A Raymond James analyst, Pavel Molchanov, said he still considered Chevron stock a strong buy despite the weak earnings report. Like Exxon Mobil, Chevron has spread its refining operations around the world and does not depend on American consumers to make money. “Petroleum demand in the United States is the weakest of any major economy,” Mr. Molchanov said. “They’re particularly focused in Asia where the economy is relatively decent.” The company said a barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids fetched $53 in the second quarter, compared with $110 in the second quarter of 2008. Chevron’s production numbers, however, stood out when compared with other major oil companies reporting earnings this week. Chevron raised net oil-equivalent production by 5 percent. During the quarter, Chevron’s subsidiaries started drawing crude and natural gas from deepwater production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Angola and Brazil.

Skip to next paragraph Related 7 Bombs Strike in Iraq as Violence Spreads (June 26, 2009) Premier Casting U.S. Withdrawal as Iraq Victory (June 26, 2009) Yet, there are widespread doubts about whether Iraq is ready for a sudden infusion of capital from international oil corporations. The country is still not safe. Parliament has not approved a law regulating the oil industry. And oil companies are wary of corruption within Iraq’s Oil Ministry. The oil companies are also somewhat disgruntled, being forced to compete for 20-year service contracts and not the more lucrative production sharing agreements they would prefer. Such agreements would allow them to share directly in the profits from oil production, rather than getting fixed fees. Still, all sides want to move ahead for one simple reason: money. “Asking why oil companies are interested in Iraq is like asking why robbers rob banks: because that’s where the money is,” said Larry Goldstein, director of special projects at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that studies energy economics. “You can’t choose where the resources are. The risks are substantial, but everybody has to play by the same risks.” The Iraqi government says that in order to maintain security and pay the salaries of the hundreds of thousands of its employees hired during the past two years, it has to try to exponentially raise oil production, which accounts for about 95 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings. “We are determined to develop our massive hydrocarbon resources as quickly as possible to finance the reconstruction of the country,” Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq’s oil minister, said recently. Mr. Shahristani said his goal was to increase production from the current level of about 2.4 million barrels a day to 6 million barrels in six years. To do that, the government has estimated that its oil sector needs $50 billion in investment on top of the more than $8 billion it has spent during the past several years to try to increase capacity. But production has been declining for years in southern Iraq, which contains about 80 percent of Iraq’s oil. Government officials blame crumbling infrastructure there, while others cite mismanagement. Under the government of Saddam Hussein, many oil-sector employees who held technical jobs were members of the Baath Party. After the American invasion, many of them fled abroad, were arrested or were killed, leaving the ranks severely depleted. Iraqi oil officials acknowledge that as a result of that and mismanagement, oil production and the current bidding process have suffered. Oil corporations have complained quietly about the corruption, mismanagement and continuing violence in Iraq, as well as rules that force them to become partners with Iraqi oil companies. Another contractual requirement dictates that the oil companies that win fields in the auction make payments totaling $2.6 billion to the government. The Iraqi government has described the money as loans that will be paid back once production begins. More ominously for the oil companies, stiff resistance to the coming auction has been building among members of Parliament, oil unions and even officials in the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. “The service contracts will put the Iraqi economy in chains and shackle its independence for the next 20 years,” said Fayad al-Nema, director of the South Oil Company, the state-owned company that produces most of the country’s crude oil. Mr. Nema’s opinion is important because the South Oil Company is likely to be chosen as one of the partners in the joint ventures that will be created with foreign companies to operate the six oil fields and two gas fields that are up for bid. Despite the drawbacks, international oil companies see Iraq as critical for business because few other places have as much oil that is untapped and relatively close to the surface, so it can be extracted relatively cheaply. With 115 billion barrels, the country has the world’s third largest proven reserves, trailing only Saudi Arabia and Iran. Indeed, after months of lobbying by Mr. Maliki and other government officials, most of the world’s big oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum and Chevron, are expected to submit bids. The companies were expelled from Iraq in 1972, after Mr. Hussein nationalized the oil industry. “My guess is that every international oil company in the world, knowing Iraq is blessed with terrific God-given natural resources, is interested in Iraq,” Daniel Nelson, a former ExxonMobil vice president, said recently. “I’m not giving any competitive secrets away here.” Last year, an Iraqi plan to award six no-bid contracts to Western oil companies was voided amid sharp criticism from several United States senators. In the meantime, the Kurdistan Regional Government signed about 30 contracts of its own with international oil companies, though the central government refuses to recognize them. Each of the six fields open for bidding has more than five billion barrels of oil. Four of the fields are in the south and two are in the northern province of Kirkuk. The auction is scheduled to begin on Monday, and the government hopes to finish subsequent contract negotiations by the end of August. Abeer Mohammed contributed reporting.

At her wooden hut here in the Amazon forest, where oil-project flares illuminate the night sky, she points to a portrait of her youngest son, who died seven years ago of leukemia at age 16. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Chevron Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Moises Saman for The New York Times Residents of Shushufindi, Ecuador, wash in the water of the Santa Fe River. The residents say toxic chemicals have leached into the soil, groundwater and streams. “We believe the American oilmen created the pollution that killed my son,” said Ms. Ruíz, 58, who lives in a clearing where Texaco, the American oil company that Chevron acquired in 2001, once poured oil waste into pits used decades ago for drilling wells. Texaco’s roughnecks are long gone, but black gunk from the pits seeps to the topsoil here and in dozens of other spots in Ecuador’s northeastern jungle. These days the only Chevron employees who visit the former oil fields, in a region where resentment against the company runs high, do so escorted by bodyguards toting guns. They represent one side in a bitter fight that is developing into the world’s largest environmental lawsuit, with $27 billion in potential damages. Chevron is preparing for a ruling by a lone judge in a tiny courtroom on the top floor of a shopping center in Lago Agrio, a town rife with slums that Texaco founded in the 1960s as its base camp in the Amazon. Chevron faces claims for an era when oil companies were less purposeful about protecting the environment than they are today. It also faces potentially huge damages in a country where American corporations once wielded strong influence but are now treated with discourtesy, if not contempt. The sympathies of the judge, a former military officer named Juan Nuñez, are not hard to discern, and he appears likely to rule against Chevron this year. “This is a fight between a Goliath and people who cannot even pay their bills,” Mr. Nuñez, 57, said in an interview in his office, where more than 100,000 pages of evidence were stacked to the ceiling. But his ruling is not likely to end the case. Already, the dispute is the subject of intense lobbying in Washington, which could apply pressure to Ecuador on Chevron’s behalf. If the company loses, it is ready to pursue appeals in Ecuador and, if necessary, to seek international arbitration. Texaco laid down stakes here in the 1960s, and began producing oil in the early 1970s when Ecuador was still under military rule. Before the oil began to flow, the region was inhabited by forest tribes, including the Cofán and the Siona-Secoya. Political tension permeated Texaco’s presence in Ecuador much of the time it operated here in a partnership with the government, and by the time it was prepared to leave, in the early 1990s, a cleanup of its operations was needed. So Texaco reached a $40 million agreement with Ecuador to clean a portion of the well sites and waste pits in its concession area, absolving it of future liability. But that cleanup, carried out in the 1990s, was far from the bookend Texaco hoped to achieve. Instead, villagers in Ecuador became convinced they were getting sick from the pollution left behind. They filed suit in 1993 in the United States, and later claimed that their grievances were not covered by Texaco’s settlement agreement. As the case snaked its way through American courts, Ecuador seemed to fall to pieces, going through 10 presidents in a decade by 2006. The American lawsuit was eventually thrown out, on grounds the case should not be tried in the United States, and the plaintiffs reformulated it and filed it here. Today, Chevron has absorbed Texaco, and Ecuador has gone through a metamorphosis under the leftist President Rafael Correa. He has repeatedly sided with the plaintiffs, calling Chevron’s Ecuadorean past “a crime against humanity.” Such sentiment holds strong appeal to those who claim that people here, like Ms. Ruíz’s 16-year-old son, are dying from the pollution that Texaco spawned. Citing scientific studies, the plaintiffs claim that toxic chemicals from Texaco’s waste pits, including benzene, which is known to induce leukemia, have leached for decades into soil, groundwater and streams. A report last year by Richard Cabrera, a geologist and court-appointed expert, estimated that 1,400 people in this jungle region  perhaps more  had died of cancer because of oil contamination. Chevron rejected the claims, contending that Mr. Cabrera had no medical evidence to back up his conclusion that the company should pay $2.9 billion just to compensate for excess cancer deaths. 1 2 Next Page » Simon Romero reported from Shushufindi, Ecuador, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

Gene Randall, a former CNN correspondent, spent about five months on the project, which was posted on the Internet in April, three weeks before the “60 Minutes” report was shown on May 3. “Chevron hired me to tell its side of the story,” he said. “That’s what I did.” The two videos  one by CBS, the other by a corporation being scrutinized by CBS  run about 14 minutes long. They each discuss a class-action lawsuit filed by Ecuadoreans who accuse Texaco, a company acquired by Chevron in 2001, of poisoning the rain forest. An Ecuadorean judge is expected to rule soon on whether Chevron owes up to $27 billion in damages, which would make the case “the largest environmental lawsuit in history,” the “60 Minutes” correspondent, Scott Pelley, said. Both videos start with a correspondent appearing on camera and calling it a “bitter” dispute. But from there, they diverge. The “60 Minutes” report visits the rain forest, talks to the Ecuadorean judge and interviews a Chevron manager. The Chevron video interviews the same Chevron manager, as well as five professors who are consultants to the oil company, but none of the plaintiffs. The Chevron video never directly claims to be journalism. But a casual viewer could be swayed by the description  “Gene Randall reporting”  and the journalistic devices used, including file footage of the rain forest and over-the-shoulder interviews with experts. Chevron posted the video on YouTube as well as its own Web site devoted to the lawsuit. Chevron declined to answer questions about the video. But in a statement, it said that “we produced this video in response to a campaign waged by trial lawyers. They’ve turned to Hollywood to tell a fictional story. We’ve turned to an award-winning, former journalist to tell a factual story.” Mr. Randall, who has been a corporate consultant since leaving CNN in 2001, had worked with Chevron once before, as an interviewer of the company’s chief executive for a corporate Web video. When the company approached Mr. Randall late last year, he said he had researched the Ecuador lawsuit and “became convinced that their side had not gotten out there.” The first Google search result for the words “Chevron in Ecuador” shows a Web site created by Amazon Watch, an environmental activist group, that blames “Chevron’s negligence” for injuries and deaths in the country. Chevron has since bought Google ads so that its Web site about the lawsuit, which includes Mr. Randall’s video, appears as a sponsored link. Mitch Anderson, a campaigner for Amazon Watch, said that Chevron had resorted to “embarrassing public relations tactics” because credible news sources had not sufficiently framed the report the way they would like, namely, to “to place all of the blame for Texaco’s environmental disaster in Ecuador on PetroEcuador,” Texaco’s former partner. Mr. Randall’s video acknowledges the claims of the plaintiffs many times, primarily to set up Chevron’s response. “This is not a news report,” he said in an interview. “This is a client hiring a provider to tell its side of the story.” The video ends with a voiceover saying “Gene Randall reporting.” Jeff Fager, the executive producer of “60 Minutes,” said his staff would have liked the same access that Mr. Randall had to Chevron. The oil company’s chief environmental scientist appears in the corporate video, but “they wouldn’t let us interview her,” Mr. Fager said. Mr. Fager emphasized that the “60 Minutes” segment was “well-reported and fair.” “I’m sure that Chevron preferred the story they told to the one we told, but that’s not journalism, that’s advocacy,” he said. Their advocacy may not have had a serious effect. While the “60 Minutes” report reached at least 12 million viewers on television, the Chevron-sponsored effort has received only about 2,000 views on YouTube. Chevron would not say how many views it had counted on its own Web site. “Most companies like their own advertising best, and this is not a whole lot different,” Mr. Fager said.

A blog about energy, the environment and the bottom line. Go to Blog » But the world’s oil giants are not convinced that it will work. Even as Washington goes into a frenzy over energy, many of the oil companies are staying on the sidelines, balking at investing in new technologies favored by the president, or even straying from commitments they had already made. Royal Dutch Shell said last month that it would freeze its research and investments in wind, solar and hydrogen power, and focus its alternative energy efforts on biofuels. The company had already sold much of its solar business and pulled out of a project last year to build the largest offshore wind farm, near London. BP, a company that has spent nine years saying it was moving “beyond petroleum,” has been getting back to petroleum since 2007, paring back its renewable program. And American oil companies, which all along have been more skeptical of alternative energy than their European counterparts, are studiously ignoring the new messages coming from Washington. “In my view, nothing has really changed,” Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said after the election of President Obama. “We don’t oppose alternative energy sources and the development of those. But to hang the future of the country’s energy on those alternatives alone belies reality of their size and scale.” The administration wants to spend $150 billion over the next decade to create what it calls “a clean energy future.” Its plan would aim to diversify the nation’s energy sources by encouraging more renewables, and it would reduce oil consumption and cut carbon emissions from fossil fuels. The oil companies have frequently run advertisements expressing their interest in new forms of energy, but their actual investments have belied the marketing claims. The great bulk of their investments goes to traditional petroleum resources, including carbon-intensive energy sources like tar sands and natural gas from shale, while alternative investments account for a tiny fraction of their spending. So far, that has changed little under the Obama administration. “The scale of their alternative investments is so mind-numbingly small that it’s hard to find them,” said Nathanael Greene, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “These companies don’t feel they have to be on the leading edge of this stuff.” Perhaps not surprisingly, most investments in alternative sources of energy are coming from pockets other than those of the oil companies. In the last 15 years, the top five oil companies have spent around $5 billion to develop sources of renewable energy, according to Michael Eckhart, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, an industry trade group. This represents only 10 percent of the roughly $50 billion funneled into the clean-energy sector by venture capital funds and corporate investors during that period, he said. “Big Oil does not consider renewable energy to be a mainstream business,” Mr. Eckhart said. “It’s a side business for them.” Shell, for example, said it spent $1.7 billion since 2004 on alternative projects. That amount is dwarfed by the $87 billion it spent over the same period on its oil and gas projects around the world. This year, the company’s overall capital spending is set at $31 billion, most of it for the development of fossil fuels. Industry executives contend that comparing investments in oil and gas projects with their research efforts in the renewable field is misleading. They say that while renewable fuels are needed, they are still at an early stage of development, and petroleum will remain the dominant source of energy for decades. In its long-term forecast, Exxon says that by 2050, hydrocarbons  including oil, gas, and coal  will account for 80 percent of the world’s energy supplies, about the same as today. “Renewable energy is very real,” David J. O’Reilly, the chief executive of Chevron, said in a speech in New York last November. “We need it. It will be an essential part of the future I envision. But it’s not realistic to suppose we can replace conventional energy in a timeframe that some suggest.” Chevron has spent about $3.2 billion since 2002 on “renewable and alternative energy and energy efficiency services,” according to Alexander Yelland, a spokesman. It plans to spend $2.7 billion in the three years through 2011 on a variety of projects, including a business that helps improve energy efficiency for companies and government agencies, he said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on April 8, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.The Obama administration wants to reduce oil consumption, increase renewable energy supplies and cut carbon dioxide emissions in the most ambitious transformation of energy policy in a generation.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Chevron Corp Go to your Portfolio » Chevron capped off a string of robust quarterly profit reports from oil companies, including another American corporate profit record for the Exxon Mobil Corporation. Altogether, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and their rivals BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips posted earnings of $44.4 billion for the quarter, up 58 percent from the same time a year ago. But this period of astounding, sometimes record profits may be coming to an end. Crude prices peaked at about $145 near the start of the quarter in mid-July before embarking on a steep slide that has continued into the fourth quarter. When the third quarter ended Sept. 30, benchmark crude prices were still around $100 a barrel. In early trading Friday, they slipped below $64 a barrel. Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., said it earned $7.89 billion, or $3.85 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $3.72 billion, or $1.75 a share, at the period a year ago. Analysts were expecting average earnings of $3.25 a share based on a survey by Thomson Reuters. Revenue shot up 43 percent, to $78.87 billion, from $55.2 billion. Its shares slipped 10 cents, to $74.08, in morning trading Friday. Chevron said earnings from its exploration and production, or upstream, business rose about 80 percent in the quarter, to $6.18 billion, buoyed by crude prices. Global production fell nearly 6 percent to an average of 2.44 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, however, hurt in part by late-summer hurricanes that shut down output in the Gulf of Mexico. At its American upstream arm, Chevron said the average sales price for a barrel of crude and natural gas liquids was $107 in the third quarter, up from $67 a year ago. Chevron said it swung to a profit of $1 billion at its United States refining and marketing arm after posting a loss of $110 million a year ago, when ample gasoline supplies made it difficult for Chevron and other refiners to recover higher oil costs at the gasoline pump. In this year’s third quarter, Chevron said it benefited from significantly higher margins on the sale or refined products  largely because of the drop in crude prices. The company made the turnaround even though branded gasoline sales volumes fell 7 percent from a year ago. Chevron reported capital and exploratory expenditures of $5.5 billion in the quarter, up from $5.2 billion a year ago. It also bought back $2 billion shares of its common stock.

Mr. Kempthorne also said his department would follow all of the recommendations from the inspector general, Earl E. Devaney, to improve the Minerals Management Service, including enhanced oversight of the agency and a stronger ethics program. “This process will be completed as swiftly as possible, and we will examine the full spectrum of disciplinary actions, including termination,” Mr. Kempthorne said. In three reports released last week, Mr. Devaney detailed what he called a “culture of ethical failure” that existed at the agency from 2002 to 2006, including high-ranking officials who defied procurement regulations and employees who had sexual relationships with and accepted gifts from oil company employees. Mr. Devaney told the House Natural Resources Committee that the employees involved in the scandal “had a callous disregard for the ethical rules by which the rest of us are required to play,” while Mr. Kempthorne called their actions inexcusable. While there was no proof that oil companies had received any contracts because of their coziness with the agency, Mr. Devaney said he believed the government probably lost money because of the ethics abuses. But both the secretary and inspector general stressed that they believed 99.9 percent of Interior Department employees were hard-working and ethical. Mr. Devaney said the atmosphere at the royalty agency now “is decidedly different.” Democrats on the committee criticized oil companies for not being more helpful in the investigation and wondered what was being done to discourage employees at the companies named in the investigation  Chevron, Shell, Hess and Gary-Williams Energy Corporation  from repeating the actions documented in the investigation. Republicans at the hearing agreed that Mr. Devaney’s findings were serious, but some also said a more pressing matter for the committee was the search for bipartisan solutions to the country’s energy problems. Under questioning from Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Devaney said his investigation had been delayed when employees from Chevron and a former Shell employee refused to testify. He said it was possible that more employees of the Minerals Management Service could have been prosecuted if the oil company officials had cooperated, but said he also wished the Justice Department had been more aggressive itself. Two former employees have already pleaded guilty to charges connected to the violation of the procurement standards. Mr. Devaney said he did not expect any further indictments. Mr. Kempthorne said it could be assumed that the oil company officials who had offered gifts in the past would still be in regular contact with agency employees. He said that the department was stepping up its efforts to inform companies about the ethics rules surrounding gifts. Still, Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, said he found it “disturbing that one half of the crime here just goes on and conducts business as if nothing happened.” Representative Steve Pearce, Republican of New Mexico, expressed dismay at the report’s findings, saying they would be more appropriate in People magazine than in The Congressional Record.

As a result, prices at the pump began soaring again. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Add to Portfolio Valero Energy Corporation Chevron Corp Go to your Portfolio » Already in the last two days the average price for a gallon of gasoline has increased to nearly $3.80 from $3.68, according to AAA, a jump that has been rare since the oil price spikes of the 1970s and 1980s. Drivers throughout the South and Midwest, which depend on Gulf refineries, are reporting increases of 30 to 40 cents at some gasoline stations over the last couple of days. The culprit is a combined blow from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, which have shut down almost all oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico for over two weeks and thrown a wrench into refinery operations in Texas and Louisiana. At least 14 Texas refineries, representing nearly a quarter of the nation’s refining capacity, will probably remain shut for the next week or more. Three more Louisiana refineries may be damaged from widespread flooding. “It may not be possible for us  and other manufacturers  to maintain normal supplies in the coming days,” Chevron stated in a bleak assessment on its Web site on Sunday, warning of “severe supply disruptions in the wake of Hurricane Ike.” The Energy Department said it would release more than 300,000 barrels of reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to refiners, and indicated that it would help to keep supplies going to refineries that were still running. But oil companies said power outages at refineries and pipelines and at hundreds of gasoline stations around the Gulf area were going to make distribution of fuel difficult for awhile. Refiners began to send crews as early as Saturday afternoon to visit refineries along the coast after Hurricane Ike passed quickly through the area. Preliminary reports indicated that the refineries in Texas did not suffer significant flooding or other damage, but company officials said they did not want to speculate about how long it would take to resume normal operations. It will also take time for companies to fly over and board hundreds of oil and gas platforms on the Gulf that were jostled by Hurricane Ike’s extensive wake and gusts. The United States Minerals Management Service reported that at least 10 platforms  out of 3,800 in the Gulf  had been destroyed. At least two oil drilling rigs broke loose from their moorings. There has been no estimate yet of any environmental damages. Platforms and other production facilities around the Gulf account for about 25 percent of domestic oil production and nearly 15 percent of domestic natural gas output. “We don’t even know when we can start the restart process, let alone how long the restart process will take,” said Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero Energy, the country’s biggest refiner. Valero has three big refineries in Houston, Port Arthur, Tex., and Texas City, Tex., that have been closed since a few days before the hurricane made landfall as a Category 2 storm Saturday morning. Mr. Day said that crewmen had not found any serious structural damage at the three facilities, but there was no power for the Texas City and Port Arthur refineries because of a regional blackout. Meanwhile none of the three facilities have adequate fresh water supplies to generate steam because the storm surge pushed salt water through the region’s waterways. Since most of the Houston refineries are clustered in a small area, are supplied by the same utilities and most are expected to face similar problems. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We are looking at another week or eight or nine days before refineries are up and going, so refined gasoline is going to be in a shortage situation because of the power outages and flooding.” “It is going to be felt for the next week that we have gasoline shortages,” Ms. Hutchison said, “so people need to be prepared for that.” The disruptions come as drivers were just getting used to lower gasoline prices. Just before Hurricane Gustav hit Louisiana on the Labor Day weekend, the national average for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline was $3.69, more than 40 cents below the highs in July. Gasoline prices had fallen sharply until the last few days mainly because oil prices have dropped since early summer by more than $40 dollars a barrel to about $100, about the level at the beginning of the year. Crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange declined again on Sunday by more than 2 percent, to $99.70 a barrel a six-month low, as traders continued to view declining economic trends as more important than an active hurricane season. Declining oil prices mean that once the disruption subsides, gas prices could easily drop as quickly as they are now rising. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike are the first major challenge to Gulf oil operations since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005, which crippled more than 100 production platforms, disrupted refinery operations and sent oil and gas prices rising for weeks.

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We are looking at another week or eight or nine days before refineries are up and going, so refined gasoline is going to be in a shortage situation because of the power outages and flooding.” “It is going to be felt for the next week that we have gasoline shortages,” Ms. Hutchison said, “so people need to be prepared for that.” The disruptions come as drivers were just getting used to lower gasoline prices. Just before Hurricane Gustav hit Louisiana on the Labor Day weekend, the national average for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline was $3.69, more than 40 cents below the highs in July. Gasoline prices had fallen sharply until the last few days mainly because oil prices have dropped since early summer by more than $40 dollars a barrel to about $100, about the level at the beginning of the year. Crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange declined again on Sunday by more than 2 percent, to $99.70 a barrel a six-month low, as traders continued to view declining economic trends as more important than an active hurricane season. Declining oil prices mean that once the disruption subsides, gas prices could easily drop as quickly as they are now rising. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike are the first major challenge to Gulf oil operations since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005, which crippled more than 100 production platforms, disrupted refinery operations and sent oil and gas prices rising for weeks.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/world/middleeast/11iraq.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Iraq Cancels Six No-Bid Oil Contracts<date>Published: September 10, 2008</date><text>An Iraqi plan to award six no-bid contracts to Western oil companies, which came under sharp criticism from several United States senators this summer, has been withdrawn, participants in the negotiations said on Wednesday.

The companies confirmed on Wednesday that the deals had been canceled. While not particularly lucrative by industry standards, the contracts were valued for providing a foothold in Iraq at a time when oil companies are being shut out of energy-rich countries around the world. The companies will still be eligible to compete in open bidding in Iraq. The six no-bid deals were for work to increase Iraqi oil production from existing oil fields by half a million barrels a day  the same amount by which OPEC countries agreed Tuesday to reduce output. After its cancellation of the deals, Iraq reduced by 200,000 barrels per day its goal of producing 2.9 million barrels per day by the end of the year. The deals would have been the first major oil contracts with the central government since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003, though the Kurdistan region has separately signed more than 20 contracts. Since that time, however, Iraq’s central government has moved on with other energy deals. The Oil Ministry last month signed its first major post-Hussein contract with the China National Petroleum Corporation. On Sunday, the Iraqi cabinet approved a deal with Shell to process natural gas in southern Iraq. The ministry informed the oil companies of the cancellation on Sept. 3, according to a statement from Shell. In Vienna, Mr. Shahristani said the ministry would now invite bids on the contracts. Shell said the Iraqi side had broken off negotiations. “Shell can confirm that we received a letter from Iraqi Ministry of Oil on September 3rd informing us of their decision to cease further discussions,” the company said in a statement. Earlier this summer, a group of Democratic senators led by Charles E. Schumer of New York had appealed to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to block the deals, contending that they could undermine the efforts of Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites to reach agreement on a hydrocarbon law and a revenue-sharing agreement. This criticism was conveyed to Mr. Shahristani by the American Embassy in Baghdad in late June, and after that the deals were delayed. “I’m glad the Iraqis heard our plea that to do this now would be bad for Iraq and bad for Iraqi-American relations,” Senator Schumer said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “It’s a good first step. Now let’s make progress on the long-term” goal of passing a hydrocarbon law, he said. The State Department had responded that the contracts were an Iraqi affair, though American advisers had helped draft them. Meanwhile, the ministry has said it intends to proceed with new oil deals whether or not the Iraqi Parliament passes a hydrocarbon law. Senator Schumer said Wednesday that he would propose an amendment to the defense appropriation bill in Congress that would specify that should Iraq sign any petroleum contracts before passing the law, profits from those deals would go to defray United States reconstruction spending in Iraq.

Chevron and several smaller oil companies are also on the verge of signing contracts. President Bush and Vice President Cheney, both former oil-company executives, have long tried to tell us this war was about terrorism, about weapons of mass destruction, about bringing freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people, about anything but oil. Said Mr. Bush: “We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.” He didn’t wait. It didn’t matter that Saddam Hussein posed no imminent threat to the U.S. Or that Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

But at what cost? In addition to the terrible toll of Americans and Iraqis killed and wounded, the war in Iraq has diverted attention and resources from critical problems here in the U.S., where the housing market has been crippled, the stock market has tanked, gasoline has soared past $4 per gallon, unemployment is increasing and an extraordinary number of debt-ridden working families are staring into a financial abyss. Even as oil companies are enjoying staggering profits, many Americans  in July!  are already worried sick about the potentially ruinous cost of heating their homes next winter.

For an administration joined at the hip to the oil industry, the lure of Iraq’s enormous reserves was stronger even than the impulse to conquer an enemy that murdered more than 2,700 civilians on Sept. 11, a toll greater than the number of Americans killed by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.

Skip to next paragraph Related Iraq Sues Companies Over Oil-for-Food Program (July 1, 2008) Iraq’s oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, speaking at a news conference here, said Iraq would begin taking bids later this year for longer-term contracts on six of its oil fields. Thirty-five foreign companies have qualified to participate. Winners will be announced in 2009, Mr. Shahristani said. Iraq hopes to almost double its production, to 4.5 million barrels of oil a day over the next five years from the current 2.5 million barrels, Mr. Shahristani said. The contracts are aimed at helping the country do that. Iraq had been expected on Monday to issue its first contracts to foreign oil companies that would provide technical support and help raise Iraqi oil production ahead of awarding lucrative long-tern contracts. Those initial short-term contracts, with Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total, BP and Chevron, are still under negotiation, a person close to the talks said, and will probably be completed in the next month. The reason for the delay was unclear. Chevron said in a statement that it was “continuing to negotiate” with the Oil Ministry on the short-term technical contract on an oil field called West Qurna, which is currently producing. “The ministry has separately announced a tender for full field development and Chevron has been prequalified to participate in that bid round,” the company said. Mr. Shahristani defended the way Iraq has handled the oil contracts, which have led to criticism in the Arab world and abroad, where suspicions run rampant that the United States-led invasion was at least partly about access to Iraq’s oil. The initial contracts are expected to be awarded without competitive bidding, but Mr. Shahristani told the news conference, “There will be no privilege for any of those companies to participate in future contracts.” Bloomberg News quoted the chief executive of Shell, Jeroen van der Veer, as saying at the World Petroleum Congress in Madrid that the company expected to sign oil agreements with Iraq in “a matter of weeks.” A major legal question hangs over the process: Iraq has yet to pass a law that divides oil revenue among all parts of the country. Iraq has some of the largest oil reserves on earth, but they are largely untapped because the country has long lacked the resources to develop them. The companies will provide equipment and expertise to refurbish the country’s aging infrastructure. The six fields “are producing now, but there is a need for development because they were established years ago,” Mr. Shahristani said. Iraqis interviewed on Monday said profit from oil was the business of the country’s most powerful politicians, as well as the United States, and ordinary people got little benefit from it “The income won’t come to me,” said Abu Riyam, a 42-year-old engineer who was shoe shopping with a relative in central Baghdad. “They won’t build houses or hospitals with it.” Despite Iraqi skepticism, oil accounts for nearly all of Iraq’s revenue, and provides salaries for public sector employees as well as financing for most public works projects. Other Iraqis were more hopeful. “American technology is the best in the world,” said Salah Mahmood, a 45-year-old cab driver in Basra, Iraq’s second-largest city and the center of oil production for the country. “Why would we reject these contracts?” Also on Monday, a spate of violence against judges escalated sharply. Bombs exploded in front of the houses of four judges from the Court of Appeals in largely-Shiite eastern Baghdad, a spokesman for the court said. A fifth judge discovered a bomb in his car as he was leaving the same court Monday afternoon. An Interior Ministry spokesman said the bomb exploded and the judge, Hassan Fuad, was wounded. The attacks seemed to be calculated to intimidate rather than to kill. It was not clear who was responsible. “This is an attack to destroy the state itself,” said Wail Abdul Latif, a member of Parliament who worked as a judge for decades. “These judges were far from sectarianism and politics.” In addition, bombs exploded in Mosul, in northern Iraq, and near a police station in a town called Mandli in Diyala Province in eastern Iraq, killing two and wounding more than 20, the authorities said. Sabrina Tavernise reported from Baghdad, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow. Reporting was contributed by Riyadh Muhammad, Mudhafer al-Husaini and Mohammed Hussein from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Basra, Mosul, Baquba and Diwaniya.

Iraq has some of the largest oil reserves on earth, but they are largely untapped because the country has long lacked the resources to develop them. The companies will provide equipment and expertise to refurbish the country’s aging infrastructure. The six fields “are producing now, but there is a need for development because they were established years ago,” Mr. Shahristani said. Iraqis interviewed on Monday said profit from oil was the business of the country’s most powerful politicians, as well as the United States, and ordinary people got little benefit from it “The income won’t come to me,” said Abu Riyam, a 42-year-old engineer who was shoe shopping with a relative in central Baghdad. “They won’t build houses or hospitals with it.” Despite Iraqi skepticism, oil accounts for nearly all of Iraq’s revenue, and provides salaries for public sector employees as well as financing for most public works projects. Other Iraqis were more hopeful. “American technology is the best in the world,” said Salah Mahmood, a 45-year-old cab driver in Basra, Iraq’s second-largest city and the center of oil production for the country. “Why would we reject these contracts?” Also on Monday, a spate of violence against judges escalated sharply. Bombs exploded in front of the houses of four judges from the Court of Appeals in largely-Shiite eastern Baghdad, a spokesman for the court said. A fifth judge discovered a bomb in his car as he was leaving the same court Monday afternoon. An Interior Ministry spokesman said the bomb exploded and the judge, Hassan Fuad, was wounded. The attacks seemed to be calculated to intimidate rather than to kill. It was not clear who was responsible. “This is an attack to destroy the state itself,” said Wail Abdul Latif, a member of Parliament who worked as a judge for decades. “These judges were far from sectarianism and politics.” In addition, bombs exploded in Mosul, in northern Iraq, and near a police station in a town called Mandli in Diyala Province in eastern Iraq, killing two and wounding more than 20, the authorities said. Sabrina Tavernise reported from Baghdad, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow. Reporting was contributed by Riyadh Muhammad, Mudhafer al-Husaini and Mohammed Hussein from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Basra, Mosul, Baquba and Diwaniya.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/world/middleeast/30contract.html?ref=chevroncorporation">U.S. Advised Iraqi Ministry on Oil Deals<date>Published: June 30, 2008</date><text>A group of American advisers led by a small State Department team played an integral part in drawing up contracts between the Iraqi government and five major Western oil companies to develop some of the largest fields in Iraq, American officials say.

Go to the Blog » The disclosure, coming on the eve of the contracts’ announcement, is the first confirmation of direct involvement by the Bush administration in deals to open Iraq’s oil to commercial development and is likely to stoke criticism. In their role as advisers to the Iraqi Oil Ministry, American government lawyers and private-sector consultants provided template contracts and detailed suggestions on drafting the contracts, advisers and a senior State Department official said. It is unclear how much influence their work had on the ministry’s decisions. The advisers  who, along with the diplomatic official, spoke on condition of anonymity  say that their involvement was only to help an understaffed Iraqi ministry with technical and legal details of the contracts and that they in no way helped choose which companies got the deals. Repeated calls to the Oil Ministry’s press office for comment were not returned. At a time of spiraling oil prices, the no-bid contracts, in a country with some of the world’s largest untapped fields and potential for vast profits, are a rare prize to the industry. The contracts are expected to be awarded Monday to Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, Total and Chevron, as well as to several smaller oil companies. The deals have been criticized by opponents of the Iraq war, who accuse the Bush administration of working behind the scenes to ensure Western access to Iraqi oil fields even as most other oil-exporting countries have been sharply limiting the roles of international oil companies in development. For its part, the administration has repeatedly denied steering the Iraqis toward decisions. “Iraq is a sovereign country, and it can make decisions based on how it feels that it wants to move forward in its development of its oil resources,” said Dana Perino, the White House spokeswoman. Though enriched by high prices, the companies are starved for new oil fields. The United States government, too, has eagerly encouraged investment anywhere in the world that could provide new oil to alleviate the exceptionally tight global supply, which is a cause of high prices. Iraq is particularly attractive in that light, because in addition to its vast reserves, it has the potential to bring new sources of oil onto the market relatively cheaply. As sabotage on oil export pipelines has declined with improved security, this potential is closer to being realized. American military officials say the pipelines now have excess capacity, waiting for output to increase at the fields. But any perception of American meddling in Iraq’s oil policies threatens to inflame opinion against the United States, particularly in Arab nations that are skeptical of American intentions in Iraq, which has the third-largest oil reserves in the world. “We pretend it is not a centerpiece of our motivation, yet we keep confirming that it is,” Frederick D. Barton, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in a telephone interview. “And we undermine our own veracity by citing issues like sovereignty, when we have our hands right in the middle of it.” United States officials are directly advising Iraq on a host of issues, from electricity to education. But they have avoided the limelight when questions turn to how Iraq should manage its oil endowment, insisting that a decision must rest with the Iraqi government. The State Department advisers on the Western contracts say they purposely avoid trying to shape Iraqi policy. “They have not negotiated with the international oil companies since the 1970s,” said the senior State Department official, who was speaking about Iraqi oil officials and who is directly involved in shaping United States energy policy in Iraq. The advice on the drafting of the contracts was not binding, he said, and sometimes the ministry chose to ignore it. “The ministry did not have to take our advice,” he said, adding that the Iraqis had also turned to the Norwegian government for counsel. “It has been their sole decision.” The advisers say they were not involved in advancing the oil companies’ interests, but rather treated the Oil Ministry as a client, the State Department official said. “I do not see this as a conflict of interest,” he said. A potential area of criticism, however, is that only Western companies got the bigger oil contracts. In particular, Russian companies that have experience in Iraq and had sought development contracts are still waiting. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in World »A group of American advisers led by a small State Department team played an integral part in drawing up contracts between the Iraqi government and five major Western oil companies to develop some of the largest fields in Iraq, American officials say.

They are blamed by both the public and Congress for the current energy crisis, but complain about being hamstrung in their own search for energy sources. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Daniel Rosenbaum for The New York Times David J. OReilly Enlarge This Image Chevron Chevrons Blind Faith production facility and others would work offshore if the drilling moratorium there is lifted. Before heading to Saudi Arabia for an emergency energy summit this weekend, David J. O’Reilly, the chairman and chief executive of Chevron, spoke about why Congress should allow more access to offshore drilling in the United States and offered his explanation of why oil prices have jumped to record levels in recent months. Q. President Bush this week called for lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling. What impact will this have on future oil supplies in the United States ? A. It is a good thing. The president is going in the right direction here. But I would have gone even further and lifted the moratorium with a presidential order. But you also have to remember that the lag time between exploration and first production is still in the range of eight to 10 years. Still, it would send a very strong message to the world that U.S. energy policy is shifting and is going toward a little more supply. Q. How much more oil can be produced in these regions there? A. That’s really impossible to know until we have more exploration. But I know the chances are pretty good it would expand our supply. Let’s suppose that we expanded production by one million barrels a day 15 years from now. At over $100 a barrel  remember this is a hypothesis  that would still mean $3 billion a month less in oil imports. That would have a demonstrable impact. Q. But there is strong opposition to offshore drilling. A. I realize there is a discomfort. This has to be done very carefully. But we’ve demonstrated, in the face of very powerful hurricanes, that even under extreme weather conditions our offshore systems are pretty robust and environmentally sound. The Europeans have a strong environmental record but the Norwegians and the British have been able to safely encourage offshore developments. Brazil was a recent example of success offshore. So what’s wrong with this country? It is a shame that we need to get to $100 a barrel for oil or $4 a gallon for gasoline to have this discussion. Q. Democrats say oil companies are sitting on unused leases and they should drill there first before more regions are opened up to production. A. What I would encourage the Democrats to do is to look at the facts. We should not be making these crass statements without facts. There are already existing limitations on leases. Already you have to use them or loose them. It takes time for geological exploration to occur. In our case, over 80 percent of our leases are being actively worked. We turned back many of them last year, even before they expired, because many don’t have anything on them. Q. Oil prices are headed for their seventh straight year of gains. Why such a sustained run-up in prices? A. This is a case of demand-driven increases. The time we could count on cheap oil and cheap gas is ending. In prior periods, you’ve had price spikes because of big disruptions in supplies. But in this decade, the new phenomenon is that demand has been the main driver. Q. But hasn’t the oil industry failed to anticipate the surge in consumption growth that we’re seeing now by underinvesting in the 1990s? A. It is very easy to say that looking backward. But you have to remember that oil was at $10 a barrel in 1998 and a lot of people were getting out of the business. It was a tough time back then. But those that were tough enough to continue investing then survived. Q. Oil prices have jumped from around $25 in 2002 to about $140 a barrel recently. Are we in a bubble? A. I am a believer that most of this is related to fundamentals. Those are concerns about supplies. Last year, oil supplies did not grow in total. What the market is looking for is more visibility in future oil supplies. That is one of the main drivers for the difference between the prices five years ago and the prices we’re seeing now. Q. What has been the impact of financial investors or “speculators” in the market? A. I am not quite sure that I know that. It is quite possible that they have added some volatility. But the bulk of the price of oil that we see today relates to concerns about the outlook for physical supplies in the long term. Q. Many people are concerned about the issue of peak oil and the perception that the world is running out of oil has taken hold within investors. How do you respond to these concerns? A. It is not so much the molecules in the ground that are a concern. The biggest problem is to provide adequate access to permit investment to occur in a timely manner. If you include the United States, this is a matter of access. Q. Iraq is looking to bring back international oil companies. What can you tell us about your company’s plans there? A. We’ve been helping with technical support with Iraqi engineers on a voluntary basis. The Iraqis are also interested in short-term technical service agreements, which we’re considering entering into, that will allow production to increase in the short term by a total of 500,000 barrels a day. The world needs more oil. Having near-term supply from Iraq is important. But a hydrocarbon law and a predictable long-term investment climate, the Iraqis themselves say, is a prerequisite for long-term development.

PETERSBURG, Russia  The lineup told it all about Russia’s importance today. There, on one stage, sat the leaders of BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Total, Schlumberger and Dow Chemical, as well as the chairman of the Russian energy giant Gazprom and the president of the Russian oil company Lukoil. Skip to next paragraph Related Russia Takes Critical Tone on Economy (June 8, 2008) The busy executives of the global energy industry, by their very willingness to sit together at an economic conference here over the weekend, were sending a powerful message that big Western businesses were in Russia to stay. They may be worried about the weak rule of law, corruption and lack of an independent judiciary, as seen in recent troubles confronting BP and Shell with their Russian partners. But that is not likely to stop them from swarming around the honey pot for large contracts and access to the resources of Russia, one of the world’s largest energy exporters and fastest growing economies in an era of $130-a-barrel oil. And while politicians in Western Europe fret over their own inability to develop a cohesive energy policy  and some fan fears of a newly resurgent, aggressive Russia  many of the sharpest minds who gathered here at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum seemed focused on something quite different: ensuring that Russians benefit from economic plenty this time, as opposed to the heady era of privatization in the 1990s, which benefited only a few. In a speech on Sunday that was keenly awaited by liberals in Russia’s business elite, a first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, listed the “many hurdles” on this path: an over-reliance on energy exports, a falling population, a lack of modern skills, an unhealthy way of life and a state apparatus with a tendency to meddle. “Russia should be a country that people want to live in,” Mr. Shuvalov said in remarks that seemed uncharacteristically self-deprecating for a top Russian official these days. Mr. Shuvalov’s audience filled less than half of the hall. It had been packed on Saturday when the new president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, took subtle aim at the United States, suggesting that the world might be in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and that a revived Russia could offer solutions to problems that have underscored America’s shortcomings. But the crowd on Sunday was rapt as Russian and Western business executives peered out to make projections on Russia’s state and standing in 2020. So much has changed, so fast, in the past decade here that there is little clarity on how to proceed. As one Russian participant, Alexander V. Izosimov of the cellphone operator VimpelCom, said, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Jim O’Neill, who is the chief economist of Goldman Sachs  and credited with coining the phrase “BRIC countries” to describe Brazil, Russia, India and China becoming leaders among world economies  surprised the crowd by predicting a conservative overall average of 3.3 percent annual economic growth in Russia by 2020, down from growth around 8 percent now.

PETERSBURG, Russia  The lineup told it all about Russia’s importance today. There, on one stage, sat the leaders of BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Total, Schlumberger and Dow Chemical, as well as the chairman of the Russian energy giant Gazprom and the president of the Russian oil company Lukoil. Skip to next paragraph Related Russia Takes Critical Tone on Economy (June 8, 2008) The busy executives of the global energy industry, by their very willingness to sit together at an economic conference here over the weekend, were sending a powerful message that big Western businesses were in Russia to stay. They may be worried about the weak rule of law, corruption and lack of an independent judiciary, as seen in recent troubles confronting BP and Shell with their Russian partners. But that is not likely to stop them from swarming around the honey pot for large contracts and access to the resources of Russia, one of the world’s largest energy exporters and fastest growing economies in an era of $130-a-barrel oil. And while politicians in Western Europe fret over their own inability to develop a cohesive energy policy  and some fan fears of a newly resurgent, aggressive Russia  many of the sharpest minds who gathered here at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum seemed focused on something quite different: ensuring that Russians benefit from economic plenty this time, as opposed to the heady era of privatization in the 1990s, which benefited only a few. In a speech on Sunday that was keenly awaited by liberals in Russia’s business elite, a first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, listed the “many hurdles” on this path: an over-reliance on energy exports, a falling population, a lack of modern skills, an unhealthy way of life and a state apparatus with a tendency to meddle. “Russia should be a country that people want to live in,” Mr. Shuvalov said in remarks that seemed uncharacteristically self-deprecating for a top Russian official these days. Mr. Shuvalov’s audience filled less than half of the hall. It had been packed on Saturday when the new president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, took subtle aim at the United States, suggesting that the world might be in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and that a revived Russia could offer solutions to problems that have underscored America’s shortcomings. But the crowd on Sunday was rapt as Russian and Western business executives peered out to make projections on Russia’s state and standing in 2020. So much has changed, so fast, in the past decade here that there is little clarity on how to proceed. As one Russian participant, Alexander V. Izosimov of the cellphone operator VimpelCom, said, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Jim O’Neill, who is the chief economist of Goldman Sachs  and credited with coining the phrase “BRIC countries” to describe Brazil, Russia, India and China becoming leaders among world economies  surprised the crowd by predicting a conservative overall average of 3.3 percent annual economic growth in Russia by 2020, down from growth around 8 percent now. Russia, Mr. O’Neill said, will have a 4 percent share of world’s gross domestic product then, compared with 2 percent now. But he said it would be weaker relative to Brazil, India and China because of far fewer people at work. India alone is expected to grow by 300 million people  twice Russia’s current population.

The terms of the settlement were submitted for approval in the federal court for the Southern District of New York. Under the terms of the deal, the companies also agreed to pay 70 percent of the future cleanup costs over the next 30 years. The defendants that agreed to the settlement include BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Marathon Oil, Valero Energy, Citgo and Sunoco. Six other companies named in the lawsuit, including Exxon Mobil, did not agree to the deal, said Scott Summy, a lawyer at Baron &amp; Budd and a counsel for the plaintiffs. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs, which include 153 public water systems in New York, California and 15 other states, claimed that the additive, a chemical called methyl tertiary butyl ether, or M.T.B.E., was a defective product that led to widespread contamination of groundwater. The suit contended that the chemical was used by oil companies, even though they knew of the environmental and health risks that it posed. Low levels of M.T.B.E. can make drinking water supplies unpalatable because of its ''offensive taste and odor,'' according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency has also found that the compound caused cancer in laboratory rats that were exposed to high doses. Since the mid-1990s, hundreds of lawsuits have been brought against oil companies for their use of the chemical. This deal, if approved, would be the largest settlement to date. M.T.B.E. has been used since 1979 to increase octane levels in gasoline, but its use became more widespread after the 1990 Clean Air Act mandated the use of an oxygenate in certain cities to reduce smog and other pollutants. When mixed with gasoline, the additive ensured that the fuel burned more thoroughly, thereby reducing air pollution. But after being widely adopted, it was found to corrupt groundwater. Even in small amounts, the additive makes water smell and taste like turpentine. The use of M.T.B.E. is now banned in 23 states, including New York and California. In 2005, some 130,000 barrels of M.T.B.E. were produced a day, representing about 1 percent of the nation's gasoline supplies. Oil companies stopped using it in 2006. The oil industry has fought hard to avoid penalties related to its use of the additive, arguing that it should not be forced to pay for the cleanup of a product that it was mandated to use. Estimates of the cost of a total cleanup of M.T.B.E. have run to the tens of billions of dollars. In 2003, the Republican-dominated Congress tried to pass a provision that would have shielded M.T.B.E. manufacturers from litigation, but failed because of strong opposition in the Senate. A second attempt to add a lawsuit shield also failed during discussion of the 2005 energy bill. ''No court has ruled that gasoline with M.T.B.E. is a defective product,'' said Rick Wallace, a lawyer at Wallace King Domike &amp; Reiskin in Washington, who represents Chevron and Shell. ''This settlement does not concede the point. Quite the contrary, the settling companies are prepared to vigorously defend the product.'' The high risk of lawsuits related to M.T.B.E. has prompted the oil industry to stop using it and look for another gasoline additive. That eventually led to the development and use of ethanol as an oxygenate replacement. Peter J. Sacripanti, a lawyer representing Exxon at McDermott Will &amp; Emery, said that Exxon did not plan to settle and would ''vigorously defend'' itself. ''Exxon's position is very simple,'' he said. ''When it engages in conduct that injures people, it pays recompense for that. In all these cases, our conduct did not cause injury, or cause damages. Our conduct was lawful.'' The suit, first filed in 2003 by public water providers in several states, was eventually consolidated into a single federal case. The pending case will go to trial in September in New York. Robert J. Gordon, of Weitz &amp; Luxenberg in New York, also represented the plaintiffs.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E5D9123DF930A35756C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=chevroncorporation">BUSINESS BRIEFING | EARNINGS; Chevron Profit Rises Even as Production Falls<date>Published: May 3, 2008</date><text>Chevron said first-quarter profit rose 9.5 percent, beating Wall Street estimates.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic High Prices Fail to Bolster Output Related Times Topics: Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline But as prices flirt with $120 a barrel, many energy experts are becoming worried that neither seems to be happening. Higher prices have done little to suppress global demand or attract new production, and the resulting mismatch has sent oil prices ever higher. That has translated into more pain at the pump, with gasoline setting a fresh record of $3.60 a gallon nationwide on Monday. Experts expect prices above $4 a gallon this summer, and one analyst recently predicted that gasoline could reach $7 in the next four years. A central reason that oil supplies are not rising much is that major producers outside the OPEC cartel, like Russia, Mexico and Norway, are showing troubling signs of sluggishness. Unlike OPEC, whose explicit goal is to regulate the supply of oil to keep prices up, these countries are the free traders of the oil market, with every incentive to produce flat-out at a time of high prices. But for a variety of reasons, including sharply higher drilling costs and a rise of nationalistic policies that restrict foreign investment, these countries are failing to increase their output. They seem stuck at about 50 million barrels of oil a day, or 60 percent of the world’s oil supplies, with few prospects for growth. “According to normal economic theory, and the history of oil, rising prices have two major effects,” said Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. “They reduce demand and they induce oil supplies. Not this time.” With global supplies tight, geopolitics continue to play a big role in pushing up oil prices. Oil futures closed at $118.75 a barrel, up 23 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after strikes by oil workers in Scotland and Nigeria that shut down nearly 1.7 percent of the world’s daily production. Countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been the main source of production growth in the past three decades, as new fields were discovered in Alaska, the North Sea and the Caspian region. But analysts at Barclays Capital said last week that non-OPEC supplies were “seemingly dead in the water.” Goldman Sachs raised similar concerns last month, saying that growth in non-OPEC supplies “can no longer be taken for granted.” At the same time, oil consumption keeps expanding. Global consumption is forecast to increase by 1.2 million barrels a day this year, to 87.2 million barrels a day, with much of the growth in demand coming from China, India and the Middle East, according to the International Energy Agency, a group that advises industrialized countries. In the United States and through much of the developed world, the higher fuel prices have led drivers to reduce their consumption, and gasoline demand is expected to drop this year. But that drop will be more than offset by the rise in energy demand from developing countries. In the next two decades, demand is projected to jump by 35 percent, and developing countries will consume more oil than industrialized countries. Higher oil prices mean record profits for oil companies that have, to some extent, masked the supply problems. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both expected to deliver knockout performances when reporting quarterly earnings this week, even as they struggle to increase production. “What is disturbing here is that things seem to get worse, not better,” said David Greely, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. “These high prices are not attracting meaningful new supplies.” The outlook for oil supplies “signals a period of unprecedented scarcity,” Jeff Rubin, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said last week. Oil prices might exceed $200 a barrel by 2012, he said, a level that would very likely mean $7-a-gallon gasoline in the United States. Some regions are simply running out of reserves. Norway’s production has slumped by 25 percent since its peak in 2001, and in Britain, output has dropped 43 percent in eight years. Production from the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska has dropped by 65 percent from its peak two decades ago. In many other places, the problems are not below ground, as energy executives like to put it, but above ground. Higher petroleum taxes and more costly licensing agreements, a scarcity of workers and swelling costs, as well as political wrangling and violence, are making it harder to raise production. “It’s a crunch,” said J. Robinson West, chairman of PFC Energy, an energy consulting firm in Washington. “The world is not running out of oil, but rather it’s running out of oil production capacity.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »As oil prices soared to record levels in recent years, basic economics suggested that consumption would fall and supplies would rise as producers drilled for more oil.

The lawsuit, which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought in the early 1990s, contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons of contaminated water from 1972 to 1992. Chevron’s general counsel, Charles James, disputed the findings of the report, saying the case had become a political issue in Ecuador. “This is no longer a private lawsuit; it is a working partnership between the government and plaintiffs,” he said. “This is more extortion that a real lawsuit.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Global Warming The New York Times Flooding is forcing Kivalina, Alaska, to relocate. The suit is the latest effort to hold companies like BP America, Chevron, Peabody Energy, Duke Energy and the Southern Company responsible for the impact of global warming because they emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases, or, in the case of Peabody, mine and market carbon-laden coal that is burned by others. It accused the companies of creating a public nuisance. In an unusual move, those five companies and three other defendants  the Exxon Mobil Corporation, American Electric Power and the Conoco Phillips Company  are also accused of conspiracy. “There has been a long campaign by power, coal and oil companies to mislead the public about the science of global warming,” the suit says. The campaign, it says, contributed “to the public nuisance of global warming by convincing the public at large and the victims of global warming that the process is not man-made when in fact it is.” Kivalina, an Inupiat village of 400 people on a barrier reef between the Chukchi Sea and two rivers, is being buffeted by waves that, in colder times, were blocked by sea ice, the suit says. “The result of the increased storm damage is a massive erosion problem,” it says. “Houses and buildings are in imminent danger of falling into the sea.” The estimated cost of relocating the village is up to $400 million, the suit says. Some lawyers in the case participated in the long-running litigation against American tobacco companies in the 1990s, and some of the same legal theories echo through the complaint. But the hurdles may be greater than those in the tobacco wars. Global warming is a diffuse worldwide phenomenon; a successful public nuisance case requires that defendants’ behavior be directly linked to the harm. “Public nuisance law has been used from time immemorial to address issues that have not been addressed by the political branches,” said Kirsten H. Engel, a law professor at the University of Arizona. But Professor Engel added, “It’s very difficult to get a court to jump in here and say that what these companies are doing, and have been doing for years, is unreasonable and creating a public nuisance.” Two similar lawsuits, one brought by California against six automakers and another by a coalition of Eastern states against utility companies, have been dismissed by federal judges. Both judges said the issues involved were political and did not belong in the courts. Those decisions have been appealed. Matt Pawa, a lawyer for Kivalina, said this case was different because it sought monetary damages for an injured party. “The kind of harms to property and public welfare caused by global warming are classic public nuisance injuries,” Mr. Pawa said. He added that the other cases had no conspiracy claims, which he said courts routinely addressed. Reached late Tuesday, spokesmen for three defendants  Jason Cuevas of Southern, Vic Svec of Peabody and Gantt Walton of Exxon Mobil  said they would not comment on the substance of the lawsuit. But Mr. Svec said, “Rather than unreasonably suing companies for the weather, we would encourage everyone to join Peabody in supporting aggressive development of carbon capture and storage projects and other technologies that help us provide both energy security and carbon solutions.” Of the accusation that Exxon Mobil participated in a disinformation campaign, Mr. Walton said, “The recycling of this type of discredited conspiracy theory only diverts attention from the real challenge at hand  how to provide the energy to improve living standards while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 28, 2008 Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a lawsuit filed against energy companies by an Alaska Native coastal village that is being forced to relocate because of flooding caused by the changing Arctic climate misstated the estimated cost of moving the village.

More Articles in US »Correction Appended SAN FRANCISCO  Lawyers for the Alaska Native coastal village of Kivalina, which is being forced to relocate because of flooding caused by the changing Arctic climate, filed suit in federal court here Tuesday arguing that 5 oil companies, 14 electric utilities and the country’s largest coal company were responsible for the village’s woes.

The decision to drop Honeywell and Altria is unusual because the two stocks have performed well recently. Previous changes often marked the departure of stocks in decline at the time, like Eastman Kodak, International Paper and Sears.

Venezuela’s dollar-denominated bonds suffered their steepest drop in six months on Thursday on concerns that Mr. Chávez’s government could face a protracted legal battle with Exxon, preventing the government from raising cash through the sale of refineries abroad if the economy here slows after years of torrid growth. Investors are also increasingly concerned about the financial health of the national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, amid reports that its debt is ballooning as its output declines. The oil company is the largest single source of revenue for Mr. Chávez’s government, financing an array of social welfare projects and foreign aid to leftist allies. “This is a big blow against Venezuela,” said Pietro Pitts, an oil analyst who publishes Latin Petroleum, an industry magazine based here. “It could set an important precedent for other multinationals threatened by Venezuela’s government.” After Mr. Chávez’s move to take control of large oil ventures last year, Exxon dug in for a fight. While Chevron and other companies accepted the terms imposed by Mr. Chávez, Exxon aggressively sought to prevent Venezuela from transferring control of foreign-based oil assets to entities here ahead of arbitration proceedings. In recent days, Exxon won a court order from the High Court of London prohibiting Petróleos de Venezuela from selling assets worldwide up to a value of $12 billion, Margaret Ross, an Exxon spokeswoman in Houston, said in a statement. Exxon won similar orders in the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles for assets worth up to $12 billion. And in New York, Exxon won an order freezing $300 million of Petróleos de Venezuela’s assets. Despite a deterioration of political relations between Caracas and Washington, Venezuela remains a major trading partner with the United States, ranking as its fourth-largest supplier of imported crude oil. Venezuela’s government also controls Citgo Petroleum of Houston, which operates refineries in Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. Mr. Chávez’s government has compensated American companies in previous nationalizations of their assets when it was faced with the possibility of losing control of Citgo and other foreign assets in retaliation. A spokesman for Petróleos de Venezuela did not return calls seeking comment. The company is expected to appeal the rulings. The dispute may raise borrowing costs for Petróleos de Venezuela, which is being reconfigured by Mr. Chávez to focus on pressing social concerns.

A huge underwater oil field discovered late last year has the potential to transform South America’s largest country into a sizable exporter and win it a seat at the table of the world’s oil cartel. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Map The Tupi Deepwater Field Related Times Topics: Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline Enlarge This Image Pedro Lobo/Bloomberg News The Petrobras 54 platform was in Niteroi, Brazil, last August, before its deployment. The new oil, along with refining projects under way by Petrobras, the national oil company, could eventually make Brazil a larger exporter of gasoline as well, adding to supplies in the United States and other countries where it is all but impossible to build new refineries. The subsalt basin that contains Tupi, the new deepwater field estimated to hold the equivalent of five billion to eight billion barrels of light crude oil, is creating a buzz among the world’s largest oil companies. They have struggled lately to find global-scale projects worth investing in, even with oil touching $100 a barrel. Tupi is the world’s biggest oil find since a 12-billion-barrel field discovered in 2000 in Kazakhstan. Talk by the Brazilian government of tightening investment terms for the new offshore exploration frontier, however, could quickly curb international enthusiasm. Brazil is even drawing comparisons with Bolivia and Venezuela, two South American countries that have nationalized parts of their energy industries in recent years. Still, Brazil has remained far more open to foreign investment than those neighbors, and it has encouraged international oil companies like Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron to pour billions of dollars into offshore exploration, though so far without much success. Even if Petrobras asks for help from other major oil companies, developing Tupi will require solving thorny technical challenges and executing a project on a scale it has never tried before. The first commercial quantities of oil are not expected for some seven years. José Sergio Gabrielli, the chief executive of Petrobras, said he was optimistic that the company could develop the oil with little outside help. “We think we can develop the oil faster than we thought at the beginning,” Mr. Gabrielli said in an interview here last week. “We don’t think we have any insurmountable challenge on the technology side.” Just a decade ago the notion that Brazil would become self-sufficient in energy, let alone emerge as an exporter, seemed far-fetched  even in the sunny beach city of Rio, where Petrobras is based. Petrobras was formed five decades ago largely as a trading company to import oil to support Brazil’s growing economy, which is now the world’s 10th largest and supports more than 185 million people. Yet two years ago, even without Tupi, Brazil reached its long-sought goal of energy self-sufficiency, in part by expanding its domestic fossil fuel resources but also by developing an extensive ethanol industry using sugar cane. Today Petrobras has a standing goal of raising its Brazilian crude oil output by at least 100,000 barrels a day every year. With Tupi, Brazil’s 12.2 billion barrels of proven reserves would increase to some 17.2 billion, putting Brazil ahead of Canada’s 17.1 billion and Mexico’s 12.9 billion. It would fall between China and Nigeria on a world scale, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Venezuela, by contrast, has some 80 billion barrels of proven reserves. Rapid economic growth and declining oil production in oil-rich nations like Indonesia, Mexico and Iran are crimping how much they can sell abroad, straining the global oil market. In some cases, the governments of these countries subsidize gasoline heavily at home, which tends to encourage wasteful habits. But Brazil, with an economy growing at a healthy clip, sells fuels to its citizens essentially at market rates. And the huge three-decade-old effort to turn sugar cane into ethanol has made Brazil the largest consumer of plant-based biofuels in the world. The government requires that gasoline contain a minimum of 25 percent ethanol and that every service station have at least one pump that delivers pure ethanol. The growing ethanol program is putting Brazil in a better position to take advantage of Tupi’s oil riches, Mr. Gabrielli said. Petrobras expects ethanol use to rise as more flex-fuel vehicles hit the roads. “We are going to have more gasoline for export than we have today,” he said, “because part of the gasoline is going to be displaced by ethanol.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »RIO DE JANEIRO  While some of the world’s largest oil producers, including Mexico and Iran, are struggling to remain exporters, Brazil is moving in the opposite direction.

Academia Steps In.<date>Published: December 16, 2007</date><text>Correction Appended PAY me now, and pay me later. That’s the new mind-set at some leading research universities in dealing with business  and the essence of an emerging model for how corporations can tap big brains on campus without having to pay their salaries. Corporations have long been able to license intellectual property from universities, but these deals are cumbersome to negotiate and tend to work best when corporate researchers know exactly what they need to create. They don’t always. Often, they explore scientific and technological frontiers without a map. After blue-sky thinking and random experimentation, they build new products without relying on neatly defined patents or published scientific papers  the bread-and-butter of academic knowledge production. In the bygone days of innovation, large corporations  like RCA, Xerox and the old AT&amp;T  maintained internal laboratories like Bell Labs. These corporate labs were essentially research universities embedded in private companies, and their employees published academic papers, spoke at conferences and even gave away valuable breakthroughs. Bell Labs, for instance, created the world’s first transistor after World War II  and never earned a dollar from the innovation. Almost no corporate labs based on the Bell or Xerox model remain, victims of cost-cutting and a new appreciation by corporate leaders that commercial innovations may flow best when scientists and engineers stick to business problems. The obsession with marrying research and markets, while generally a strength of American capitalism, leaves some needs unmet. To fill them, “companies need boots on the ground at universities,” says Henry Chesbrough, a business professor who studies innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. A vanguard group of universities is giving corporations greater access to ivory-tower laboratories  for a price. Stanford has paired with Exxon Mobil in a deal worth $100 million over 10 years. The University of California, Davis, is getting $25 million from Chevron. And Intel has opened collaborative laboratories with Berkeley, the University of Washington and Carnegie Mellon. The appeal of these arrangements is that “we get broad engagement with universities,” says Andrew A. Chien, Intel’s director of research. “Their researchers work on frontiers, in unexplored territory. We want explorers.” Intel hopes to learn more about scientific and technical developments that might influence its business, even decades from now. The company says it benefits from having its own employees rub shoulders with professors, while gaining the chance to observe younger talent in Ph.D. programs. “You can view this as a pure pipeline,” says Mr. Chien, himself a former professor. Jean Stéphenne, president of the vaccine division of GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company, says university partnerships with corporations will grow “because technology is changing so rapidly.” Even if companies have the resources to finance their own research and identify the right academic problems to tackle, they usually don’t have the time to assemble a staff to pursue these problems. Without help from university professors, Mr. Stéphenne asks, “How can we cope?” Some people doubt that formal partnerships between corporations and universities can deliver real benefits. “Universities don’t innovate,” says Curtis R. Carlson, chief executive of SRI International, a nonprofit research institute in Menlo Park, Calif., that bought what remained of RCA’s lab. “Innovation means you get it out so people can use it. The university is not going to take it to the world.” But corporations hope that universities can help them take innovations to the world faster and more efficiently. Last month, BP pledged to spend $500 million over 10 years on alternative-energy research to be carried out by a new Energy Biosciences Institute at Berkeley, which will manage work done at a nearby Department of Energy lab and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “This is a new model we’re working through in real time,” says Robert J. Birgeneau, the chancellor of Berkeley. CRITICS of corporate-university partnerships fear limits on academic freedom or, worse, that companies might censor results that go against their interests. The risk of such interference seems small, however. Despite the large amount being offered by BP, the money will be divided three ways; of Berkeley’s annual research budget of $500 million (nearly all from the federal government), BP will be contributing less than 3 percent. Under the terms of the partnership, meanwhile, Berkeley professors are free to publish results of BP-funded research. The university also will own the rights to any resulting intellectual property. BP would even have to license that intellectual property, though payments are capped and the company would get the first look at promising results. The alternative to corporate funds is for universities to rely even more on government funds. And that raises parallel issues in the minds of some academics. The idea that government funding plays no role in prioritizing research “is completely at odds with reality,” says Michael Crow, the president of Arizona State University. The marriage of corporations and university researchers is still in its early days. “In the decades ahead, we will see more differentiation among universities in how they go about doing this,” Mr. Crow says. For universities, no matter what models emerge, the key is to deliver benefits to society and business. “Will these partnerships produce products you won’t get from two people in a garage?” Mr. Birgeneau asks. “We don’t know that yet. It is an important question.” G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com. Correction: December 23, 2007 A headline last Sunday with the Ping column, about research partnerships between universities and corporations, referred incorrectly to the status of Bell Labs. Although it is no longer part of AT&amp;T, it has not been discontinued; it is now the research arm of Alcatel-Lucent. The column also misspelled the surname of the president of Arizona State University, who said that universities’ roles in such partnerships would evolve in coming decades.

Despite the large amount being offered by BP, the money will be divided three ways; of Berkeley’s annual research budget of $500 million (nearly all from the federal government), BP will be contributing less than 3 percent. Under the terms of the partnership, meanwhile, Berkeley professors are free to publish results of BP-funded research. The university also will own the rights to any resulting intellectual property. BP would even have to license that intellectual property, though payments are capped and the company would get the first look at promising results. The alternative to corporate funds is for universities to rely even more on government funds. And that raises parallel issues in the minds of some academics. The idea that government funding plays no role in prioritizing research “is completely at odds with reality,” says Michael Crow, the president of Arizona State University. The marriage of corporations and university researchers is still in its early days. “In the decades ahead, we will see more differentiation among universities in how they go about doing this,” Mr. Crow says. For universities, no matter what models emerge, the key is to deliver benefits to society and business. “Will these partnerships produce products you won’t get from two people in a garage?” Mr. Birgeneau asks. “We don’t know that yet. It is an important question.” G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com. Correction: December 23, 2007 A headline last Sunday with the Ping column, about research partnerships between universities and corporations, referred incorrectly to the status of Bell Labs. Although it is no longer part of AT&amp;T, it has not been discontinued; it is now the research arm of Alcatel-Lucent. The column also misspelled the surname of the president of Arizona State University, who said that universities’ roles in such partnerships would evolve in coming decades. He is Michael Crow, not Crowe.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/business/worldbusiness/15chevron.html?ref=chevroncorporation">Chevron to Pay $30 Million to Settle Kickback Charges<date>Published: November 15, 2007</date><text>WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (AP)  Chevron has agreed to pay $30 million to settle charges that it had made illegal kickbacks to Iraq for oil purchased in 2001 and 2002 under the United Nations’ oil-for-food program. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that Chevron had agreed to the settlement under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act without admitting or denying the charges. But the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York said Chevron could still be prosecuted for criminal tax violations. Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., agreed to remit $25 million in profits and pay a $3 million civil penalty. The company will also pay $2 million to the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the Treasury Department. Of the $25 million, Chevron will forfeit $20 million under an agreement with the United States attorney’s office in New York and pay $5 million under an agreement with the district attorney’s office in Manhattan. The S.E.C. said in its complaint that Chevron found out in 2001 that the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Organization was demanding surcharges and that the company adopted a policy prohibiting payment. The company then purchased, through intermediaries, about 78 million barrels of crude oil from Iraq under 36 contracts from April 2001 to May 2002. But these traders failed to follow the company’s prohibition against kickbacks, and Chevron’s management did not ensure compliance, the S.E.C. said. A company spokesman, Donald Campbell, said in a statement: “The U.S. government advises us that one former Chevron crude oil trader participated in transactions when he knew or should have known that surcharges were to be paid by the third-party merchants from which Chevron purchased the crude oil. “There are no allegations that Chevron paid surcharges, and the trader is no longer affiliated with Chevron.” The oil-for-food program, which ran from 1996 to 2003, was created to help Iraqis meet some basic needs under the United Nations sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The program let the Iraqi government sell oil primarily to buy humanitarian goods. It was later found that the program was often used as a means to funnel kickbacks. Four other companies have agreed to settle S.E.C. corruption charges stemming from suspected kickbacks to the Hussein regime: the El Paso Corporation, Textron, Ingersoll-Rand and York International, which was purchased in 2005 by the auto supplier Johnson Controls. Chevron’s financial penalty is by far the largest of the five.

Margins to produce gasoline and other refined products fell during the quarter as prices for the fuel failed to keep pace with surging crude oil prices, dragging down earnings across the industry. Chevron said its net income fell to $3.72 billion, or $1.75 a share, from $5.02 billion, or $2.29 a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding about $400 million for one-time items, it posted earnings of about $1.94 a share, short of the $2.07 expected by analysts. Revenue in the quarter rose to $55.17 billion from $54.21 billion. Chevron’s chief executive, David J. O’Reilly, said in a statement that the company had difficulty recovering its higher fuel costs because the market in the United States was well-supplied with gasoline. Earnings at the company’s refining and marketing segment fell 74 percent, to $377 million, including a loss of $110 million from its refining and marketing operations in the United States. Chevron’s refineries in the United States processed 168,000 fewer barrels of oil a day than last year, partly as a result of a fire at its Pascagoula, Miss., refinery in August and a planned shutdown at its refinery in El Segundo, Calif. Profit from its exploration and production unit dipped to $3.43 billion from $3.5 billion last year. Chevron’s worldwide production dropped about 4 percent, to 2.6 million barrels a day, mainly as a result of changes to the company’s operating agreements in Venezuela.

Last year, the province’s premier, Danny Williams, walked away from talks with a consortium that includes Exxon Mobil and is led by Chevron Canada after the companies rejected his demands for an equity stake and additional royalties when oil prices are high. On Wednesday Mr. Williams, a Conservative and a multimillionaire, announced that he now had an agreement that would give his province a 4.9 percent stake in the Hebron oil project for 110 million Canadian dollars ($103.8 million). The tentative pact with the oil companies, he added, also includes an extra 6.5 percent royalty, on top of a 30 percent base rate, and removes the special investment tax credits that the oil industry had demanded. “This is a happy day for the province,” Mr. Williams said by telephone from the provincial capital of St. John’s. “We’re entering into a whole new era.” The deal largely fulfills Mr. Williams’s demands from 2006, with the exception of the addition of an oil-processing operation in the province. Exactly what broke the impasse is unclear. James C. Bates, a vice president in charge of asset development at Chevron Canada, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, declined to comment on what had closed the gaps between the sides. Mr. Bates characterized the outcome as “a win-win situation.” The Hebron oil field contains an estimated 731 million barrels of oil. As with most energy projects in Canada, the vast majority of its production will most likely flow to the United States. Some analysts estimate that construction may begin in 2010. Hebron will be Newfoundland’s fourth offshore oil project. Mr. Williams said that given the agreement’s terms and expected high oil prices, Hebron would be unusually lucrative, generating about 16 billion Canadian dollars ($15.1 billion) for Newfoundland over 25 years as well as 7 billion Canadian dollars for the federal government. Newfoundland struggled economically even before joining Canada in 1949. The collapse of cod stocks in recent years devastated its main industry, fishing and fish packing. But Wade Locke, an economist at Memorial University in St. John’s, said that oil royalties and energy industry spending meant that Newfoundland would no longer qualify for financial assistance from the federal government by the end of 2009. “Hebron, combined with everything else, will turn Newfoundland into a province of opportunity, like Alberta,” he said, referring to the affluent and oil-rich western province. While Mr. Williams’s tough stand last year drew criticism from parts of Canada’s business community, it contributed to his party’s 75 percent approval rating among Newfoundland voters in opinion polls. The announcement of a Hebron agreement is expected to help sustain the Conservatives’ position as they head into an election in October.

Refining margins hit near-record rates during the quarter, propping up profits at integrated oil companies, which both produce and refine oil and gas, as commodity prices dipped. Still, the second quarter was a mixed bag for the sector as lower output and crude oil prices outweighed strong refining profit at some large oil companies. Chevron’s net income in the quarter increased to $5.38 billion, or $2.52 a share, from $4.35 billion, or $1.97 a share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain of $680 million on the sale of Dynegy stock and a loss of $160 million on debt redemption, the company earned about $2.37 a share. Analysts’ average forecast for that figure was $2.30 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company’s production in the quarter dropped about 1 percent, to 2.63 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, because of changes in ownership at its operations in Venezuela and lower production in the United States. Chevron shares closed down 2.6 percent, or $2.26 a share, to $85.20. The company said it expected 2007 second-half production to be in line with the first half at about 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. “We’re starting to see that real growth in production is taking some time,” said James Halloran, an energy analyst with National City Private Client Group, which manages about $35 billion in assets. He added, “They are bringing on new projects, but they keep getting offset by either higher decline rates than anticipated, the effects of production-sharing agreements, or by glitches like Venezuela,” where the government has nationalized some assets in the energy sector.
