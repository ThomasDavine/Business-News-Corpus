The CTIA Show Dispatches from the wireless industry’s fall event. The average smartphone has the processing power that the personal computer did only a few years back. It ably runs Angry Birds and keeps you up on Twitter feeds (and makes phone calls, if that is still your thing). But soon they will need to take on another chore: Distilling data from the world around us. The explosion of sensors, by one estimate 140 per person by 2013, up from five per person now, will create huge loads of data. Sending all the raw information they collect into big computing centers could cause a lot of unnecessary congestion. Sandy Huffaker for The New York TimesPaul Jacobs. “Driving computing is the near-term big thing for us,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, a leading maker of chips for cellphones. A pacemaker connected to the network to monitor patient health, he noted, “records almost 100,000 beats a day. You can’t do that at a large scale. Phones can monitor the patient, and reduce the data.” Unless something goes drastically wrong, which would require the phone to send an alert to the hospital, consolidated information would be sent to a hospital computer less often and more efficiently by phone. “Security becomes a huge issue for this, so does safety, along with data reduction,” he said in an interview on the eve of the big CTIA cellphone industry conference here. Video over the phones gets a lot of attention as the next big function for smartphone computing power, Mr. Jacobs noted. He said monitoring and compressing business information, along with managing relationships with other connected devices, may be where the computing power goes. “Even if each sensor don’t generate a lot of data each, there will be so many of them that it will add up,” he said. This is, of course, a useful argument from a chief executive whose company is all about making powerful chips for wireless devices. Qualcomm is also working on a wireless connectivity standard, called Flashlink, that would enable phones to identify and interact with devices from up to a kilometer away. The applications range from home and office monitoring (getting the phone to work with a projector, say, to run a slide show) to identifying friends carrying similar devices. It is probably five or more years away, but could make connected devices even more attractive. But Mr. Jacobs’s observation also fits what has become a common model in the history of networked computing. First the computers at the center of a network become powerful; then the computers at the edge, the consumer and ordinary business devices, acquire more power and functionality, challenging the processing power of the center. As companies like Google and Microsoft build enormous data centers, the strong computing core has appeared. If history is any guide, the edge will in turn become powerful. Indeed, the recent Silk browser released with Amazon’s Fire tablet computer apportions tasks in just such an edge-core way, supporting Mr. Jacob’s prediction. At the same time, another function of wireless phones — computing at power low enough to work on small batteries — is becoming attractive for other devices, including tablet computers and the computer servers in data centers, Mr. Jacobs said. The Windows 8 tablet from Microsoft, expected in about a year with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip inside, “will collect data in a standby mode, like a phone,” Mr. Jacobs said. “It will be a fundamental difference for people.They are not used to that.” The device will turn on immediately, fully updated. Mr. Jacobs also noted that Qualcomm is working on devices that allow for input from gestures. (You can see a brief video of it.) Microsoft, which in July published patents on gesture technology at a tablet-sized level, would not comment on the features of its next device. Computer servers, stacked by the thousands in big data centers, now consume worrisome amounts of electricity. With that in mind, some computer makers are looking at adapting the designs of ARM, another phone chip company, for servers. “There is no question that ARM will end up in the data center,” Mr. Jacobs said. “When you are in the mobile industry, you focus on power.” ARM sells its designs, however, while Qualcomm focuses on high-value systems on its chips, including things like video and security as well as radio connections and computing. Phone chips in the server business, Mr. Jacobs said, “are not our main focus. Phones are still such a big market.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/alleged-iphone-5-images-begin-to-surface-online/?ref=qualcomminc">Plenty of Chatter About a New iPhone<date>September 15, 2011, 6:51 pm</date><text>photo via bgr.com Cases for an unusual iPhone model appeared briefly on the Case-Mate Web site Thursday. We’re just weeks away from the announcement of the new Apple iPhone 5, according to an Apple employee who asked not to be named because he was not allowed to speak publicly for the company. As the excitement for Apple’s latest product revs up, chatter about the phone is starting to fly around the Web at warp speeds. On Thursday the technology blog Boy Genius Report posted images of a new iPhone case from the site of a company called Case-Mate. The images were visible on the company’s site for a short period of time before they were replaced with a curiously cryptic page that says, “We’ll have your cases when you have your new iPhone.” From descriptions I’ve heard of the new iPhone from Apple employees, the images seemed potentially authentic. But it seems that Case-Mate might be sneakily trying to take advantage of the excitement over the phone by posting and then unposting the images. These things rarely happen accidentally, especially when it comes to new Apple products. Sneaky public relations tactics aside, an engineer familiar with the new iPhone said it would be fairly different from the iPhone 4 — including on the inside. The new iPhone will come with an eight-megapixel camera, this person said, an upgrade from the five-megapixel camera in the iPhone 4. Earlier this year Howard Stringer, Sony’s chief executive, let it slip that the next iPhone would be updated with an eight-megapixel camera made by Sony. The Apple engineer also said the new phone would have a faster A5 dual-core processor. Apple patents and recent new hires show that the company plans to add mobile payment functions to a future iPhone too — although it is unclear if that will happen this year. As I’ve written in the past, two people with knowledge of the inner workings of Apple’s next-generation iPhones say either the iPhone 5 or iPhone 6 will include a new chip that is made by Qualcomm. This chip will include near-field communication technology, known as N.F.C., that can be used to make mobile payments by waving the phone over an N.F.C. reader, just like swiping a credit card at a terminal. When Apple does introduce a mobile-payment-ready iPhone, the company will immediately have an advantage over its competitors, including Google and Microsoft, which are trying to push payments on mobile devices too. One person familiar with Apple’s plans said the phone’s payment information would be tied to customers’ iTunes accounts, which would make it simple for customers to set up a payment account on the iPhone by simply logging into iTunes. According to Apple, 200 million people have stored their credit card information on iTunes.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/technology/13qualcomm.html?ref=qualcomminc">Paul Jacobs Helps Qualcomm Get a Jump on Rivals<date>Published: June 12, 2011</date><text>SAN DIEGO — When Paul E. Jacobs took over from his father as chief executive of the chip maker Qualcomm in 2005, mobile phones were just beginning their transition from tools for talking to hand-held computers delivering data and entertainment.“We talk about the future of computing being mobile, but I don’t feel that way,” said Mr. Jacobs, 48. “I feel the present of computing is mobile.” Mr. Jacobs has spent the last six years expanding Qualcomm’s business beyond his father’s tight focus on the digital wireless technology known as C.D.M.A. (code division multiple access). While Irwin Jacobs, 77, the M.I.T. professor and electronics wizard who founded the company in 1985 and retired in 2005, was known for his dogged defense of the company’s intellectual property, his son Paul is more prone to talk breathlessly about a connected world where mobile devices diagnose our illnesses, turn on our lights, control our thermostats and allow doctors to remotely monitor our health in real time. Such a family succession in publicly traded companies is rare; Ford Motor and Comcast come to mind. For it to succeed is rarer still. Corporate governance specialists often disapprove of such successions. But the younger Mr. Jacobs has positioned Qualcomm, which builds chips for mobile devices, to lead the smartphone chip market as consumers increasingly do their computing in their palms and not tethered to their desks. Last year Qualcomm dominated a diverse field of smartphone chip makers with 41 percent of the total market share in terms of revenue and nearly 61 percent of the market share for application processors used in smartphones powered by Google’s Android operating system, according to the market research firm Strategy Analytics. Part of the company’s success is that the market for smartphones has been so robust. In 2010, smartphone shipments shot up 74 percent over the year before, while the market for PCs increased just 14 percent, according to the market research firm IDC. Such huge growth in hand-held computers has rival chip makers like Intel, Nvidia, Samsung and Texas Instruments in a tight race to build smaller, more power-efficient chips, capable of running the increasingly complex apps, location-based services and graphics consumers have come to expect in their phones. Intel, which dominated PC chips, is late to this market, so it is anyone’s game to win. Qualcomm’s strategy has been to create high-function, low-powered chip sets for smartphones and tablets that connect with other devices in various ways — a feat that has thus far largely eluded Intel. Qualcomm’s ARM-based Snapdragon chips are just such all-in-one processors. “Qualcomm has a two- or three-year advantage in terms of integration,” said Stuart Robinson, an analyst at Strategy Analytics. Qualcomm managed a leadership feat unusual in the modern business environment. “Qualcomm has been able to do the handoff from father to son that most other companies have not been able to do,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at the Williams Financial Group who has covered Qualcomm and the chip industry for more than a decade. “Paul is an engineer who owns patents in his own right and was a brilliant technologist before moving into this position,” he said. “And I think the industry as a whole respected him, knowing he was not just being given the job because it was his dad’s.” Still, the stigma of nepotism trailed Mr. Jacobs. “I could walk into a room and people would just underestimate me. ‘You’re the son of Irwin,’ ” he said. “They would think, ‘This person is only here because of that.’ ” The third of four sons, Mr. Jacobs took to computers early, learning to program in middle school on a Teletype terminal. Beginning in seventh grade he worked part time at Linkabit, another technology company founded by his father, which made communications equipment for the military. During college he worked summers at Qualcomm. “Another thing that my father did for me was that every summer I worked in another area of engineering, so that by the time I went to college, I had done almost every kind of engineering there was,” said Mr. Jacobs, who went on to earn a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where he focused on robotics. 1 2 Next Page »SAN DIEGO — When Paul E.

Counting AT&amp;T’s proposed bid, the industry’s merger and acquisition volume now tops $172 billion over the past year, surpassing the electric companies for the No. 2 spot. Oil and gas remains the most active industry for M.&amp;A., with nearly $266 billion of deals, according to Bloomberg data. Despite the strong industry M.&amp;A., AT&amp;T’s announcement represents the biggest telecom deal, by far. The next largest was in April 2010, when CenturyLink agreed to buy Qwest Communications for roughly $22 billion. The T-Mobile acquisition also represents AT&amp;T’s most ambitious move in awhile. In late December AT&amp;T agreed to buy some spectrum licenses from Qualcomm for roughly $1.9 billion. AT&amp;T’s last megamerger was back in 2006 when the company bought BellSouth for $83 billion. The T-Mobile transaction would be the second largest deal for AT&amp;T in the last decade. That assumes, of course, the deal gets the O.K. from regulators, who are likely to scrutinize it carefully. AT&amp;T expects this transaction to take a year to go through the approval process. On March 18, the Federal Communications Commission approved CenturyLink-Qwest tie-up, which was announced in April 2010.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/qatalysts-fee-in-atheros-deal-raises-question-of-disclosure/?ref=qualcomminc">Qatalyst's Fee in Atheros Deal Raises Question of Disclosure<date>March 10, 2011, 2:46 pm</date><text>Let’s start with a multiple choice question. You are a shareholder in a wireless communications company about to be purchased for approximately $3.1 billion. A boutique investment bank with technology expertise is retained to advise the company’s board and is to be paid a fee of $24 million. Of that amount, $23.5 million is contingent and will only be paid if the transaction is completed. In connection with the transaction, the investment bank provided a fairness opinion asserting that the price being paid to you is “fair from a financial point of view.” In deciding whether to approve the deal, do you: A. Think the fee should be publicly disclosed. B. Think disclosure of the fee is unimportant and so the company can decide not to disclose it. C. Wish you could go into investment banking. If you answered A, do you think that your knowledge of the fee: 1. Would be important to your decision whether to approve the deal? 2. Would not be important to your decision to approve the deal? The facts for these questions were the subject of Vice Chancellor John W. Noble’s opinion issued last Friday in Delaware Chancery Court in connection with Qualcomm‘s purchase of Atheros Communications. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Delaware Chancery Court opinion In this case, Atheros’s investment bank, Qatalyst Partners, led by Frank P. Quattrone, is to be paid $23.5 million by Atheros if a deal is completed. An additional $500,000 is payable to Qatalyst upon the bank’s delivery of a fairness opinion for the deal. In addition, Qatalyst will be paid an additional $7,500 for every one-cent increase in consideration paid to Atheros shareholder over and above a price of $45 a share. This final fee is the one negotiated by Atheros and, according to Vice Chancellor Noble, it is “substantially lower” than the fee that Qatalyst initially proposed. Anyone want to guess what the purchase price here is? Yes, $45 a share. But in fairness, the fee arrangement was only agreed late in the sale process when the price appeared to have been set. Qatalyst’s fee is a bit on the high side but not over the top in the investment banking world. According to Factset Mergermetrics, the average fee paid to an investment bank representing targets since 2005 where the transaction value was $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion was about $20 million. And yes, you can debate whether this money is commensurate with the value provided by investment banks. Initially, Atheros did not disclose the amount of the fee in its proxy statement. Atherton stated that the fee paid was “customary.” This is a common practice in mergers and acquisitions. Investment banks and parties are gun-shy about disclosing fees. They will use the ”customary” formulation and hope that the Securities and Exchange Commission does not force them to specify more. More often than not, the S.E.C. does not review the transaction documents and the parties get away with this nondisclosure. But Delaware also imposes its own disclosure requirements, which purport to mirror the federal ones. These require that the target company “disclose fully and fairly all material information within the board’s control…” Material information is formulated as “a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.” And that is why this began with a multiple-choice question. Do you find this fee information material such that Vice Chancellor Noble should require it to be disclosed? The vice chancellor answered yes. Vice Chancellor Noble focused on the contingent nature of the compensation, 98 percent of which was payable only if a transaction was completed. In his opinion, the vice chancellor stated: The differential between compensation scenarios may fairly raise questions about the financial advisor’s objectivity and self-interest. Stockholders should know that their financial advisor, upon whom they are being asked to rely, stands to reap a large reward only if the transaction closes and, as a practical matter, only if the financial advisor renders a fairness opinion in favor of the transaction. In essence, the contingent fee can readily be seen as providing an extraordinary incentive for Qatalyst to support the transaction. In this case, Atheros had only disclosed that a “substantial portion” of Qatalyst’s fee was contingent on completion of the transaction. But Vice Chancellor Noble said that the ratio was so high — 50-to-1 of contingent fee versus noncontingent compensation — that disclosure was required. Let’s face it, 50-to-1 seems a higher threshold than the word “substantial” would lead you to conclude. As an aside, Qualcomm had agreed to an exclusivity agreement with Atheros while another potential bidder was still interested in bidding. But Vice Chancellor Noble found nothing wrong with the Atheros board’s general sale process. In making this determination, the vice chancellor relied on the fact that this “was an independent board with deep knowledge of the company’s industry and it employed a robust and sophisticated process.” This is par for the course in Delaware these days. Independence and good faith trumps all, as we saw in the Airgas opinion. And the Atheros board did make efforts to reach out to the other bidder, the other bidder just did not appear serious enough. This justified the Atheros board’s decision to concentrate on Qualcomm. Expect bidders to focus on Vice Chancellor Noble’s justification of the exclusivity decision and become more insistent on exclusivity agreements in connection with sale negotiations. Atheros’s special meeting has been delayed until March 18 to allow for shareholders to digest this new disclosure and related disclosure that Vice Chancellor Noble ordered be made concerning the post-transaction employment conversations that Atheros’s chief executive held with Qualcomm. The opinion is one of a string in the last few months where Delaware courts have found disclosure related to investment banks and fairness opinions to be deficient. The others were in opinions involving takeovers of Art Technology Group, Occam Networks and implicitly Del Monte Foods. These opinions have not set forth bright-line rules but instead elaborated broad standards based on what they determine to be “material.” The result is that one must piece together the disclosure rules from these opinions, and even then cannot be sure that their disclosure is kosher. Tellingly, there is an entire law review article discussing these opinions and what exactly is required to be disclosed in Delaware. There may be some benefit from Delaware judges setting broadly worded disclosure standards. It allows for Delaware judges to become more involved in monitoring each deal. It also permits Delaware judges to impose penalties for bad behavior through additional disclosure while otherwise not penalizing directors and officers for bad behavior. But the costs are more litigation and uncertainty about standards as parties debate over what exactly is material such that it is required to be disclosed. Without clear rules on the subject, it also means that there are no real disclosure rules for fairness opinions in terms of banker compensation, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital or even the choice of what projections to use. Qatalyst for example, chose not to use Atheros’s own internal projections, instead relying on those from Wall Street, because the company’s projections did not provide an “an ‘apples to apples’ comparison with the information available for comparable transactions.” But such a comparison of “apples” as opposed to “oranges” is commonly done. We are left to puzzle why Qatalyst made this choice and wonder how good their analysis is. There needs to be a full debate about what shareholders need to know about the valuation analysis underlying a fairness opinion. It may be that, given fairness opinions are commonly maligned as not worth the paper they are written on, even the underlying disclosure is not meaningful or material to investors. This is a debate that cannot occur in a court. Since 1933, disclosure has been the cornerstone of the federal securities laws. This is the domain of the S.E.C., but the agency has forfeited it to Delaware courts when it comes to takeovers. The Delaware courts are trying to work this out, but standards for disclosure in the fairness opinion context are too intricate to set judicially. The S.E.C. should step back in and set clear rules for fairness opinion disclosure, including fee disclosure in the context of what shareholders may actually find meaningful. If it is indeed important, the fact that fee disclosure depends upon whether the S.E.C. comments on a company’s proxy or a Delaware judge intervenes seems a bit much. This is a problem I wrote about back in 2006 and it remains a problem. While the S.E.C. has a lot on its plate, perhaps it is time for it to update these rules and provide some answers on what is material for purposes of fairness opinions.

The International Consumer Electronics Show, the giant annual tech extravaganza, kicks off as more than 125,000 gadget fans descend on Las Vegas. Yet again, none of Apple’s hipster crew will attend. Their absence will be more acutely felt than ever, as rivals strain to show off their answers to the iPad. Expect plenty of happy talk, defensive posturing and denial, but not much in the way of consumer validation. The Mac and later the iPod helped establish a clear divide between Apple and the rest of gizmoland. But it wasn’t until 2007 that Apple truly eclipsed the C.E.S., as the big get-together is known. The company’s chief executive, Steve Jobs, stole the show remotely by introducing the iPhone at a rival event. Meanwhile, the C.E.S. best-in-show award went to a now nearly useless combination HD-DVD/Blu-ray player. The stark and humiliating contrast served notice to Apple competitors. But their attempts to compete head-on continue to be derivative and, at times, silly. The top prize at the electronics show in 2009 was the Palm Pre, a phone that never caught on from a company that no longer independently exists. Other big pushes, like last year’s 3-D TV hoopla, increasingly look like a depressing journey into groupthink. There won’t be much catharsis this year, either. Apple sold about 15 million iPads in 2010, making it the fastest-selling consumer electronics product ever. Nearly all the big gadgeteers in attendance will introduce rival tablet devices. Many will run on a version of Google’s Android operating system due out later this year. They have a fighting chance, considering Android-powered smartphones are catching on. But Apple was hobbled in its phone fight by an exclusive and unpopular AT&amp;T deal. That’s not the case with the iPad. Furthermore, when it comes to electronic playthings, established winners usually retain most of the spoils. These tablets-come-lately will struggle for market share just as Apple is nearly ready to sell its second-generation iPad. So while Mr. Jobs won’t be at the show, he will still loom large as attendees try to work out their fear of Apple. Tablet Gold Rush Qualcomm is making a $3.1 billion push for tablet gold. The company, a wireless technology giant, hasn’t had much success beyond cellphones. Yet other devices, like the Apple iPad and its rivals, are starting to take the technological lead from smartphones. Buying Atheros Communications gives Qualcomm a way in. Qualcomm has become an $84 billion company that produces chips for cellphones and licenses some underlying technologies needed to connect one phone to another. But there’s a bigger emerging opportunity. Devices that were once stationary and wired, like most computers, are increasingly becoming mobile. And new gadgets, like tablets and electronic readers, are proliferating. Atheros, by contrast, makes Wi-Fi chips and other sorts of processors that connect devices locally. Yet smartphones and tablets alike need both long-range and local connectivity. Snapping up Atheros means that Qualcomm should eventually be able to make one chip that provides both 4G cellphone connectivity and Wi-Fi. Such integration of multiple tasks is often a successful recipe for bigger sales, higher margins and increased market share. Happily for Qualcomm, its foray doesn’t come with too high a price tag. It is paying about 22 times Atheros’s estimated earnings for 2011. That’s in line with Atheros’s five-year average price-to-earnings ratio, according to Barclays. That said, this is Qualcomm’s biggest merger effort to date. And large deals can lead to indigestion and distracting managerial headaches. Furthermore, the company had some $20 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet prior to this deal, so there could be more ambitious purchases to come. Yet Qualcomm deserves the benefit of the doubt for now, given its solid long-term performance and record of returning cash to shareholders. In the fiscal year ending in September, for instance, the company distributed all of the $4.1 billion of cash generated from its operations back to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. As long as that discipline holds, Qualcomm’s latest purchase has every chance of proving a smart bet on a market that’s explosively upwardly mobile.

The deal, formally announced on Wednesday, is the largest takeover yet by Qualcomm, a leading wireless technology company. It also comes on the heels of Intel’s $1.4 billion purchase in August of Infineon’s wireless chip business, which competes with Atheros. Many industry analysts believe Qualcomm’s takeover of Atheros is the first of several potential deals in the semiconductor industry this year. They say big technology companies, flush with cash and eager to acquire high-margin businesses, may find attractive opportunities among small and midsize chip makers. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink As people spend more hours perusing Facebook, searching the Web, sending messages via Twitter and streaming videos online, the digital connection — and the ability to stay online throughout the day — is becoming increasingly important, as Qualcomm’s deal for Atheros shows. “From a vision standpoint, we believe that communications capability will go into more and more devices in the world around us and that the phone will be used to interact with these devices,” Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, said on Wednesday in a conference call with analysts and investors. Like Qualcomm, Atheros is a major player in connecting devices to the Internet. Atheros specializes in Wi-Fi connectivity chips and installs its technology in a broad range of consumer devices, including laptops, home electronics and mobile devices, where it has started to gain market share. According to analysts, the addition of Atheros will significantly bolster Qualcomm’s Wi-Fi technology, which has been a glaring weakness in its portfolio. Qualcomm also has products for Bluetooth and GPS devices, but the bulk of its business is in 3G technology and the design of core chipset processors that allow cellphones to transmit data to radio towers and run applications. Although the technology industry has enjoyed strong deal activity in the last 12 months, particularly in the remote, or cloud, computing and data storage sectors, the semiconductor business has been relatively quiet. With several major companies holding significant cash, however, many analysts believe the pace of acquisitions will pick up in 2011. “Most chip companies are at record levels of profit margin, and if these cash-rich companies can go out and blow $3 billion and get 15 percent in pretax margins, the acquisitions can be very accretive” to earnings, said Gary Mobley, an analyst at the Benchmark Company. Qualcomm had $18 billion in cash as of the end of September; its rival Intel, which has become increasingly aggressive in the mobile sector, has $20 billion in cash. From a strategic standpoint, there is also a significant incentive for chip makers to consolidate. Global demand for mobile devices, in particular smartphones and tablet computers, is surging. The research firm International Data Corporation estimates that the smartphone market grew more than 55 percent in the last year, with 269.6 million units sold worldwide. Sales will most likely reach 330 million in 2011. This booming market for devices has intensified competition, as handset, chip makers and everyone else down the chain tries to secure a larger slice of the pie. Furthermore, as data needs grow and the number of connectivity technologies expand (like 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), companies will feel pressure to make acquisitions to compensate for holes in their product lines, said Anil Doradla, a research analyst at William Blair &amp; Company. “Within the semiconductor world, most of the mergers and acquisitions are centered around strengthening their ability to address the need for processing greater amounts of data along with the richness in applications,” he said. With hundreds of companies in the chip market, experts say, there are dozens of possible pairings. According to Mr. Doradla, the most likely acquisition candidates among small and midsize companies are Cavium Networks, Silicon Laboratories and NetLogic Microsystems. Like Atheros, Cavium Networks has networking and Bluetooth technology that goes into consumer electronics, like remote controls. Mr. Mobley of the Benchmark Company said his top picks included the acquisition of Entropic Communications by Intel or STMicroelectronics; a takeover of MIPS Technologies by Synopsys or ARM Holdings; or the purchase of EZchip Semiconductor by the Marvell Technology Group. According to Mr. Mobley, EZchip, which makes network processors, would complement Marvell’s portfolio of Ethernet switches. “You’re going to see an unprecedented amount of merger and acquisition in 2011, relative to anything we’ve seen before,” said Craig A. Ellis, an analyst at Caris &amp; Company.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/technology/companies/07qualcomm.html?ref=qualcomminc">Intel and Qualcomm Eye Each Other’s Terrain<date>Published: September 6, 2009</date><text>SAN DIEGO  The inside of computers has been Intel’s territory, as the world’s biggest maker of microprocessors reminds consumers with its “Intel Inside” campaign. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News Paul Jacobs, chief of Qualcomm, says that PCs have become so standardized that there is now more innovation in cellphones. Related Times Topics: Qualcomm Inc. | Intel Corporation Albert Gea/Reuters The T-Mobile G1, which uses Googles Android operating system and a Qualcomm chip. The cellphone’s guts have been the domain of Qualcomm. As the cellphone becomes more like a computer and the computer more like a cellphone, it was inevitable that the two chip makers would clash. Intel wants to get inside smartphones, and Qualcomm, one of the largest suppliers of chips for wireless phones, wants to get into small notebook computers. “Intel is trying to come down from the computer and bring their software ecosystem along,” said Qualcomm’s chief executive, Paul E. Jacobs. “We’re trying to go up from the phone and build the software ecosystem.” Qualcomm, which sells about 22 percent of all chips used in wireless devices including the iPhone, BlackBerry Storm and T-Mobile G1, believes it has never been better situated in its 24-year history to break into the market for computing devices. PCs are evolving into tablet PCs and small laptops, essentially big smartphones that are always on, always connected to the Internet, with all-day battery life  in short, very much like a large iPhone or BlackBerry. Qualcomm calls these devices smartbooks because the design resembles a large smartphone. Mr. Jacobs sees his company at the center of an industry that is driving the most cutting-edge innovations, as seen in devices like the iPhone and BlackBerry Storm. “That energy is now coming out of the phone industry,” Mr. Jacobs said. “The PC became so standardized that the degree of innovation was not the same as what you see in the phone space.” Intel, whose revenue is approximately triple Qualcomm’s, disagrees. “As mobile devices become smarter with PC-like performance, computer and Internet capabilities, this is Intel’s strength,” an Intel spokeswoman, Suzy Ramirez, said. Qualcomm is counting on its Snapdragon chip to power these devices. Developed by a team of former I.B.M. engineers who worked on the PowerPC microprocessor, it is the first chip of its kind to reach a speed of 1 gigahertz, a significant milestone for ARM, a processor design renowned for using so little power the device’s battery can last all day. Snapdragon is already being used by Toshiba in its ultra-thin TG01 smartphone that is being sold in Europe. More devices using Snapdragon are expected later this year, Mr. Jacobs says. Hardware alone will not win the battle, however. Qualcomm has been working with Google, which developed the Android operating system for cellphones. The fruit of this partnership was T-Mobile’s G1 phone, the first smartphone using Android and a Qualcomm chip. “There was a lot engineering back and forth,” Mr. Jacobs said. “The thing that we’re doing now is helping them scale. Because they have a relatively small team focused on evolving the operating system.” What may prove more significant than Android is software that Google will bring out next year: the Chrome operating system, which is intended for larger, computerlike devices to challenge laptops running Windows. Qualcomm is betting that Google becomes a major operating software company. “They’re onto what the future of computing is,” said Bill Davidson, Qualcomm’s senior vice president for global marketing and investor relations. “It’s about taking advantage of the computational power that already exists within the Internet.” He went on: “The whole push for Chrome is to have the much thinner, lighter, smaller client so that you don’t need as much memory to run this big honking OS,” he said, referring to Microsoft’s Windows operating software. The Qualcomm chip will be designed to work with Chrome to move some of the computing functions off the device to fast computers based in data centers, a model the industry calls cloud computing. “I think a hybrid model is the model that will work best, where there are certain applications that are downloaded on the device and they live there,” Mr. Jacobs said. “And other ones that are coming up and down through the cloud. We’ll support both.” It is not going to be a cakewalk to displace the most potent partnership  Microsoft and Intel  in the history of the personal computer. “One of the key issues is brand,” said Matthew Wilkins, principal analyst for compute platforms research, at the market researcher iSuppli. “Google Chrome OS, Android and ARM are not traditionally seen in PC retail stores. Therefore they will be competing against established and recognized brands: Intel, Microsoft and Windows.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on September 7, 2009, on page B4 of the New York edition.SAN DIEGO  The inside of computers has been Intel’s territory, as the world’s biggest maker of microprocessors reminds consumers with its “Intel Inside” campaign. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News Paul Jacobs, chief of Qualcomm, says that PCs have become so standardized that there is now more innovation in cellphones. Related Times Topics: Qualcomm Inc. | Intel Corporation Albert Gea/Reuters The T-Mobile G1, which uses Googles Android operating system and a Qualcomm chip. The cellphone’s guts have been the domain of Qualcomm. As the cellphone becomes more like a computer and the computer more like a cellphone, it was inevitable that the two chip makers would clash. Intel wants to get inside smartphones, and Qualcomm, one of the largest suppliers of chips for wireless phones, wants to get into small notebook computers. “Intel is trying to come down from the computer and bring their software ecosystem along,” said Qualcomm’s chief executive, Paul E. Jacobs. “We’re trying to go up from the phone and build the software ecosystem.” Qualcomm, which sells about 22 percent of all chips used in wireless devices including the iPhone, BlackBerry Storm and T-Mobile G1, believes it has never been better situated in its 24-year history to break into the market for computing devices. PCs are evolving into tablet PCs and small laptops, essentially big smartphones that are always on, always connected to the Internet, with all-day battery life  in short, very much like a large iPhone or BlackBerry. Qualcomm calls these devices smartbooks because the design resembles a large smartphone. Mr. Jacobs sees his company at the center of an industry that is driving the most cutting-edge innovations, as seen in devices like the iPhone and BlackBerry Storm. “That energy is now coming out of the phone industry,” Mr. Jacobs said. “The PC became so standardized that the degree of innovation was not the same as what you see in the phone space.” Intel, whose revenue is approximately triple Qualcomm’s, disagrees. “As mobile devices become smarter with PC-like performance, computer and Internet capabilities, this is Intel’s strength,” an Intel spokeswoman, Suzy Ramirez, said.

Qualcomm has suffered a series of legal setbacks in the dispute. In June 2007, Broadcom prevailed in a jury trial in federal court in California after it claimed that Qualcomm had violated three patents that include methods for transmitting high-speed data over cellphones. A week later, the United States International Trade Commission ruled that Qualcomm had violated a separate Broadcom patent that governed power management in cellphone chips. Broadcom asserted that Qualcomm was using the technology without paying licensing fees. Under the settlement announced Sunday night, the two companies said they were dismissing all litigation, including the infringement claims in the United States District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., the International Trade Commission, as well as Broadcom’s complaints to the European Commission and the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The companies also announced they had entered into a multiyear patent agreement but did not provide financial details of the arrangement. Qualcomm said it agreed to pay the first $200 million of the settlement in the quarter ending June 30. Don Rosenberg, general counsel for Qualcomm, said he approached Broadcom’s general counsel late last year and the two forged a relationship that led to heavy negotiations the last two weeks. Mr. Rosenberg said “both parties were clearly in the mood to put this behind us.” Ed Snyder, a telecommunications industry analyst with Charter Equity Research, said the agreement was good for both companies but said “clearly, Broadcom is coming out ahead.” Qualcomm said the agreement would not force it to change the model that it uses to license its own chip technology, which also had been in dispute. The argument involved chips made for so-called smartphones, the feature-rich devices that operate on third-generation, or 3G, networks. These devices have become particularly important for the cellphone industry as it seeks to find growth opportunities when most consumers already own phones.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Qualcomm Inc Go to your Portfolio » Now Pixtronix, Qualcomm and other companies are developing technologies intended to conserve battery life on handhelds as people spend ever more time not just talking and texting on them, but also browsing the Web and watching TV. A new color display in a prototype from Pixtronix uses energy-efficient LED bulbs, creating the image with thousands of tiny shutters that slide open and closed like digital pocket doors. New technology by Qualcomm takes advantage of natural light, reflecting the short, blue waves of daylight, for instance, and combining them in the same process that lets bluebirds glow with iridescent color in the sun. Energy efficiency is widely sought by manufacturers of mobile devices, said Paul Semenza, a senior vice president at DisplaySearch, a market research company in Austin, Tex. “Everybody is shooting for low-power color,” Mr. Semenza said. The screen technology from Pixtronix, a display company in Andover, Mass., is called PerfectLight. The company, which has been developing the technology internally since 2005, publicly demonstrated its first prototypes in late October. “We offer one-fourth the power consumption of a liquid crystal display,” said Mark Halfman, vice president for marketing at Pixtronix. PerfectLight prototypes have demonstrated use of fewer than 50 milliwatts for the backlighting of a smartphone display, in contrast to the 200 or so milliwatts required on a traditional LCD, he said. LCD, the current screen technology, is inefficient because it loses much of its optical energy as light passes through polarizers, filters and crystals, Mr. Semenza said. The polarizers can cut the intensity of light in half, and the color filters reduce it even more. Because so much energy is blocked or filtered this way, the backlighting must be extremely bright to create glowing colors. “You can end up with about a fifth of the optical energy that is put out by the backlight  or even less,” he said. That optical loss doesn’t occur in PerfectLight because the liquid crystals, polarizers and color filters of LCDs are eliminated, Mr. Halfman said. Instead, the image is created with thousands of digitally controlled, microelectro-mechanical system, or MEMS, shutters that open and close over each pixel opening, allowing light from the red, green and blue LEDs to pass through. “We have a single shutter for each pixel,” he said. A display in a cellphone might have 76,000 to 300,000 shutters for as many pixels. He says Pixtronix expects to license the lighting technology to display manufacturers. “Manufacturers will use our displays to gain a market differentiation in terms of power consumption” from standard LCD displays, he said. Qualcomm MEMS Technologies, a subsidiary of Qualcomm, the wireless chip maker in San Diego, also uses microelectro-mechanical systems in its new display technology called mirasol. (The name is based on the underlying technologies  “mira” for mirrors used in the devices, and “sol” for the sun used for lighting.) Unlike PerfectLight, though, the light for the pixels is provided not by LEDs, but by a far less expensive source: ambient light. To form the image, tiny mirrorlike optical structures in the MEMS selectively reflect red, green or blue light. The Qualcomm devices are fabricated not on silicon, as most MEMS are, but on glass, a far cheaper material, said Chris Chinnock, president of Insight Media, a market research company in Norwalk, Conn. He said that the color on the screen did not bleach in direct sunlight. “You take that display out in the sun and, by golly, it works fantastically,” he said. James Cathey, vice president for business development at Qualcomm MEMS Technologies, said that the reflective display would require very little power. “Because we can harness the ambient light, our technology is low-power, as low as one milliwatt,” he said. The Qualcomm displays may appear soon on beaches and ski slopes. Mirasol will be used in a waterproof MP3 player from Freestyle Audio of San Diego, said Lance Fried, founder and chairman. The player will cost $80 to $100, he said. Mirasol technology will also be used for the screen of an MP3 player integrated into a headphone to be sold by Skullcandy of Park City, Utah, said Tom Brady, director for marketing. The E Ink Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., which developed low-power, black-and-white electronic displays for many e-book readers, is also working on a color screen that, like Qualcomm’s, takes advantage of ambient light. One prototype has a flexible color display on a stainless steel backing. “Our color displays will be sunlight-readable,” said Sriram K. Peruvemba, vice president for marketing, and will require very little power to do their job. “Imagine,” he said, “if you are reading the newspaper on your laptop and stop to talk on the phone,” the newspaper shown on the laptop will consume power until you return. “With the technology we are building, though, you can lay down the display and talk” and not worry about draining the battery.

Connect is neither a business nor a philanthropy. It offers prospective biotechnology, telecommunications, computer software and electronics companies advice and programs that introduce them to investment and venture capital firms. It does not charge for those services, but it relies on contributions from 200 members, among them business, legal and financial people, as well as the directors of research institutes in the San Diego area like the Scripps Research Institute, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the Burnham Institute for Medical Research. This idea of combining scientific potential and financial heft was the brainchild of the founders of the Qualcomm Corporation, which became a telecommunications giant; Hybritech, a pioneering firm in biotechnology that is now owned by Eli Lilly; and Richard Atkinson, the president of the University of California, San Diego. In 1985, they formed Connect as an extension of the university to turn faculty ideas into commercial products. Connect did just that under the leadership of William Otterson, a computer executive who built the organization over 13 years, despite his long struggle with cancer, which ultimately took his life at age 69 in 1999. “Bill Otterson created the culture here, telling scientists and research people to share ideas and then compete in the marketplace,” said Mr. Roth, a pharmaceutical industry entrepreneur who took Connect’s reins in 2004.

As Mr. Muller recounts it, some of their work involved storing samples of genetic DNA and RNA, which requires preserving cell structures in freezers capable of extremely low temperatures. “For 80 years, we have stored tissue samples and cellular structures in freezers. The costs are huge  $60,000 a year at least for each freezer, and 500 university laboratories have hundreds of freezers to store 10,000 samples a week,” Mr. Muller said. The Mullers were studying small animals called tardigrades that exist in extreme environments, like the Sahara desert. Tardigrades can suspend their metabolism by dehydrating themselves and living in such a state for as long as 10 years. “They dry up completely but come back to life when you put them in water,” Mr. Muller explained. So, he said, he and his wife got to thinking: what if such a state could be duplicated technologically in a simple plastic matrix in which shrink-wrapped molecules are stored at room temperature, eliminating the need for freezers? Four years ago, they decided to give their idea a try. Mr. Muller kept his job at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies “to support our four children” while Judy Muller-Cohn left her job at a biotechnology firm to work at their new company. “We mortgaged the house, took the college money out of savings and threw it all in,” Mr. Muller said in a recent interview at Biomatrica’s headquarters while Mrs. Muller-Cohn was traveling.

The companies did not disclose the terms of the settlement. But they did say they have entered into a 15-year agreement in which Nokia has agreed to pay royalties to license technology developed by Qualcomm that improves phone performance and battery life, and reduces product size. The two companies had been at odds since April 2007, when the previous licensing agreement between them expired. Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, said that it should pay a lower royalty rate than it had been because it controlled important technology with its own patents. The case over the royalty disputes was scheduled to go to trial on Wednesday morning in Delaware Chancery Court. However, the judge in the case postponed the start of the trial until Thursday. Also on Wednesday, Qualcomm was scheduled to give its quarterly earnings review to investors, but delayed a conference call with securities analysts until Thursday morning. The company did report its financial results. It said net income for its third fiscal quarter was up 6 percent, to $748 million, from the quarter a year ago, on revenue of $2.8 billion, which was up 19 percent from a year ago. Qualcomm’s shares soared 18.7 percent in after-hours trading to $53.20, up from a $44.82 close in the regular session on Wednesday. Mark McKechnie, an industry analyst with American Technology Research, said the lawsuit and Nokia’s refusal to pay royalties had been a considerable drag on Qualcomm’s stock. The settlement is, he said, “probably a smart move for Nokia, but a lucrative move for Qualcomm.” He estimated that the settlement could mean as much as $400 million in royalties paid to Qualcomm next year. He said he derived that by estimating that Nokia could pay a 2 percent royalty fee on the 100 million phones equipped with Qualcomm technology that it is likely to sell next year. (Mr. McKechnie said that a 5 percent royalty arrangement is more typical in the industry.) “It’s pretty significant. It’s a big win for an American company,” Mr. McKechnie said of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. Mr. McKechnie said that the resolution could also save Qualcomm as much as $200 million a year in legal bills. Qualcomm declined to comment beyond a joint press release issued by the companies. As part of the settlement, Nokia said it had agreed to withdraw a complaint it made to the European Commission against Qualcomm and assign ownership of a number of patents to Qualcomm. “We believe that this agreement is positive for the industry, enabling the market to benefit from innovation and new technologies,” Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia’s chief executive, said in a press release. Mr. McKechnie said Nokia was well served to settle, as it had its hands full battling smartphone competitors, including Apple. “Nokia is facing increasing competition from smartphone competitors,” he said. “It can’t be messing around with legal battles with Qualcomm when going through massive industry transition.” More Articles in Technology »SAN FRANCISCO  Qualcomm and Nokia said on Wednesday they have settled a patent lawsuit with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake  the resolution coming just hours after the trial in the case was scheduled to start.

At a developer event in China, the company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will display a range of wireless Internet devices that Intel believes will fill a gap between smartphones and laptops. The company is hoping to capitalize on the success that Apple has had with its iPhone, which is one of the most popular mobile Web smartphones. Intel is calling the new computers Mobile Internet Devices, or MIDs, and claims that it will have a significant advantage over makers of chips for cellphones because the Intel version will be highly compatible with the company’s laptop and desktop processors for which most Web software is written today. The first generation of Intel’s MID technology will be aimed at data, not voice communications, leaving the company out of the market for smartphones. That has not damped the enthusiasm of Intel executives who foresee a proliferation of devices ranging from advanced ultracompact laptops to small, tablet-size devices that will be used for browsing the Web, navigation and Internet chat, rather than voice communications. “What enables the innovation is the ability to bring over all the existing PC applications,” said Anand Chandrasekher, general manager of the company’s Ultra Mobility Group. The weak link in the Intel strategy is that voice communication remains a significant factor for consumers choosing to buy hand-held devices. Intel backed out of the cellphone market two years ago when it sold its Xscale microprocessor business to the Marvell Technology Group. Intel then set out on an ambitious redesign project for ultralow-power versions of its PC-oriented X86 chips. The current system requires two chips, one for the processor and one for peripherals. It will take the company another technology generation to place everything on a single chip. That leads some analysts to believe that the company’s real breakthrough will not come until 2009 or 2010, when a new processor, now code-named Moorestown, arrives. “We’re pretty bullish on it with some qualifications,” said Van L. Baker, a research vice president at the Gartner Group, a market research firm. “We don’t believe they get there in a significant way until the next generation of technology.” Meanwhile, Intel’s strategy is moving the company toward a direct confrontation with Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chip maker that is also trying to deliver the wireless Internet on hand-held devices. The company, which refers to its strategy as “pocketable computing,” is offering a competing chip that offers lower power consumption and which is aimed for devices that blend voice and Internet data. “We need to deliver an Internet experience that is like the desktop,” said Sanjay Jha, Qualcomm’s chief operating officer. “People are used to the Internet, and you can’t shortchange them.” The new Intel mobile Internet strategy takes advantage of the company’s Atom microprocessor, which was announced in early March. The Atom will have performance roughly equivalent to laptop computers introduced four years ago, but will use little more than a half-a-watt to two-and-a-half watts of battery power. That is significantly lower than the 35 watts of power consumed by the company’s state-of-the-art microprocessors in today’s laptops. The new MIDs, which are scheduled to begin showing up in consumer electronics outlets in June, are the clearest evidence to date of the effort that Intel has made since its chief executive, Paul Otellini, set the company on a low-power strategy in 2005. In interviews, Intel executives said that the company was slightly ahead of the commitment Mr. Otellini made to bring out a line of lower-power processors before the end of the decade. Complicating life for Intel is the fact that the chip maker is locked out of the low-power cellphone and smartphone marketplace, which today is entirely based on microprocessor chips made by designs licensed from the British design firm ARM Ltd. to companies like Qualcomm. More than 10 billion ARM chips have been sold by more than 200 licensees, and ARM now says that more than eight million chips a day are being used in cellphones, smartphones and a wide range of hand-held consumer products. Until recently, early efforts by the PC industry to create so-called palmtop PCs, such as the Microsoft-inspired Ultra-Mobile PCs, have failed to find a broad consumer audience. Indeed, the entire P.D.A., or personal digital assistant, market is all but dead as many of its functions were overtaken by the smartphone. However, the category showed renewed signs of life last year when Asus, a Taiwanese equipment maker, made a name for itself by introducing the Eee PC, a two-pound Linux-based laptop that sells for $400. Now many of the mainstream PC makers are rushing to introduce similar laptops that fall well below the traditional PC laptop price, but allow Web surfing and many basic computing tasks. There is also renewed interest among consumer electronics makers in devices that are neither laptops or cellphones. Introducing products at the Intel event in Shanghai will be Asus, BenQ, Clarion, Fujitsu, Gigabyte, Lenovo, LG-E, NEC, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, WiBrain and Usi. Intel has also distanced itself from its traditionally close relationship with Microsoft and Windows by striking up a new partnership with Ubuntu and Red Flag, two distributors of Linux software for consumer markets. “Think of it as, ‘honey I shrunk the PC,’ ” said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a consumer electronics market research and consulting firm. “Intel is betting that this will be a win in China, which already has the world’s largest mobile phone market and therefore influences the rest of the world market.” More Articles in Technology »SAN FRANCISCO  Intel plans to proclaim Wednesday in Shanghai that the next big thing in consumer gadgets will be the “Internet in your pocket.” The challenge for the giant chip maker will be to prove that it is not too late to a market that has rapidly become the hottest spot in the consumer electronics business in a post-PC era.

McKelvey During a speech at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit last week, Mr. Mulally drew several parallels between the challenges at Ford and at Boeing, even referring to Boeing’s current work force at one point as “we.” He likened technology that would one day allow vehicles to self-diagnose problems to an airplane’s autopilot system, noting that planes can constantly be aware of their status and surroundings. And when asked about the future of Ford’s perennially money-losing British brands, Jaguar and Land Rover, which are for sale, Mr. Mulally offered this aeronautical assessment: “They’re ready to take off and go flying.” NICK BUNKLEY FEWER FREE APPLES In a move that might come to be known as the Al Gore rule, Apple is paring back the freebies for its outside directors. Until this year, Apple has given computers and other equipment it makes to its directors who are not executives of the company. Last year, Mr. Gore accepted free merchandise that was worth $15,245, more than double the value of products accepted by any of Apple’s five other outside directors, Apple’s latest proxy shows. (Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, accepted none.) Starting in 2008, the proxy says, Apple will limit the giveaways to directors to one of each new product it introduces. Beyond that, the proxy says, the directors can “purchase additional equipment at a discount.” Asked to explain the change, Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said, “We would like all of our directors to gain hands-on experience with each of our innovative products.” Kalee Kreider, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, declined to comment. PATRICK McGEEHAN QUALCOMM’S GUARDS Qualcomm spent about $265,000 last year to post guards at the homes of the company’s billionaire chairman, Irwin M. Jacobs, and its chief executive, Paul E. Jacobs. But the shareholders who were billed for the unusual protection may never know why. Qualcomm, which makes chip sets for cellphones, temporarily provided the guards to “address a potential threat” to the two men, according to the company’s latest proxy statement. The proxy provides no detail on the threat or whether the Jacobses, who are father and son, were even targets. It simply states that the protective action was taken after “an incident with another high-profile business executive in the same residential area.” Irwin Jacobs, who founded the company, is one of the most prominent residents of La Jolla, Calif., the affluent community where he has lived for decades in an oceanfront estate. A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to answer questions about the matter. PATRICK McGEEHAN A BUNDLE FROM BAUSCH Ronald L.

McKelvey During a speech at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit last week, Mr. Mulally drew several parallels between the challenges at Ford and at Boeing, even referring to Boeing’s current work force at one point as “we.” He likened technology that would one day allow vehicles to self-diagnose problems to an airplane’s autopilot system, noting that planes can constantly be aware of their status and surroundings. And when asked about the future of Ford’s perennially money-losing British brands, Jaguar and Land Rover, which are for sale, Mr. Mulally offered this aeronautical assessment: “They’re ready to take off and go flying.” NICK BUNKLEY FEWER FREE APPLES In a move that might come to be known as the Al Gore rule, Apple is paring back the freebies for its outside directors. Until this year, Apple has given computers and other equipment it makes to its directors who are not executives of the company. Last year, Mr. Gore accepted free merchandise that was worth $15,245, more than double the value of products accepted by any of Apple’s five other outside directors, Apple’s latest proxy shows. (Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, accepted none.) Starting in 2008, the proxy says, Apple will limit the giveaways to directors to one of each new product it introduces. Beyond that, the proxy says, the directors can “purchase additional equipment at a discount.” Asked to explain the change, Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said, “We would like all of our directors to gain hands-on experience with each of our innovative products.” Kalee Kreider, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, declined to comment. PATRICK McGEEHAN QUALCOMM’S GUARDS Qualcomm spent about $265,000 last year to post guards at the homes of the company’s billionaire chairman, Irwin M. Jacobs, and its chief executive, Paul E. Jacobs. But the shareholders who were billed for the unusual protection may never know why. Qualcomm, which makes chip sets for cellphones, temporarily provided the guards to “address a potential threat” to the two men, according to the company’s latest proxy statement. The proxy provides no detail on the threat or whether the Jacobses, who are father and son, were even targets. It simply states that the protective action was taken after “an incident with another high-profile business executive in the same residential area.” Irwin Jacobs, who founded the company, is one of the most prominent residents of La Jolla, Calif., the affluent community where he has lived for decades in an oceanfront estate. A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to answer questions about the matter. PATRICK McGEEHAN A BUNDLE FROM BAUSCH Ronald L. Zarrella, the chief executive of the eye care company Bausch &amp; Lomb, retired last week with a tidy pay packet. Last October, the company was bought by the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, and Mr. Zarrella, 58, received $30 million for his outstanding share options. He will receive an additional $10 million for his severance package and become chairman emeritus.

Cellphones in Hell Skip to next paragraph Richard Barnes for The New York Times Flipped Phones Top: Reclaimed keypads. Bottom: Parts of reclaimed phones; the metal will be recycled. Americans threw out just shy of three million tons of household electronics in 2006. This so-called e-waste is the fastest-growing part of the municipal waste stream and, depending on your outlook, either an enormous problem or a bonanza. E-waste generally contains substances that, though safely sequestered during each product’s use, can become hazardous if not handled properly when disposed. Those products also hold bits of precious metals like silver, copper, platinum and gold. The Belgian company Umicore is in the business of reclaiming those materials. It extracts 17 metals from our unwanted televisions, computers and cellphones and from more ominous-sounding industrial byproducts like drosses and anode slimes. Umicore harvests silver from spent photo-developing solutions collected at American big-box stores and sells it to Italian jewelers. The company describes its work as “aboveground mining.” Umicore has roots in actual mining. In the late 1800s, during the reign of King Leopold II, the firm mined copper in the African Congo and shipped it to a riverside smelter near Antwerp. Today the same property houses a sprawling, state-of-the-art $2 billion smelter and refinery. Here, metals are recovered and processed. Then they are sold, sometimes to Asia, where they are used to manufacture brand-new electronics. It’s a reshuffling of the colonial arrangement: an abundant resource is sent from richer countries to poorer ones, made into goods, then sent back. That resource is our garbage. Umicore’s smelter was burning furiously at 2,116 degrees Fahrenheit one afternoon last fall. Two heavy-set men in blue overalls sat in the control room, staring expressionlessly through heat-shielded windows. They were eye-level with the mouth of the smelter  a pit 13 feet wide by 46 feet deep. A conveyor belt fed shredded circuit boards and scrap into the fire in a dim, fast blur. I imagined the black-and-white television in my mother’s basement, or my first blue Nokia cellphone  all the devices I’d gotten close to and outgrown  spilling out and squealing like lobsters in a pot. The metals exit the smelter’s base as a glowing sludge. It streams into another caldron the height of a house. From there, it moves into tanks of acid. The acid is electrocuted. As electricity flows through the mixture, copper accumulates on the tank’s end plate. I watched a giant claw move across the ceiling, rip out the plate and, with a violent whack, cleave off a gleaming layer of 99.9 percent pure copper, with the unmistakable sheen of a new penny. It was thrilling to see something so clean and recognizable emerge from such an alien process. After explaining the final stages, Thierry Van Kerckhoven, Umicore’s e-scrap manager, handed me another of the end products from this process: a one-kilogram bar of gold. It felt the way I thought it would, based on what you see in the movies: substantial, mesmerizing. It was worth about $24,000. “This gold is recycled gold,” Kerckhoven said. “This gold is green gold.” Recycling feels good because we imagine it as just this kind of alchemy  which Umicore achieves with impressive environmental controls. The centerpiece is a monstrous gas-cleaning-and-filtration system that captures and neutralizes enough of the carcinogenic and endocrine-altering chemicals produced from melting e-waste, according to Umicore, that the faint yellow emission finally released from its smokestack easily surpasses the European Union’s air-quality standards. (Martin Hojsik, who campaigns against toxics for Greenpeace International, notes that the process followed by Umicore and its few, similarly equipped competitors around the world is “not entirely clean” but still “the preferable solution” for recovering metals from e-waste.) Ultimately, by weight, only 1/2 of 1 percent of the e-waste Umicore takes in cannot be safely sent back into the world in a usable form. “There is often a discussion of separating what is valuable from what is toxic,” Christian Hagelüken, Umicore’s senior manager of business development, told me. “But sometimes they are the same thing.” This may never be more true than for cellphones. They are the most valuable form of e-waste. Each one contains about a dollar’s worth of precious metals, mostly gold. And while single phones house far less hazardous material than a computer  an old, clunky monitor can incorporate seven pounds of lead  their cumulative presence is staggering. Last year, according to ABI Research, 1.2 billion phones were sold worldwide. Sixty percent of them probably replaced existing ones. In the United States, phones are cast aside after, on average, 12 months. And according to the industry trade group CTIA, four out of every five people in the country own cellphones. Umicore estimates that, together with its competitors, it received only 1 percent of all phones that were discarded globally in 2006. “This of course is a lousy percentage,” Hagelüken said. “Computers are also bad, but phones are the worst.” Our obliviousness has mostly kept them from being recycled at all. When we do bother, we may not know, or be able to control, where the “recycled” phones go. Many enter a secondhand market in the developing world through a receding series of middlemen. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next Page » Jon Mooallem, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about the science and commerce of sleep.

Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, the maker of chips for mobile phones, insisted it was pure coincidence that he found himself within a few blocks of where the iPhone was introduced to France on Wednesday. But though the iPhone, the cellphone-media player from Apple, has no Qualcomm components, Mr. Jacobs generously gave it credit for making consumers more eager for third-generation cellphone networks. The 3G technology  which Qualcomm designs and licenses  allows cellphone Internet browsing that is comparable in speed to broadband on a desktop computer. But the iPhone, which the French operator Orange put on sale Wednesday, does not support 3G. The current version, now available in Britain, Germany, France and the United States, uses a technology called Edge that speeds second-generation network data transfers. Apple has already said it intends to offer a 3G iPhone in the future. “There’s no doubt in my mind that a really positive effect of the iPhone was to focus mainstream people on the idea of using their device for data,” Mr. Jacobs, who is based in San Diego, said during a visit to Paris to see customers and government officials. “But it also caused mainstream consciousness that 3G is really a good thing to have because it will make your experience better. “Qualcomm could have spent huge amounts of money advertising 3G and not gotten the point across as well as the iPhone has,” he said. Although Orange had said that its iPhone plans would offer unlimited Internet access, the company disclosed clear limits Wednesday. The iPhone cannot be used with Internet phone services like Skype; it cannot be used as a modem for a personal computer and it cannot be used to connect to peer-to-peer networks. Orange also reserved the right to limit subscribers who download more than 500 megabytes of data a month. It said it would sell an unlocked version of the iPhone for 649 euros ($950), with an additional 100-euro unlocking fee, along with a 399-euro model with a two-year Orange contract. Simon Treille, the first to buy an iPhone in France at the Champs-Élysées Orange store, said it would change the mobile Internet. “It’s like a PC screen but you always have it in your pocket,” said Mr. Treille, who works at jechange.fr, a Web site for comparison shopping. Despite the hundreds of billions of euros that European companies and governments invested in 3G at the turn of the century, it is only now beginning to attract wide use, a situation that has led some to call the transition from GSM, the 2G technology, a failure. But Mr. Jacobs pointed to many signs of success for 3G. Some operators, like Orange and Telstra, in Australia, are reporting that for the first time, the revenue they generate from data use is more than that from text messaging, for instance. Worldwide, the company says, 60 million 3G phones were sold last year, and it estimates that the number will grow to 90 million by the end of this year. Hewlett-Packard recently signed on to offer Gobi, a new Qualcomm design that puts two kinds of 3G networking into one for use in laptops. Mr. Jacobs said to expect a series of similar announcements from other computer makers. Mr. Jacobs also said that he felt “pretty good” about the progress of the company’s legal battles with Nokia over royalty payments and was confident about Qualcomm’s antitrust case before the European Commission. In October, the European Commission opened a formal investigation into whether Qualcomm was overcharging its business partners for using patents that are essential to 3G.

If successful, the effort will usher in new mobile devices that as the iPhone has done, will make it easier to use the Internet on the go. The phones, which would run on software that Google would give away to phone makers, could be cheaper and easier to customize. And by giving outside software developers full access to a Google-powered phones functions, the alliance members hope for a proliferation of new PC-style programs and services, like social networking and video sharing. Were human beings and we communicate, and thats what the Internet social network phenomenon is all about, said Robert Pepper, a former policy chief at the Federal Communications Commission. The Internet is going mobile, and its not just top down, its one-to-one and many-to-many all at the same time, and thats what the Google guys get. With the move, Google is trying to alter the dynamics of yet another industry. It is already using its deep pockets and innovative technology to shake up television, book publishing, computer software and advertising. But while Googles much-anticipated plan has encouraged talk of a Google Phone, the company said that for now it had no plans to build phones. Instead, it has signed up powerful partners to develop and market the phones, including handset makers like Motorola and Samsung, carriers like T-Mobile, Sprint and China Mobile and semiconductor companies like Qualcomm and Intel. The group, the Open Handset Alliance, expects to start selling the Google-powered phones in the second half of next year. Analysts were quick to point out that impressive telecommunications and computing alliances had been proposed many times in recent decades and had often had little impact. And the alliances software, which is not yet complete, would face competition from established rivals, like Microsoft, Nokia, Palm and Research in Motion. Im not convinced, said Chetan Sharma, a technology consultant who tracks the wireless data industry. Its a pretty impressive list of people in the group, but it takes a long time to get things into the ecosystem. However, the strength of Googles brand with consumers, as well as the open-source strategy that will make the phone software freely available and customizable, make it difficult to discount Googles potential impact. For Google, the initiative is an ambitious push to take its overwhelming dominance of advertising on PC screens onto wireless devices. The company has been frustrated at the limited availability of its services on mobile phones, whose features and software are largely controlled by carriers and handset makers. By courting programmers, Google hopes to give the phones abilities that users demand and carriers find difficult to resist. The idea is that just as spreadsheets, word processors, video games and other software tools turned the personal computer into an everyday appliance, the emergence of new mobile applications can spur wider adoption of so-called smartphones. More use of the Web, whether on PCs or on phones, benefits Google because its advertising systems have such broad reach. Software developers will build applications that do amazing things on the Internet and on mobile phones as well, Eric E. Schmidt, Googles chief executive, said at a news conference. Googles stock hit a record of $730.23 on Monday before closing at $725.65, up 2 percent. The 34-member Open Handset Alliance also includes mobile phone operators like NTT DoCoMo and KDDI of Japan and Telecom Italia of Italy, the phone makers HTC and LG and chip makers like Broadcom and Texas Instruments. EBay, which owns the Internet calling service Skype, and Nuance Communications, which makes voice recognition software, are also members. The list of powerful partners illustrates the substantial inroads that Google has made in the highly competitive industry, as well the challenges it still faces. For example, the two largest cellular carriers in the United States, AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, which together account for 52 percent of the market, are not part of the alliance. While a Verizon spokesman said the company had not ruled out the possibility of joining, an AT&amp;T spokesman, Mark Siegel, said AT&amp;T had no plans to participate. Googles announcement is about what is going to happen in the future, and our focus is about delivering the goods today, Mr. Siegel said. Apple executives declined to comment on the Google announcement. However, an Apple spokesman noted that its chairman, Steven P. Jobs, said recently that the company planned to allow programmers to write applications for the iPhone, beginning in February. Alliance members said they had high hopes for the project. Just like the iPhone energized the industry, this is a different way to energize the industry, said Sanjay K. Jha, chief operating officer of Qualcomm, which makes chips used in wireless phones. Mr. Jha said the Google technology would bring better Internet capabilities to moderately priced phones. He also said innovation could accelerate, as developers would be able to enhance the software, which is based on the Linux operating system, as they saw fit. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology »SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5  What Apple began with its iPhone, Google is hoping to accelerate, with an ambitious plan to transform the software at the heart of cellphones.

Houses burned with no firefighters in sight as emergency crews on the ground and in the air struggled to keep up with shifting wind that fanned new fires and made others recede and reignite.

He roamed the parking lot of a mall in Escondido, carrying two large plastic bottles in search of water. I have a feeling its probably gone, Mr. Gallagher said of his home. About 1,500 National Guard troops, including 200 diverted from the border, were deployed to help with evacuation and crowd control, mostly in the San Diego area, which appeared to be the hardest hit. There, seven fires intensified and forced the largest evacuation ever in San Diego County, including entire towns like Ramona and Rancho Santa Fe in the rustic northern stretches. A total of 250,000 people were urged to evacuate. Nearly 600 homes and 100 commercial buildings have burned in Southern California, most in San Diego County. Late Monday, about 15,100 were considered threatened. State emergency officials said they feared that the fires, devouring some of the thickest and driest brush in years, could surpass the destruction of 2003, when California experienced its worst fire season on record. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who had declared a state of emergency in seven counties on Sunday, said President Bush had called to offer federal assistance with the blazes, which could take several days to extinguish.

San Diego is particularly haunted by wildfires. The worst one in state history burned nearly 750,000 acres in 2003, destroyed 3,600 homes and other buildings, and killed 24 people across Southern California, with much of the damage and more than a dozen of the deaths in San Diego County. Officials there said those memories prompted swift action this time as the latest fire burned in much of the same area and same direction as 2003. The San Diego Wild Animal Park, a major tourist draw, was closed and the animals were moved to safer quarters while owners of horses throughout northern San Diego also rushed to save their animals. Because of the fires erratic nature, state officials had difficulty compiling accurate data on the scope of the damage or progress in controlling them. Just as state officials at a midmorning news conference in Malibu were declaring a fire in suburban Los Angeles the states top priority, San Diego officials were issuing sweeping evacuation orders and television showed images of scores of buildings burning in a remote area of Los Angeles. The hot, gusting winds, not expected to let up until late Tuesday, at times grounded fire-fighting airplanes, which are pivotal for their ability to dump tremendous amounts of water and fire retardant. We have to just pray the wind slows down because the wind is the No. 1 enemy in the dry weather, Mr. Schwarzenegger said in Malibu, where a large fire destroyed landmarks Sunday and flared anew after dying down somewhat overnight. Some of the fires appeared to have been started by downed power lines, but a few were thought to have been caused by arson. Brush and small trees burned in most cases, but firefighters faced a difficult problem northeast of Los Angeles at the Lake Arrowhead resort, where a forest fire erupted early in the afternoon and added to the plume of smoke hanging over most of the region.

Agency Gives Boost to WiMax<date>Published: October 20, 2007</date><text>PARIS, Oct. 19  The United Nations telecommunications agency in Geneva gave the upstart technology called WiMax a vote of approval, providing a sizable victory for Intel and something of a defeat for competing technologies from Qualcomm and Ericsson. The International Telecommunication Unions radio assembly agreed late Thursday to include WiMax, a wireless technology that allows Internet and other data connections across much broader areas than Wi-Fi, as part of what is called the third-generation family of mobile standards. That endorsement opens the way for many of the unions member countries to devote a part of the public radio spectrum to WiMax, and receivers for it could be built into laptop computers, phones, music players and other portable devices. Unlike Wi-Fi, this mobile Internet technology can hand off a signal from antenna to antenna, thus allowing a device to hold a connection while in motion. WiMax potentially can move data at 70 megabits a second across 65 kilometers, or 40 miles. Current fixed-line broadband connections have speeds of about 2 megabits a second. The approval, which came in the form of a consensus of the radio assembly ahead of the World Radiocommunication Conference next week in Geneva, gives WiMax a leg up on Ultra Mobile Broadband, an alternative technology from Qualcomm, and Long-Term Evolution, an equivalent from Ericsson. Intel has been promoting and investing in WiMax for the last three years and led a pretty substantial amount of lobbying to prove its case and get the unions stamp on the technology, said Sriram Viswanathan, vice president of Intel Capital, the companys strategic investment program, and general manager of its WiMax business. The radio technology is the first to be added to the specifications for third-generation radio standards since the union approved them a decade ago. Even before the unions endorsement, WiMax had been gathering momentum with Intels weight behind it. Lenovo, Acer and a few other makers of personal computers recently committed to using Intels WiMax chips, which are expected to reach the market in May. Nokia said last month that it would make its N-series of tablet devices with WiMax when they go on sale next year. Japan, Britain and Switzerland have scheduled auctions in the coming months to allocate licenses in the radio frequency in which WiMax operates, 2.5 to 2.69 gigahertz. But WiMax is not universally cheered. Gary D. Forsee resigned as chief executive of Sprint Nextel last week amid doubts about his strategy, which includes $5 billion to roll out a commercially unproven WiMax network. Sprint Nextels WiMax partner, Clearwire, introduced an access card this week for laptops for its high-speed network. Qualcomm said Friday that it "remains dedicated" to providing the technologies, including WiMax, that its operators choose. Sphere: Related Blogs &amp; Articles More Articles in Technology »PARIS, Oct. 19  The United Nations telecommunications agency in Geneva gave the upstart technology called WiMax a vote of approval, providing a sizable victory for Intel and something of a defeat for competing technologies from Qualcomm and Ericsson. The International Telecommunication Unions radio assembly agreed late Thursday to include WiMax, a wireless technology that allows Internet and other data connections across much broader areas than Wi-Fi, as part of what is called the third-generation family of mobile standards. That endorsement opens the way for many of the unions member countries to devote a part of the public radio spectrum to WiMax, and receivers for it could be built into laptop computers, phones, music players and other portable devices. Unlike Wi-Fi, this mobile Internet technology can hand off a signal from antenna to antenna, thus allowing a device to hold a connection while in motion. WiMax potentially can move data at 70 megabits a second across 65 kilometers, or 40 miles. Current fixed-line broadband connections have speeds of about 2 megabits a second. The approval, which came in the form of a consensus of the radio assembly ahead of the World Radiocommunication Conference next week in Geneva, gives WiMax a leg up on Ultra Mobile Broadband, an alternative technology from Qualcomm, and Long-Term Evolution, an equivalent from Ericsson. Intel has been promoting and investing in WiMax for the last three years and led a pretty substantial amount of lobbying to prove its case and get the unions stamp on the technology, said Sriram Viswanathan, vice president of Intel Capital, the companys strategic investment program, and general manager of its WiMax business. The radio technology is the first to be added to the specifications for third-generation radio standards since the union approved them a decade ago. Even before the unions endorsement, WiMax had been gathering momentum with Intels weight behind it. Lenovo, Acer and a few other makers of personal computers recently committed to using Intels WiMax chips, which are expected to reach the market in May. Nokia said last month that it would make its N-series of tablet devices with WiMax when they go on sale next year. Japan, Britain and Switzerland have scheduled auctions in the coming months to allocate licenses in the radio frequency in which WiMax operates, 2.5 to 2.69 gigahertz. But WiMax is not universally cheered. Gary D. Forsee resigned as chief executive of Sprint Nextel last week amid doubts about his strategy, which includes $5 billion to roll out a commercially unproven WiMax network.

The regulatory agency said an in-depth investigation would be conducted as ''a matter of priority.'' The move does not imply that the commission has conclusive proof of an infringement, it added. In October 2005, six telecommunications companies accused Qualcomm of breaking antitrust laws in its licensing of mobile phone technology. The companies -- Broadcom, Ericsson, NEC, Nokia, Panasonic Mobile Communications and Texas Instruments -- said Qualcomm's royalty fees for next-generation mobile phone chips were excessive, breaking a series of agreements to keep fees at reasonable levels. Qualcomm makes chips for cellphones and charges royalties to handset makers and chip makers that use technology covered by its patents. The investigation focuses on whether the licensing terms and royalties imposed by Qualcomm are ''fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory,'' the commission said. The inquiry is the first major antitrust investigation the commission is undertaking after its landmark victory against Microsoft in September. If the commission finds against Qualcomm, it could force the company to change its licensing practices and fine it as much as 10 percent of its annual revenue. The six complainants welcomed the development in the investigation, saying that they were concerned that Qualcomm's practices were ''harmful to the mobile telecommunications industry globally,'' resulting in higher prices and less choice for carriers and consumers alike. Qualcomm argues, however, that its licensing practices have not harmed the end customers, as prices have declined over the two-year period of the investigation.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/technology/26qualcomm.html?ref=qualcomminc">Qualcomm Forecast<date>Published: September 26, 2007</date><text>Qualcomm raised its profit forecast for the fourth quarter yesterday, citing higher-than-expected shipments of its chip sets for more cellular phones.

Skip to next paragraph Related European Court's Judgment in Microsoft Case Managing Globalization Brussels, the regulatorGo to Blog » Enlarge This Image Jean-Christophe Verhaegen/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images Peer Hellstrom a lawyer who argued against Microsoft. Software and legal experts said the European ruling might signal problems for companies like Apple, Intel and Qualcomm, whose market dominance in online music downloads, computer chips and mobile phone technology is also being scrutinized by the European Commission. The decision is a strong endorsement for what in the United States would be considered aggressive policy on dominant firms, said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. And thats going to continue to play out in other kinds of cases. The 13-member European Court of First Instance, in a starkly worded summary of the 244-page decision, reaffirmed that Microsoft had abused its market power by adding a digital media player to Windows, undercutting the early leader, Real Networks. It also ordered Microsoft to obey a March 2004 commission order to share confidential computer code with competitors. The court also upheld the record fine levied against the company, 497.2 million euros ($689.4 million). But the court decision comes as the center of gravity in computing is shifting away from the software for personal computers, Microsofts stronghold. Increasingly, the e-mailing or word-processing functions of a computer can be performed with software delivered on a Web browser. Other devices like cellphones are now used as alternates to personal computers. The real challenge to Microsoft, after more than a decade of dominating the technology industry, is coming not from the government, but from the marketplace. The direct impact on Microsoft is small, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. But there may be a longer-range consequence of having Microsoft under constant, open-ended scrutiny from Europe. If you end up handicapping a major player in new markets, you may actually not enhance competition but hinder it, and help create new monopolies, Mr. Yoffie said. The obvious example is Google in Internet search and Apple in digital music. Indeed, the Justice Department issued a statement expressing its concerns with the European decision, saying that tough restraints on powerful companies can be harmful. Thomas O. Barnett, assistant attorney general for the departments antitrust division, said that the effect rather than helping consumers, may have the unfortunate consequence of harming consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition. Consumer welfare, not protecting competitors, should be the guiding standard in antitrust, Mr. Barnett said. Antitrust enforcement has often been criticized as too slow to grapple with fast-moving high-technology markets. Indeed, the media player market changed drastically during the years-long investigation in Europe. When the European Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows in Europe without its media player, but at no difference in price, few people wanted the stripped-down version of Windows. Still, the Luxembourg courts ruling poses a threat to Microsofts traditional way of doing business by bundling new features and products into its Windows operating system. The court decision sets a precedent, at least from Europe. For example, if Microsoft wants to put handwriting- and speech-recognition features or stronger security software into Windows, European authorities might listen to competitors complaints. In the United States, the Justice Department chose to settle the Microsoft antitrust case in 2001 without challenging the companys freedom to put whatever it wants in its operating system. Microsofts allies said the courts decision would have a chilling effect on the business strategies of many global technology companies. This ruling is certainly going to introduce a lot of uncertainty, said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a Washington-based group that supported Microsoft in its legal case in Europe. What the court is basically saying is that if you develop a successful product and get too big, the European Commission is going to force you to give away your intellectual property. The European rulings widest impact on technology companies, legal and industry experts say, will probably be on Microsofts ability to guard some of its intellectual property in software for servers. Server software, running on data center computers, powers corporate networks and the Web. The court upheld the commissions order that Microsoft must share technical information with competitors so their server software works smoothly with Microsofts Windows desktop. The order applies only to Europe, but Microsoft may have a difficult time containing the impact to the European market only. Because the Internet runs on server software, industry analysts say the courts ruling could have a lasting impact. The Internet has opened a really good door for the industry and society to walk through to enjoy a far more rapid pace of innovation and growth than in personal computing, where Microsoft controls things, said Timothy F. Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford University and a senior official in the Justice Departments antitrust division during the Clinton administration. Europe is pushing to ensure that the higher pace of innovation on the server is allowed to continue. Bradford L. Smith, the general counsel for Microsoft, who was present for the reading, said the company would follow the ruling but did not say specifically whether the company would appeal it. In a statement issued by the company, Mr. Smith said: I would note that a lot has changed since this case started in 1998. The world has changed, the industry has changed, and our company has changed. The decision followed a five-day hearing on the issues under appeal in April 2006. Microsoft had indicated in the past that it would appeal any negative ruling to the European Court of Justice, the highest court in Europe. But an appeal by the company, a process likely to take at least two years, would focus only on whether the appellate court erred in procedure and points of law in reaching its decision, not on the facts in the case. Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels that while the decision set an important precedent, the judgment is bittersweet because the court has confirmed the commissions view that consumers are suffering at the hands of Microsoft. In the course of the case, which began with a complaint in 1998, Ms. Kroes noted that Microsofts share of the market in server software has risen sharply and that Windows Media Player has come to dominate the market. She highlighted the fact that Microsoft has 95 percent of the world market for desktop operating systems and said she would like to see this shrink. You cant draw a line and say exactly 50 percent is correct, but a significant drop in market share is what we would like to see, she said. Microsoft cannot regulate the market by imposing its products and its services on people. Kevin J.

Qualcomm, which has suffered a handful of legal setbacks recently, said that its general counsel, Louis M. Lupin, was taking personal leave and would step down as the lead lawyer, although he would remain with the company in some capacity. The decision to resign was wholly personal and the company did not ask him to leave, Qualcomm said. The company said his duties would be assumed by Carol C. Lam, a former United States attorney in Southern California who joined Qualcomm this year. Qualcomm is facing a number of high-profile legal challenges at home and abroad. Overseas, it continues to face anticompetition complaints from the European Commission and Korea, industry analysts said. In the United States, it is embroiled in litigation and hostile negotiations with a number of companies, including Broadcom and a longtime partner, Nokia. In the multipronged dispute with Broadcom, a federal judge last week admonished Qualcomms lawyers for withholding evidence during a trial that concluded in January. Also last week, the Bush administration upheld an earlier ruling that required Qualcomm to pay royalties to use power management technology covered by a patent controlled by Broadcom. Things are not going well for Qualcomm on the legal front, said Edward Snyder, an industry analyst with Charter Equity Research. He said he believed that the setbacks and continuing disputes could significantly weaken the companys market position. Qualcomms legal challenges continue today in a federal court in Santa Ana, Calif. The court is scheduled to begin considering what penalties and remedies to apply in a jury case that Qualcomm lost in June in which it was accused of violating three Broadcom patents. The company also is in the midst of negotiations with Nokia, which is refusing to pay royalties to Qualcomm. Nokia asserts that its license agreement has ended and that it is entitled to renegotiate, hoping for terms that will allow it to pay considerably lower fees. Qualcomm continues to be in a powerful position, however, given that it controls patents for technology used in many of the worlds cellphones. Given that the company relies heavily on intellectual property, it is not unusual for Qualcomm to be involved in legal disputes, but the last 12 months have been particularly intense, said Paul Sagawa, an industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Mr. Sagawa said he believed that both the Broadcom and Nokia issues would be resolved without doing long-term damage to Qualcomm and that the company remained on strong financial footing. But he said the string of legal setbacks may have contributed to Mr. Lupins departure, despite the companys statement that the decision was personal. I wouldnt be surprised if there was a mutual parting of the ways, he said.

The court is scheduled to begin considering what penalties and remedies to apply in a jury case that Qualcomm lost in June in which it was accused of violating three Broadcom patents. The company also is in the midst of negotiations with Nokia, which is refusing to pay royalties to Qualcomm. Nokia asserts that its license agreement has ended and that it is entitled to renegotiate, hoping for terms that will allow it to pay considerably lower fees. Qualcomm continues to be in a powerful position, however, given that it controls patents for technology used in many of the worlds cellphones. Given that the company relies heavily on intellectual property, it is not unusual for Qualcomm to be involved in legal disputes, but the last 12 months have been particularly intense, said Paul Sagawa, an industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Mr. Sagawa said he believed that both the Broadcom and Nokia issues would be resolved without doing long-term damage to Qualcomm and that the company remained on strong financial footing. But he said the string of legal setbacks may have contributed to Mr. Lupins departure, despite the companys statement that the decision was personal. I wouldnt be surprised if there was a mutual parting of the ways, he said.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/business/11broadcom.html?ref=qualcomminc">Judge Sides With Broadcom in Qualcomm Patent Fight<date>Published: August 11, 2007</date><text>LOS ANGELES, Aug. 10 (Bloomberg News)  The Broadcom Corporation was tentatively awarded $39.3 million in damages and legal fees on Friday in a patent dispute with a rival chip maker, Qualcomm, after a federal judge upheld a jury verdict that Qualcomm had infringed three patents.

Qualcomm, which makes chips used in many mobile phones, has argued that the ruling, made in June by the United States International Trade Commission, could lead to a ban on the importation of millions of new phones that use power management technology covered in a patent controlled by Broadcom. But serious disruption in the phone market is unlikely, said Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, in upholding the ruling. Ms. Schwab noted that since the June ruling, two major mobile phone carriers have reached agreements to pay licensing fees to Broadcom, allowing them to bring the latest phones into the country. Ms. Schwab also noted that Broadcom had agreed to give a royalty-free license to public safety organizations using new phones, a move that she said ameliorated Qualcomm’s claim that Broadcom’s demand for fees could hamper public safety. The decision is a blow to Qualcomm, based in San Diego, which is a dominant maker of chips for phones used on mobile phone networks operated by Verizon Wireless, Sprint and AT&amp;T. Qualcomm has argued that the licensing fees of $6 a phone that Broadcom demanded were prohibitively expensive. Broadcom, a chip maker based in Irvine, Calif., has countered that Qualcomm is using its power- management technology without paying royalties. Broadcom has sued Qualcomm over the issue, but the suit was stayed pending a decision by the trade representative. Lou Lupin, general counsel for Qualcomm, said the company planned to appeal for an emergency stay of the ruling to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. “We’re obviously disappointed but not terribly surprised,” Mr. Lupin said of the decision. He said Qualcomm’s argument that the June ruling would hamper public safety appeared to have been at least partly undermined by Broadcom’s agreements with the two mobile carriers. Verizon reached a deal with Broadcom last month. The other company has not been publicly identified. David Rosmann, vice president for intellectual property litigation at Broadcom, said the company would seek an immediate enforcement of the ruling that would bar the importing of phones with unlicensed Broadcom technology. Mr. Rosmann said such a ban would probably affect fewer than 10 percent of phones, and only new models that are not yet on the market. Mark McKechnie, a telecommunications equipment industry analyst with American Technology Research, said it was in the interest of consumers for Qualcomm and Broadcom to reach an agreement. “It’s going to slow down the ramp of U.S. technology if it holds,” Mr. McKechnie said.

The agreement will give Verizon Wireless the right to use a patent found to have been infringed by Qualcomm, the companies said in a statement yesterday. Verizon Communications and the Vodafone Group jointly own Verizon Wireless. Broadcom won a trade ruling last month against Qualcomm in its bid to prevent phone companies from using the chips, which allow phones to surf the Internet and download video, without paying royalties. The agreement allows Verizon to introduce the latest mobile phones and hands Qualcomm another setback in its two-year dispute over the technology. Verizon is paying $6 a handset, to a maximum of $200 million. Broadcom offered similar terms to Qualcomm last month to settle their dispute. Qualcomm rejected the offer. ''It's a great strategic move for Broadcom,'' said Michael Cohen, an analyst at Pacific American Securities, who owns Qualcomm shares. ''It gets them up to $200 million and at the same time strips away a powerful political ally from Qualcomm.'' Shares of Broadcom rose $1.63, to $33.99, on Nasdaq. Qualcomm shares dropped $1.75, to $43.35. Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, is scheduled to decide by Aug. 6 whether to ban handsets that have Qualcomm's newest chips because of the patent violation. The federal International Trade Commission approved the ban in June. Verizon Wireless will cease its efforts to overturn the ban and will withdraw its motion for a stay from the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, according to the statement. ''It's a chink in Qualcomm's armor because Verizon was their best ally in lobbying,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''Verizon takes the risk out of what will happen going forward and insulated its business.''</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/business/08phone.html?ref=qualcomminc">Patent Ruling Strikes a Blow at Qualcomm<date>Published: June 8, 2007</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO, June 7  Millions of new mobile phones containing certain Qualcomm semiconductors could be barred from import into the United States under a ruling issued Thursday by a federal government agency in a patent dispute. Skip to next paragraph Related International Trade Commission Statement on its Qualcomm Ruling (usitc.gov) Qualcomm said the ruling by the United States International Trade Commission, if it withstands an appeal, could prevent the importation into the United States of tens of millions of new mobile handsets designed for the Verizon, Sprint and AT&amp;T Wireless networks. The agency ruled that Qualcomm, a semiconductor company based in San Diego, had infringed on a key patent belonging to Broadcom, a competing chip company based in Irvine, Calif., that is used in the design of chips made for advanced 3G, or third-generation, smart cellphones. Qualcomm said that it planned to appeal immediately to the federal court to block the ruling. The company also said that it planned to appeal to President Bush, whose trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, has 60 days within which to veto the ruling. The company said it sought to avoid irreparable harm to U.S. consumers and injury to the economy. Nancy Stark, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, said that company would ask the White House to void the ruling and the federal appeals court to stay it. Its bad for the industry and bad for the wireless consumer, she said. Its going to freeze innovation. Tim Luke, a telecommunications industry analyst with Lehman Brothers, said that while the I.T.C. ruling is big, it probably does not mean any disruption in handset supplies. Investors will be looking for a settlement between Qualcomm and Broadcom, he said, adding that Qualcomm also might be able to find a technological fix so that it does not use the technology covered by the Broadcom patent. Qualcomms fundamental business is really strong and theyll have to think of a way to work around this, Mr. Luke said. The I.T.C. ruled that a patent governing power management in cellphone chips that is held by Broadcom was violated. Broadcom asserts that Qualcomm is using the power management technology without paying licensing royalties. This is tremendously significant, said David Rosmann, vice president of intellectual property litigation for Broadcom. Qualcomm is either going to need to take a license or they will not be able the provide the next generation of handsets. The I.T.C. ruling affects only new models of handsets. Under the ruling, Qualcomm would still be permitted to deliver models that already are on the market as of June 7, whether or not they use the patented technology. Qualcomm officials said in a conference call with investors late Thursday that it had been negotiating with Broadcom to establish royalty rates. But Qualcomm officials said the rates currently under discussion were so prohibitive that, if met, would undermine Qualcomms business model. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, said the I.T.C. overstepped its statutory authority and the decision had the potential to disrupt the supply of handsets in a way that, he said, could hurt wireless carriers, and consumers. The issue ruled on by the I.T.C. is part of a broader dispute between Qualcomm, one of the biggest makers in the world of chips for mobile phones, and Broadcom, which makes chips for many digital devices and is trying to gain more business in the mobile phone market. Last week, Broadcom prevailed in a jury trial in United States District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., in which it claimed Qualcomm had infringed three additional patents. The technology covered in those patents includes methods for transmission of high-speed data over mobile phones. Broadcom has also sued Qualcomm over the patent covered in the I.T.C. ruling, but a federal court delayed ruling on the case until the I.T.C. acted.

The creation of a task force, which is modeled after the one investigating antitrust complaints against Microsoft, means that the case in question merits a full-blown investigation, said Na Yang-ju, a spokesman for the South Korean antitrust watchdog agency, the Fair Trade Commission. But commission officials also acknowledged that the case against Qualcomm was more complicated than they had expected. A year ago, the commission ruled that Microsoft was guilty of breaching fair trade rules, a decision the company is appealing. We have been investigating Qualcomms case since last April but we have found it to be a complicated case where facts are difficult to establish, a commission investigator, Lee Seung-kyu, said. South Korea is home to several leading mobile phone makers as well as smaller companies that provide technology and components. More than 80 percent of the countrys 48 million people carry cellphones, all based on Qualcomm technology. Companies here have constantly complained about Qualcomm demanding too much royalty, said Kevin Lee, an industry analyst at Woori Investment and Securities in Seoul. The investigation can be seen as political pressure on Qualcomm to be more friendly toward South Korean companies which use its technology, Mr. Lee added. Executives at the company said they had no comment because they had not yet received official queries from the Fair Trade Commission. Investigators from the commission searched Qualcomm Koreas two offices in April, seeking data on Qualcomms business dealings with Samsung, LG and Pantech. Qualcomm Korea said it was standing by a statement issued in April by its parent that its business practices are lawful and procompetitive. The investigation into Qualcomm was set off last year by complaints from Nextreaming and Thin Multimedia, two South Korean companies that make software that allows cellphone users to download music, surf the Internet and display video over high-speed cellular networks. Lim Il-taek, president of Nextreaming, accused Qualcomm of undermining fair competition by bundling its multimedia software into its market-dominant cellphone chip sets. Correction: January 5, 2007 An article in Business Day on Wednesday about an investigation of Qualcomm by the antitrust authorities in South Korea misspelled the given name of the president of Nextreaming, which has accused Qualcomm of undermining fair competition.

Intel Capital said it would make a $600 million cash investment in Clearwire, which was founded nearly three years ago by Craig O. McCaw, a pioneer in the cellular telephone industry. Motorola Ventures would not say how much of its $300 million investment would be in cash. In a related transaction, Motorola said it would buy Clearwire's NextNet Wireless subsidiary for an undisclosed amount. Analysts said Intel and Motorola wanted to give a lift to WiMax, a standard for mobile wireless that is used by Clearwire and is competing with technology from Qualcomm. WiMax is much like the popular WiFi networking standard but works over much greater distances, carrying both Internet data and mobile phone calls. A single WiMax base station could connect hundreds or potentially thousands of customers to the Internet over distances of many miles. "This investment is a catalyst to help spur implementations of WiMax globally," said Sean Maloney, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's mobility group. "People have told us they want access to high-speed Internet wherever they are." There are now 175 tests of WiMax going on around the world, Mr. Maloney said. He added that Intel planned to continue working with other companies in the WiMax market, and emphasized that the relationship with Clearwire was not exclusive. Motorola said it planned to sell wireless networking equipment to Clearwire. It declined to provide financial details. "Intel is basically setting the stage for WiMax to become the standard" when cellular companies upgrade their networks, said Jagdish Rebello, wireless communications and consumer electronics at iSuppli, a consumer electronics market research firm. "Intel has not been able to get traction with the carriers, and in Clearwire they have a good partner." Intel is hoping that WiMax will have the same success as WiFi, and has already made a sizable investment in the technology in its own labs. The company is working to build WiMax ability into the next version of its Centrino chipset by the end of 2007, Mr. Maloney said. He said he expected Centrino with WiMax to take off over a period of two to three years, following much the same path as WiFi. "WiMax is the big sister of WiFi," he said. "Eventually we see the two technologies merging." The companies announced the investment after the close of regular trading Wednesday. Shares of Intel fell 61 cents, to $18.75. Motorola fell 33 cents, to $19.94. Both stocks rose slightly in after-hours trading. The investment in Clearwire is Intel Capital's biggest to date, by a large margin. The unit typically invests less than $5 million in companies working on emerging technologies, in most cases receiving a 20 percent stake. It said it would own a minority stake in Clearwire but would not specify its size. Intel made a smaller investment in Clearwire in 2004. The investment sheds new light on Intel's strategy in the mobile communications market. Last month Intel sold its money-losing mobile chip business for $600 million. The decision to back Clearwire indicates that Intel is still anxious to expand its role in mobile computing and communications, analysts said. Clearwire announced in May that it hoped to raise $400 million in an initial public offering later this year. However, the company said Wednesday that it was canceling that plan. It did not explain its decision. The company offers WiMax service in 27 regions around the country, with about 18,000 subscribers in the United States and 11,500 in Belgium and Ireland. Mr. McCaw owns 47 percent of Clearwire's outstanding shares and controls 87 percent of the voting rights through a holding company. The company has yet to turn a profit. Last year it reported a net loss of $140 million on revenue of $33.5 million in 2005.

Qualcomm's increased forecast comes less than a week after its larger competitor, Texas Instruments, said sales and profit this quarter would be above earlier projections. Qualcomm has raised its profit forecasts four times since December as demand for phones surges. The shares rose 65 cents, to $41.84. Paul Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, said in the statement yesterday that consumer demand for services and devices using the third-generation WCDMA technology, or wide-band code-division multiple access, "continues to be vibrant," prompting the company to raise its forecasts. While Qualcomm and Texas Instruments both increased their forecasts for the current quarter, investors have become concerned that demand may wane later in the year. Last week, a Citigroup analyst, Glen Yeung, cut his 2007 profit estimates for Texas Instruments, citing concern that revenue growth might slow. Mr. Yeung's report on June 9 reversed a rise in Texas Instruments shares, sending them to their biggest decline in three months.

In a news release, the company said its earnings for the fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 26, increased to $538 million, or 32 cents a share, from $393 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 40 percent, to $1.56 billion, from $1.12 billion. Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, said it expected first-quarter operating earnings of 36 cents to 38 cents a share, above Wall Street's average estimate of 35 cents a share. Qualcomm makes most of its money by licensing a wireless transmission standard called code division multiple access.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/12/technology/12qualcomm.html?ref=qualcomminc">Qualcomm to Buy Flarion for $600 Million<date>Published: August 12, 2005</date><text>Qualcomm said yesterday that it would buy the wireless broadband technology firm Flarion Technologies in a bid to expand its own wireless technology. The cash and stock deal is initially worth $600 million, and the company could eventually pay $205 million more. Skip to next paragraph Forum: Technology and the Internet Shares of Qualcomm, which dominates the market for wireless chips based on C.D.M.A., the dominant cellphone standard in the United States, rose more than 2 percent after it said it would buy Flarion, a high-profile private technology firm. Many mobile operators tested Flarion's gear in their search for high-speed wireless technology, but it has had little success so far as most operators are building networks based on Qualcomm technology. Qualcomm said it expected the deal to dilute its fiscal 2006 per-share earnings by about 3 cents. Upon closing the deal, it expects $10 million in one-time charges related to in-process research and development. It plans to issue $267 million of stock, assume existing Flarion options and warrants valued at about $128 million and pay about $205 million in cash, net of Flarion's projected cash balance. Within eight years of the close, Qualcomm plans to issue $35 million more in stock and pay $170 million more in cash, depending on certain milestones, it said.

According to a copy of the suit, which was filed July 1, Qualcomm threatened to cut off supplies to companies that bought products from rivals and "coerced" users to support Qualcomm products over competing ones. A spokeswoman for Qualcomm, Emily Gin Kilpatrick, said the company believed that the lawsuit had no merit. The lawsuit reflects an effort by Broadcom, which makes semiconductors for cable television set-top boxes, to branch into chips for mobile phones, where Qualcomm dominates a technology called C.D.M.A., which is used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint. "Their monopoly in C.D.M.A. technology has increased the price of cellphones in the U.S., and we are hoping that the courts will prevent the same thing from happening with the next generation '3G' cellphones," Scott A. McGregor, Broadcom's chief executive, said in a statement. Broadcom is seeking unspecified damages from Qualcomm and an injunction barring "unfair business practices." The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in New Jersey because Broadcom has offices in that state, the complaint said. Broadcom's headquarters are in Irvine, Calif. In May, Broadcom filed two lawsuits and a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission accusing Qualcomm of infringing patents.

Jacobs would succeed his father, the company's founder, as chief executive. The promotion of Mr. Jacobs, 42, came as no surprise to Wall Street analysts, who had been anticipating his appointment even before his father, Irwin M. Jacobs, announced his retirement. The company also announced that Steven R. Altman, 43, would become president, succeeding Anthony S. Thornley, who is also retiring. "I'm very pleased that the governance committee decided to promote Paul and Steve as officers," the elder Mr. Jacobs said Tuesday at the annual shareholders meeting. Irwin Jacobs, 71, will remain chairman after he retires as chief on July 1, but will no longer have day-to-day responsibilities. Paul Jacobs was also named to Qualcomm's board. Mr. Altman, a lawyer, joined Qualcomm in 1989 and has been responsible for its technology licensing strategy. The younger Mr. Jacobs, who joined Qualcomm full time as an engineer 15 years ago, is widely considered a smart successor to his father given his combination of company experience and academic background. He holds a doctorate in electrical engineering and has held various positions at the company, most recently executive vice president for the wireless and Internet group. "Irwin helped get Qualcomm to where it is, and now Paul is in a good position to keep up the momentum," said T. Michael Walkley, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. Mr. Walkley added that Qualcomm would have been hard pressed to find an outside candidate with the same combination of market knowledge and engineering skill. Shares in Qualcomm fell $1.10 Tuesday to close at $36.29; the stock rose $1.94 on Monday after Qualcomm revised its profit guidance for the quarter. The company raised its quarterly dividend to 9 cents a share from 7 cents on Tuesday and doubled its share repurchase authority to $2 billion. Corporate governance watchdogs typically keep a close watch when a family member is promoted within a Fortune 500 company, and as a result, analysts said that Paul Jacobs' performance would be held to a high standard. His brother, Jeffrey A. Jacobs, leads the company's global development division. Paul Jacobs has helped his father prove skeptics wrong before. Over the last decade, the company pioneered the use of C.D.M.A. - or code division multiple access - starting when that technology was the least favored of two competing standards for the delivery of data and voice traffic over wireless networks. Today, the technology is a widely used standard, and successors of C.D.M.A. are poised to play a significant role in mobile phone technology. Qualcomm sells C.D.M.A. chips for cellphones and receives royalties from makers of telephone handsets based on the technology. In the late 1990's, Paul Jacobs led the company's handset manufacturing business, which endured some technical problems before it was sold to Kyocera Wireless in 2000. But in the end, Paul Jacobs's oversight of the headset division helped make C.D.M.A. a standard, allowing the company to seed the market with handsets based on C.D.M.A. early in the cellular industry's development. "He played a key role in proving C.DM.A. and getting the market off the ground," Mr. Walkley said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E4DC1F3DF93BA35750C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=qualcomminc">Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Qualcomm Predicts Better-Than-Expected Profit<date>Published: March 8, 2005</date><text>Qualcomm said yesterday that its profit for the second quarter would be slightly better than expected on increased shipments of chips, sending its shares up 5 percent. The company, a supplier of chips and technology licenses for its C.D.M.A. and W-C.D.M.A. mobile phone technology, also said revenue for the quarter would be at the low end of its target because average sales prices were lower than expected. Qualcomm, based in San Diego, raised its profit outlook for the quarter ending March 27 to a range of 26 cents to 28 cents a share, from 25 cents to 27 cents. It said the estimate was based on shipments of its Mobile Station Modem phone chips in a range of 36 million to 37 million, up from its forecast of 35 million to 37 million. Based on information from the majority of its license customers, Qualcomm also raised its estimate for first-quarter shipments of chips for C.D.M.A. and W-C.D.M.A. to 51 million to 52 million, from 46 million to 49 million. But it cut its second-quarter revenue outlook to a range of $1.35 billion to $1.40 billion excluding its investment arm, down from a previous forecast of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion. Shares of Qualcomm rose $1.89, to $37.39.

The company plans to have the more integrated semiconductor widely available by the middle of 2006, making it the first major manufacturer to produce an integrated cellphone chip for the mass market, according to industry analysts. At present, the components of a mobile phone include numerous specialized chips that control functions like sending and receiving radio frequencies, managing power and overseeing the phone's basic computing functions. "This isn't an incremental step," said Bill Krenik, manager of wireless advanced architectures for Texas Instruments. "It's a big leap forward." Texas Instruments is not the only company to have integrated much of that technology on a single chip. Last November, Qualcomm said it had developed integrated technology. However, its product may be in the mass market somewhat later than the Texas Instruments technology, said Alex Slawsby, an industry analyst with IDC, a research firm. Qualcomm said its chip would be available in the second half of 2006. Mr. Slawsby said that the advantage of such chips might come initially in the production of inexpensive entry-level phones. The integrated chip, Mr. Slawsby said, would allow phone manufacturers to more quickly and cheaply produce handsets that could be sold to emerging markets. Despite the advances toward integration of functions onto a single chip, some will remain separate. Specifically, the major chipmakers have not yet figured out how to economically integrate the memory, a specialized chip that stores phone numbers and other information. A significant advancement is that the technology integrates two basic chips, Mr. Krenik said, the one that controls sending and receiving radio frequencies and the one that controls basic computing functions.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E6DB1038F933A15752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=qualcomminc">Technology Briefing | Hardware: Qualcomm Posts 46% Profit Increase<date>Published: January 20, 2005</date><text>Qualcomm said yesterday that first-quarter profit rose 46 percent on climbing demand for handsets that let users play games, take photos and read e-mail.

The company is attracting new customers as wireless carriers switch to networks that are based on the technology developed by Qualcomm. The company said that excluding the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives investments unit, second-quarter profit would be 25 cents to 27 cents a share, falling short of the 30 cents expected by analysts in a Thomson First Call survey.

Those wanting to clear some of the clutter may want to take a look at Symantec's Norton Internet Security 2005 suite, which includes Norton AntiSpam 2005. The spam-filtering program weeds out the junk that streams into most POP3 e-mail accounts and works with Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express, Qualcomm's Eudora program, and Yahoo Web mail. AntiSpam 2005 can spot some identity-theft scams with fraudulent sender addresses. The Internet Security suite helps protect the computer further with Norton AntiVirus and Norton Personal Firewall, in addition to Norton's programs for privacy and parental control. Symantec has also freshened up its Norton SystemWorks utility suite; each suite works with Windows 98 and later and is available for $70 in stores and at www.symantecstore.com. Norton SystemWorks 2005 includes the Norton Utilities, Norton AntiVirus and CheckIt Diagnostics programs for repairing many PC woes. Norton SystemWorks also has the power to turn back time; its GoBack data backup and recovery program can return a computer to its previous working state and even scrounge up copies of files that have accidentally been deleted.

The cellphone industry is working to build phones able to receive high-definition television signals over the air, even though HDTV has yet to make its way into most American living rooms. Texas Instruments, the largest maker of computer chips for mobile phones, plans to announce today that it is developing technology that will allow wireless handsets to receive hundreds of high-definition channels. The phones would not be marketed until 2007. Although Sprint and AT&amp;T Wireless currently offer a service that allows cellphone users to watch live streaming from more than a dozen television channels over the cellular networks, the picture delivery is very slow and not much like a real TV viewing experience. The push into high-definition television reception by Texas Instruments and a handful of other chip makers could change all that. Qualcomm, the world's second largest maker of chips for mobile phones, is also working on a chip to enable phones to receive digital television signals, the company said Tuesday. Both companies said the HDTV phones would be in widespread tests by 2006. Already, a telecommunications company in South Korea is testing a television phone in Seoul. The new chips would receive digital signals that would display uninterrupted images while a user is moving. Texas Instruments and other chip makers envision consumers receiving television signals, not over the existing cellular network, but from a separate network, like a satellite television network. "There's no reason why, in three to four years, you won't have 200 channels on your cellphone," said Marc Cetto, a general manager in the handset division of Texas Instruments. He said he expected that the technology's appeal would be "event-driven," attracting consumers who want to watch programming like sports and news. Analysts and phone company executives said future programming might be similar to existing television content, but might also emphasize shows of shorter length. But before consumers can carry true HDTV sets in their pockets, substantial technological challenges need to be overcome. The companies have to create phones with enough battery life that users will not have to choose between making calls and tuning into shows. On the other hand, mobile phone makers and cellular carriers have successfully added new functions and features like color screens to the ever-smaller gadgets - making the move into television less of a leap. From a business standpoint, finding popular new uses is crucial to the growth of the cellphone business. In the case of television technology, there are a number of unanswered questions, like whether consumers would want to pay for programming as they do now for standard satellite TV or how much they would be asked to pay. Mr. Cetto said he did not expect the actual handsets to cost much more than the current generation of phones. Another question is whether consumers who have become accustomed to watching television on huge sets at home would be interested in watching shows on tiny screens. Allen Leibovitch, a semiconductor analyst with IDC, a market research company, said the technology might actually be a dangerous distraction to people who use their mobile phones while driving. The concept of miniature televisions is not new. Sony, with its Watchman, and other consumer electronics makers have for years sold portable televisions with small screens, but those devices have had very limited markets. Rich Templeton, the chief executive of Texas Instruments, conceded the appeal of the tiny appliances has not been vast. But he said the phone-based television would be more widely used because most users would be carrying them anyway. In Seoul, SK Telecom, a major telecommunications provider, is testing phones that receive a television signal, said James E. Katz, director of mobile computing studies at Rutgers University. Mr. Katz, who saw the tests in Korea this week, said the screens were small, but the picture and sound were quite sharp. "You can sit in a cafe and watch your show by yourself," he said, "or you can gather around it with a couple of small-headed friends." But he added that he was not sure whether American consumers would take to the technology. SK Telecom is delivering TV programming over its existing cellular network, Mr. Katz said. Phone makers have not offered analog TV service, Mr. Cetto said, because analog signals can be easily interrupted. By contrast, he said, the digital signal can be processed in such a way as to compensate for interruptions in the frequency. But while digital technology makes it easier to display a constant stream of images while the phone user is moving, digital programming has been slow to develop. Mr. Cetto said Texas Instruments was already participating in tests in Berlin, Helsinki, Finland and Pittsburgh, that have shown that disruption can be overcome. "A month ago, I was in Europe going 60 miles an hour in a car, watching television on a cellphone," said Mr. Cetto, who added that he was in Berlin and that he was not driving at the time. Sanjay Jha, president of Qualcomm's chip set and system software division, said digital TV technology on phones was the next logical step.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED61139F937A1575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;ref=qualcomminc">Technology Briefing | Digital Media: Qualcomm-Microsoft Deal<date>Published: September 24, 2004</date><text>Qualcomm and Microsoft said yesterday that they had reached an agreement that would let customers play digital audio and video files created with Microsoft Windows Media software on wireless devices that use Qualcomm's chips.

The company, based in San Diego, announced on Friday morning that it planned to study whether to change its accounting practices to reflect the growing size and volatility of the mobile communications market. It is a potential change applauded by Wall Street analysts. But investors, nevertheless, punished Qualcomm - albeit briefly. The company's stock fell by as much as 7 percent before rebounding moderately to close at $38.83, down $1.57. "When people hear there's a change to a company's accounting, 90 percent of the time it's because there's a problem," said Albert Lin, a telecommunications analyst with American Technology Research, a research firm for institutional investors. In this case, Mr. Lin said, "this is definitely good for investors." Whether Qualcomm will actually make any changes will not be known until as late as November, said Bill Keitel, the company's chief financial officer. But, he said, the company wanted to let investors know it is planning to study how best to record the royalties it earns from makers of handsets when they use Qualcomm's technology, known as code division multiple access, or CDMA, in their mobile phones. Qualcomm makes about 40 percent of its revenue from selling microprocessors used by handset companies, like Samsung and Motorola, that make cellphones for use on CDMA networks. Qualcomm has been a pioneer of CDMA technology, which is one of the two standards for how voice and data are transmitted over wireless networks. It is used in about 25 percent of mobile phones worldwide. Another 30 percent to 40 percent of Qualcomm's revenue comes from royalties paid by the handset makers that build phones to be CDMA-compatible. Generally, the royalties that handset makers pay are equal to about 5 percent of the retail price of the phone. The proposed change in accounting would affect how Qualcomm records revenue from those royalties. Currently, when the company announces its quarterly results, it bases the amount of royalty revenue on an estimate of the number of phones that include CDMA technology sold during the quarter. Mr. Keitel said the company typically did not get actual sales figures from the handset makers until several months later. At that point, Qualcomm has historically revised its earnings to reflect the actual phone sales. The estimate can be off by tens of millions of dollars - and as much as 10 percent of the company's royalty revenue, said Mr. Lin, the telecommunications analyst. He said that several years ago he suggested that Qualcomm change the way it recorded royalties. Other analysts said they had not seen a serious problem with using estimates. "They're calibrating relatively accurately," said Jim Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research. Mr. Keitel said the company had concluded that its current accounting practice best complies with government rules, which require companies to make an estimate of revenue if it can reliably do so. But he said Qualcomm was going to study whether it would better satisfy regulatory standards if it reported actual handset royalty revenues when they become available. He also said the company would consider some hybrid solution, like recognizing some of the royalty revenue by estimate, but not all of it. If the company makes a change, he said, it would not affect the underlying economics of the business. Louis P. Gerhardy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the initial drop in share price on Friday might reflect confusion about the nature of the proposed accounting changes. He said investors might also have been reacting to a revision in Qualcomm's fourth-quarter earnings forecast. Qualcomm said it expected fourth-quarter revenue to rise 60 percent to 62 percent from the same period a year earlier. And the company said it expected earnings per share to be $1.09 to $1.10. Previously, the company said it expected earnings of $1.08 to $1.09, and revenue to increase 57 percent to 65 percent. Both guidance figures were improvements, analysts said. But "some investors were probably expecting a more significant positive surprise," Mr. Gerhardy said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EFDD1530F933A2575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;ref=qualcomminc">Technology Briefing | Deals: Qualcomm To Acquire Iridigm<date>Published: September 10, 2004</date><text>Qualcomm, the world's second-largest maker of chips that power mobile telephones, will buy the Iridigm Display Corporation for $170 million to acquire its patented technology for cellphone screens. The price covers the 86 percent of Iridigm that Qualcomm does not already own, the company said yesterday. Iridigm's so-called iMod technology is cheaper to make and uses less battery power than existing liquid crystal-display, or L.C.D., screens, said Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. The technology allows manufacturers to make lower-priced phones with more features like color screens that display pictures and video. Demand for cellphones with color screens and features like cameras lifted global shipments 37 percent, to $163.7 million during the second quarter, the research company IDC said. Qualcomm makes wireless-phone chips and sell licenses for the use of its patented code-division multiple-access, or C.D.M.A., technology for transmitting phone calls.

The next day, he showed up with a computer program that wrote the sentences automatically.Mr. Maloney, now 48, might hope he can conjure another quick, innovative fix. In January, Mr. Maloney, a self-taught engineer and rising star at the Intel Corporation, was tapped to run the company's struggling communications division, which is responsible for making chips that operate in laptops, hand-held computers and cellphones.For Intel, the wireless business is increasingly important, as it is for other technology leaders, given the boom in mobile communications. Yet the division has been a trouble spot in the company, despite the marketing success of Centrino, its wireless chip for laptop computers. In fact, the communications division has been floundering after a series of poor business and engineering decisions that left it losing around $850 million in 2003.''We plan to become profitable in 2005,'' Mr. Maloney said of the communications division, which did $4 billion in sales last year. But he said that skeptical investors were ''wondering if we can do that.''Intel, with $30 billion in sales last year, had a surge in profits in its recent second quarter, with earnings nearly doubling from the same period a year earlier. But its shares dropped more than 12 percent last week, closing at $22.73 on the Nasdaq on Friday, on news that its inventories are rising, which causes a decline in gross profit margins. At the same time, the market is showing jitters about an overall softening in the technology sector.Investors have expressed concern about Intel's long-term growth, though it still owns some 85 percent of the market for microprocessors that run PC's. But the PC sector has stagnated even as demand for mobile devices has skyrocketed.For some skeptics on Wall Street, Intel's failure to translate its expertise and dominance of the computer microprocessor market into expertise building chips for mobile devices is a serious issue -- particularly because they say dominating the wireless field will be pivotal to Intel's future. Making gains in ''the communications business is just critical in terms of broadening the market and enabling growth for Intel,'' said Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.Correction: July 20, 2004, Tuesday A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the Intel Corporation's communications division misstated the 2003 market share of worldwide flash-memory sales for three companies.

Yet while many applications and services filter spam, there are subtle differences among them that can affect system performance, filtering speed and accuracy.Most Web-based e-mail applications, for instance, are less reliable in identifying spam than new desktop software and the latest versions of online services are. Users should consider these factors in deciding which e-mail program or service to use.Once a minor annoyance, spam now makes up about 48 percent of all e-mail sent each day, compared with only 7 percent in April 2001, according to Brightmail, a company that tracks and filters spam. Hotmail, a free Web-based e-mail service, now filters 2.4 billion spam messages a day.By sorting suspect messages into separate folders or mailboxes, recipients can save themselves time and irritation when checking e-mail. Beyond that, they may be able to find satisfaction in the notion that they are working collectively to fight spam by forcing many of its purveyors to find more effective marketing strategies.Web-Based FilteringMillions of people have set up Web-based e-mail accounts through services like Hotmail or Yahoo Mail, in which a user typically reads and sends e-mail with a Web browser. Forty percent of all users of e-mail accounts use a Web-based address as the primary account, according to a study by Jupiter Research, a market research firm.These services can be prime targets for direct marketers because of their popularity among newcomers to the Internet, who may be less spam-savvy, and because of the ease with which a computer can extrapolate e-mail addresses from a single domain (for instance, name@yahoo.com).Correction: August 2, 2003, Saturday An article in Circuits on Thursday about methods of guarding against unsolicited e-mail, or spam, referred imprecisely to the filtering method of Yahoo Mail.

Jacobs discussed antennas and data transmission rates with his father the way many of his friends and their fathers talked balls and strikes. So in 1985, when Irwin M. Jacobs started Qualcomm, a pioneering firm in mobile phone technologies, it was natural for his son to spend summers working there.''We would talk about all the angles sitting at dinner, driving everyone else crazy,'' said Paul, who began work on a doctorate in electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley the same year Qualcomm was founded. ''We had a mission.''Qualcomm, now a $3 billion maker of software and microprocessors for mobile phones, has steadily grown into one of the titans of wireless software though consumers may now know it best for its Eudora e-mail software.Today, Irwin Jacobs, a founder and driving force of Qualcomm, holds the corner office. Down the hall is Paul Jacobs, the president of Qualcomm's Internet and wireless group, one of the company's most important divisions, and who is considered by many inside the company and by some outside of it to be a strong candidate to succeed his father as chief executive.For now, the elder Mr. Jacobs, at 69, is showing no signs of quitting or reducing his role in the company. And he has offered no indication about who his successor might be. But Paul Jacobs, 40, has made quite clear that he hopes to be chosen. Asked when his father might step aside, Paul Jacobs laughed and said: ''Ask him when that might be. Then tell me what he said.''The company's board might see promise in having another Jacobs at the helm. The younger Mr. Jacobs is generally favorably regarded by the board and Wall Street as an innovative engineer. But a potential strike against Paul Jacobs is that he was the manager in charge of Qualcomm's troubled handset division, which briefly ceased production in 1998 because of connector problems within its mobile phones. The division was later sold. Also in his disfavor, thorny management problems are often raised by having a family member succeed another in a Fortune 500 company.Corporate governance watchdogs are often skeptical when succession turns into a family affair. In businesses large and small, there are at least as many examples of children faring worse in the family business than there are of those who did better than their parents.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-qualcomm-raises-chip-forecast.html?ref=qualcomminc">Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Qualcomm Raises Chip Forecast<date>Published: March 11, 2003</date><text>Qualcomm Inc. raised its forecast yesterday for cellphone chip shipments in the current quarter, based on strong demand for its advanced chips that allow users to surf the Internet at high speeds.

While other companies have been hurt by the sluggish economy and lower industry spending, Qualcomm has managed to outperform its peers and post profits on the strength of its code division multiple access technology, the dominant wireless technology in American networks.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/27/technology/state-of-the-art-keeping-an-eye-on-things-by-cellphone.html?ref=qualcomminc">STATE OF THE ART; Keeping an Eye on Things, by Cellphone<date>Published: February 27, 2003</date><text>IT IS a fundamental law of electronics: the audio breakthrough always precedes the video. Think about it: radio came before television, CD's came before DVD's, and Ella Fitzgerald came before Britney Spears.The telephone world is, at the moment, still in its audio-only phase. Video hasn't gained much traction, partly because video still requires too much data for relatively tiny ''pipes'' of the phone system to carry, and partly because most people don't care to be caught on camera still dripping wet from the shower.But a consortium composed of Logitech, Verizon Wireless, Qualcomm and gPix has just stumbled onto a novel idea. Maybe the ''killer app'' for video on phones isn't seeing the person you're calling. Instead, the exciting development may be the ability to use your cellphone's color screen to view remote scenes, both of public places and of your own private ones. What was once a piece of communications gear thus becomes a tool for security, safety and even spying.A new service called Logitech Mobile Video costs $5 per month and is available to Verizon Wireless customers with so-called Get It Now phones: the Audiovox CDMA2000, the Sharp Z-800 or the Motorola T-720. These phones can run miniature programs written in something called Brew, a software tool kit for cellphones from Qualcomm. (What is it with programmers' obsession with coffee? Already they've come up with programming languages called Java, JavaScript and Brew. What's next -- software written in Half-Caf Mochaccino?)The idea behind a Get It Now phone is that you can download ringer sounds, games and other programs directly to the phone, for a fee. Among the downloadable goodies is Logitech's Mobile Video software, a tiny program that lets you build a list of Logitech's golf ball video cameras (Webcams) all over the world. At any time, wherever you happen to be, you can choose a camera from this list and, after a five-second wait, view the image it captures on your cellphone screen.The picture is on the small side -- 160 by 120 pixels, or about the size of a Wheat Thin -- and the quality is not what you would call high-definition. In fact, even calling it ''video'' is an act of the purest kindness; instead of smooth motion, you see a still frame that updates itself every two seconds to two minutes, depending on the technology gods' sense of humor.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/12/business/technology-qualcomm-plans-to-start-paying-a-quarterly-dividend-in-march.html?ref=qualcomminc">TECHNOLOGY; Qualcomm Plans to Start Paying A Quarterly Dividend in March<date>Published: February 12, 2003</date><text>Qualcomm Inc. said today that it would begin paying a quarterly dividend, becoming the second major technology company to announce plans to do so recently.The company, which had about $3.7 billion in cash and investments at the end of last year, also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program that is effective immediately and lasts for the next 24 months. Qualcomm had about 783 million shares of common stock outstanding as of Dec. 29.Qualcomm said the dividend of 5 cents a share would be payable on March 31 to shareholders of record on March 14. The company, which said it planned to continue paying a dividend, said it would pay out about $160 million a year if the dividend continued.Microsoft also recently announced it would pay a dividend.More investors, reeling from shrunken stock values in the formerly highflying technology sector, are seeking dividends. President Bush's plan to ask Congress to eliminate taxes on stock dividends has also pushed several technology companies to reconsider their policies against dividends.While I.B.M., Intel and a few other technology companies pay dividends, many have long argued that rising stock prices would be a better reward for shareholders. Several have said they would reconsider that stance if the tax laws changed.Qualcomm's shares closed down 3 cents, at $37.58.While other telecommunications equipment companies have been hurt by the sluggish economy and lower industry spending, Qualcomm has managed to outperform its peers and post profits on the strength of its code division multiple access technology, the dominant wireless technology in the United States and the second most common mobile phone technology in the world.Qualcomm owns most of the patents to C.D.M.A and licenses its technology and provides more than 90 percent of the chips for C.D.M.A. phones.Last month, the company reported a 73 percent jump in net profit for its fiscal first quarter as demand in Asia helped increase revenue by 57 percent. It also raised expectations for chip shipments in 2003.Qualcomm has, however, also been the subject of questions regarding its use of the cash it generates, especially since the company has a separate strategic investment arm that invests in telecommunications companies that commit themselves to C.D.M.A.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/16/business/globalstar-bankrupt-satellite-company-to-be-sold-for-55-million.html?ref=qualcomminc">Globalstar, Bankrupt Satellite Company, to Be Sold for $55 Million<date>Published: January 16, 2003</date><text>Globalstar, the bankrupt satellite phone company, agreed yesterday to sell control of itself to an investment firm run by Bennett S. LeBow for $55 million.Loral Space and Communications, Qualcomm and other investors had sunk about $4 billion into Globalstar, according to analysts.Under the agreement, Mr. LeBow's investment firm, New Valley, will provide $20 million to keep Globalstar from running out of cash while it completes its reorganization in bankruptcy. New Valley will provide an additional $35 million and receive at least half of Globalstar's shares when Globalstar completes the restructuring.Globalstar's bondholders are to become minority shareholders, and current shareholders in Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd., the publicly held affiliate of the satellite venture, are to receive, at most, an opportunity to buy new shares.The agreement requires approval of the bankruptcy court, but analysts said it was unlikely that Globalstar could come up with a better offer in the next few weeks while the proposal is under review.''It's a great day for us,'' said Anthony J. Navarra, president of Globalstar, which is based in San Jose, Calif. Mr. Navarra said that Globalstar expected to emerge from bankruptcy in late March or early April and that the money from Mr. LeBow should be enough for the business to reach break even.Globalstar has 52 satellites in orbit, including a 48-satellite network and four spares. It offers service in more than 100 countries. The company has been spending $4 million more in cash than it has been taking in each month from operations, not counting legal costs associated with bankruptcy, Mr. Navarra said. With Mr. LeBow's support, Globalstar expects to expand its voice and data products and increase its marketing, he said.Many analysts say it is unlikely that Mr. LeBow can save Globalstar in the long run. The company might be able to cover its operating costs once all the debt piled up creating the system is written off in bankruptcy court, but analysts are skeptical that investors will supply the huge sums needed to build and launch more satellites in the future as the current generation reaches the end of its lifetime.New Valley, a publicly traded investment company based in Miami, is majority owned by the Vector Group, the holding company for Mr. LeBow's investments. New Valley, which focused on real estate in the last year, reported in November that it had a net loss of $9.9 million on revenue of just $4.6 million in the first nine months of last year. Shares of New Valley rose 28 cents yesterday, to $4.40.Mr. LeBow is best known as the maverick vulture investor who plunged into the tobacco industry by gaining control of the Liggett Group and then shocked fellow executives by publicly stating that cigarettes caused addiction and death. Liggett negotiated the first global settlements with lawyers representing smokers.Mr. LeBow's greatest turnaround success came with Western Union. He acquired the remnants of the telegraph company for $25 million in 1987, took it into bankruptcy and ultimately sold its assets for $1.2 billion.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/07/business/company-news-qualcomm-raises-forecast-on-near-term-shipments.html?ref=qualcomminc">COMPANY NEWS; QUALCOMM RAISES FORECAST ON NEAR-TERM SHIPMENTS<date>Published: December 07, 2002</date><text>Qualcomm Inc., the No. 1 maker of chips in mobile phones, raised its forecast for near-term chip shipments yesterday, helped by demand in China and the United States and increased use of wireless services in India.

C.D.M.A. is one of the world's major competing standards for wireless network technology. China began offering C.D.M.A. wireless service this year, and Qualcomm is hoping that C.D.M.A. subscriber growth in China will drive the company's growth next year. Qualcomm will train Chinese application developers in the binary run-time environment for wireless technology, a standard that gives users the ability to download applications like games, ring tones, entertainment and information onto their mobile devices via the Internet. The financial terms of the venture were not disclosed.

Last Seen 2/1/02'' -- to everyone who uses the ad-supported version of Eurdora Mail.While it was not the first time Qualcomm had placed public service ads on Eudora Mail, this time the gesture hit closer to home. Damon van Dam, the missing girl's father, is an engineer under contract with Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. The van Dams live north of the city in a community called Sabre Springs.''The entire company has been very concerned,'' says Jeremy James, senior director of marketing for Qualcomm Internet Services. ''Because we had this version of Eudora that we can serve ads onto, we knew immediately that we wanted to do this for the van Dams.''Police investigators in San Diego are treating Danielle's disappearance as a kidnapping. Her parents reported her missing on Feb. 2.Qualcomm received a few negative reactions to the ad from Eudora users who found it unwelcome and upsetting, according to Mr. James. But Marissa Gluck, a senior analyst with Jupiter Research, said the negative responses were unusual. The reaction to most public service announcements is favorable.''Public service ads benefit everyone,'' Ms. Gluck said. ''The publisher wins because it's doing good things for the brand. There's really no downside unless you're supporting a controversial organization.''Before long, the issue of public service ads on Eudora Mail may no longer arise. Currently, about 20 percent of Eudora Mail's 10 million customers use the ad-supported version. But Qualcomm officials say the company may phase out that version by the end of the year, in light of the anemic online advertising market.Qualcomm, whose main business is licensing wireless technology, is also considering phasing out the $39.95 version of Eudora Mail. Because Microsoft now bundles its own e-mail program, Outlook Express, into the Windows operating system, there is little reason for consumers to pay for a separate e-mail program, Mr. James said. A free version of Eudora Mail without ads will probably remain available, he added. KAREN J.

Some Enron Board Members Quit or Face Ouster at Other Companies<date>Published: February 09, 2002</date><text>The door is closing behind some Enron directors.Two of them, Robert K. Jaedicke and Wendy L. Gramm, recently resigned from the boards of other companies, and another, Frank Savage, is facing pressure from shareholder activists as his position on the Qualcomm board nears a vote on Tuesday morning.Mr. Jaedicke, a former accounting professor, resigned from the California Water Service Group, and Dr. Gramm, a former commodities regulator, resigned from various boards of the Invesco mutual funds.Two large Qualcomm shareholders, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and pension funds in New York City, are considering voting against Mr. Savage on Tuesday.Activists and members of Congress have harshly criticized Enron's directors as failing to provide enough oversight to prevent the company's collapse. Many activists argue that the board bears significant responsibility for the loss of billions of dollars of investors' money.A special committee appointed by Enron's board concluded that the board had also failed in its duties. The company inflated its profits, and some employees enriched themselves at Enron's expense, according to the committee's report.''It seems the endgame has begun for the directors,'' said Patrick McGurn, a vice president with Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large shareholders on proxy matters. ''I think it was inevitable.''The A.F.L.-C.I.O., the big federation of labor unions, has conducted a letter-writing campaign to persuade public companies to remove Enron directors from their boards. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. began contacting companies in late January to question whether the Enron directors were suitable board members.The debate that is going on ''is very important to the standards of corporate governance,'' said William Patterson, the director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s office of investment. Board members ''need to be directly accountable to shareholders,'' he added.The California pension group, known as Calpers, said it planned to evaluate each Enron director individually when it comes time for shareholder votes. It said it decided to vote against Mr. Savage because of the special committee's report and other concerns about his numerous board positions and the particular demands of the Enron board.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/20/business/technology-briefing-hardware-handspring-raises-cash.html?ref=qualcomminc">Technology Briefing | Hardware: Handspring Raises Cash<date>Published: December 20, 2001</date><text>Handspring Inc., the money-losing maker of the Visor hand-held computer, said it had raised $48.5 million from investors including Qualcomm Inc.
