Giuliani to vouch for the plant’s safety in a new advertising campaign scheduled to begin next week. The campaign will include advertisements on cable television and in newspapers, a spokesman for the company, the Entergy Corporation, said Wednesday. Entergy is seeking to renew its operating licenses for the two reactors at Indian Point, on the Hudson River in Buchanan, N.Y., and the advertising campaign is the company’s highest-profile effort to buttress its public image during a politically volatile period that is critical to Indian Point’s future. Entergy has contended with public unease after the tsunami in March that led to a reactor meltdown in Japan, as well as steady criticism from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The governor, a longtime opponent of Indian Point, has repeatedly called for the plant — about 35 miles from Midtown Manhattan — to be shut down, because of safety concerns. Those public relations challenges led Entergy to conversations this summer with Mr. Giuliani, who has previously done promotional work for Indian Point, about his appearing in new advertisements that would deal with the plant’s safety. An Entergy spokesman, James F. Steets, declined to say how much the company planned to spend on the campaign or how much it had paid Mr. Giuliani to appear in the advertisements. “Our goal is to reassure people about the safety of Indian Point,” Mr. Steets said in a telephone interview. “With the high regard people have for Mayor Giuliani, I think we can get that message across clearly.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani’s consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, declined to comment on the advertising campaign.

In January, a longtime critic, Andrew M. Cuomo, was sworn in as governor, and proceeded to push for the facility to be shuttered because of its proximity to New York City and its susceptibility to earthquakes and terrorist attacks. Then, in March, a tsunami precipitated a reactor meltdown in Japan, stoking new fears about the safety of nuclear power plants, especially those near population centers.Now, Indian Point’s owners, confronted by that intensified political opposition and public unease, are preparing a public relations campaign. And, seeking a way to counteract the determined governor, they are turning for help to a tough-talking former New York mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. The Entergy Corporation, the operator of the two reactors at Indian Point, which generate as much as 30 percent of New York City’s power, has been in talks with Mr. Giuliani about headlining a major advertising campaign aimed at allaying public concerns about the facility’s safety. The campaign would effectively pit Mr. Giuliani, an erstwhile Republican presidential candidate, against the governor, a Democrat. Entergy officials said the campaign was still in the planning stages and could include television commercials. A company spokesman, James F. Steets, would not elaborate on discussions with Mr. Giuliani, who has done promotional work for Entergy in the past. “We think he’s a great voice for Indian Point,” Mr. Steets said. “He has been very supportive of the plants because he understands they’re safe and secure, and as mayor he knows how important it is to have a reliable source of energy for the city.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani’s consulting business, Giuliani Partners, declined to comment for this article, and it remained unclear whether Mr. Giuliani and Entergy had reached an agreement. An advertising campaign would be the most visible sign yet of Entergy’s concern that Mr. Cuomo and other opponents pose a serious threat to the future of the plant, which sits 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan in Buchanan. The original 40-year operating licenses for Indian Point’s reactors expire in 2013 and 2015, and Entergy is asking the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend them for 20 years. Mr. Cuomo has vowed to lobby federal regulators to deny the extensions, and one of the governor’s top aides met with representatives from Entergy in June and emphasized that Mr. Cuomo was determined to shut down the plant, a blunt message that startled company officials. The state’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has also emerged as an obstacle. Since January, he has repeatedly written to federal regulators raising concerns about safety and security at Indian Point. Entergy also faces considerable public misgivings. According to a Siena College poll conducted in March, 72 percent of registered voters in New York State were concerned about the safety of the state’s nuclear plants, which include three active facilities upstate, in addition to Indian Point. “I would imagine this has their full attention,” Paul T. Ridzon, an analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets, said of Entergy. “I think if they spend a few million dollars on a campaign, it would certainly be money well spent, because the plant is very profitable.” The reactors at Indian Point have a capacity of more than 2,000 megawatts — or about 41 percent of the capacity of Entergy’s wholesale nuclear power business. Entergy’s nuclear division generated $489 million in income last year, or 39 percent of the company’s earnings. Indian Point has its share of backers, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has questioned whether it would be possible to close the plant anytime soon, given the large share of the city’s energy it provides. But in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Entergy routinely discloses the risk of “possible shutdown of nuclear generating facilities,” and in an earnings conference call on Tuesday, the company’s chief executive, J. Wayne Leonard, acknowledged the difficult landscape. “We believe the arguments for license renewal are very strong, and they’re supported by the facts," he said. He added, “We are very early in the process, and as these things typically unfold, sometimes things get better.” Analysts said that investors had taken note of Mr. Cuomo’s tough stance toward Indian Point’s relicensing. “It’s an uncertainty,” said Michael Worms, an analyst for BMO Capital Markets, “and one thing Wall Street does not like is uncertainties.” In recent months, proponents of nuclear power have employed advertising and public relations campaigns to emphasize plant safety in the wake of the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan. The industry’s trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, has retooled its advertising — which is directed at Washington-area policy makers — to strike a reassuring tone. “Given the images on TV in the spring, that’s not surprising,” said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute. “We recognize that right now people want to understand what we do at our facilities to ensure safety.” Entergy, which is also facing a difficult relicensing battle for Vermont Yankee, a smaller nuclear plant it operates just south of Brattleboro, has adopted a similar strategy. For years, the company has maintained a Web site for Indian Point that emphasizes its safety features and promotes its economic impact in Westchester County. Its tag line is “Safe. Secure. Vital.” In March, the company placed advertisements in New York newspapers in which Mr. Leonard warned that opponents of nuclear power would try to “use the crisis in Japan to escalate the fears of the public in order to further their longstanding goals of closing Indian Point.” And last week Mr. Steets, the Entergy spokesman, said the company was now seeking to call further attention to Indian Point’s safety features. “A lot’s been said about what could happen post-Japan, and we have an important message,” he said. “It’s really about reassuring people. And we want as favorable an environment as possible for the relicensing. You don’t want people to be afraid of the plant.” For Entergy, a carefully planned public relations campaign would not be without precedent. About a year and a half after Sept. 11, 2001, amid concerns about Indian Point’s potential vulnerability to a terrorist attack, the company hired Giuliani Partners to consult on emergency planning and security. And when Entergy formally announced in 2006 that it would seek to operate Indian Point’s two active reactors beyond their initial 40-year licenses, it again enlisted Mr. Giuliani’s support. He called Indian Point “as safe as a facility can be.” Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.This has been a tough year for the long-beleaguered Indian Point nuclear plant.

Unless a court intervenes, the clock is winding down on the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor. Its initial license expires next March, and the state of Vermont is blocking a permit that it needs to run beyond then. But its owner, Entergy, which is suing the state in federal court over the permit, announced on Monday that it would order a new load of fuel for the plant, essentially betting that the legal proceedings will come out in its favor. Fuel for reactors is ordered in batches, and at Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, on the Connecticut River just north of the Massachusetts border, the fuel is supposed to last four and half years. The next refueling is scheduled for October, when one-third of the fuel bundles are supposed to be replaced at a cost of about $50 million. The shutdown for refueling, which is supposed to last about 30 days, will cost about $92 million, according to Chanel Lagarde, a spokesman for the company. The plant will bring in 800 to 1,000 temporary workers for the job, which includes various maintenance tasks, the company says. The plant was last shut for refueling in April 2010. Entergy stressed at the time that it had run for 532 days continuously without having to shut down to address a problem; one of the arguments by plant opponents is that it should be retired because it is unreliable. The plant’s reputation has not recovered since two executives, asked by state regulators if tritium could leak from buried pipes as it had at other other plants, said it had no such pipes. In fact, an underground pipe was leaking tritium. Vermont Yankee has also had assorted mechanical problems over the years. Entergy had sought a temporary injunction to allow the reactor to keep running while the court case proceeds, which would have given it clearer guidance about whether to order the fuel, but a judge turned down that request and set a trial for September. Refueling a reactor is not like ordering coal or natural gas. “Normally you order fuel six months to a year in advance,’’ said Margaret Harding, who used to design reactor cores at General Electric, which created the design for the reactor at Vermont Yankee and supplies fuel to reactors of that type around the country. For a refueling in October, she said, normally the fuel would be delivered at the end of August, allowing time for inspection. Reactor fuel differs from plant to plant. “It’s a very engineered product,’’ Ms. Harding said. “It’s designed specifically for their application.’’ Entergy owns several other reactors of the same type as Vermont Yankee, including Pilgrim, in Massachusetts, but Pilgrim uses shorter fuel assemblies. Other plants are designed for assemblies of a slightly different shape. “It’s not just, oops, we’re going to stick it someplace else,’’ she said of any unused fuel. In a statement, Entergy said that its board of directors “believes both the merits of the company’s legal position and the record strongly support its decision to continue to trial.” At the Conservation Law Foundation in Montpelier, Vt., Sandra Levine, a lawyer, said of Vermont Yankee, “This continues to be a dubious investment for Entergy.” Her group represents the New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution, which is seeking to have the plant closed. In addition to requiring a certificate from the state stating that the plant is needed for the public good, it needs a water quality certificate, she said. Still, the plant would take in $90 million in revenue between October and March, so the cost of the refueling would be offset even if the plant had to close next spring, she said. The trial presents a challenge. Most suits filed against states are over administrative actions, but this was for a legislative one. The Vermont legislature reserved for itself the authority to decide on whether to issue the certificate. The decision to buy the fuel is Entergy’s biggest bet so far on its court case. The next would be if it had to close in March in the absence of a final court decision. The plant has 650 permanent employees and spends about $100 million a year on payroll, contractors, taxes and purchases, the company says. Those costs accrue whether it is running or not.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/a-gamble-for-vermont-yankee/?ref=entergycorporation">A Gamble for Vermont Yankee<date>July 19, 2011, 8:24 am</date><text>The owners of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant may be coming up fast on a crucial decision about the reactor’s future. The plant’s initial 40-year operating license expires in March 2012; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is willing to let it run another 20 years, but the state of Vermont is not. To run beyond March, the reactor, on the Connecticut River in Vernon, Vt., just north of the Massachusetts border, needs a new “certificate of public good,” and the state Legislature has reserved to itself the authority to issue or withhold one. It has pointedly refused to issue the certificate. On Monday, a United States District Court judge in Brattleboro denied the company an injunction that would have allowed the plant to keep running after March 2012, until the permitting issue is decided. But on Oct. 8, the plant is scheduled to shut for refueling. Power plants typically plan their shutdowns for the mild weather of spring or fall, when electricity demand is lower. Vermont Yankee typically loads fuel that would last 18 months, but by October, it will have only five months of life left, unless the impasse with the Legislature is broken. Each fuel load costs about $65 million, although if it acts soon, it could presumably order a five-month load at a reduced price. The company’s strategy was to ask the judge for a restraining order to ensure that the plant could run while the issue wanders through the courts. But Judge J. Garvan Murtha ruled Monday that Entergy had not shown that it would be caused irreparable harm if the decision were delayed until fall. Entergy filed a lawsuit this year challenging the need for the Legislature’s approval to keep running the plant. Judge Murtha said that a trial would begin in September. “The best course is to proceed to trial in eight weeks with a timely decision to follow,’’ he wrote. The company issued a brief response. “We appreciate Judge Murtha’s timely and thoughtful decision on an issue that is critically important to our 650 employees and for all those who live in New England, although we are disappointed in the outcome,’’ its statement said. For now, the company said, “we will be evaluating Judge Murtha’s opinion and assessing the company’s near-term options.” At the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, which favors shutting the reactor down, James Moore, the clean energy program director, predicted that Entergy would keep operating the plant in the short term “despite their threats to the contrary.’’ The company’s decision would seem to be an indicator of its level of confidence. If it spends tens of millions of dollars to buy 18 months’ worth of fuel, that is a strong hint that it thinks it will prevail in court. If it did not buy the fuel, it will probably have to close and choose between continuing to pay its 650 employees while it waits for the court fight to end, or lay them off, which could derail any near-term prospect of restarting the plant. An earlier version of this post misidentified the town where a federal judge declined to issue an injunction. It is Brattleboro, not Burlington.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-emphasizes-aim-to-close-indian-point-plant.html?ref=entergycorporation">Cuomo Emphasizes Aim to Close Indian Point Plant<date>Published: June 28, 2011</date><text>ALBANY — One of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s top advisers met with the operators of the Indian Point nuclear plant last week and told them that the governor was determined to close the plant.Mr. Cuomo is not the first politician or the first governor to take that position, but newly passed state legislation will make it easier for him to do so. The meeting was the first high-level meeting between Entergy, the company that runs Indian Point, and the Cuomo administration, and it was convened at Entergy’s request. Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly taken the position in speeches that he wants to close the plant. But his administration had not delivered the message so directly to the company, or in such strong words, and company officials left the meeting alarmed. The encounter seemed to mark a heightened determination to close the plant, and recent events put considerable leverage in the governor’s hands to make his wish a reality. On the day of the meeting, lawmakers were in the process of approving legislation to streamline the siting of new power plants in New York, a step that, for the first time in nearly a decade, makes replacing Indian Point and the huge amount of power it generates more feasible. The last siting law expired at the beginning of 2003. At the same time, the licenses for Indian Point’s two reactors expire in 2013 and 2015. The state can derail the process by refusing to provide permits related to the plants’ use of water from the Hudson River as a coolant. Last year, the State Department of Environmental Conservation rejected a crucial permit application from Entergy; the company is challenging the move. For the Cuomo administration, closing Indian Point would be a major step toward reshaping the state’s energy policy. Replacing the plant would take years and require a long-term energy strategy. The plant produces 2,000 megawatts and provides 25 percent of the power in New York City and Westchester. Public worries about the plant, in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Midtown, flared after the recent catastrophe at the Japanese nuclear plant in Fukushima, and after a report highlighting the Indian Point plant’s proximity to a fault line. But replacing it with natural gas plants or other more conventional options could bring its own environmental and emissions concerns. Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said “the governor’s long-standing position with respect to closing Indian Point has been clear, and this administration intends to follow through with implementing that policy.” Details of the meeting last week between Entergy and the governor’s advisers were provided by people who were briefed on it but who insisted on anonymity because the meeting was private. It took place at the Capitol office of Howard Glaser, the governor’s director of state operations. The top Entergy executive at the meeting was Richard Smith, the president of its wholesale commodity business. James F. Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, issued a general statement defending the plant. “Indian Point provides 25 percent of N.Y.C.’s and Westchester’s power for subways, schools, police stations and firehouses, businesses and homes with virtually no emissions, at lower cost,” he said. “Entergy’s investment in recent years of more than a half-billion dollars to upgrade safety and security, and rigorous independent inspections by multiple inspectors on site full time, help ensure Indian Point is safe.” The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 gives the federal government sole authority to regulate the safety of nuclear plants, but the states have always had the right to approve or disapprove the construction of power reactors, as they can approve or disapprove any power plant. Several states have held referendums on whether to force nuclear plants to close, but no such proposal has ever passed. Vermont is declining to permit continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, owned, like Indian Point, by Entergy, for operation beyond the expiration of its license next spring. Entergy needs a water quality permit from New York as part of the federal relicensing of Indian Point. Last year, the administration of Gov. David A. Paterson denied the permit, but Entergy has requested an administrative hearing, which will take place this year. The company is also contesting the state’s denial to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Cuomo administration will preside over the endgame of this process at a critical phase, as Entergy seeks relicensing for Indian Point. The passage of power plant legislation last week gave the Cuomo administration important new ammunition in its battle. While no large plants have been sited in New York State in more than a decade, the new legislation, by streamlining approvals, makes it easier for energy companies to begin that process. But David Lochbaum, the director of the nuclear safety project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group, said the challenge of replacing Indian Point had more to do with transmission of existing power than generating power. Local resistance has prevented the building of new transmission lines to bring power from the north to New York City and its suburbs. “If you took Indian Point out of the mix, one of the options would be to replace it with more power from upstate New York or Canada, but the power lines are already at capacity,” Mr. Lochbaum said. “The power might be there, but not the ability to get it to people who need it.” The Cuomo administration is supporting a plan to connect New York City and New Jersey with transmission lines beneath the Hudson, which could deliver 660 megawatts to Manhattan. That plan, also, is controversial. The Indian Point plant uses up to 2.5 billion gallons of water from the Hudson per day as a coolant, cycling it back into the river. Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat and former assemblyman, has sued the N.R.C. over its issuance of exemptions to Indian Point from health and safety requirements. Mr. Cuomo filed a brief supporting the suit when he was attorney general. Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.ALBANY — One of Gov. Andrew M.

Missed Deadline on Indian Point Decision, Operator Says<date>June 21, 2011, 5:00 pm</date><text>Associated PressThe Indian Point nuclear power plant in Buchanan, N.Y. New York State missed a deadline for ruling on an application for a water quality certificate for the Indian Point nuclear plant, the plant’s owner, Entergy, said on Tuesday in a notification to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The filing raised the possibility that state officials may have lost a tool for blocking a license renewal for the plant’s nuclear reactors. The commission must decide whether to grant a 20-year extension to the two reactors’ initial 40-year licenses, and under its rules, the reactors must have a valid water quality certificate. The federal Clean Water Act, the law under which such certificates are issued, gives the states one year to decide on such applications, and that period expired in April 2010, Entergy said. The company is asking the N.R.C. to rule on whether it must keep waiting for a permit from Albany. A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Michael Bopp, said his agency’s lawyers had not had a chance to review Entergy’s contentions. But he countered that his department had indeed reached a decision within a year; it rejected the application. What has been going on since then is an appeal of the rejection, he said. New York State opposes a license extension for the reactors, a position taken by Gov. Andrew Cuomo well before he was elected last year. The state could still prevail by persuading the regulatory commission that the plant, on the Hudson River in Buchanan, N.Y., has unaddressed safety problems. But so far the commission has approved every single application for a reactor license renewal, in some cases for reactors that had more obvious age-related safety issues than the Indian Point reactors do. The commission has, however, required reactors to take various maintenance steps to win renewals. Entergy still needs a second approval from the state, a State Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit, which covers many of the same water quality issues that the certificate does. But the discharge permit is not required for license renewal and has no deadline attached. New York State is seeking to have Entergy build towers at the plant for cooling water to reduce damage to fish and other aquatic life. Entergy is resisting. A spokesman for the regulatory commission, Neil Sheehan, said it had received the notification and that its lawyers were reviewing it. In a statement, Fred Dacimo, Entergy’s vice president for operations, said the company was addressing the underlying issues in the argument over the water quality certificate. “Our steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship and our continued adherence to New York water quality standards remain firm,” he said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/indian-point-and-earth-day/?ref=entergycorporation">Indian Point and Earth Day<date>April 21, 2011, 7:37 pm</date><text>9:19 p.m. | Updated I spent much of Thursday inside the Indian Point nuclear power complex, which is less than 10 miles from my home in the Hudson Valley and less than 40 miles north of Times Square. Here’s a snippet of video (much more coming soon) from our stop in the thick-walled building housing the pool for spent fuel from Indian Point 3, one of the two active reactors at the plant: I felt a mix of awe and fascination — and, yes, a tingle of fear — as I stared into the green depths and absorbed that the reactor’s entire legacy of used fuel since it began producing power in 1976 was there in that small space. One of the unbending realities for anyone fighting this energy choice is that even if Indian Point, or any other plant, were to lose its license, the reactors and fuel would be around for decades before full decommissioning ever happened. I was strongly encouraged by what I saw today, but will be doing more reporting before weighing in more thoroughly here. What to do about existing plants, and how to chart a sustainable energy future with (or without) nuclear power are entirely separate questions. It’s worth reflecting, on the eve of Earth Day 2011, that one year ago I was blogging about boom times for the global coal industry. The organizers of Earth Day celebrations this year are calling for “a billion acts of green.” There are plenty of important questions about nuclear technology going forward, but to my mind responsible operation of existing plants is one of those green acts. I first toured the plant in 1995, shortly after I began writing for The Times. Much has changed, with a shift to fully private operation by Entergy Corporation and the full closure of the leaky and aged Indian Point 1 reactor, a museum piece from the early days of commercial nuclear power. The active reactors, Indian Point 2 and 3, were humming away on Thursday, and a new feature is an open-air pad where spent fuel taken from crowding cooling pools is increasingly being stored in “dry casks” — super rugged containers that no engineer has yet figured out how to breach. I’m learning about various steps taken in recent years to secure the reactors and the stored spent fuel both from acts of man, in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks, and nature, in the wake of Japan’s great seismic calamity. I’ll be writing much more about this issue, as I promised when I recently explored the starkly different reactions from two prominent environmentalists to the still-unfolding events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex. As if to reinforce the importance of considering fully the risks that attend the use of the atom, Japanese residents of a 12-mile-radius zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex were paying last visits to their neighborhoods before a long-term evacuation order took effect.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/science/earth/19nuclear.html?ref=entergycorporation">Entergy Corporation Sues Vermont Over Nuclear License<date>Published: April 18, 2011</date><text>The owners of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant filed a federal lawsuit against state officials on Monday challenging the constitutionality of a state law giving the Vermont legislature veto power over operation of the reactor when its current license expires next March.The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission had granted the 39-year-old reactor a 20-year operating extension last month, setting up a court battle over who will decide whether the plant can operate. The parties bringing the suit are two subsidiaries of the Entergy Corporation, which is based in New Orleans and sells power on the open market. When they bought the plant from local utilities in 2002, they signed an agreement with Vermont’s regulatory agency, the Public Service Board, agreeing that when the plant’s 40-year federal operating license expired in March 2012, its “certificate of public good,” would also need to be renewed. The state requires such certificates of all big power plants. Vermont added another layer when it enacted a law forbidding the Public Service Board from granting such a certificate without the legislature’s approval. In February 2010, the State Senate voted, 26 to 4, to refuse to grant such a certificate to Vermont Yankee, partly at the urging of the governor, Peter Shumlin, who was then a state senator. The House did not vote. Richard Smith, an Entergy executive, said the legislature had improperly taken the decision out of the hands of experts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and given it to “political decision makers.” Only the Nuclear Regulatory Commission can make decisions about safety, he said. But Mr. Shumlin, a Democrat, said the state legislators thought the plant was too old to operate reliably. “I don’t talk about safety; it’s not my concern,” Mr. Shumlin said in a news conference in Montpelier after the suit was filed. Underlying the struggle is that the plant has had embarrassing operational lapses in recent years, and is the same vintage and design of No. 1 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, which was damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Mr. Smith said in a telephone conference call: “You will hear that Entergy is going back on its word and breaking the deal it made in the 2002 Memorandum of Understanding. This is not true. We believe the general assembly changed the rules, and left us with no other choice.” The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Burlington, argues that the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction on nuclear safety questions. But it also says that the state is trying to interfere with the interstate electricity market. It accuses state officials of having suggested that they would grant a new operating certificate to Vermont Yankee if Entergy offered utility price breaks to Vermont residents. That would violate the federal authority’s exclusive right to regulate interstate commerce, the lawsuit says, because it would result in consumers in New Hampshire and Massachusetts paying higher rates. The civil suit, filed by the subsidiaries Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations, names the governor, State Attorney General William Sorrell and the members of the Public Service Board as defendants. Mr. Smith said the plant should be allowed to keep running partly because it had received good ratings from an industry group, but the company refused to release the report. The plant has had operational problems. A wooden cooling tower collapsed in August 2007. Also, plant officials appearing before two state panels were asked whether the reactor could leak tritium, as other reactors have. They answered that it had no buried pipes, but a few months later, a tritium leak was discovered from an underground pipe. Entergy officials said the company tried to sell the troubled reactor, but no buyers stepped forward. The company must decide by July whether to order fuel to run the reactor beyond this fall.The owners of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant filed a federal lawsuit against state officials on Monday challenging the constitutionality of a state law giving the Vermont legislature veto power over operation of the reactor when its current license expires next March.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/nyregion/22indian.html?ref=entergycorporation">Indian Point Operators Dismiss Need for 50-Mile Evacuation Plan<date>Published: March 21, 2011</date><text>WHITE PLAINS — The operators of the Indian Point nuclear power plant said Monday that they did not expect ever to face the combination of earthquake and flooding that devastated Japan this month. But in the aftermath of those disasters, they said, some regulatory changes were to be expected.Executives of Entergy, which owns Indian Point, told the Westchester County Board of Legislators’ Environmental and Energy Committee at a meeting here that it was too soon to know what should be done differently at the plant. They said they did not foresee a natural disaster of the same magnitude in the New York area; the plant is on the Hudson River in Buchanan, 35 miles north of Midtown. But, they said, they did expect regulators to insist on some changes after the damage done to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan. “I have no doubt there will be changes we make in response to this event,” said John McCann, vice president of nuclear safety and licensing for Entergy. But, he said, he was “in no position” to say what they would be. Mr. McCann reassured the legislators that Indian Point had been designed to withstand an earthquake much stronger than any on record in the region, though not one as powerful as the quake that rocked Japan. He said repeatedly that the greater threat to public safety in Japan had come not from the earthquake, but from the tsunami. It was the tsunami, he said, that washed away the tanks of fuel for the emergency generators and left the Japanese unable to keep the plant’s rectors cooled. Indian Point has several sources of power and water that should preclude a similar situation there, he said. Even if all sources failed, he added, there were “severe-accident-management” plans drawn up, calling, for instance, for water from the Hudson to be pumped to the plant to keep the fuel rods and spent fuel rods from overheating. But Michael B. Kaplowitz of Somers, chairman of the environment committee, asked, “How can you test that?” Mr. Kaplowitz wondered aloud if the plan amounted to calling in a “fire brigade” to pump water onto the rods to prevent a meltdown. The Entergy executives said they had been storing spent fuel rods in 10 “dry casks” on concrete pads. The casks, they said, were designed to withstand the degree of shaking that would accompany an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale, the same level, they said, that the plant could handle. Some of the legislators seemed more worried about the plan for evacuating the area around Indian Point, especially after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommended that people in Japan stay at least 50 miles away from the crippled Fukushima plant. The existing evacuation plan for Indian Point adheres only to the current federal standard of a 10-mile radius around a nuclear plant. One legislator, Peter B. Harckham of Katonah, recalled having been among those evacuated after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979. “I can just tell you, it didn’t work,” he said. “It took us well over four hours to go a short distance.” Another legislator, William Burton of Ossining, said that he shared with his neighbors “a not-unreasonable fear of not being warned soon enough” of trouble at Indian Point. “As soon as the siren goes off, I’ll jump in my car and I’ll be in gridlock on 9A before things start,” he said, referring to a highway that runs along the Hudson. Despite the advice the federal regulators gave to people in Japan, the Entergy executives expressed doubt that the evacuation zone would be expanded to reach as far as New York City. Asked if a feasible plan to evacuate much or all of the city could be drawn up, Entergy’s director of emergency planning, Michael J. Slobodien, said neither he nor the federal regulators knew. “We really don’t have enough information to begin to answer that question,” Mr. Slobodien said. He said the idea that regulators would demand an evacuation plan for an area beyond 10 miles was “rank speculation.”WHITE PLAINS — The operators of the Indian Point nuclear power plant said Monday that they did not expect ever to face the combination of earthquake and flooding that devastated Japan this month. But in the aftermath of those disasters, they said, some regulatory changes were to be expected.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/nyregion/17towns.html?ref=entergycorporation">Indian Point Is New York’s Nuclear Question Mark<date>Published: March 16, 2011</date><text>BUCHANAN, N.Y.Charles Lynch, who traps nuisance raccoons, muskrats and coyotes for a living, remembers when Indian Point was a park with a swimming pool and dance pavilion on the Hudson River that drew people from New York City and beyond on sultry summer evenings. But even as a catastrophe is playing out at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan, he’s fine with Indian Point’s current use as a nuclear plant in the heart of the nation’s most densely populated region, 25 miles from New York City. “Not a bit,” said Mr. Lynch, 70, when asked if the Japanese disaster gave him pause about the plant in his backyard. “I’ve been here too long to worry about whether it’s safe. You have to trust that it is. The only people who complain about it are the people who move here from New York City.” In Buchanan, a quiet, dog-eared village, and in nearby communities, Indian Point provides the jobs and the tax dollars. Elsewhere in the region, the attitude toward it is hardly so benign. And as the nuclear disaster lurches along in Japan, it remains to be seen what effect it will have on the future of Indian Point, whose owner, the Entergy Corporation, has applied for its two reactors to be allowed to remain in operation for another 20 years beyond 2013 and 2015, when their 40-year operating licenses expire. For critics, who have tried for decades to shut down a plant they say could never be built today, it’s a moment of truth about the risks they say have been ignored for way too long. “WHEN you see a tragedy like this unfolding halfway around the world, you can’t help but think: can it happen here?” said Paul Gallay, executive director of the environmental group Riverkeeper. “We understand the world better. We understand the earthquake risks better. When you factor in the impossibility of evacuation and the size of the population around it, this is a 40-year-old plant that shouldn’t have a future.” So could it happen here? An Entergy spokesman, Jim Steets, said no, at least not the same crisis as the one in Japan. First, the earthquake risk and history there are incomparably more serious than in New York. And second, it wasn’t the quake that wrecked the plant. It was the tsunami, hardly an issue here. “The risk that Indian Point could be damaged by an earthquake is extremely low,” he said. But indications are that the earthquake risk is worse than previously thought. A 2008 study by researchers at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory found that Indian Point sits at the previously unidentified intersection of two active seismic zones, and could pose a greater earthquake threat than the plant’s design is expected to meet. Officials with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission say the site is safe and that its earthquake threat is on the lower end nationally and in the Northeast. But it is one of 17 nuclear sites being asked to review and reassess seismic issues. Still, said Scott Burnell, a commission spokesman, “The N.R.C. continues to believe that all U.S. plants are capable of withstanding the strongest earthquakes that can be expected at any given site.” It is almost impossible to watch the horrific images from Japan and not think: That could be us, perhaps from something that is as unforeseen here as this level of tsunami was there. Though Fukushima Daiichi is the ultimate nightmare of technology as sorcerer’s apprentice, we live a quieter version of it every day. We don’t want gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale. We don’t want windmills off Cape Cod. We don’t want anything to do with coal or with a liquefied natural gas project like Broadwater in the Long Island Sound, but we want our infinite genie of infinite energy. Indian Point in meltdown is our worst nightmare. But the plant, says Mr. Steets, has also kept millions of tons of pollutants out of the air over its lifetime. And none of the politicians who have jumped aboard the train to shut it have come up with a concerted plan for conservation and alternatives to replace the energy that accounts for as much as 30 percent of New York City’s electricity. In Japan the brooms are going berserk, a Disney horror movie before our eyes. But we’ve also built a monster at home that has propelled our sublime technological joy ride. The nightmare in Japan should keep us up at night. But the one in front of our eyes should, too. We don’t all live in Buchanan. But we do.

No one was injured and no radiation was released, the commission said.Operators at the plant, in Buchanan, declared an “alert,” the second lowest in a four-stage emergency ranking. The fire was extinguished by an automatic system and plant firefighters soon after the explosion, which occurred at 6:49 p.m., officials said. It is unclear when the 36-year-old Indian Point 2 plant will resume operations, said James Steets, a spokesman for the plant’s owner, Entergy, based in Louisiana. The plant will use a spare transformer that is at the site, Mr. Steets said, and making the switch will “take more than a few days.” A transformer fire broke out at the sister reactor, Indian Point 3, in April 2007. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigated and said plant workers had failed to spot potential deterioration in a part that contributed to the fire. The transformers for the two Indian Point reactors are separated by a blast wall as a precaution against one damaging the other. In July 2009 the commission issued a notice to operating reactors tallying transformer failures at Indian Point 3; the aging Oyster Creek nuclear plant near Toms River, N.J.; and other plants in 2007 and 2008, calling the incidence of that kind of failure “relatively high.” Such failures require declaring plant emergencies, starting up emergency diesel generators and the sudden shutting down of the reactor. The commission counts the number of unplanned shutdowns per 7,000 hours of operation, roughly the amount of time that a well-run reactor operates in a year. If the figure rises above three, the commission shifts the plant’s performance in that area from a category of green, which means no problem, to white, a finding of “minor safety significance.” Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the regulatory commission, said it had not yet determined whether the latest shutdown pushed the Indian Point 2 reactor into the white category. If it does, he said, the plant will face additional inspections and the commission’s staff will seek changes in operations to reduce the frequency of shutdowns there. It was a hectic Sunday evening for Entergy. About the time of the Indian Point transformer explosion, operators at the company’s Vermont Yankee reactor in Vernon, Vt., discovered a small leak in a pipe that carries cooling water to the reactor, and they shut down the plant on Sunday night. Mr. Sheehan, the regulatory commission’s spokesman, said that leak did not prompt an emergency alert. Laurence M. Smith, a Vermont Yankee spokesman, said he expected the plant to be back in operation by Wednesday. Last week, Entergy put the Vermont Yankee plant up for sale because the Vermont legislature seems unlikely to give the company permission to run the plant beyond the expiration of its initial 40-year license, in early 2012. Opponents have argued that the reactor, which is 38 years old, is now unreliable. But Mr. Sheehan said Vermont Yankee’s shutdown rate was far less than a level that would set off additional regulatory inspections.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/energy-environment/05nuke.html?ref=entergycorporation">Entergy Puts Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant Up for Sale<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>Entergy Nuclear, evidently convinced that the Vermont legislature will not allow the company to run the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant for another 20 years, announced on Thursday that the plant was up for sale.The company acted two days after Peter E. Shumlin, a prominent opponent of the plant and the state Senate’s president pro tem, was elected governor. It was not immediately clear if a new owner would be more persuasive with the legislature in Montpelier. State lawmakers have reacted vehemently to a series of misstatements and missteps by Entergy and leaks of radioactive tritium at the plant, in Vernon, Vt., on the banks of the Connecticut River near the Massachusetts border. Entergy, based in New Orleans, said it expected multiple parties to be interested in the reactor and that it wanted to keep hundreds of highly skilled employees from seeking work elsewhere. The reactor has been on track to receive a 20-year extension to its initial 40-year license from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But as a condition of Entergy’s acquisition of the plant from local utilities in 2002, the state of Vermont required the legislature’s approval for continued operation. In February the Vermont Senate voted down an extension. It was reacting partly to testimony before two state panels from plant officials on the question of whether Vermont Yankee could leak radioactive material from underground pipes, as other reactors around the country had. The executives replied that Vermont Yankee had no such pipes. Then tests found radioactive tritium that had leaked into the groundwater from an underground pipe. Mr. Shumlin, a Democrat, was a leading force in the February vote. There is some question whether the legislature’s decision would be in the form of a law that would come to him for signature, or in the form of a resolution by the state House and Senate that would not require his assent, but his election does not help Entergy’s prospects. Reached by telephone, Mr. Shumlin said a change of ownership would make no difference. “We have a tired nuclear power plant that was designed to be shut down on schedule in 2012, and we should meet that schedule,” he said. With radioactive materials now in the soil around the plant, he asked, “Why would anyone else want to inherit that legacy? Or pay cash for it?” But Entergy, which paid $180 million for the plant in 2002 and has made substantial investment in it, is apparently hoping to convince a potential buyer that it could win over the legislature. “It may be that people like that plant more than they like Entergy,” James Steets, an Entergy spokesman, said. Randolph D. Brock III, a Republican state senator who won re-election on Tuesday, said the problem was largely Entergy’s “lack of candor and inept government relations.” He added, “Moe, Curly and Larry are more credible than Entergy Louisiana in the Senate.” John J. Reed, an investment banker who specializes in the purchase and sale of nuclear plants, suggested that a sale could be structured for “a new owner with a clean track record” and be contingent on the plant’s winning state approval for continued operation. But other plant opponents agreed with the governor-elect. “The problems are bigger than ownership,” said Sandra Levine, a senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation in Vermont. “The problems at Vermont Yankee come from it being an old plant that’s leaking radioactivity into the environment. That would not be corrected simply by changing ownership.” At Entergy’s headquarters, Michael Burns, a spokesman, said that while the license did not expire until March 2012, the company would have to begin making “some key decisions” in the second quarter of 2011. One decision would be on how, or whether, to refuel the reactor. It is scheduled for refueling next fall. Several companies are likely to be interested in bidding, Mr. Reed said, but the deal would also depend on “how willing Entergy is to take an offer that may be a lot less than they thought the plant was worth two years ago.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/science/earth/23cooling.html?ref=entergycorporation">Indian Point Nuclear Plant’s Toll on River Stirs Debate<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>BUCHANAN, N.Y. — Just beneath the wind-stippled surface of the Hudson River here, huge pipes suck enough water into the Indian Point nuclear plant every second to fill three Olympic swimming pools. And each second they take in dozens of organisms — fish and crabs, but mostly larvae — that are at the center of a $1.1 billion debate: should the plant have to put in cooling towers that would vastly reduce the intake of water?Yes, says New York State, which puts the annual death toll at nearly a billion organisms and is withholding a water permit that the plant would need to extend its initial 40-year operating license. No, says Entergy, the plant owner, which argues that more fish could be saved by installing a different water-intake system. It warns that, if built, the cooling towers would pump tons of pollution into the air of New York’s northern suburbs — and that Westchester County already fails to meet national air quality standards for particulates. But as with all things nuclear, the dispute transcends the issue immediately at hand, and some question whether the debate is really about water. New York State argued recently before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Indian Point poses such a safety risk that its two reactors should be shut down when their licenses expire in 2013 and 2015. “We’ve had opposition here since we started up,” said Joseph E. Pollock, the site vice president for the Indian Point plant, who disputes the idea that water is at the crux of the debate. Water quality is “just an avenue being utilized,” he said. To hedge their bets, environmental groups like Riverkeeper are arguing for both a shutdown and the construction of cooling towers, which would eliminate the need for Indian Point to take in a huge volume of water from the Hudson to condense steam from the power generation process back into water. “We think the world would be a better place with cooling towers,” said Phillip Musegaas, Riverkeeper’s program director. “For us, that’s a separate question from ultimate closure.” The debate over Indian Point’s water use takes physical form at the river’s edge. In between the reactor domes and the shore sit the water intake structures, including big metal machines with thick windows that look a bit like subway cars and enclose a cluster of sprays and rotating parts, like a car wash. Inside the structures, wire mesh screens rotate in a continuous loop in front of six intake pipes, each seven feet in diameter, for each reactor. The screens undergo a gentle spraying that is intended to free animals that have “impinged” on them, releasing them back into the river, and then a stronger one that blasts off leaves and twigs, litter and whatever else came in with the water. The machines were installed in the 1990s as part of an earlier compromise over cooling water. There is some debate about how effective they are at returning fish to the river, but James Steets, a spokesman for the plant, demonstrated one recent morning that they returned at least some. He opened a hatch on a white fiberglass chute that slightly resembled a water slide at a theme park. Inside, swimming vigorously upstream, was a dark fish about the size of a little finger that had been caught on the screen and rinsed off. Then it turned and zipped down with the flow toward a pipe that would carry it out to the middle of the river. A few seconds later, a small crab followed. Smaller living things are sucked right through the screens and then into the plant’s condenser, a giant metal box crossed by rows of small metal tubes. The tubes carry steam that has come from the reactor building and has given off much of its energy to turn a turbine. The turbine spins a generator that makes electricity. With the cool river water inside the box but outside the tubes, the steam condenses back into water that is pumped toward the reactor again to be reboiled into steam. The river water then flows out of the box, through a canal, and eventually back into the river, its temperature, at this time of year, about 15 degrees higher than when it entered. Some eggs and small fish survive their transit through the condenser, Mr. Steets said, but for regulatory purposes, they are assumed to be killed. Among the eggs and baby fish are the shortnose sturgeon, which is endangered. The cooling towers would cut the water intake by about 97 percent and eliminate the threat to the marine organisms. But plant officials argue that the towers would dump salt particles from the Hudson into the air, lowering the area’s air quality. Entergy’s engineers also point out that Indian Point’s two reactors are flanked by hills overlooking the Hudson. The cooling towers, which each would be the size of Yankee Stadium, would have to sit near the level of the Hudson River, requiring extensive excavation, they say. Advocates of the towers counter that Entergy is trying to make construction seem as complicated as possible. Entergy is instead proposing an updated kind of water intake called a “wedge wire” system with a cigar-shape cage covered with a screen like the one on a screen door. It is proposing to install 144 of these cages, which would suck in water more slowly. Entergy argues that far fewer fish hit the screen this way. But the state says Indian Point should use the “best technology available,” which means cooling towers. In a letter denying Entergy’s application for a new water permit, the state said the tower system would save more than 90 percent of the organisms that are now killed. Entergy replies that the wedge wire system would be nearly as effective and could be built years earlier, allowing far more wildlife to be saved in coming years. The view of Mr. Pollock, Entergy’s senior executive at the plant, that the water permit is merely a surrogate for a bigger issue is shared by some industry observers. Some point out that the political outlook for Indian Point is not favorable; the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, who is running for governor, has made closing down the plant the most specific part of his energy platform. Shelby Tucker, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company who follows utilities and independent power producers, attributes much of the opposition not to the fate of aquatic wildlife but to anxieties dating from the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa. “There still persists a certain element that is very much against nuclear, for reasons they feel are appropriate,” he said. “But they might use other reasons to stop the nuclear plant from running.” Yet the stakes are higher than simply the plant’s future, he said. If Indian Point is shut, something will have to take its place to ensure the reliability of the grid in downstate New York. And with the plant’s output removed, Mr. Tucker says, electricity prices would rise for consumers around the state.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/opinion/11wed3.html?ref=entergycorporation">Wrong Answer at Indian Point<date>Published: August 10, 2010</date><text>Ever since New York State ruled in the spring that the obsolete cooling system at the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Buchanan, N.Y., pollutes the Hudson River and kills too many fish, the plant’s owner, the Entergy Corporation, has been seeking public support for what it calls a “smarter solution” to the problem. Finding some solution is important for Entergy, which wants to keep operating Indian Point’s two nuclear reactors, whose federal licenses expire in 2013 and 2015. To renew the licenses for another 20 years, Entergy needs a water-quality certificate from the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The agency denied the certificate in April. Indian Point’s cooling system sucks up about 2.5 billion gallons of river water a day — by far the largest single industrial use of water in New York State, according to the agency. The water passes through the plant and is dumped back in the river, hotter than before. About a billion fish, larvae and eggs are killed each year, trapped against the cooling system’s intake screens or drawn through its pipes, or fatally stressed by the heated water, which holds less oxygen. As it has since the 1970s, the government has pointed Indian Point toward a simple, sure way to solve the problem: cooling towers that recycle water in a closed loop and thus require very little from the river. Environmental law requires power plants to use the “best technology available” to minimize the damage they do, and closed-cycle cooling is widely recognized to be as good as it gets. Entergy officials say otherwise. They have appealed the denial, arguing, among other things, that the cooling towers would take too long to build and would be monstrosities the size of Yankee Stadium. The company also says the new towers would belch dangerous “particulate matter” into the air. Entergy is, therefore, offering another technology: “wedge-wire” screens submerged in the river that they say would protect fish at lower cost. In rebuttal, the state argues that closed-cycle towers could easily be smaller and that the “particulate matter” is harmless water vapor and salt. It also says Entergy’s claim that fish and larvae will swim away from or be swept safely around the screens is unproven and that, in any case, the screens will do nothing to solve the problem of returning heated water to the river. The state also points out that if Indian Point’s owner had been serious about protecting the environment and obeying the law, it would have started on the cooling towers 30 years ago. Instead the company gambled on denial and delay. Entergy is an important energy source for the region. But Albany must make sure that the company addresses, not ducks, the problem.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/nyregion/20newburgh.html?ref=entergycorporation">Judge Refuses to Dismiss Bronx Synagogue Bomb-Plot Case<date>Published: May 19, 2010</date><text>WHITE PLAINS (AP) — A judge has refused to dismiss the case against four men who claimed they were entrapped by a government informant into a plot to bomb two Bronx synagogues and shoot down military planes. Judge Colleen McMahon of United States District Court said legal precedents established that even when the government helped commit a crime, others could be prosecuted. “In case after case, governmental activity that facilitated the commission of a crime has been held not sufficiently outrageous to warrant dismissal of an indictment,” Judge McMahon wrote in a ruling filed on Tuesday. Lawyers for the defendants and for the United States attorney’s office declined to comment. The defendants — James Cromitie, 44; Onta Williams, 32; David Williams, 28; and Laguerre Payen, 27 — are accused of placing what they thought were bombs outside two Bronx synagogues last May. The men, all from Newburgh, N.Y., also are accused of planning to use what they thought was a live Stinger missile against planes at an Air National Guard base in Newburgh. They have pleaded not guilty.The dismissal motion called the alleged plot “a government-inspired creation from Day 1.” It said an informant chose the targets, offered payment, provided maps and bought the only real weapon involved, a handgun. The defendants, who face up to life sentences, claimed “outrageous government conduct.” Judge McMahon said the government “does not exactly deny devising and financing the details of the plot.” Prosecutors claimed that the informant had to act as if he were taking part “in order to gather evidence of illegal conduct, and perhaps even to prevent some jihadist act from actually taking place.” The judge said she might re-examine the issue of government misconduct again after the trial, which is set to begin next month. She said that if she ruled on “how the scenario took place,” she might be intruding on questions a jury should take up. But she expressed doubt that the claim of government misconduct would succeed, even on appeal, because nothing “short of extreme physical or psychological coercion” would be outrageous enough to warrant dismissing an indictment.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/opinion/06tue3.html?ref=entergycorporation">Showdown at Indian Point<date>Published: April 5, 2010</date><text>In a very welcome decision for the health of the Hudson River, New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation has ruled that the obsolete cooling system at the Indian Point nuclear power plant violates the federal Clean Water Act by polluting the river with heated water and needlessly killing vast numbers of fish.

Reactors<date>Published: March 26, 2010</date><text>ALBANY (AP) -- State utility regulators on Thursday rejected a plan by the Entergy Corporation to spin off its six nuclear power stations, including three in New York, into a separate company. The Public Service Commissionacted after its staff determined that the deal was not in the public interest, primarily because the resulting company -- the Enexus Energy Corporation -- could be financially shaky. Entergy, based in New Orleans, had offered concessions that would have reduced the spinoff's initial debt and restricted dividend payouts, among other things. But those were not enough to overcome the commission's concerns. The spinoff has received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, but it still needs permission from New York and Vermont regulators. In New York, Entergy operates the FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County and the Indian Point 2 and 3 reactors in Buchanan, a village in Westchester County. It also runs the Pilgrim Nuclear Station near Plymouth, Mass; the Vermont Yankee plant in Vernon, Vt.; and the Palisades Power Plant in Covert, Mich. The commission said its rules allowed Entergy to ask for a rehearing or to file a new petition. ''We are disappointed in the commission's decision,'' said Michael Burns, an Entergy spokesman. ''We believe our petition, as amended, met the legal standard in New York that applies in this proceeding.''</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/us/26leak.html?ref=entergycorporation">Radioactive Leak Is Fixed at Vermont Plant<date>Published: March 25, 2010</date><text>Technicians have found and fixed two holes in an underground pipe that were allowing radioactive tritium to flow into the groundwater at the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor, the plant’s owner, Entergy, said Thursday.The leak did not contaminate any drinking water, but it did cause a political uproar in Vermont; the State Senate overwhelmingly approved a measure last month that will force the plant to shut in 2012. Reversal is possible, but sentiment in Vermont is running firmly against the plant, which is in Vernon, near the Massachusetts border, because Entergy executives had assured state officials who asked about the potential for underground leaks that it had no pipes that could do so. The source of the leak has been clear for weeks, and the company gave daily updates during the two and a half months of repair work. The Vermont Department of Health has also issued frequent updates. On Thursday, an executive vice president of Entergy, Mark Savoff, promised that the company would become an industry leader in “tritium leak prevention, detection and mitigation.” The company also owns the Indian Point reactors in New York, which also had a tritium leak, as well as the failure of an underground pipe that carried clean water. At Vermont Yankee, technicians found two holes in a pipe that carries radioactive gases from the reactor to a waste processing system. The pipe is buried in an underground concrete casing equipped with a drain, so that leaked liquids would be captured. But over the years, the drain became clogged with mud and debris, the company said, and the tritium seeped through an unsealed joint. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen, and at Vermont Yankee, it is incorporated into water molecules. Thus, it cannot be filtered out. Entergy will pump some contaminated water out of the soil, purify it and use it within the plant, the company said; it will also remove about 150 cubic feet of contaminated soil and send it to a licensed dump.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27nuke.html?ref=entergycorporation">As Clock Ticks, Nuclear Plant Searches for Leak<date>Published: February 26, 2010</date><text>VERNON, Vt. — At Vermont Yankee, a nuclear reactor on the ropes, the search for a tritium leak that may doom the plant is proceeding as quickly as possible — which is to say, at a painstaking pace.Over the last few weeks, in the buildup to a vote Wednesday in which the State Senate approved shutting down the plant, engineers have been digging well after well here in an exploratory strategy that evokes the child’s game of Battleship. At each spot, workers measure the level of radioactive tritium found in the water in the hope of triangulating their way to the source of the contamination. To avoid losing track of the wells under the blanket of snow that renews itself here every few days, the locations are marked with yellow cones like the ones janitors use to warn of wet floors. Finding and fixing the leak would be a first step toward rebuilding the plant’s credibility — crucial if the owner, the Louisiana-based nuclear company Entergy, is to persuade lawmakers to reverse their decision to force the plant to close when its license expires in 2012. In voting 26 to 4 on Wednesday to shut the plant, senators cited the leak, a collapsed cooling tower and initial denials by company employees that underground pipes carry tritium — even though they do. Now, based on the tritium levels logged at various spots, a team of several dozen technicians, chemists, hydrologists and others who have been working in shifts around the clock think they may have found their target. In recent days, they have been digging toward a two-inch steel pipe wrapped in a plastic one that is itself surrounded by concrete. The operation is unfolding in a narrow industrial alley between two plant buildings in a late winter jumble of snow, mud, scaffolding and railings covered with bright orange plastic mesh to prevent anything from falling in. In the world beyond the plant fence, digging this trench would take about two days, supervisors say. But as this is an operating nuclear plant, the effort has taken more than two weeks. There are no shovels, but a device that is a cross between a giant Shop-Vac and a Waterpik: it sucks up dirt and squirts a jet of water to loosen the soil when necessary. This excavation, 13 feet long and 7 feet wide, is now about 15 feet deep. Four essential pipes that are closer to the surface — two carrying fuel for the reactor’s emergency diesel generators and two carrying air used to power equipment at the plant — are suspended near the center of the trench, forming obstacles to be assiduously avoided. To prevent a cave-in, the trench is lined with steel plates on each side that are also handled delicately. On Thursday, one of them, perhaps caught on a rock or other obstruction, was refusing to slide down toward the ever-lowering bottom. So supervisors brought in a huge backhoe on caterpillar treads to try to tap it farther down. “In the real world, you’d just bang it in,” said Tom Wrinn, a supervisor from Shaw Inc., a contractor digging the trench. “But you can’t do that here.” Mr. Wrinn watched intently as the backhoe operator maneuvered a giant claw under the roofing his men had erected to keep rainwater out of the trench. The operator set the claw down on top of the plate. Nothing happened. So the workers gave up and went back to digging with the giant vacuum. “We’re being ultra-careful,” Mr. Wrinn said. Updates on the operation are issued regularly, and health officials continue to monitor the area’s drinking water. No tritium has shown up in any drinking water wells, and there is no evidence that anyone has been exposed to radiation from the leaks. Strewn with laptop computers, cellphones, beepers, grubby jackets slung on chair backs and heroic quantities of soft drink bottles, a conference room known as the “tritium room” operates 24 hours a day. Blueprints tacked to the walls show underground piping, monitoring wells and other plant equipment. (Another contractor continues to sink more wells around Vermont Yankee, which lies on the western side of the Connecticut River, just north of the Massachusetts border.) Some technicians and engineers holed up here are long-time employees of Vermont Yankee, which opened in 1972 and is one of the nation’s oldest nuclear plants. Others include specialists in finding flaws in buried piping who use ultrasound and other techniques perfected in the oil and gas industries. For the nuclear industry as a whole, the safety issues raised by tritium leaks have political implications. The dispute over the fate of Vermont Yankee arose just as the Obama administration was promoting a revival of nuclear plant construction backed by billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees. The push for such construction is cast mainly as a drive to embrace clean and renewable energy sources but is also aimed at drawing Republican support in Congress for a climate and energy bill. Adding to the urgency over the leak is regulatory pressure. “We expect them to move forward and fix the problem,” said Donald E. Jackson, a branch chief at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s regional office of reactor projects, who was at the site this week. While the commission is disposed toward extending the plant’s lease for another two decades, Entergy now needs the approval of Vermont’s House and the Senate to reverse itself for that to happen. “We want to get this behind us,” said Timothy Trask, Entergy’s chief engineer, who grew up in the area and was sent back to oversee the fix. “We are fixing it,” he added firmly, “and getting ready for the next 20 years.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25nuke.html?ref=entergycorporation">Vermont Senate Votes to Close Nuclear Plant<date>Published: February 24, 2010</date><text>MONTPELIER, Vt. — In an unusual state foray into nuclear regulation, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 Wednesday to block operation of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant after 2012, citing radioactive leaks, misstatements in testimony by plant officials and other problems.Unless the chamber reverses itself, it will be the first time in more than 20 years that the public or its representatives has decided to close a reactor. The vote came just more than a week after President Obama declared a new era of rebirth for the nation’s nuclear industry, announcing federal loan guarantees of $8.3 billion to assure the construction of a twin-reactor plant near Augusta, Ga. While it is unclear how Vermont Yankee’s fate could influence the future of nuclear power nationally, the reactor’s recent troubles are viewed by some as a challenge to arguments that such plants are clean, well run and worth building. Vermont’s governor, Jim Douglas, a Republican, said after the Senate’s vote that he and other governors had met with Mr. Obama on Monday and that Mr. Obama had spoken “passionately” about the need for more reactors. “It’s ironic that at the same time the president is advancing a strong commitment to nuclear energy, that we’re taking a step in another direction here,” said Mr. Douglas, who had sought to delay a vote until public outrage about several recent missteps at the plant cooled a bit. In a small, ornate chamber packed with plant opponents, the Vermont senators voiced frustration over recent leaks of radioactive tritium at the 38-year-old plant as well as the collapse of a cooling tower in 2007 and inaccurate testimony by the plant’s owner, the Louisiana-based nuclear operator Entergy. Plant officials had testified under oath to two state panels that there were no buried pipes at Vermont Yankee that could leak tritium, although there were. No tritium has turned up in drinking water, but even plant supporters expressed dismay at the leak and the misstatements. “If the board of directors and management of Entergy were thoroughly infiltrated by antinuclear activists, I do not think they could have done a better job of destroying their own case,” said one senator, Randolph D. Brock III, a St. Albans Republican who cast several votes friendly to the plant. In the hours of debate, one virtue of nuclear power emphasized by proponents at the national level — production of electricity without emissions of greenhouse gases — was hardly mentioned, even by supporters. Entergy said in a statement after the vote, “We remain determined to prove our case to the legislature.” Under Vermont law, any extension of the plant’s license beyond 2012 would have to be approved by both houses. Unless the Senate reverses itself and the House also approves an extension, the plant must close by March of that year. All members of the House and the Senate are up for re-election in November, raising the possibility that a vote next year on the plant’s fate could yield a different outcome. Democrats have large majorities in both chambers. But the company faces a struggle in allaying the concerns of lawmakers and their constituents. In debate, senators cited estimates of over $1 billion for decommissioning the plant, although only about $450 million is on hand for the job. Tritium leaks could raise the bill, they said. Before debate began Wednesday morning, Entergy said it had instructed a law firm to examine the misstatements its officials had made under oath and concluded that officials had not intended to deceive the state. It said communications had “led to misunderstandings,” and a result was that “the responses were incomplete and misleading.” Curt L. Hébert, a spokesman for the company, said that Entergy had put five senior employees on administrative leave and that “all the discipline taken had financial consequences for the employees involved.” Mr. Hébert acknowledged in an interview that the leaks, the cooling tower collapse in 2007 and other problems had been “almost a perfect storm” for the plant. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said his agency would investigate the issue of the company’s providing false information to the state. The commission said the structure that collapsed, one of several cooling towers at the plant, was not required for the safe shutdown of the plant, but the distinction did little to buff the plant’s image. In a move that has also deepened public unease, Entergy has been trying to spin off the reactor and five others, including the Indian Point reactors in New York, into a new company that would borrow money to pay back Entergy and sell stock on Wall Street. Many opponents in Vermont worry that this would allow Entergy, based in New Orleans, to avoid legal liability for any problems at the plants and that a spinoff could be detrimental to the state. “It’s a dump job,” said Nancy Braus, a plant opponent from Putney who watched the Senate action from a corner of the chamber.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D61F3FF932A25751C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=entergycorporation">NATIONAL BRIEFING | NEW ENGLAND; New Hampshire: Inquiry Sought at Nuclear Plant<date>Published: February 11, 2010</date><text>Gov.

Go to Blog » Owners of the Vermont Yankee plant, along the Connecticut River just north of the Massachusetts border near Brattleboro, are seeking a 20-year extension of the plant’s operating license, which expires in 2012. But the rising radiation levels, an indication that reactor water is leaking into the soil, have stirred deep concern about the plant’s safety and the credibility of its operators. So far no tritium has been found in any drinking water wells, nor have raised concentrations of radioactive material been found in the river, the source of the plant’s cooling water. Vermont’s governor, Jim Douglas, a longtime supporter of the plant, said on Wednesday in a statement that recent events had “raised dark clouds of doubt” about the reactor’s safety and management. He suggested that the Legislature put off any decisions on the future of the plant, located in the town of Vernon. If the nuclear plant were to be denied an extension, it would be the first such move by the public or its representatives since 1989, when residents in Sacramento voted to close the Rancho Seco nuclear plant, owned by their municipal utility. No state legislature has ever voted to close one. Vermont’s state health department has been posting updates almost daily on the monitoring at the plant. “I’m not defining an immediate public health threat, but it’s very concerning when we don’t understand the mechanism,” the state’s health commissioner, Dr. Wendy Davis, said in an interview by telephone. The plant began searching for tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, under a 2007 nuclear industry initiative. The industry began the effort because leaks had been found at reactors in Illinois and New York. Levels found in the last few days exceed the federal standard for drinking water, although they were found in monitoring wells, not drinking water wells. The state has moved to weekly from monthly testing at the elementary school across the street from the plant, but has not detected anything unusual off the plant site. The top elected official in the town of Vernon, Michael A. Ball, who has worked at Vermont Yankee since 1985 and is a senior engineer there, went to the state capitol last week with other local officials to urge the Legislature to refrain from taking up the safety issue. They argued that a professional panel should decide whether the reactor was safe. Mr. Ball said that some legislators had told him that the discovery of the radioactive contamination “gave them pause” and that they wanted more information before voting. “Others were adamant,” he said, telling him flatly that the recent discovery had “pushed them off the fence and they’re voting against it.” Other factors cloud the plant’s future. A vice president of Entergy, the company that owns the plant, had told state officials he did not believe the plant had underground piping that carried radioactive material, although it does. And Entergy is seeking permission to spin off Vermont Yankee and five of its other reactors into a new subsidiary, a move that the plant’s opponents view as an attempt to limit Entergy’s legal liability. A cooling tower at Vermont Yankee collapsed in 2007. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the tower was not needed to assure safety, but the incident shook public confidence. “Their problem is that the plant is too old to be reliable or safe,” said James W. Moore, an energy expert at the Montpelier office of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group. Tritium is usually incorporated into a water molecule, and such molecules behave chemically just as ordinary water does. But it gives off a beta particle that can cause damage inside the body. Like ordinary water molecules, those incorporating tritium pass through the body quickly. In November, technicians measured tritium at Vermont Yankee at 700 picocuries per liter. But in January the plant notified the state that the level had risen to thousands of picocuries per liter. In one monitoring well, it recently exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’s standard for drinking water, which is 20,000 picocuries per liter. Plant workers also found that water in a concrete trench that holds pipes in one building contained millions of picocuries of tritium per liter, as well as traces of other radioactive materials. It was not immediately clear if water could find its way from that trench into the groundwater. Under federal rules, the plant does not have to alert the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the presence of tritium in the groundwater unless the level reaches 30,000 picocuries per liter. At that point it would have 30 days to tell the commission, and specify what it planned to do. Robert Williams, a spokesman for Vermont Yankee, said the company was working hard to find a leak. “It’s a necessarily slow and methodical process,” he said. The plant is already in touch with federal and state regulators, he added. Dozens of reactors around the country have had their 40-year licenses extended by 20 years without much debate. Under the Atomic Energy Act, such decisions are usually the sole purview of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But Vermont struck a deal with Entergy when it bought the plant in 2002 that gave legislators a veto role. An official with the federal nuclear commission noted that if the state blocked a license renewal, Entergy could file a court challenge. Vermont Yankee is the largest generator of power in Vermont. But New England’s power grid has a surplus of electricity because of the recession.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Michael Nagle for The New York Times A small hole caused by corrosion allowed about 100,000 gallons of water to escape from a pipe at the Indian Point 2 plant, north of New York City. Multimedia Graphic A Hidden Underground Leak Related Times Topics: Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant (NY) A one-and-a-half-inch hole caused by corrosion allowed about 100,000 gallons of water to escape from the main system that keeps the reactor cool immediately after any shutdown, according to nuclear experts. The leak was discovered on Feb. 16, according to the plant’s owner, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, a subsidiary of the Entergy Corporation. Entergy and the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission emphasized that the Indian Point reactor could still have been shut down safely with either of two other backup systems, although operators generally avoid using both. They also stressed that the supply pipe was quickly repaired after the leak was found and that the water itself, which is cleaner than tap water, posed no environmental threat. Yet the leak’s discovery has prompted Entergy and the regulatory commission to begin studying how the chief system for cooling during shutdowns, so important that the Indian Point 2 has three pumps in place to do the same job, could be endangered by the failure of a single part. More broadly, it has raised concerns about the monitoring of decades-old buried pipes at the nation’s nuclear plants, many of which are applying for renewal of their operating licenses. Indian Point 2, whose 40-year operating license expires in 2013, already faces harsh criticism from New York State and county officials who want it shut down. This week Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads a House subcommittee on energy and the environment, said the leak raised serious questions about Entergy’s and the regulatory commission’s oversight. “This leak may demonstrate a systemic failure of the licensee and the commission to inspect critical buried pipes in a manner sufficient to guarantee the public health and safety,” he wrote to the commission’s chairman, Dale Klein, in a letter on Thursday. The letter was also signed by Representative John J. Hall, whose district includes the plant. The congressmen said they were “shocked” that a leak that big could develop without detection and called the system for detecting such problems “profoundly inadequate.” One argument raised by New York State in opposing extension of the license of Indian Point 2 or the adjacent Indian Point 3 reactor is that crucial components are aging in ways that the operators may not anticipate or understand. The supply pipe at issue, measuring eight inches in diameter, is used to fill a 600,000-gallon tank that is employed whenever the plant “trips,” or shuts down because of an equipment malfunction. Such shutdowns are not unusual; one occurred on April 3, roughly a month after the pipe was fixed. James F. Steets, a spokesman for Indian Point, said it was unclear when the leak began. The company initially said the pipe was losing 18 gallons a minute but later amended that to 12; either number is small relative to the 600,000-gallon tank, he said. Mr. Steets said that the water level in the tank offered no clue that the supply pipe was leaking. The tank has an alarm to indicate its water level is falling, he said, but it did not sound because an automatic system was topping off the tank with purified water. At a nuclear plant, a central water system takes heat from the reactor in the form of steam and turns it into electricity. During a shutdown at Indian Point 2, that system often turns off and a pipe measuring 12 inches in diameter carries water from the tank into the cooling system to carry off excess heat. The buried portion of neither the eight-inch supply pipe nor the 12-inch pipe connecting the tank to the reactor cooling system has been visually inspected since the reactor began operating in August 1973, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Nor does the commission require such inspections.

Multimedia Graphic A Hidden Underground Leak Related Times Topics: Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant (NY) A one-and-a-half-inch hole caused by corrosion allowed about 100,000 gallons of water to escape from the main system that keeps the reactor cool immediately after any shutdown, according to nuclear experts. The leak was discovered on Feb. 16, according to the plant’s owner, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, a subsidiary of the Entergy Corporation. Entergy and the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission emphasized that the Indian Point reactor could still have been shut down safely with either of two other backup systems, although operators generally avoid using both. They also stressed that the supply pipe was quickly repaired after the leak was found and that the water itself, which is cleaner than tap water, posed no environmental threat. Yet the leak’s discovery has prompted Entergy and the regulatory commission to begin studying how the chief system for cooling during shutdowns, so important that the Indian Point 2 has three pumps in place to do the same job, could be endangered by the failure of a single part. More broadly, it has raised concerns about the monitoring of decades-old buried pipes at the nation’s nuclear plants, many of which are applying for renewal of their operating licenses. Indian Point 2, whose 40-year operating license expires in 2013, already faces harsh criticism from New York State and county officials who want it shut down. This week Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads a House subcommittee on energy and the environment, said the leak raised serious questions about Entergy’s and the regulatory commission’s oversight. “This leak may demonstrate a systemic failure of the licensee and the commission to inspect critical buried pipes in a manner sufficient to guarantee the public health and safety,” he wrote to the commission’s chairman, Dale Klein, in a letter on Thursday. The letter was also signed by Representative John J. Hall, whose district includes the plant. The congressmen said they were “shocked” that a leak that big could develop without detection and called the system for detecting such problems “profoundly inadequate.” One argument raised by New York State in opposing extension of the license of Indian Point 2 or the adjacent Indian Point 3 reactor is that crucial components are aging in ways that the operators may not anticipate or understand. The supply pipe at issue, measuring eight inches in diameter, is used to fill a 600,000-gallon tank that is employed whenever the plant “trips,” or shuts down because of an equipment malfunction. Such shutdowns are not unusual; one occurred on April 3, roughly a month after the pipe was fixed. James F. Steets, a spokesman for Indian Point, said it was unclear when the leak began. The company initially said the pipe was losing 18 gallons a minute but later amended that to 12; either number is small relative to the 600,000-gallon tank, he said. Mr. Steets said that the water level in the tank offered no clue that the supply pipe was leaking. The tank has an alarm to indicate its water level is falling, he said, but it did not sound because an automatic system was topping off the tank with purified water. At a nuclear plant, a central water system takes heat from the reactor in the form of steam and turns it into electricity. During a shutdown at Indian Point 2, that system often turns off and a pipe measuring 12 inches in diameter carries water from the tank into the cooling system to carry off excess heat. The buried portion of neither the eight-inch supply pipe nor the 12-inch pipe connecting the tank to the reactor cooling system has been visually inspected since the reactor began operating in August 1973, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Nor does the commission require such inspections. Paul Blanch, an electrical engineer and nuclear safety expert who worked at Indian Point in 2001 and 2002, said that because neither pipe had been inspected, except for a short section that was replaced when the hole was located in February, “they shouldn’t be operating right now.” He said the plant could be operating with a backup system that is ready to fail. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/31quakewe.html?ref=entergycorporation">Renewed Concerns for Nuclear Plant Critics<date>Published: August 29, 2008</date><text>BUCHANAN Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » AMID their worries about whether the Indian Point nuclear plant’s new emergency sirens would sound, if necessary, and whether evacuation routes could accommodate panicked throngs in an emergency, Westchester residents now have another worst-case scenario to consider: one from beneath the ground. The plant may be more vulnerable to earthquakes than experts previously thought, because it sits less than a mile south of a newly identified seismic zone running from Stamford, Conn., to Peekskill, according to a study by Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The study compiled information about 383 earthquakes within a 15,000-square-mile-area around New York City since 1677 and analyzed 34 years of new data on tremors recorded by modern technology. Based on this research, scientists say magnitude-5 earthquakes  strong enough to cause damage  should be expected in the region about every 100 years. The most recent one occurred in 1884. “The last one just knocked over a few chimneys, but now, with our population density, we’d see some buildings falling, people getting killed,” said John Armbruster, one of the study’s authors, adding that a major tremor could damage aging bridges and Indian Point’s nuclear reactors. About 20 million people live within 50 miles of the plant, which generates 20 to 40 percent of the electricity used by Westchester and New York City. “There should be more engineering studies of how the plant would respond to a magnitude-5 earthquake a few kilometers away,” Mr. Armbruster said. “We think that’s a realistic possibility, though at a low level, and we question whether the studies, which were done when the plant was originally designed, in the early 1970s, are adequate, knowing what we know now.” Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York; Riverkeeper, the Hudson River watchdog organization; and others who oppose the efforts of the plant’s owner, Entergy Nuclear, to get a 20-year license extension for Indian Point’s reactors  set to expire in 2013 and 2015  have seized on this study as more evidence for their cause. But Entergy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials insist that the plant was built to withstand up to a magnitude-6 quake, which the Lamont-Doherty study estimates might occur once every 670 years. A magnitude-7 quake is estimated to occur once every 3,400 years. Neither magnitude has ever been recorded in the area. James Steets, an Entergy spokesman, said construction of the plant took into account the strength of previous earthquakes and the plant’s proximity to the Ramapo fault, about two miles away. The resulting precautions, including giant shock absorbers, would prevent damage to the equipment, or the plant would safely shut down, he said. “This may be new information about this fault line, but it doesn’t change, in any remarkable way, what we’re presently prepared for,” Mr. Steets said. He said that what concerned him about the study was that people would become “unnecessarily fearful.” Of the 154 challenges to the plant’s relicensing application, the N.R.C. has agreed to hear debate on 15 points, according to Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the commission. The study’s findings will not be included, because under current regulations, license renewal procedures do not take earthquake or terrorism threats into consideration. Nevertheless, Lynn R. Sykes, the study’s lead author and a longtime critic of Indian Point, said the commission should make an exception for Lamont-Doherty’s updated seismic findings, in addition to all the other environmental and safety objections raised to the relicensing application. “Earthquake science is far more advanced now than it was 30 years ago,” he said. “We need to have a full hearing of these issues.” More Articles in New York Region » A version of this article appeared in print on August 31, 2008, on page WE6 of the New York edition.BUCHANAN Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » AMID their worries about whether the Indian Point nuclear plant’s new emergency sirens would sound, if necessary, and whether evacuation routes could accommodate panicked throngs in an emergency, Westchester residents now have another worst-case scenario to consider: one from beneath the ground.

Skip to next paragraph Related Indian Point Faulted on Siren-Upgrade Effort (August 3, 2008) A broader plan by the plants’ owner, Entergy, to spin them off into a new holding company continues to meet resistance from state officials, who worry that the proposal would not be in taxpayers’ interest. The spinoff has received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but still needs approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the state level, it needs the approval of the Public Service Commission in New York, and regulators in Vermont. The main concern among state officials is that the spinoff could shield Entergy from several hundred million dollars in costs associated with the eventual decommissioning of the two Indian Point plants, in Westchester County, and the FitzPatrick plant, in Oswego County. That would increase the risk that eventually, taxpayers in New York would have to foot the bill. Entergy could also be insulated from more than $1 billion in costs related to a potential overhaul of the cooling system at Indian Point, which is the subject of an ongoing battle between the company and the state. Environmental groups have complained that the current cooling system has been calamitous for the fish population in the Hudson River. This month, the State Department of Environmental Conservation ruled that the plant’s cooling system was responsible for “excessive fish kills,” and recommended that it be completely overhauled. But the matter remains the subject of a legal battle so far unresolved. The state’s victory involved a revenue-sharing plan that Entergy wanted to end, but that it will keep following negotiations with the State Power Authority. Entergy’s proposal was disclosed this year in securities filings, which laid out a new holding company called Enexus that would include nuclear plants in New York and Vermont. In a clause in one of those filings, Entergy claimed that Enexus would not have to live up to the revenue-sharing agreement between Entergy and New York. Under the existing agreement, Entergy is supposed to pay New York up to $72 million annually through 2014, and state officials had expected to receive the full amount. The money is due to go to the State Power Authority, which provides low-cost electricity to businesses and municipalities and administers various programs like replacing coal furnaces in public schools and providing energy-efficient refrigerators to public-housing residents. Following negotiations in recent weeks with the Power Authority, which was threatening legal action, Entergy backed off from arguably the most controversial part of its spinoff proposal  at least in the minds of New York officials. “Entergy and N.Y.P.A. have agreed that any payments due N.Y.P.A. under the amended value-sharing agreements will continue despite the proposed reorganization,” said Gil C. Quiniones, the Power Authority’s chief operating officer. Future payments “will not be affected by approval of the spinoff transaction,” Alex J. Schott, an Entergy spokesman, said. “With New York State already feeling the financial pinch, Entergy’s decision to ditch its ill-conceived plan is a huge win for New Yorkers,” Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement. His office has urged the Public Service Commission to block the spinoff and hold public hearings, and has been an active participant in the commission’s proceedings. Alex Detrick, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said that the attorney general “remains opposed to Entergy’s plan.” Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who has long been a critic of the state’s privatization of Indian Point, said that “the fight over the reorganization is going to continue.” “I can’t think of a mistake New York made of more consequence in the last 10 years than the sale of Indian Point,” Mr. Brodsky added. “If this is a model of privatization, it’s a horror show. We’re in this fight just to get them to keep their written commitments.” Mr. Schott said that the company had set aside adequate funds for decommissioning, as required by federal law. “Those funds are reviewed every two years” by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, he said, “and annually in the last five years of a license.” Jim Steets, another spokesman for Entergy, said that the company "would clearly have the financial wherewithal" to undertake such projects. Critics of Entergy worry that the decommissioning could cost billions more than the company has set aside, and that the new holding company might not have the funds to bear such costs.

The new $30 million siren system requires approval by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and was not ready by an Aug. 14 deadline. Entergy Nuclear Operations Inc., the company that runs Indian Point, has paid almost $800,000 for missing deadlines and may have to pay more. “It’s been a very long process,” Anthony W. Sutton, commissioner of the Westchester County Department of Emergency Services, said after a meeting on Aug. 8. “But we’re going to have an excellent siren system.” At a public meeting attended by a handful of Westchester residents, officials from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Westchester County and Entergy explained the system of 172 sirens. The system would warn people inside a 10-mile radius of the plant in an emergency. Under the 2005 Energy Policy Act, plant operators were required to create a system that would work if power failed. The sirens are required to blast a tone of at least 70 decibels in high-population areas and of at least 60 decibels in lower-population areas, said Jim Trapp, siren project manager for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Nine homes inside a 5-mile radius from the plant were not in a position to hear a steady, four-minute tone at the minimum decibel levels and have been given the tone alert radios, which retail for around $60, he said. Another 2,445 households situated from 5 to 10 miles from the plant are in areas where the minimum decibel levels cannot be heard and will be offered the radios by November, the company said. “They would rather be given radios than have a siren built in their backyard,” Mr. Trapp said. There are 100,000 people living within 10 miles of Indian Point, and the area includes all or parts of Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties. Phillip Musegaas, policy director for Riverkeeper, a Hudson River watchdog group, said he would be “very happy” when the siren system was done, but was skeptical because of Entergy’s missed deadlines. “It suggests they’re not prepared,” Mr. Musegaas said after the meeting. Fred Dacimo, vice president of Entergy, said the system is “ready to be put into service,” but is awaiting approval from FEMA. “This is the most sophisticated system of its type in the United States,” Mr. Dacimo said. “I think we are doing the public a disservice if we don’t put this in service quickly.” Mike Beeman, director of disaster assistance for FEMA, said that the agency was reviewing every aspect of the siren system. He said that FEMA received Entergy’s final report on the system on April 6 and said it could take 60 days to review. Mr. Dacimo said once FEMA approved the system, it could be functional in two to eight days. Neil A. Sheehan, public affairs officer for the N.R.C., said the agency would wait until the system was approved to decide on a penalty for missing the latest deadline. Entergy submitted a plan to the agency in April 2006 to meet a January 2007 deadline and began work in May 2006 before FEMA had given its approval. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission extended that January 2007 deadline once, but fined Entergy $780,000 for missing two more. The new siren system has 11 control stations, including at least two in each county, and the sirens could be activated by electric or microwave signals, officials said. David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project for the Union of Concerned Scientists, attended the meeting. “This has been like a soap opera for the past two years,” he said. “But it looks like it’s finally done, and it seems like it’s a pretty thorough system.” More Articles in New York Region » A version of this article appeared in print on August 17, 2008, on page WE5 of the New York edition.TARRYTOWN Skip to next paragraph Alan Zale for The New York Times CONTRAST A new warning siren, left, and the old one, on right, at Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson.

Entergy submitted a plan to the agency in April 2006 to meet a January 2007 deadline and began work in May 2006 before FEMA had given its approval. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission extended that January 2007 deadline once, but fined Entergy $780,000 for missing two more. The new siren system has 11 control stations, including at least two in each county, and the sirens could be activated by electric or microwave signals, officials said. David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project for the Union of Concerned Scientists, attended the meeting. “This has been like a soap opera for the past two years,” he said. “But it looks like it’s finally done, and it seems like it’s a pretty thorough system.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/03nukewe.html?ref=entergycorporation">Indian Point Faulted on Siren-Upgrade Effort<date>Published: August 3, 2008</date><text>THE panel of outside experts hired by Entergy Nuclear to review operations at Indian Point, part of the company’s campaign to improve its image as it seeks a 20-year license extension, found generally that the plant complied with minimum standards, but picked out one “very visible exception,” the emergency sirens. Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » The plant installed a siren system in the early 1980s, after new rules that followed the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pa., required them. In 2005, however, the Energy Policy Act set a new standard that applied only to Indian Point, for a siren system that would work even if the power failed. According to the outside experts, Entergy began work promptly on a system with a battery backup, but a “decision to provide a world-class system that exceeds regulatory requirements, while well-intentioned, had substantial bearing on the ultimate project failures.” One problem is that Entergy submitted a plan to the Federal Emergency Management Agency at the end of April 2006 and then started work in May, before FEMA replied. The company was trying to meet a January 2007 deadline. Entergy planned for 150 sirens in the 10-mile area surrounding the reactors, which are in Buchanan, on the east bank of the Hudson River, but when FEMA provided the requirements, the company realized it would have to add five more sirens. The emergency management agency, the panel said, provided “unclear and at times inconsistent criteria” for approval of the system. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission extended the January 2007 deadline once but declined to do so again, and it has assessed $780,000 in fines for being late. Entergy is now working against a deadline of Aug. 14, with the outcome uncertain. “Over all, the entire siren upgrade program was not conducted with the rigor demanded of a regulatory-driven major nuclear plant project,” the experts found. And missing the deadlines “undermined N.R.C.’s confidence in the licensee and aggravated Entergy’s relationship problems with Indian Point stakeholders.” But the report did point out that while Entergy had fumbled and missed deadlines for improvements, the old system was still in place. According to the outside investigators: Entergy did not pick the vendor well or supervise the company it hired properly; it did a poor job of management; and it did not properly understand the requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. It was also slowed down because it picked unfamiliar technology. Entergy would have had an easier task if it had limited itself to installing battery backup, said Martin Vonk, one of 12 members of the panel. Mr. Vonk , a former reactor operator, has worked as an emergency preparedness manager at several nuclear utilities. The sirens are switched on by radio, and “one of the problems, industrywide, with sirens, has been the ability to communicate with them in an environment when more and more people are using up the available radio frequencies,” he said. Entergy tried out a new radio system, similar to cellphone communications, “and they ran into problems,” Mr. Vonk said. The panel also said that in the decades since the Three Mile Island accident, communications technology has changed. In response to that accident, before there were emergency planning requirements, the police drove through the streets, issuing warnings through loudspeakers, and eventually went door to door. Sirens, the report noted, do not convey sophisticated information; e-mail messages or calls to homes and cellphones would do more.

The four-month, $4 million study by a panel of 12 outside experts was an unusual exercise paid for by the plant’s owner, Entergy Nuclear, as a way to increase public confidence as it seeks to extend the licenses on the two reactors. The panel’s report said that in many areas, the plant compared favorably with “top-performing plants” around the country. But it also said Entergy had not spent enough time establishing relationships of trust with local elected officials, and had even cut back on the number of people assigned to work with local governments on emergency planning. Westchester County’s government has boycotted some emergency planning activities involving the plant, at times arguing that no safe evacuation is possible and that the plant should close. Coincidentally on Thursday, a panel of administrative law judges at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it had decided that 15 arguments raised by opponents of the extension of the licenses were worthy of a full hearing. That decision is nearly certain to make Indian Point’s license extension process the most drawn-out of its type. The judges agreed to hear arguments by New York State that Entergy lacks a thorough program for managing the aging of the two reactors, and that Entergy had underestimated the cost of a cleanup of radiation off site, if an accident were to occur. It rejected New York’s arguments that the plant is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. The state is appealing that rejection in court. Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, said his office would “fight tooth and nail against the relicensing of Indian Point.” The license for Indian Point 2 expires in 2013, and the license for Indian Point 3 in 2015, but both licenses are automatically extended until the commission issues its ruling. The other reactor, Indian Point 1, closed in 1974. Westchester County also opposes the relicensing, but the county’s director of emergency planning, Anthony W. Sutton, said he was encouraged by the independent panel’s report. He and about 15 other local officials were briefed on it for more than two hours on Thursday morning. “We went into this kind of tongue-in-cheek,” he said. “Many people were questioning the integrity of the panel if it had been commissioned by Entergy.” But, he said, “the report seems to be written in a very frank fashion. It seems that the group had the courage of their convictions and called it what it was.” The study said that even the part of emergency preparedness that is within the sole control of the plant owners needs improvement. The emergency operations command center meets regulatory requirements but “would be suboptimal for extended use in a major emergency.” With the exception of missing repeated deadlines for installing new battery-powered emergency sirens, the plant meets minimum requirements, the panel observed. Likewise, security preparations meet the regulations but have “some shortcomings.” The security team “has developed sound strategies for dealing with a range of possible security threats including some scenarios well beyond those that the plant is required to prepare for by regulations,” the report said. Some of the security findings were not made public. In a statement, Entergy noted one of the panel’s central conclusions, that the plant “is fundamentally safe and secure,” and said it was forming a team to fix the problems cited. Entergy said it got an oral briefing on Wednesday and got the written report only on Thursday, shortly before the public release, and that it would offer a formal response within 60 days. The report also said that the reactors’ electricity plays “an important role in the electric reliability and economic health of New York City and the surrounding areas.” The site, in Buchanan on the east bank of the Hudson River, suffers from “legacy equipment abandonment and inadequate attention to infrastructure appearance,” the report said. A co-chairman for the study, James T. Rhodes, a former president and chief executive of the Virginia Electric and Power Company, said, “The impression you get when you go in the gate is, ‘Boy, this is an old facility.’ ” The study did not address one of the central issues of relicensing: how well Entergy could cope with aging parts and equipment. It did note another problem of old plants, that many key people are approaching retirement, at a time when the familiar training ground for reactor operators, the Navy’s submarine fleet, is turning out fewer veterans. And attracting utility workers to the Hudson Valley is a challenge, the experts said. The report did take on another long-standing worry, a Sept. 11-style aircraft attack. The possibility of significant radiation release in such an attack “is extremely low to the point I would say of being noncredible,” said Neil E. Todreas, a co-chairman of the group and a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But an outside expert who was not on the panel was not reassured. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer who works for the Union of Concerned Scientists but who worked for the New York Power Authority in White Plains when the authority owned Indian Point 3, said the section on fire protection after a nuclear accident was “almost pure fertilizer.” Studies of fire risk, he said, assumed that the fire was contained to one room and that all the equipment outside that room functioned normally.

The owner, Entergy Nuclear, is structuring a spinoff of its plants that the company claims would effectively end the agreement. State officials fear the plan could also free Entergy from several hundred million dollars in costs associated with the eventual decommissioning of the two Indian Point plants in Westchester County and the FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County. That could increase the risk that state taxpayers would have to one day foot the bill for closing the plants. Details of Entergy’s strategy were included in a lengthy securities filing issued this year in which the company laid out a plan to spin off nuclear plants in New York and elsewhere into a new company called Enexus. In a clause in one of its filings, Entergy claims that Enexus would not have to live up to a revenue sharing agreement between Entergy and New York. Under the agreement, the company is supposed to pay New York up to $72 million annually through 2014, and state officials had expected to receive the full amount. Alex J. Schott, a spokesman for Entergy, said the spinoff “optimizes the value for all our stakeholders.” As for the revenue sharing agreement, he said the state “was aware that Entergy was considering alternative structures for the nuclear business at the time the agreement was reached.” “We remain hopeful that the spinoff will happen by the end of September,” he said. Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said: “Entergy’s plan is ill conceived on a number of levels. It could ultimately cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, does nothing to guarantee adequate decontamination of the site, and does not anticipate a future New York without Indian Point.” Under the agreement, the $432 million worth of revenue is to go to the State Power Authority, which provides low-cost electricity to businesses and municipalities and administers various programs like replacing coal furnaces in public schools and providing energy-efficient refrigerators to public housing residents. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already approved the spinoff, though the plan still needs the backing of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as regulators in New York and Vermont, where Entergy owns an old reactor that it wants to include in the spinoff. In New York, the proposal is working its way through the Public Service Commission, where it will eventually be voted on by the five commissioners. Mr. Cuomo’s office has urged the commission to block the spinoff and hold public hearings, and lawyers representing the State Power Authority say they will battle Entergy in court, if necessary, to preserve the revenue sharing deal. Opponents say the cost of decommissioning the plants in the future could be billions more than had been set aside, as required under federal law, and they worry that the new company  which would be significantly smaller in terms of revenue  may have too much debt. “This is the kind of crystallized, focused corporate greed and irresponsibility that Entergy has perfected,” said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County who is a party to the Public Service Commission proceeding. “They are mining the ratepayer and taxpayer for every penny they can and trying to evade their responsibilities,” Mr. Brodsky said. Entergy officials say they have already set aside sufficient funds for decommissioning. “Speculation by opponents of the spinoff concerning costs of decommissioning are not factually based and are misleading the public,” Mr. Schott said. The terms of the revenue sharing deal said it would hold even if the plants were transferred to an Entergy affiliate. But company officials said that they are not creating a new affiliate but rather a new and independent company. The state has feuded with Entergy over the revenue sharing deal in recent years and says the spinoff is simply the latest attempt by the company to avoid payment. In a letter last month, Max R. Shulman, a lawyer representing the State Power Authority, said the company’s claims that Enexus was not an affiliate were “wrong as a matter of law.” Mr. Shulman contended, among other things, that the plants will actually be run by an entity called EquaGen, which will be a joint venture between Entergy and Enexus, and that all of Enexus’s initial board members will be selected by Entergy. Entergy officials, in letters and court filings, have rejected the state’s arguments and have said they were “in full compliance with all terms and conditions” of the agreement. They plan to spin off Enexus to their own shareholders, who could then sell or hold on to the new shares. Christine Pritchard, a spokeswoman for the Power Authority, said it would fight Entergy in court if necessary. “If the spinoff of Entergy’s nuclear plants is approved and, based upon the structure of the spinoff, Entergy then tries to evade its obligations under the value sharing agreements, N.Y.P.A. intends fully to protect its rights and challenge that unwarranted conduct in a court of law,” she said.

The uproar that followed rekindled environmental groups’ hopes of shutting down the aging plant. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Zachary P. Stephens/Brattleboro Reformer Workers last August examined the collapsed portion of a cooling tower at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant. Entergy, the plants operator, blamed rotting timbers for the collapse. The proposed closing, albeit a long shot, has gained some support this year among Vermont politicians. The discussion is bringing into sharp relief a conflict between two objectives long held by environmental advocates: combating nuclear power and stopping global warming. Nuclear plants supply nearly 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, and they do so without emitting the carbon dioxide that is the principal cause of global warming. Vermont’s 36-year-old plant, which feeds into the regional power grid, represents a third of the state’s electrical generation. Antinuclear groups that are arguing for closing the plant hope to replace the lost electricity with renewable generation from wind turbines, solar power and the combustion of plant material. Additionally, they cite the potential for cutting electrical demand by making homes and business more efficient. Even so, some environmental advocates have reluctantly acknowledged that no combination of renewable power and improved efficiency can replace the plant, Vermont Yankee, at least in the near term. Instead, the state would probably have to tap the Northeastern grid  which derives more than half its energy from fossil fuels  for extra power. “We’ll likely have to go to the market, and that will mean an increase in Vermont’s electricity portfolio that comes from fossil fuels,” said Andrew Perchlik, director of Renewable Energy Vermont, a group that promotes clean power, speaking about the prospect of the plant’s closing. He faulted the state government and utilities for not focusing earlier on renewable energy, saying that if they had done so, “we wouldn’t be in this predicament.” The Vermont debate comes as interest in nuclear power is increasing across the country, driven by rising demand for power as well as emissions concerns. Like other plants nationwide, Vermont Yankee is seeking a 20-year extension of its operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body that oversees the country’s reactor fleet. A decision, which could allow the plant to keep operating until 2032, is expected later this year. Several utilities, encouraged by the federal government, are considering building nuclear reactors for the first time in three decades. In Vermont, home to many people with a back-to-the-land viewpoint, surveys show that people want to move away from fuels like coal and oil that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. They also support renewable energy. But the same surveys show less consensus on nuclear power. At energy workshops last year, nearly two-thirds of participants said Vermont utilities should cease buying power from the nuclear plant  unless fossil fuels and out-of-state nuclear power were the alternatives, in which case more than half would continue with Vermont Yankee. Not counting dams, another low-emission energy source that many environmental groups oppose, renewable power makes up 2.5 percent of the nation’s electricity generation. That figure is higher in Vermont, 6 percent, but renewables are still a long way from supplying the bulk of the state’s power. Starting from these slim figures, many advocacy groups dream of achieving a nuclear-free mix burnished by local renewables. State researchers estimate that as much as 48 percent of Vermont’s power could one day come from local renewables, including small hydropower projects. “When you look at all the scenarios for climate change, nuclear is not a must-do,” said James Moore, the clean-energy advocate for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a group that opposes the nuclear plant. But utilities in Vermont, like their counterparts elsewhere in the country, argue that environmental advocates are mistaken if they believe a low-emission future can be achieved without nuclear power. They note the intermittency of power sources like windmills and solar panels, and argue that the nation needs more, not fewer, big power plants that emit no carbon dioxide. “Vermont is in an enviable position right now,” said Steve Costello, a spokesman for the state’s largest utility, Central Vermont Public Service. “We have arguably the cleanest power in the country from an air-emissions standpoint, and we have the lowest rates in the Northeast.” His utility is willing to build more renewables, he said, but closing Vermont Yankee would make maintaining clean and cheap power “much more difficult.” Even as some Vermonters argue for more renewable power, proposals to build it have hit snags. Vermont has only one commercial wind farm, 11 turbines along a mountain ridge. They have less than 1 percent of the capacity of Vermont Yankee, a relatively small nuclear plant. 1 2 Next Page » Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington.

Antinuclear groups that are arguing for closing the plant hope to replace the lost electricity with renewable generation from wind turbines, solar power and the combustion of plant material. Additionally, they cite the potential for cutting electrical demand by making homes and business more efficient. Even so, some environmental advocates have reluctantly acknowledged that no combination of renewable power and improved efficiency can replace the plant, Vermont Yankee, at least in the near term. Instead, the state would probably have to tap the Northeastern grid  which derives more than half its energy from fossil fuels  for extra power. “We’ll likely have to go to the market, and that will mean an increase in Vermont’s electricity portfolio that comes from fossil fuels,” said Andrew Perchlik, director of Renewable Energy Vermont, a group that promotes clean power, speaking about the prospect of the plant’s closing. He faulted the state government and utilities for not focusing earlier on renewable energy, saying that if they had done so, “we wouldn’t be in this predicament.” The Vermont debate comes as interest in nuclear power is increasing across the country, driven by rising demand for power as well as emissions concerns. Like other plants nationwide, Vermont Yankee is seeking a 20-year extension of its operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body that oversees the country’s reactor fleet. A decision, which could allow the plant to keep operating until 2032, is expected later this year. Several utilities, encouraged by the federal government, are considering building nuclear reactors for the first time in three decades. In Vermont, home to many people with a back-to-the-land viewpoint, surveys show that people want to move away from fuels like coal and oil that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. They also support renewable energy. But the same surveys show less consensus on nuclear power. At energy workshops last year, nearly two-thirds of participants said Vermont utilities should cease buying power from the nuclear plant  unless fossil fuels and out-of-state nuclear power were the alternatives, in which case more than half would continue with Vermont Yankee. Not counting dams, another low-emission energy source that many environmental groups oppose, renewable power makes up 2.5 percent of the nation’s electricity generation. That figure is higher in Vermont, 6 percent, but renewables are still a long way from supplying the bulk of the state’s power. Starting from these slim figures, many advocacy groups dream of achieving a nuclear-free mix burnished by local renewables. State researchers estimate that as much as 48 percent of Vermont’s power could one day come from local renewables, including small hydropower projects. “When you look at all the scenarios for climate change, nuclear is not a must-do,” said James Moore, the clean-energy advocate for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a group that opposes the nuclear plant. But utilities in Vermont, like their counterparts elsewhere in the country, argue that environmental advocates are mistaken if they believe a low-emission future can be achieved without nuclear power. They note the intermittency of power sources like windmills and solar panels, and argue that the nation needs more, not fewer, big power plants that emit no carbon dioxide. “Vermont is in an enviable position right now,” said Steve Costello, a spokesman for the state’s largest utility, Central Vermont Public Service. “We have arguably the cleanest power in the country from an air-emissions standpoint, and we have the lowest rates in the Northeast.” His utility is willing to build more renewables, he said, but closing Vermont Yankee would make maintaining clean and cheap power “much more difficult.” Even as some Vermonters argue for more renewable power, proposals to build it have hit snags. Vermont has only one commercial wind farm, 11 turbines along a mountain ridge. They have less than 1 percent of the capacity of Vermont Yankee, a relatively small nuclear plant. 1 2 Next Page » Matthew L.

Says<date>Published: May 25, 2008</date><text>ENTERGY NUCLEAR’s operating policies since radioactive groundwater contamination from two of its reactors at Indian Point was discovered in 2005 have been “reasonable and technically sound,” the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Tuesday. Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » Strontium 90 and tritium, the radioactive isotopes that leaked into the ground and the Hudson River from the Indian Point 1 and Indian Point 2 nuclear power plants in Buchanan, are byproducts of the reactor process. But according to the N.R.C.’s status update on the plants, the amounts leaked are small and do not pose a health hazard to humans, and fish taken from the river showed no presence of radioactive materials. “The amount of radioactivity is well within regulatory limits,” said Diane Screnci, an N.R.C. spokeswoman. The volume of leaked radioactive water from the two plants  Indian Point 1 has been closed since 1974 but still leaks contaminants into the ground from its spent-fuel pool  is about 20,000 gallons, “equivalent to what might be in a backyard, in-ground swimming pool,” Ms. Screnci said. (The pools of spent fuel are enormous, uncovered concrete tanks with stainless steel liners that sometimes have pinhole leaks.) The N.R.C.’s latest assessment, which was presented at a public informational meeting in Cortlandt on Tuesday, means that Entergy may continue to leave the contaminants in the ground until the plants are decommissioned. Then it must dispose of the contaminants according to the commission’s standards. Entergy is seeking 20-year extensions to the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and 3, which expire in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The Indian Point 1 site is scheduled to be remediated by the end of the year, which would eliminate that source of contamination. Robyn Bentley, an Entergy spokeswoman, said that because Indian Point was one of the first nuclear plants in the country to have groundwater issues with tritium and strontium 90, “it’s been a learning experience for us and the industry.” She said Entergy would continue to review the status of the groundwater and monitor the effectiveness of its remediation effort. At Riverkeeper, a nonprofit watchdog group, Phillip Musegaas, a lawyer for the organization, questioned some of the regulatory commission’s assessments. “We agree that there isn’t an immediate threat to human health, but not enough research has been done to totally rule out all environmental threats,” he said. High on Riverkeeper’s list of concerns, he said, are future leakage from Indian Point 2’s spent fuel pool and the fact that only a portion of that pool has been examined. “It’s already leaked twice,” Mr. Musegaas said, “and we’re worried that it will leak again in the future.” Another point of contention with the N.R.C., Mr. Musegaas said, is whether Entergy is allotting enough money to clean up the plant when it is decommissioned. The regulatory commission has a formula for the amount of money the owner of a power plant must set aside for remediation. But Mr. Musegaas said: “That’s based on a normally operating plant, not one with these kinds of problems. Even in the best of circumstances, the plants have encountered cost overruns upon decommissioning.” He said his organization would push the N.R.C. and Entergy to move more expeditiously on contamination cleanup.

While the Bush administration opposed Supreme Court review of appeals filed by industry groups, Solicitor General Paul D. Clement notified the court that if the justices did decide to hear the case, the administration would side with the industry challengers. In its brief, the administration told the justices that the federal appeals court that barred the Environmental Protection Agency from adopting the cost-benefit approach erred “by purporting to micromanage the agency’s decision making.” Given the number of cases the Supreme Court has already accepted for argument next fall, this case is unlikely to be argued before December, with a decision unlikely before March or April of next year. Consequently, if a Democrat wins the White House in November, the court and the country could well see a reprise of the drama that played out in the early days of the administration of President Ronald Reagan. Taking office in January 1981 with a vigorous antiregulatory agenda, the Reagan administration inherited a set of Supreme Court positions that it did not want to support. In one pending case, on standards for workplace exposure to cotton dust, the cause of “brown lung” disease among textile workers, the new administration wanted to use a cost-benefit analysis, the opposite of the position that the administration of President Jimmy Carter had just finished arguing to the Supreme Court. The Reagan administration’s lawyers asked the court for permission to withdraw the government’s brief. Instead, in American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan, the court handed the administration a stinging rebuke by ruling that the statute at issue, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, made worker safety a “pre-eminent value” and did not permit a cost-benefit analysis. The court’s new case, Entergy Corporation v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 07-588, concerns a provision of the Clean Water Act that applies to the use by power plants and manufacturing facilities of “cooling water,” water drawn from rivers or lakes and used to absorb heat generated by the industrial process. Both the intake of the water and its outflow have environmental consequences for aquatic organisms. Section 316 of the act provides that the design of structures used for cooling water must “reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.” Proposing rules for large existing power plants in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency gave the industry a range of options for meeting “national performance standards.” It also provided that on a plant-by-plant basis, operators could request a variance on the ground that the cost of complying was significantly greater than the environmental benefits of compliance. Ruling in a lawsuit brought by environmental groups, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, held that the statute barred the agency from engaging in cost-benefit analysis of the type it had proposed. The only way that cost could be taken into account, the court said, was to permit a plant operator to use “a less expensive technology that achieves essentially the same results” as the “best” technology. Finding that it was unclear exactly how the agency had considered cost, the appeals court sent the regulation back to it for reconsideration. The administration told the Supreme Court that the appeals court had addressed a question of “great significance” and had reached a “wrong” result. The appeals court engaged in “freelancing,” Solicitor General Clement’s brief said, by “usurping the agency’s role of construing and filling in an ambiguous statute.” The brief went on to explain that the administration had decided not to appeal the ruling because “the full impact of the decision will not be clear until E.P.A. completes proceedings on remand.” However, Mr. Clement added, the administration would support the industry view and defend the regulation if the court decided to hear the case. That leaves a coalition of environmental groups, led by Riverkeeper Inc., to defend the appeals court’s judgment when the case is argued in the Supreme Court’s next term.

Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » Opponents of the plant have for years called for an independent safety assessment, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that the reactors get one of those every time one of its inspectors walks through the door and that its regular process assures safety. Now, though, with the plant up for relicensing, the owner, Entergy Nuclear, would like to reassure the public and has decided to pay for an assessment itself. In an announcement on Wednesday, Michael R. Kansler, president and chief nuclear officer of Entergy Nuclear, said the plant’s “special circumstances” merited a safety evaluation by outsiders, to be given full access to the plant and its personnel. He said he hoped the assessment would be completed sometime around midyear. “Repeated and continuous Nuclear Regulatory Commission assessments have concluded that Indian Point is safe,” he said in a conference call with reporters. But, he added, “we hope this evaluation will be another step in building public confidence.” Riverkeeper, a group concerned with water quality in the Hudson that has intervened in the relicensing hearings to try to close the two reactors, professed to have no confidence in this approach. “An independent safety assessment is not an assessment contracted and paid for by the company needing an assessment,” said Lisa Rainwater, the group’s policy director. “There are times when the federal government needs to step in and put taxpayers’ dollars to work for the sake of public health and safety.” The N.R.C. was also rather ho-hum. It said it had no objection to the independent evaluation but had more confidence in its own inspection procedure. It also pointed out that groups like the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, an electric utility organization that organizes reactor operators to conduct inspection visits and audits of other reactors, already provide independent assessments. In fact, one of the co-chairmen of the assessment panel chosen by Entergy is a former chairman and chief executive of the institute, James T. Rhodes. He is also the former president and chief executive of another nuclear utility, Virginia Electric and Power Company. The other co-chairman is Neil E. Todreas, a professor emeritus of nuclear engineering at M.I.T. and, for eight years in the 1980s, the head of the nuclear engineering department there. The members include John S. Dyson, now chairman of Millbank Capital Management and a former chairman of the New York Power Authority, which used to own Indian Point 3. The 12 members also include experts in security and in emergency planning. The group is supposed to meet for the first time this week and spend a total of three weeks at the plant, which is in Buchanan. It will spend time before and after the meeting preparing for its visits, Mr. Todreas said. Mr. Rhodes said that the group was “looking at Indian Point as it is now; the relicensing procedure is a separate procedure.” But, he added, “The results of our work might be used in that.” In fact, the results are almost certain to be used by one side or the other. The panel is legally obligated to point out to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission any problems it discovers, Mr. Rhodes said. The N.R.C. said it expected to be notified. The assessment panel will not examine public safety questions beyond Entergy’s control, like the role of the National Guard. Twelve years ago, the N.R.C. itself organized an independent assessment of a reactor, Maine Yankee, near Bath, Me. The report found a variety of problems, including that an emergency cooling system and one that was in regular use were not designed properly and could not be counted on if the plant ran above 90 percent of its rated power output. Eventually so many problems were discovered that the owners decided the plant was not worth fixing and tore it down. But the N.R.C. insists that since then, its regular inspection system has improved, eliminating the need for a repeat of that kind of audit at Indian Point.

But through extraordinary means, the owner won federal approvals that allowed it to keep operating. That was in the early 1980s, and the owner was New York State. Now the struggle is playing out again. This time, however, New York State, which sold Indian Point 3 to Entergy Nuclear for $600 million in 2000, has joined Westchester County and other opponents in trying to persuade the Nuclear Regulatory Commission not to grant 20-year license extensions for the two operating reactors  Unit 3 and Unit 2, which Entergy bought from Consolidated Edison in 2001. New York is the first state to formally oppose the relicensing of a nuclear power plant, and officials say there are two main reasons for taking that position: On Sept. 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11, which slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center, and United Airlines Flight 175, which hit the south tower, flew along the Hudson River and crossed it just north of Indian Point. “New Yorkers know all too well that the threat of terrorism is real,” Mylan L. Denerstein, the state’s executive deputy attorney general for social justice, said in an opening statement at a hearing convened on March 10 by a three-judge panel that will make a recommendation to the full regulatory agency. Those who support relicensing the plants say that the risk of an attack must be weighed against the more likely possibility of higher energy prices, electricity shortages and increased air pollution if the plant were to close. And while people who are worried about air pollution and electric bills might outnumber those who fear the possible dangers posed by Indian Point, the fear of radiation probably sways more voters than the specter of higher electric bills. In the 1980s, the issue was whether the emergency plans for Indian Point were adequate, and the commission was not trying to win any popularity contests. Westchester officials boycotted the evacuation drills that the federal government demanded, so New York State sent stand-ins, and ultimately the commission decided that the performance was adequate. Moreover, it licensed the Shoreham reactor on Long Island about the same time despite wider protests. The commission still operates about the same way. At times it seems to relish being out of step with political passions. One commissioner, Peter B. Lyons, told Turkish energy experts in Istanbul in January that one goal of effective regulation was to “maintain more stable regulatory standards as political persuasions change within the government.” Mr. Lyons went on to say that while governmental views may change, the commission would keep elected officials “informed of our activities.” Will the government’s views change again? Perhaps. The commission, which is supposed to have five appointed members, has only four as the Bush administration winds down, and some of them are likely to leave before a decision is reached on Indian Point. As a result, the fate of the plant may rest with the next administration. Among the Democratic presidential contenders, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York has been tough on the plant’s operators. For instance, Indian Point has had warning sirens for more than 20 years, but a provision in the 2005 energy act, inserted by Senator Clinton, who lives in Westchester, requires battery backups for sirens around plants in high-population areas. Indian Point, in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, is the only site that qualifies. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has not specifically addressed Indian Point, but before the Vermont primary he told the editors of The Brattleboro Reformer that older nuclear plants should not receive license extensions until issues about spent fuel storage and safety were resolved. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, also has not specifically addressed Indian Point, but in a debate in Boca Raton, Fla., in January, he said that the United States could reduce global warming with “the embrace of green technologies,” including nuclear energy. On the state level, former Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed cutting energy demand by 15 percent below projected levels, an ambitious goal. Whether the new governor, David A. Paterson, will pursue that initiative is not clear. In the meantime, the license renewal process could drag on for years. The dispute over emergency planning, when New York State supported the plants, lasted from 1979 until 1983. Once again, time may not be on the side of the opponents. Under the commission rules, the plants can run until there is a decision, regardless of how long that takes, if the operator applied more than five years before the licenses expired. The license for Unit 2 is scheduled to expire in September 2013, and the one for Unit 3 in December 2015. New York is arguing that the applications are incomplete and do not qualify for consideration, so far with little indication of sympathy from the commission.

For instance, Indian Point has had warning sirens for more than 20 years, but a provision in the 2005 energy act, inserted by Senator Clinton, who lives in Westchester, requires battery backups for sirens around plants in high-population areas. Indian Point, in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, is the only site that qualifies. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has not specifically addressed Indian Point, but before the Vermont primary he told the editors of The Brattleboro Reformer that older nuclear plants should not receive license extensions until issues about spent fuel storage and safety were resolved. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, also has not specifically addressed Indian Point, but in a debate in Boca Raton, Fla., in January, he said that the United States could reduce global warming with “the embrace of green technologies,” including nuclear energy. On the state level, former Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed cutting energy demand by 15 percent below projected levels, an ambitious goal. Whether the new governor, David A. Paterson, will pursue that initiative is not clear. In the meantime, the license renewal process could drag on for years. The dispute over emergency planning, when New York State supported the plants, lasted from 1979 until 1983. Once again, time may not be on the side of the opponents. Under the commission rules, the plants can run until there is a decision, regardless of how long that takes, if the operator applied more than five years before the licenses expired. The license for Unit 2 is scheduled to expire in September 2013, and the one for Unit 3 in December 2015. New York is arguing that the applications are incomplete and do not qualify for consideration, so far with little indication of sympathy from the commission.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/16indianwe.html?ref=entergycorporation">A Hearing on Indian Point That Struggles to Be Heard<date>Published: March 16, 2008</date><text>White Plains Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » Enlarge This Image Alan Zale for The New York Times PICKETS Foes of Indian Point nuclear power plant outside the hearing at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains. THE fight over whether to close the Indian Point nuclear power plant has been a passionate one in the region, where opponents slap bumper stickers on their cars that read, “Nowhere to Run” and “Not If ... But When.” Critics emphasize Indian Point’s potential as a target for terrorists. Concerns have been raised about everything from the emergency evacuation plan to leaking storage pools for spent fuel. Critics say the repeated failures of the plant’s new siren system are a symbol of poor management. But the biggest drama at last week’s hearings on relicensing Indian Point’s two reactors in Buchanan concerned the acoustics of the courtroom. As Westchester County and the state began to make their arguments Monday to the three-judge panel appointed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, spectators strained to hear the testimony. When Michael B. Kaplowitz, the vice chairman of the Westchester Board of Legislators, complained that a hearing couldn’t be considered public if the public couldn’t hear it, the panel chairman, Lawrence G. McDade, warned that the next person who spoke out would be removed from the courtroom. By that afternoon, microphones had been scattered at the three tables of lawyers representing relicensing opponents, the commission staff members and Entergy Nuclear, the plant’s owner. And as the hearing became more audible, it became clear it would not be a forum for a general safety review of the reactors, let alone a referendum on nuclear power. The N.R.C. considers two major factors in whether to extend the licenses: Entergy’s plans for managing the aging parts, and the environmental impact of keeping the plants open, said Neil Sheehan, an agency spokesman. The hearings are part of a multiyear process to determine whether the reactors should be given a 20-year extension of the licenses, allowing Indian Point 2 to operate until 2033 and Indian Point 3 to operate until 2035. New York, which is the first state to oppose the relicensing of a nuclear power plant, submitted arguments concerning terrorism, emergency evacuation, accidental releases of radioactivity, population density and the danger of earthquakes, among other issues. The commission says those issues are already covered by its regulations and are not particular to license extension. But the state says they are reasons to let the license lapse. “The continued operation of Indian Point is untenable: the risks are simply too great,” Mylan L. Denerstein, executive deputy attorney general for social justice, said in her opening statement. But unless the plant’s opponents, who include environmental groups and municipalities, can persuade the judges to reverse commission precedent, many of these arguments will not be considered. “There are two tracks  the safety track, which looks at the company’s aging management plan for the plant, and the environmental track,” Mr. Sheehan said. “There have been a number of contentions that fall outside the two tracks and those areas, and they’ve been rejected in the past. These contentions  sirens would be an example, spent nuclear fuel, and emergency planning in general  do not fall under the umbrella.” Those safety issues are part of the commission’s continuing oversight, he said. During the hearing, lawyers for Entergy repeatedly objected to the state’s arguments as outside the scope of relicensing guidelines. Roughly 15 municipalities and environmental groups had petitioned the commission to be participants in the hearings, filing 150 motions. The oral arguments heard last week were essentially a weeding-out process. Next the judges will decide who can directly make their cases for or against extending Indian Point’s operation and which arguments will be given a hearing. Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, has repeatedly called for Indian Point to be closed. At the hearings, the county petitioned the judges to allow the county to adopt the state’s arguments. Westchester did not submit any of its own, so it is essentially piggybacking on the state’s efforts. “The plant is old, they’ve had constant problems and it’s far too dangerous to have in the heart of a thriving suburb with the population we have here,” Mr. Spano said in an interview. “I’ve been working with them 10 years, and they still can’t get the hot line to work properly.” Officials from Entergy say they are confident the licenses will be renewed.

After years in a storage pool, the more than 6,000 rods, each of them 12 feet long, have been dried out and immersed in helium gas to prevent rust, fitted into slots like eggs in a carton, and sealed in a steel canister for what may be the next few hundred thousand years. Then on Friday the canister, inside the cask, was hauled by a tank-like “crawler” to the new pad, which was designed to survive earthquakes, hurricanes and other hazards. The spent rods altogether will give off about as much heat as a dozen hair dryers running at full power, and the exterior of the cask will reach 80 to 90 degrees. They also give off radiation  a dose of about one millirem per hour  that is about equivalent to what an average person receives a day from natural sources. Officials of Entergy, which owns the Indian Point plant, said there would be no additional radiation along the fence line. The new system for storing spent fuel is the biggest physical change required of Entergy for the Indian Point plant to continue operating beyond its initial 40-year license. In fact, the waste storage may outlive the reactors themselves. Similar canisters have already been stored at the former site of the Connecticut Yankee reactor on the Connecticut River. Indian Point, on the east bank of the Hudson River 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, is seeking a 20-year extension of the operating licenses for two reactors. A third was deactivated in 1974. Gov. Eliot Spitzer and other elected officials are opposed to an extension because of safety concerns and are demanding hearings before a panel of three judges appointed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As for the storing of the spent rods in casks, opinions are mixed. At first, Westchester County opposed the idea, mainly because casks would allow the plant to continuing operating for decades. Now it favors the plan, however, because some engineers say that the spent fuel in the casks, called dry storage, would be less vulnerable to terrorist attack than fuel in the storage pools. Some opponents say a successful attack might drain the pools, which would lead to a devastating fire. Entergy plans to keep the pools nearly full of spent fuel, leaving enough space to allow emptying the reactor completely should that become necessary. Usually, a third of the fuel is removed at each refueling shutdown, which takes place every two years. Entergy began planning for the move from the storage pools to the cask in mid-2002. Any kind of changes at a nuclear power plant are usually complex and cumbersome, and this one  moving the bundles of fuel rods 300 feet  was even more so. For one thing, the crane used for years to lower fuel into the pool was not strong enough to remove it once the fuel was put into the canister, which weighs about 100 tons when fully loaded. The inner package was designed to be shipped to a burial place, possibly Yucca Mountain in Nevada, although that project’s future is uncertain. Then the Indian Point project took on a “there’s-a-hole-in-the-bucket” character when workers began excavating to build a foundation for a bigger crane. While digging the hole, they discovered that water had leaked from the pool holding the spent fuel. And a diver sent into the pool to look for flaws in its stainless steel liner could not find the leak’s source. Jim Steets, a spokesman for the company, said that engineers now think that the water probably came from a leak patched years ago. However, a third spent-fuel pool in Indian Point 1, the plant that was deactivated in 1974, is known to be leaking. Entergy plans to put all of the spent fuel rods into dry casks later this year, and then drain the pool. When Indian Point was planned, it was thought that the spent rods would be removed after a few years and trucked to a chemical plant where they would be chopped up, and the plutonium removed for future use. But after the reprocessing industry collapsed, the owners of the plants in the early 1980s, Consolidated Edison and the New York Power Authority, signed contracts with the federal Department of Energy to remove the fuel, beginning in 1998. Now, however, the government appears to be years from having a place to bury the material.

The megawattage was higher than normal, but the politics sounded familiar when Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, with Democratic politicians and antinuclear activists in tow, dropped a rhetorical bomb on the Indian Point nuclear power plant on Monday. Not only should the Nuclear Regulatory Commission deny an application to renew its license, Mr. Cuomo said, but “Indian Point should be closed, and it should be closed now.” For those who missed the urgency, he added, “Indian Point is, in my opinion, a catastrophe waiting to happen.” Well, an ambitious Democratic politician in these parts can never go wrong railing against Indian Point  the more apocalyptic the language, the better. But even in the kingdom where the word “no” forever reigns supreme, closing Indian Point raises its share of vexing questions. For starters: Is New York prepared to increase carbon emissions and perhaps flunk its goals under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to close Indian Point? In whose neighborhoods in Westchester or Rockland Counties is it prepared to build the power plants that would replace it? Is the possibility of more expensive and less reliable electricity an acceptable trade-off for not having to worry about Indian Point? If Indian Point poses an unacceptable risk, shouldn’t the dozens of nuclear plants in metropolitan areas around the country and the world close as well? And we’re comfortable with those carbon trade-offs too? In the end, they come down to this: Do the forever-green, antinuke politics of the 1970s hold up in the global warming era of 2007? Think before you answer. NUCLEAR power isn’t the most lovable of alternatives, and if you live in Westchester County, as I do, the specter of Indian Point is one of the constants of local discourse, like college admissions hysteria, real estate anxiety and Bill and Hillary sightings. Indian Point’s critics say its safety record over the years has been too flawed, the population around it too large, the evacuation plans too inadequate to keep it open. You think, if they can’t get the sirens to operate, maybe there are bigger worries. (Of course, it was New York State that sold this alleged catastrophe in the making to its current owners just six years ago, but we’ll let that pass.) There’s plenty of hyperbole on both sides, and Entergy Nuclear, the plant’s owner, seems able to spend money like a drunken sailor to get its message out. Nuclear power’s most effective spokesman may be Patrick Moore, a founder and former member of the environmental group Greenpeace, who has been hired by the nuclear industry to promote the technology. He says the resurgence of nuclear energy around the world  even in ultragreen countries like Finland  reflects the simple fact that nuclear power has more potential to replace and reduce carbon emissions than anything else, and that, leaving out the Model T technology of Chernobyl, its worldwide safety record remains almost impeccable. “What drives me nuts,” he said, “ is that the environmental movement itself has become the primary obstacle to reducing fossil fuel emissions. Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin, and they’ve got it completely backward. Either you quit worrying about climate change and go on burning fossil fuels or you accept nuclear energy and get off fossil fuels. They’re stuck between a rock and a hard place of their own making.” Of course, if you factor in conservation and alternative energy, there should be other options. And maybe the biggest obstacle to nuclear power has been cost, not pesky enviros. But for now, all the painless green alternatives like massive conservation, smart building, solar power, wind power, ocean waves and the rest that are supposed to allow us to do without nuclear power are still minor parts of the equation. Unless Mr. Cuomo succeeds in closing Indian Point tomorrow, we might hope for two things as its relicensing process plods on. One, says Alex Matthiessen, president of Riverkeeper in Westchester, is a far more thorough hearing than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission seems to have in mind  one that looks at issues like evacuation plans, vulnerability to terrorist attacks, potential leaks from spent fuel pools and other issues. A 20-year renewal for a nuclear plant in the most populous part of the country shouldn’t be a rubber stamp.

Paterson and members of the Congressional delegation at a news conference, claimed that the nuclear plant, in densely populated Westchester County, could not be defended from a terrorist attack and that the surrounding area could not be evacuated if a major accident occurred. The state filed a 313-page petition on behalf of Mr. Cuomo and Gov. Eliot Spitzer on Friday. Most recently, opponents’ ire had been directed at the plant owner’s belated progress in meeting federal deadlines to install warning sirens around the plant, which is on the Hudson River in Buchanan. The state also contends that the application to extend the plant’s license for 20 more years, which was filed on April 30 by the plant’s owner, Entergy Nuclear, failed to account for pipes, cables and fire-protection systems that have deteriorated at the nuclear reactors, which began operation in the mid-’70s. “I believe Indian Point should be closed and it should be closed now,” Mr. Cuomo said at the news conference at the Westchester County administrative building. Officials of the N.R.C. could not recall a previous occasion when a state had tried to intervene in a license-extension proceeding to block the extension. New York State owned Indian Point 3 from 1975 until 2000. New Jersey has intervened in the relicensing of the Oyster Creek nuclear plant, and Vermont and Massachusetts both sought conditions on the license extension of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant. Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said the company had invested hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade equipment at the plant since it bought the two reactors. He said that the company was prepared to prove to federal regulators that the equipment still worked properly. “The plant equipment can perform according to its design,” Mr. Steets said. “That is what we have to demonstrate to the N.R.C.” In a statement on Monday, Governor Spitzer said that the Indian Point relicensing application “fails to address a number of crucial issues.” Although he did not go as far as Mr. Cuomo in calling for an immediate shutdown, Mr. Spitzer said the plant should close as soon as an alternative source of power could be found. The two reactors have a combined capacity of 2,069 megawatts. A three-judge panel appointed by the N.R.C. is expected to rule within the next several weeks whether New York State can intervene in the relicensing application and whether the issues it has raised should be considered. Entergy applied for a 20-year extension of the original 40-year licenses on April 30. The commission, which has granted about two dozen 20-year extensions around the country, has established a goal of ruling on applications within 22 months if there is no hearing, or within 30 months if there is one. The license for the Indian Point 2 reactor expires in 2013, and Indian Point 3’s license ends in 2015. But the licenses have been automatically extended until the commission issues its ruling. Indian Point 1 closed in 1974. It was not clear from the state’s filing how New York proposed to meet its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping the region’s grid supplied with energy on peak days, although opponents of the plant insist that efficient use of electricity could take up any slack should the reactors be shut down. But Patrick Moore, a founder and former member of the environmental activist group Greenpeace, who has been hired by the nuclear industry to promote the technology, said on Monday that there was “a logical inconsistency” in the argument being presented by opponents of the plant. Mr. Moore said the goal of shutting Indian Point and of reducing carbon emissions were “mutually exclusive” in a time of concern over global warming. He added that if the reactors were shut, the logical substitute would be two new ones. Mr. Cuomo said at the news conference that claims of power shortages should the plant be shut were “scare tactics,” and he cited studies that have shown there would be sufficient power to meet the area’s needs without Indian Point. He also said that the plant has been shut for refueling and repairs for extended periods and that the power grid has not suffered. “If the plant closes, we can replace the power,” he said. The two nuclear reactors in Westchester County  which have attracted much opposition since the accident at the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania in March 1979 and the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001  are surrounded by 20 million people within a 50-mile radius, more than any other reactor in the country. American Airlines Flight 11, which struck the north tower of the World Trade Center, flew south along the Hudson River and over Indian Point, but the vulnerability of the reactors is a matter of dispute. Nonetheless, Mr. Cuomo said that “the terrorist threat that this plant poses is insurmountable.” John Sullivan reported from White Plains and Matthew L. Wald from Washington.

There is already strong opposition to the relicensing of other nuclear power plants, including Oyster Creek in southern New Jersey and Vermont Yankee, which is on the Connecticut River just north of the Massachusetts border. Panels of three administrative law judges are studying those applications as well. A hearing is scheduled to begin Monday in Toms River, N.J., on the request for a 20-year licensing extension of Oyster Creek, the oldest commercial reactor in the country, and a hearing is also likely for Vermont Yankee. Another three-judge panel is considering hearings for the Pilgrim nuclear plant, in Plymouth, Mass. The antinuclear group, Friends United for Sustainable Energy, or FUSE, of Spring Valley, N.Y., contends that for decades, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, improperly held the Indian Point reactors, which are in Buchanan, N.Y., to less stringent design requirements than those the government applied to newer plants. The requirements, which lay out in broad terms what safety precautions must be built into a plant’s hardware, were often changed in the 1960s and early ’70s, when the Indian Point reactors were built. According to the petition by FUSE, the builders claimed at one point that they met the draft criteria, but actually met only the criteria the nuclear industry was lobbying for. The commission itself focused on precisely what standards were used, and what should have been used, when it analyzed the plant again in the early 1990s. In 1992, the commission decided not to require Indian Point to meet the criteria for newer plants. “You don’t start from scratch,” said a spokesman for the commission, Neil Sheehan, on Friday, describing the decision to consider relicensing the plant now without making it comply with rules approved after its completion. But FUSE argues that the 1992 action was a violation of a federal law designed to ensure fairness in administrative procedures. And the failure of the builders to heed the requirements that applied to newer plants “substantially reduces safety margins,” the group contends. Entergy, which owns the reactors, insists that the plant was safe as built and still is. FUSE also charged that Entergy has failed to submit an adequate plan for maintaining safety at the plant as its components age. The operators are promising merely to reach agreement later, thereby limiting public input, the group said. But James Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said in a telephone interview that it was in the nature of such maintenance plans that they evolved as the plant aged, and that “you never finish.” Entergy bought Indian Point 2 from Consolidated Edison and Indian Point 3 from the New York Power Authority. The reactors are now owned by separate subsidiaries of Entergy. Plant opponents have argued that this is a legal strategy to limit the corporation’s liability in the event of an accident. They now contend that because the reactors are separately held, Entergy cannot submit one application for renewal of both licenses. The opponents also note that while the two plants are of similar design, construction was managed by different engineering companies. The application, according to FUSE, “creates an avalanche of a mixing of safety, technical and environmental issues caused by comingling.” But Entergy, the first operator at the site to run both reactors, has been trying to integrate their operations. Mr. Steets said that the differences in the plants were accounted for in the details of the application for the extension, and that Entergy was seeking, for financial reasons, to bring them under the ownership of a single subsidiary.

Skip to next paragraph Related Businessman Ordered Jailed in Dispute With Utility (September 12, 2007) Entergy had asked that Joe Seeber of Hewitt, Tex., be jailed for 45 days because two references to a 1996 injury lawsuit were included in a 400-page report that Mr. Seeber sent to J. Wayne Leonard, Entergys chief executive, and Entergy directors. Judge Kern A. Reese of Civil Court found Mr. Seeber in contempt of court Tuesday for violating his order that no references to the 1996 injury case be included in any letters to Mr. Leonard. The judge handed down a 30-day sentence then suspended all but 7 days because he ruled the references were inadvertent. Judge Reese then said he would waive the seven days if Mr. Seeber wrote a letter of apology that the court found acceptable. Mr. Seeber said that after the judge approved his letter on Wednesday, he mailed it to Mr. Leonard, only to have his lawyer tell him that an Entergy lawyer, Marcus V. Brown, had met with the judge to complain about it. Mr. Seeber said that his lawyer then instructed him to make some changes and mail two copies of the revised letter to Mr. Brown instead of Mr. Leonard. The unusual case stems from work by Mr. Seeber and his firm, TriStem Consulting, which checks electricity bills for accuracy. He has recovered $20 million in overcharges from Entergy for the city government and is pressing a case to collect $5 million more that he says Entergy improperly charged Louisiana. In the 1996 case, Entergy, which had a contract to maintain the citys streetlights, paid $3.2 million in damages to a fruit vendor who was injured when a corroded light pole fell on him. Entergy then sued Mr. Seeber, saying he was liable for the damages because, as the citys electric bill consultant, he should have warned Entergy about the pole. The case was dismissed, and Entergy is appealing. Mr. Seeber contends that Entergy is trying to ruin his business. He has posted on the Internet what he says is a copy of an internal Entergy report that details a strategy to eliminate the need for the city to hire an electric bill consultant. Entergy said Wednesday that it had sought only technical changes in Mr. Seebers letter. The company also released a 2004 letter from Mr. Seeber, responding to its efforts to settle a different lawsuit. The letter quoted an Entergy lawyer as saying that the utility never wanted to sit across the table from him again. Mr. Seeber proposed a settlement of $10 million and a $25,000 monthly fee for five years. The 400-page report that Mr. Seeber sent to Entergy detailed suspicions of fraud in Entergys financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and shareholders. The company said it found no merit in the accusations but never told Mr. Seeber, who continued to send reports to Mr. Leonard. Mr. Seeber is not alone in raising questions about the integrity of Entergys financial statements. The FPL Group, a large Florida utility holding company, called off a merger with Entergy in 2001, principally because of what it said were discrepancies in Entergys financial forecasts and Entergys repeated refusal to provide financial documents. Mr. Leonard said at the time that the merger failed because of minimal due diligence by FPL and a personality dispute with the companys chief executive then, James L.

But the judge is also giving the businessman a chance to avoid time behind bars. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Cheryl Gerber for The New York Times Joe Seeber, near where a corroded streetlight fell on a food vendor in 1996 in New Orleans. The roots of the case are in a 1996 accident, when a corroded streetlight fell on a fruit vendor who worked on the sidewalk in front of Charity Hospital here. The vendor won a $3.2 million damage award from Entergy, the utility company that had a contract to maintain the citys streetlights and power them. Enter the businessman, Joe Seeber of Hewitt, Tex., a consultant whose firm checks electricity bills for accuracy. He has recovered $20 million in overcharges from Entergy for the city government here and others and is fighting to collect $5 million more that he says Entergy improperly charged Louisiana. Entergy sued Mr. Seeber and his firm, TriStem Consulting, contending that he should pay the $3.2 million in damages because as the citys electricity bill auditor he had a duty to know the pole was corroded and to report that corrosion to Entergy. Mr. Seeber, who initially acted as his own lawyer, wrote to the companys directors and J. Wayne Leonard, the chief executive, complaining that the company was trying to ruin his business with what he said was a baseless lawsuit. Mr. Seeber maintains that Entergy is simply trying to intimidate him, ruin his business and violate his First Amendment rights. A judge threw the companys case out, finding any fault was Entergys; the utility is appealing. But before the case against Mr. Seeber was dismissed, Judge Kearn A. Reese of state Civil Court ordered Mr. Seeber to make no mention of the injury case to anyone at Entergy except for two lawyers he designated. In his role as a self-styled consumer advocate, Mr. Seeber later sent a 400-page report to Mr. Leonard, contending that Entergy had filed fraudulent financial statements for two decades. (Yolanda Pollard, an Entergy spokeswoman, said the company conducted a thorough internal investigation and determined the fraud allegations were nothing but propaganda. Marcus V. Brown, a lawyer for Entergy, said the company never told Mr. Seeber about its findings because we arent required to.) On Monday, Mr. Brown established that in the 400-page report, there were passing mentions of the injury case on Pages 205 and 209. Entergy asked for a 45-day jail sentence as punishment for contempt of court. Judge Reece sentenced Mr. Seeber to 30 days on Tuesday but suspended all but 7 because Mr. Seeber showed that he had tried to remove references to the injury case from his report and that the two passing mentions were inadvertent. The judge said he would waive any jail time provided Mr. Seeber wrote a letter of apology to Mr. Leonard and other Entergy officials. He said the letter, due at noon Thursday, had to be acceptable to the court. Mr. Seebers lawyer, Philip C. Ciaccio Jr., asked whether Mr. Seeber would be allowed to revise his letter if the judge found it unacceptable. No, Judge Reece replied. Mr. Seeber said in an interview later that he would write a letter apologizing for making any mention of the injury case in his report but that he would not apologize for raising the fraud allegations. He fears that unless he does so, Judge Reece will order him to jail. Mr. Ciaccio said that Judge Reece may not even have jurisdiction in the matter because Mr. Seeber won a summary judgment finding that he bore no responsibility in the 1996 injury case. Judge Reece said he agreed. But, the judge added, because Entergy is appealing that summary dismissal, and a decision has not been issued, he saw no reason to delay jailing Mr. Seeber if he deems his apology letter unacceptable. Court rules require people in litigation to deal directly with each others lawyers and not to independently approach people on the other side. Mr. Seeber said he was unaware of this when he represented himself initially. He said that after he hired lawyers and they explained the rule to him, he sought to comply. He said that he also understood that Judge Reece had said the order did not apply to his auditing business and the necessity of contacting Entergy about his audits and his suspicions of fraud, a point the judge confirmed during his remarks on Tuesday. Mr. Brown, the Entergy lawyer, elicited testimony from two TriStem employees that they reviewed the 400-page report and were instructed by Mr. Seeber to make sure all references to the injury case were removed. Lisa Pibil, Mr. Seebers office manager, held up the document, showing where one paragraph had been cut out with a knife. She said she neglected to review a compact disc that was included in the report, which contained the two passing references to the injury case. Repeatedly, Mr. Brown said that Mr. Seeber should have personally reviewed the report to make sure his instructions were followed and should not have assigned the job to subordinates. Judge Reece agreed.

More Articles in Business »NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 11  A judge ordered a businessman jailed Tuesday in an unusual case involving a corroded light pole, an injured street vendor and what the businessman calls a vindictive utility company. But the judge is also giving the businessman a chance to avoid time behind bars. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Cheryl Gerber for The New York Times Joe Seeber, near where a corroded streetlight fell on a food vendor in 1996 in New Orleans. The roots of the case are in a 1996 accident, when a corroded streetlight fell on a fruit vendor who worked on the sidewalk in front of Charity Hospital here. The vendor won a $3.2 million damage award from Entergy, the utility company that had a contract to maintain the citys streetlights and power them. Enter the businessman, Joe Seeber of Hewitt, Tex., a consultant whose firm checks electricity bills for accuracy. He has recovered $20 million in overcharges from Entergy for the city government here and others and is fighting to collect $5 million more that he says Entergy improperly charged Louisiana. Entergy sued Mr. Seeber and his firm, TriStem Consulting, contending that he should pay the $3.2 million in damages because as the citys electricity bill auditor he had a duty to know the pole was corroded and to report that corrosion to Entergy. Mr. Seeber, who initially acted as his own lawyer, wrote to the companys directors and J. Wayne Leonard, the chief executive, complaining that the company was trying to ruin his business with what he said was a baseless lawsuit. Mr. Seeber maintains that Entergy is simply trying to intimidate him, ruin his business and violate his First Amendment rights. A judge threw the companys case out, finding any fault was Entergys; the utility is appealing. But before the case against Mr. Seeber was dismissed, Judge Kearn A. Reese of state Civil Court ordered Mr. Seeber to make no mention of the injury case to anyone at Entergy except for two lawyers he designated. In his role as a self-styled consumer advocate, Mr. Seeber later sent a 400-page report to Mr. Leonard, contending that Entergy had filed fraudulent financial statements for two decades. (Yolanda Pollard, an Entergy spokeswoman, said the company conducted a thorough internal investigation and determined the fraud allegations were nothing but propaganda. Marcus V. Brown, a lawyer for Entergy, said the company never told Mr. Seeber about its findings because we arent required to.) On Monday, Mr. Brown established that in the 400-page report, there were passing mentions of the injury case on Pages 205 and 209. Entergy asked for a 45-day jail sentence as punishment for contempt of court. Judge Reece sentenced Mr. Seeber to 30 days on Tuesday but suspended all but 7 because Mr. Seeber showed that he had tried to remove references to the injury case from his report and that the two passing mentions were inadvertent. The judge said he would waive any jail time provided Mr. Seeber wrote a letter of apology to Mr. Leonard and other Entergy officials. He said the letter, due at noon Thursday, had to be acceptable to the court. Mr. Seebers lawyer, Philip C. Ciaccio Jr., asked whether Mr. Seeber would be allowed to revise his letter if the judge found it unacceptable. No, Judge Reece replied. Mr. Seeber said in an interview later that he would write a letter apologizing for making any mention of the injury case in his report but that he would not apologize for raising the fraud allegations. He fears that unless he does so, Judge Reece will order him to jail. Mr. Ciaccio said that Judge Reece may not even have jurisdiction in the matter because Mr. Seeber won a summary judgment finding that he bore no responsibility in the 1996 injury case. Judge Reece said he agreed. But, the judge added, because Entergy is appealing that summary dismissal, and a decision has not been issued, he saw no reason to delay jailing Mr. Seeber if he deems his apology letter unacceptable. Court rules require people in litigation to deal directly with each others lawyers and not to independently approach people on the other side. Mr. Seeber said he was unaware of this when he represented himself initially. He said that after he hired lawyers and they explained the rule to him, he sought to comply. He said that he also understood that Judge Reece had said the order did not apply to his auditing business and the necessity of contacting Entergy about his audits and his suspicions of fraud, a point the judge confirmed during his remarks on Tuesday. Mr. Brown, the Entergy lawyer, elicited testimony from two TriStem employees that they reviewed the 400-page report and were instructed by Mr. Seeber to make sure all references to the injury case were removed. Lisa Pibil, Mr. Seebers office manager, held up the document, showing where one paragraph had been cut out with a knife. She said she neglected to review a compact disc that was included in the report, which contained the two passing references to the injury case. Repeatedly, Mr. Brown said that Mr. Seeber should have personally reviewed the report to make sure his instructions were followed and should not have assigned the job to subordinates. Judge Reece agreed. The judge said that inadvertent error was not an excuse because when you are the captain of the ship, you are responsible for everything that happens to the ship. Entergy no longer has the contract with the city.

Admittedly, it’s a different category than the recent rash of collapsing bridges, exploding steam pipes and overwhelmed storm sewers. Still, in a summer whose theme seems to be things that don’t work, a rimshot, please, for the ongoing exercise in malfunction at a place where you really would rather not see it: the Indian Point nuclear power plant. True, this is not about running the reactors. Instead it’s the ongoing “Keystone Kops” episode about putting together a functional siren system that is now nearing another big deadline. That would be Aug. 24, when the updated $15 million system of 155 sirens is supposed to be ready to alert residents (let’s not dwell on what they would be alerted to) of Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam Counties who are within 10 miles of the plant on the Hudson River. The new system was initially due by Jan. 30, but Entergy Nuclear, which owns the plant, wasn’t ready and was granted an extension by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until April 15. Whoops! On April 12, 31 of what were then 150 new sirens failed to sound during a test. That led to a $130,000 fine. And now? The company said 96 percent of the sirens worked properly in its most recent test. On the other hand, it’s not a great sign that with two weeks to go, the company and regulators are arguing about just how loud the sirens have to be. Siren-Gate dates to 2005, when provisions inserted by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton into the federal Energy Policy Act required backup battery power for the sirens at Indian Point, which were installed when the plant was built in the mid-1970s. The plans called for replacing the 156 old sirens, which had mechanical rotating horns and were activated by radio signals, with new units featuring activating systems that can be triggered by cellphone, microwave radio or Internet-based signals. But company officials say numerous glitches have prevented the system from operating properly. And public officials say the project has become a nightmare, sucking up time, energy and resources, with the outcome still uncertain. “This has consumed so much time for so long — half my staff on a daily basis in one way or another,” said Tony Sutton, the commissioner of emergency services in Westchester County. “And when we’re done, what will we have? An outdoor siren system born in the cold war.” Well, one hopes it will be a better siren system, but still, the episode does raise questions. The first, as enunciated more than once by the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, is if Entergy has so much trouble getting the sirens to work, what does it say about its ability to run, say, a nuclear plant? Second, as Mr. Sutton puts it, is this is the level of technology we should expect now? The sirens, it turns out, are meant to be heard outside, not inside. This might have made sense three decades ago, when most people didn’t have air-conditioning and left the windows open, and shopped on Main Street instead of at a bunkerlike mall. Might not a system with text messages, e-mail links, chips that turn on television sets — something in tune with modern technology — make a bit more sense today? AN Entergy spokesman, Jim Steets, said the company’s expertise was in running nuclear plants not siren technology. He said that the idea that the siren problems speak to the overall operations of the plant was something of a cheap shot. Still, he says, “I’ll admit that we put ourselves in a position that enabled them to say it.” And both sides know that the siren issue isn’t really a siren issue. There’s not much margin of error on many large projects the public depends on — ask the drivers who use the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis. But there surely isn’t much on a nuclear plant at the edge of the most densely populated part of the country, which periodically has to explain things like leaks, however minuscule, of tritium and strontium 90. The sirens, presumably, will work sooner or later. The real battle, just beginning, is the epic one over renewing Indian Point’s license to produce electricity until 2035, a matter that probably won’t be decided for three years. And on that one, the issue is about a lot more than the sirens. It’s about why the sirens are needed, whether to renew the license for a plant that almost certainly could never be built at Indian Point today, and whether there’s any real alternative to the power it provides.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E1D71E3EF930A25754C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=entergycorporation">METRO BRIEFING | NEW YORK; Albany: Nuclear Standards Challenged<date>Published: July 13, 2007</date><text>Attorney General Andrew M.

Mr. Cuomo filed the papers in support of a legal challenge to the relicensing of the Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County by Andrew J. Spano, the county executive. The plant's owner, Entergy Nuclear, wants to extend the licenses of the plant's two active reactors for 20 years beyond their expiration dates of 2013 and 2015. Mr. Cuomo said federal regulators needed to evaluate more than the condition of the reactors before making a decision, and to consider factors like evacuation plans, the operator's performance and the risk of terrorism.

Fines<date>Published: May 20, 2007</date><text>County officials have asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to give any fines paid by the operators of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Buchanan to the four counties within a 10-mile radius. ''The four counties pay a hefty price to prepare for an emergency at Indian Point,'' the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, said in a statement announcing the request. ''It's only fair that fines placed on Entergy be used to help ease this burden on local taxpayers.'' The commission has said it plans to fine the plant's owner, Entergy, $130,000 for failing to install a new emergency siren system by April 15. The new system was supposed to have been in place by the end of January, but the company was granted a 75-day extension. Sirens malfunctioned during tests of the system, just days before the April 15 deadline. In a joint letter to the commission, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Nita M. Lowey supported the county's call for the fines to be directed to Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange Counties. ''As you know, Indian Point has experienced multiple safety and security deficiencies, including repeated failures of emergency sirens and leaks of contaminated water from spent fuel pools,'' they said in their May 16 letter to Samuel J. Collins, the regulatory commission's regional administrator. The funds, they said, could be used by the counties to improve their preparedness in the case of an emergency at the plant. Neil Sheehan, a commission spokesman, said fees and fines collected by the agency go directly to the United States Treasury. He said diverting the money somewhere else would be unprecedented. In the weeks since the siren failures, Entergy has continued to silently test the system to resolve the problems, most of which occurred in radio and microwave signals that prompt the sirens. Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said the company would know by early this week the plan for putting the system into service. BARBARA WHITAKER</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/opinion/WE-Indian.html?ref=entergycorporation">Energy and Safety<date>Published: May 6, 2007</date><text>Gov. Eliot Spitzer has now added his voice to the chorus of New York lawmakers imploring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct a thorough, independent safety inspection at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan  not the routine maintenance and oversight that the commission insists is all thats needed, but a special, meticulous, top-to-bottom review that includes experts from outside the region and input from the state. Mr. Spitzer is right to do so. The plant is aging and seemingly snake-bit, wrapped in a perennial fog of missteps and glitches and public-relations embarrassments. It leaks tritium and strontium. Its sirens continually fail. And its unplanned shutdowns are so frequent they seem to follow a schedule. Thats oxymoronic, but thats Indian Point for you. Now that Entergy Nuclear Northeast has officially submitted its application for 20-year extensions of Indian Points two reactor licenses, concerns about ineptitude and decrepitude are more relevant than ever. Mr. Spitzer is walking a potentially delicate line. Though conservation and efficiency can do much to reduce demand, New York State will need to increase supply, while striving to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels as well as its greenhouse gas emissions. It is hard to imagine achieving either objective without including some nuclear power in the energy mix. As badly as people may want to pull the plug on Indian Point  particularly those living in its shadow in New York City and the Hudson Valley  its still too early to do so. Mr. Spitzers responsible call for tougher inspections should not be construed as a campaign to blow a hole in the states power grid. There is, however, no contradiction in recognizing the need for clean-burning nuclear plants and the critical importance of making them impeccably safe and secure. Not everyone seems to get that. Mr. Spitzers original budget sought to charge New Yorks nuclear plants $13 million to help pay the state for using National Guard for security; that proposal was killed in the Legislature, to the delight of the energy companies, which had argued that it was only fair that they be allowed to shuck off that expense. And on one basic point  reliable warning sirens  Entergy seems bafflingly incompetent and lackadaisical, having missed repeated deadlines to install a functioning system. It was recently fined $130,000 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for blowing its April deadline; the company now promises to have a plan in place by the time the next deadline rolls around. Plans are one thing. Working sirens are another. Indian Points chronic missteps have badly strained public confidence, something that its owners and federal regulators should make it a priority to restore. They should start, at the very least, with an independent safety assessment. More Articles in Opinion »Gov. Eliot Spitzer has now added his voice to the chorus of New York lawmakers imploring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct a thorough, independent safety inspection at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan  not the routine maintenance and oversight that the commission insists is all thats needed, but a special, meticulous, top-to-bottom review that includes experts from outside the region and input from the state. Mr. Spitzer is right to do so. The plant is aging and seemingly snake-bit, wrapped in a perennial fog of missteps and glitches and public-relations embarrassments. It leaks tritium and strontium. Its sirens continually fail. And its unplanned shutdowns are so frequent they seem to follow a schedule. Thats oxymoronic, but thats Indian Point for you. Now that Entergy Nuclear Northeast has officially submitted its application for 20-year extensions of Indian Points two reactor licenses, concerns about ineptitude and decrepitude are more relevant than ever. Mr. Spitzer is walking a potentially delicate line. Though conservation and efficiency can do much to reduce demand, New York State will need to increase supply, while striving to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels as well as its greenhouse gas emissions. It is hard to imagine achieving either objective without including some nuclear power in the energy mix. As badly as people may want to pull the plug on Indian Point  particularly those living in its shadow in New York City and the Hudson Valley  its still too early to do so. Mr. Spitzers responsible call for tougher inspections should not be construed as a campaign to blow a hole in the states power grid. There is, however, no contradiction in recognizing the need for clean-burning nuclear plants and the critical importance of making them impeccably safe and secure. Not everyone seems to get that. Mr. Spitzers original budget sought to charge New Yorks nuclear plants $13 million to help pay the state for using National Guard for security; that proposal was killed in the Legislature, to the delight of the energy companies, which had argued that it was only fair that they be allowed to shuck off that expense. And on one basic point  reliable warning sirens  Entergy seems bafflingly incompetent and lackadaisical, having missed repeated deadlines to install a functioning system. It was recently fined $130,000 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for blowing its April deadline; the company now promises to have a plan in place by the time the next deadline rolls around. Plans are one thing. Working sirens are another. Indian Points chronic missteps have badly strained public confidence, something that its owners and federal regulators should make it a priority to restore. They should start, at the very least, with an independent safety assessment.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6DD133EF93AA15757C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=entergycorporation">THE WEEK; Indian Point Faces Fine on Siren System<date>Published: April 29, 2007</date><text>Federal regulators said last week that they intended to fine the Indian Point nuclear power plants $130,000 for failing to make an April 15 deadline to activate a new emergency siren system. The new system, mandated by an amendment to the federal Energy Policy Act of 2006, will provide backup battery power for all 150 emergency sirens throughout the region in the event of an electrical power failure, said Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the plant; the current system does not have backup power. In an emergency at Indian Point, in Buchanan, the sirens warn residents to turn on their TVs and radios. Indian Point missed the deadline primarily because in an April 12 test, 31 of the new sirens failed to be activated by radio, one of several ways in which they can be turned on. All 14 sirens in Putnam County failed; sirens are also in Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Entergy 30 days to submit a plan to start the new system or contest the fine. But it did not give the company a date to activate the system. ''We expect them to get it up and running in a timely fashion,'' said Neil A. Sheehan, an N.R.C. spokesman. Mr. Steets said that Entergy did not know exactly when the new system would be running but that it intended to submit a plan within the required 30 days. ''We're not anticipating a lot of new construction,'' he said. ''It's more about working through the technical circuitry.'' Entergy missed a Jan. 30 deadline to activate the system, receiving an extension from the N.R.C. to April 15. Phillip J. Musegaas, a policy analyst at Riverkeeper, an environmental monitoring group, said that the commission should fine Entergy $130,000 a day, the maximum allowed, until the new system is running. ''Why can't a company that makes $2 million a day running a complex power plant get this system up and running?'' Mr. Musegaas asked. ''A one-time fine doesn't set any real timetable.'' The missed deadline follows a string of minor leaks, fires and technical glitches at the plants over the past year, including the sirens' loss of power last August for more than six hours.

Mr. Steets said that the fire was probably caused by a worn-out bushing -- a type of porcelain insulator -- located on top of the transformer. Mr. Steets said one of the transformers will need to be replaced, having sustained considerable damage from the fire. He estimated the cost of a new transformer as $2 million to $3 million. The second transformer was ''slightly damaged'' and will not need to be replaced, according to Mr. Steets. The fire, which was quickly brought under control by an on-site fire brigade, was the second unplanned shutdown within a week for Indian Point 3 and the fourth shutdown since July 1. County officials said there was no release of radiation as a result of the fire. In response to the shutdown, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission downgraded the safety assessment of the plant from green to white, the second highest rating out of a possible four safety levels. ''We have an oversight program in place, and once you cross the threshold of more than three unplanned shutdowns over 7,000 hours, you will automatically have a change in status,'' said Neil Sheehan, spokesman for the commission. He added that the commission was in the process of setting up an inspection of the plant sometime within the next few weeks. But opponents of Indian Point said they remained unsatisfied with the response and called for an independent inspection of the site, separate from that of the commission. ''I don't consider the N.R.C.'s inspection to be an objective one,'' said Representative John Hall, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Westchester. ''They are in the business of promoting all nuclear energy plants.'' The congressman, who was the host of a forum in Beacon last Monday on wind power, the first in a planned series on alternative energy sources, said that he would continue to push for an independent inspection of Indian Point, particularly as Entergy is in the process of seeking renewal of their operating license. Testing of a new emergency siren system at Indian Point continued throughout the last few weeks in order to meet an April 15 deadline required by the N.R.C. Previous testing had indicated a failure of some of the sirens, a result that Mr. Steets said was not unusual when bringing a new system into service. ''People were a little hasty to draw an opinion on the operability of this new system based on some of the testing we conducted,'' he said. ''With each round, we gather data and make progress. The fact that not all of the sirens were sounding throughout the course of routine testing is not indicative of a failure, and we fully expect to meet our deadline.'' JULI S.

The plant was also forced to retest its new emergency system after problems arose with 123 of 150 new sirens. Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns and operates the plant, said the shutdown occurred at 4 a.m. Tuesday after operators noticed that the water level in the steam generators had dropped. The reactor was in the process of being brought back to full power after a scheduled 24-day refueling procedure. ''There were no safety implications or margins diminished in any way,'' Mr. Steets said. Service was returned by 1 a.m. Wednesday and was scheduled to reach full capacity by the end of the week, he said. David Novich, a spokesman for the Westchester County Department of Emergency Services, said he was satisfied with how the unplanned shutdown was handled. ''This is a complicated plant, and these sorts of incidents can occur when plants are brought back online,'' he said. On Monday, a test of the new siren system, scheduled to be ready by next week, ''indicated a need for additional work,'' Mr. Steets said. The problems do not jeopardize the existing system, which officials say has operated without incident for a year. Mr. Novich said that additional testing performed last Thursday had better results, with 17 of 150 new sirens not performing as required. ''Obviously, we want this to be 100 percent, but based on this second set of testing, we are clearly getting back on track,'' Mr. Novich said. Opponents of the plant were troubled by the incidents. ''No other plant has these kinds of problems,'' said Alex Matthiessen, president of the environmental group Riverkeeper. ''How many times are they going to avert disaster before their -- and our -- luck runs out?'' The Indian Point Reactors 2 and 3, in Buchanan, provide 10 percent of the state's electricity, and 25 percent for Westchester and New York City. Plant officials say they plan to apply for a renewal of their operating licenses with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this month. The current licensing agreements expire in 2013 for Plant 2 and in 2015 for Plant 3. Photo: IN BUCHANAN -- Indian Point nuclear power plants as seen from the Hudson River.

The commission said it would conduct extra inspections. The cause of the fire, which occurred shortly after 11 a.m. at the plant in Buchanan, N.Y., was not clear. The fire was extinguished by an automatic system and by the plants fire brigade, which sprayed foam. No radiation was released, but people in northern Rockland County, on the other side of the Hudson River, reported smoke and booms. Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, which owns the plant, said that operators were unsure if there had been an explosion. The booms might have been from an automatic dumping of excess steam, he said. The commissions downgraded assessment means that additional inspectors will be sent to look into the cause of the current shutdown and of the last three. Indian Point is on the east bank of the Hudson, 24 miles north of the Bronx. Reactor 1 has been decommissioned; Nos. 2 and 3 produce about 10 percent of the states electricity. The fire comes at a sensitive time for the plant. The owners are seeking to extend the 40-year licenses on the two operating reactors by 20 years, over the opposition of the Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano. They are also seeking to find and stop at least two leaks from spent fuel pools, which are allowing radioactive water to seep into the soil and, presumably, into the Hudson River. The plant is already subject to extra inspections because of the groundwater pollution. The commission acted on Friday because it was the plants fourth shutdown since last July 1. The national average is fewer than one unplanned shutdown per reactor per year. Were going to get rigorously attacked by our opponents, Mr. Steets said. In fact, Susan Tolchin, Mr. Spanos chief adviser, said that while the fire did not pose an immediate threat, in light of the plants recent operating history, this is a cause for concern for us. At a news conference, she also referred to the failure of the alarm sirens to work in a recent test. (The event on Friday was not serious enough to merit their use.) She said that the shutdowns, the sirens and the age of the plants, both of which entered service in the 1970s, are all reasons why County Executive Spano wants to see the plant shut down. Studies have shown, though, that building a replacement plant and reducing demand through efficiency would be difficult and costly. In addition, New York State has joined a pact with neighboring states to reduce global warming gases from power generation, which would be much more difficult if the reactors were shut. The other operable reactor, Indian Point 2, has had three unplanned shutdowns in the last 12 months. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ranks reactors according to 16 performance indicators, and both Indian Point plants had been green, the highest grade, in all of them, until the fire. But in the category of unplanned shutdowns per 7,000 hours of operation, Indian Point 3s grade is now white, the second-highest. The other categories are yellow and red. Seven thousand is the approximate number of hours that a well-run reactor will operate in a year. As the federal regulators have demanded improved performance, the threshold for sending in extra inspectors has declined, so that a single indicator below the top grade is now sufficient to do so. To maximize the number of hours it runs, the owners have switched Indian Point 3 to an every-other-year refueling system, and finished a refueling shutdown in record time, 24 days, on March 31. But it shut down again on April 3, before it could reach full power. In the predawn hours, it developed a problem in a pump that delivers clean, nonradioactive water to its steam generators, for heating into steam. On Friday it was still ramping up to full power when the fire hit. The company declared an unusual event, the lowest category in a four-level ranking of emergencies, at 11:43 a.m. The event was declared over about an hour later, but the fire was out before the event declaration; Mr. Steets said the operators took a few minutes to decide whether there had been an explosion, which would have moved the incident into the category of unusual event. Being unable to make a conclusive determination, they went ahead and declared the event. In Rockland County, C. J. Miller, a spokeswoman for the county executive, said that residents of Stony Point had called their local police to report smoke at 11:09 a.m., but that the county did not have any information from Entergy until an e-mail message at 11:36, and then a phone call 20 minutes after that. There is a repeated lag, she said, in what information is disseminated and when and to whom. If something happens, we need to act quickly. Last July, an electrical flaw in the generator caused the plant to shut down. Then workers put metal scaffolding too close to electrical equipment and observed electric arcing, so the plant was shut. A focus of the enhanced inspection will be to see if there are any physical issues or management issues that link the shutdowns. Juli S. Charkes contributed reporting from Hawthorne, N.Y.

That is one view. Another, persistently offered by the plants critics, is that the plant is an immediate threat to the safety and health of millions. The old debate took a new turn recently when the Indian Point operator, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, announced that it would seek a 20-year renewal of its operating licenses, which expire at the two reactors in Buchanan in 2013 and 2015. The anti-Indian Point side of the argument has some clear points on its side. The edge of the Hudson River in Westchester County, so close to so many millions of people, is a terrible place to put a nuclear plant. There is serious doubt that residents could be effectively evacuated after an accident, an issue that has taken on new resonance since 9/11. Although Entergy says it has tightened security, critics still argue that the company and federal regulators have not done enough to guard against terrorist attacks and sabotage. The plant is aging, it leaks tritium, strontium and other noxious substances into local groundwater, and its sirens are prone to failure. Its managers have a history of overlooking their responsibility to notify the public promptly about embarrassing mishaps. The plants case is basically one very big point: Indian Point is in place, and producing a large amount of much-needed energy. A recent National Research Council study found that the regions growing need for energy and the many obstacles to building new and relatively clean power sources would make replacing it very difficult. Shutting Indian Point  which produces about 30 percent of the regions current energy demand  would make electricity more expensive. It would also put a heavy burden on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a groundbreaking agreement among Northeast and mid-Atlantic states to limit carbon emissions. And if Indian Point closed, spent nuclear fuel could sit for many years at the decommissioned plant, for lack of any other place to put it. The most important question facing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, elected officials and area residents is whether it makes any sense to relicense a nuclear plant in a highly populated area from which swift evacuation is so problematic. The other critical issue is whether the age of the reactors, which date to the mid-1970s, should be a concern. As these reactors begin their fourth decade they may, like an old car, be more prone to breakdown. Faulty parts can be replaced, but it is worth asking whether the plant as a whole will remain safe through the end of its next licensing period. Living in the New York metropolitan region requires a constant balancing of risks, convenience and cost. Individuals, communities and governments come up with different answers as to whether it makes sense to live near a chemical plant, guard a reservoir or ride in a subway. As Indian Point comes up for renewal, its time to find that balance once again. More Articles in Opinion »Somewhere between heaven and hell lies the Indian Point nuclear plant, whose owners have run numbingly insistent advertising spots for years declaring it a safe, secure, vital energy panacea for the region. That is one view. Another, persistently offered by the plants critics, is that the plant is an immediate threat to the safety and health of millions. The old debate took a new turn recently when the Indian Point operator, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, announced that it would seek a 20-year renewal of its operating licenses, which expire at the two reactors in Buchanan in 2013 and 2015. The anti-Indian Point side of the argument has some clear points on its side. The edge of the Hudson River in Westchester County, so close to so many millions of people, is a terrible place to put a nuclear plant. There is serious doubt that residents could be effectively evacuated after an accident, an issue that has taken on new resonance since 9/11. Although Entergy says it has tightened security, critics still argue that the company and federal regulators have not done enough to guard against terrorist attacks and sabotage. The plant is aging, it leaks tritium, strontium and other noxious substances into local groundwater, and its sirens are prone to failure. Its managers have a history of overlooking their responsibility to notify the public promptly about embarrassing mishaps. The plants case is basically one very big point: Indian Point is in place, and producing a large amount of much-needed energy. A recent National Research Council study found that the regions growing need for energy and the many obstacles to building new and relatively clean power sources would make replacing it very difficult. Shutting Indian Point  which produces about 30 percent of the regions current energy demand  would make electricity more expensive. It would also put a heavy burden on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a groundbreaking agreement among Northeast and mid-Atlantic states to limit carbon emissions. And if Indian Point closed, spent nuclear fuel could sit for many years at the decommissioned plant, for lack of any other place to put it.

The debate between Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which runs the Indian Point nuclear power plant on the Hudson River in Buchanan, N.Y., and the environmental group Riverkeeper seemed to be going nowhere. Stances were solidified, distrust was deep. But when the call came to an Entergy spokesman to have yet another debate with his biggest nemesis  this one at a convent in Putnam County  how could he refuse? “Without an obvious, automatic reason to say yes, I thought about it,” said Jim Steets, the Entergy spokesman and the plant’s most visible public face. “And even after I said yes, I thought about it. But the religious aspect to the setting and the participants led me to believe it was the right thing to do.” Mr. Steets added that although he had assumed opponents of the plant would far outnumber supporters, he was confident the religious setting would keep the debate tame. The two sides met in late July at the Mariandale Retreat Center, founded by the Dominican Sisters. The event was organized by the Rev. Patricia Ackerman, an Episcopal priest from the Garrison Institute, a conference-and-retreat center at a nearby former monastery. Elsewhere in the United States, monasteries, convents and religious camps have been opening their doors to business mediation and strategy retreats, providing a neutral ground more conducive to long-term thought and cooperation than the office or a hotel conference room. Sally Simmel, the president of Narda, formerly the North American Retreat Directors Association, said the number of religious retreats catering in some form to businesses was in the “low hundreds.’’ Ms. Simmel said the reluctance to link business and religion began to lessen about five years ago. “The whole question of public conversation about religion became less of a no-no,” she said, “which has opened things up in good and not-so-good ways.” “It makes some sense that it started around the time that Bush came into office,” she said, “but the spread of technology at work has also led to a desire on business’s part to find places of tranquillity.” Another factor is that many religious orders are losing membership and must look to the outside for support. Many communities have vast buildings on their grounds that lend themselves to contemplation  of the biblical or business kind. Retreat camps have similar space advantages and are often in rural settings, making them good alternatives to hotel conference rooms. At a time when business people are plugged into electronic devices much of the day, holding meetings in throwback settings may be conducive to better listening. Rebecca S. Chopp, president of Colgate University and a former religion professor who has led business retreats in religious settings, said the long arc of religious thought could add to business perspectives, which tend to be shorter term. “It’s the wisdom of the centuries.’’ Dr. Chopp said. “The value structure is completely different,” she said, adding that in a religious setting, “people are not prized for what they produce.” Instead, Dr. Chopp said, “the fundamental aspect of much of religion is the notion of paying full attention,” of giving one’s mind over. That serves as an antidote to most traditional business settings. Lynn Salata, a frequent retreat leader and former General Motors employee, said that the smaller and more entrepreneurial the company, the more apt its members were to attend some form of meeting at a religious retreat.

Affiliated with the Ecumenical Catholic Church, the center, which opened in 2002, was intended to encourage participants to get into “the rhythm of prayer,” Ms. David said, whether or not they were actively religious.

This comparison is off-base and unfounded. Indian Point's reactor is protected by a multiple redundancy safety system, which includes a 31/2-to-41/2-foot-thick, steel-reinforced concrete containment dome that has been tested to withstand a direct impact by airplanes, similar to those which hit the World Trade Center towers. Unlike Indian Point, Chernobyl had no containment dome, but instead was covered by a metal roof. Also, Chernobyl operators were conducting reckless experiments that could never happen at a nuclear plant in the United States because of tight regulations and oversight by onsite Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors, as well as regular, extensive training for plant operators. With demand for electricity growing and supply shortages anticipated, Indian Point is a critical part of our energy infrastructure. The American record on nuclear power safety speaks for itself: in 50 years of commercial operation no one has ever died of a radiological incident at a United States nuclear plant. Laurent L. Lawrence Pelham The writer is program coordinator, New York Affordable Reliable Electricity Alliance. To the Editor: In ''Measuring Risk at Indian Point'' (Op-Ed, June 25), Herschel Specter never alludes to any safety issue other than a terrorist attack on the containment structure of the Indian Point nuclear power plant, and his platform suggests that this scenario is the only danger to the public. On June 27, Rep. Sue Kelly stood on the floor of Congress and asked for passage of legislation for an Independent Safety Assessment of the plant in light of radioactive leaks, repeated siren problems and public skepticism about the efficacy of the evacuation plan. In co-sponsoring the bipartisan legislation, Ms. Kelly stated, ''Indian Point is an aging plant with a history of problems.'' In 1996, an Independent Safety Assessment at the Maine Yankee nuclear plant discovered many deficiencies and the owners closed the plant. Before Entergy files and receives a 20-year license extension, the public has a right to know that the plant is being operated up to specifications, because terrorist attacks are not the only risk.

Even so, some members of Congress still support a shutdown, most likely because of their concerns about the emergency plans. And they're right: the plan could be improved. Better emergency planning could result in near-zero early deaths and injuries even if an Indian Point plant were successfully attacked by terrorists. At most, deaths in the long term would be a small fraction of the normal rate of cancer fatalities in the region. My company, in conjunction with two other consulting firms, spent two years examining Indian Point's emergency planning under the sponsorship of Entergy, the plants' owner. We assumed situations in which terrorists set out to cause large numbers of radiation injuries and deaths by creating a huge hole in one of the large containment structures surrounding each plant and then going on to cause a reactor meltdown. We determined that there are three levels of protection that significantly limit health consequences: the protection afforded by chemical, physical and biological processes that don't require human or mechanical action to be effective; actions the public can take; and actions by emergency planners and responders. Chemical reactions within the damaged containment structure cause much of the radioactive material to cling to nearby surfaces and not leave the site. Physical reactions cause the radioactive cloud that does leave the site to become increasingly diluted as it moves away from the plant. As it becomes more dilute, the risk of an early fatality sharply decreases (the biological response). To test the effectiveness of such forces of nature, we combined a highly unlikely successful terrorist attack with another improbable event: failure to take any emergency response for six hours. The expected number of offsite early fatalities was calculated to be about 28 people out of a population of 305,000 within ten miles of the plant, or less than 0.02 percent. However, this low figure is not good enough. We then set out to reduce these consequences. Most of the early fatality risk is within one mile of the plant; by two miles it is essentially gone. There are several ways that people can protect themselves. They can evacuate this inner two-mile circle by vehicle. If roads are jammed, they can take shelter first in their homes or workplaces and leave later, or they can walk out. Evacuation at two to three miles per hour, about walking speed, is sufficient to prevent early fatalities if begun within an hour and a half after the general emergency alarm is sounded. To take advantage of this, emergency planners should identify pedestrian evacuation routes within two miles of the site. Additionally, our study identified specific locations where opening up more traffic lanes would result in faster evacuations. Sounding the general emergency alarm earlier would also significantly reduce consequences. Television stations and the Internet should inform people of the location of the radioactive plume and whether it's better for them to take shelter or leave. And the Westchester County executive should realize that evacuating too many people can be counterproductive. The range of the early injury risk is about four miles. People can greatly limit this risk without depending on emergency responders by taking simple steps like seeking shelter if downwind from the damaged plant, breathing through a wet handkerchief or cloth face mask and protecting skin with clothing, a towel or a blanket. For those four miles to 10 miles from the plant, the dominant health concern is long-term. But at this distance, there is no need to evacuate. People should simply stay indoors and listen to the emergency alert system. If downwind, take shelter in a basement. Use wet handkerchiefs or face masks. The existing Westchester County community emergency planning booklet needs to be revised to take into account the findings of this two-year study. The public needs to be informed about the benefits of masks and of covering the skin, the location of pedestrian evacuation routes and rerouted traffic patterns. A revised booklet should tell residents who should evacuate and who should take shelter, and should clarify that waiting outdoors to be evacuated by bus does not offer protection and should be avoided. Most risks are in the Town of Cortlandt, followed by other areas in Westchester County. Rockland County is a distant third, and Putnam and Orange Counties are even less exposed. That is why we should focus on the in-close areas and not disperse emergency responders to low-risk areas. And most important, we need our community leaders to explain these new insights to the public and to update the present emergency plan.

Sirens<date>Published: June 18, 2006</date><text>The United States Department of Homeland Security has expressed concern about the coverage of the new siren system that Entergy Nuclear Northeast is installing across four counties for its Indian Point nuclear power plant. Concluding a brief review of a preliminary design report submitted by Entergy, a Homeland Security official said this month that the network ''will not provide complete coverage'' of the 10-mile emergency zone surrounding the two reactors in Buchanan. The official, Rebecca S. Thomson, who is chairwoman of the Radiological Assistance Committee in the Chemical and Nuclear Planning and Preparedness Division, also wrote, ''There was no explanation as to why such 'holes' are acceptable.'' Under federal legislation passed last year, Entergy must install backup power for its entire siren system. The current system, which alerts residents in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties to an emergency, has had many failings in periodic tests. County, state and federal officials have also said that they were worried about the impact of a blackout during an emergency at Indian Point. Entergy is now replacing 156 rotating sirens with about 130 stationary sirens with four-way speakers, said Jim Steets, a spokesman for the company. He said each siren would be equipped with four backup batteries. Mr. Steets said the criticism from Homeland Security, which was first reported by The Journal News, was part of the ''input process.'' He added that Entergy would review the department's findings and could make changes even though installation of the new system had begun. The new network must be in place by next January, he said. ''The acoustic studies that we did tell us that they are audible,'' he said of the sirens in the 10-mile zone. ''That doesn't mean that we are going to dismiss their feedback, but we are going to look at it and compare it to our studies and then make a determination.'' Officials in Rockland County said they found the issues raised by Homeland Security disturbing. C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, was already upset by Entergy's plan to reduce the number of sirens in his county to 40 from 51. ''We have not been given answers as to why they are considered redundant,'' he said in a statement. ''I want to make sure that all areas of Rockland County are covered adequately with the notification system and that all residents are alerted in case of an emergency at Indian Point.''

The report, commissioned three years ago in a bill sponsored by Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester Democrat, found that New York could replace the energy generated by Indian Point if the reactors were shut down, but that other options would be costlier, create more pollution, and leave New Yorkers more vulnerable to natural gas shortages. Ms. Lowey, who opposes the plant for safety reasons, called the report good news at a news conference held in White Plains on Tuesday, saying it demonstrated that the plant was not indispensable and that the increased costs of alternatives like wind and coal power would be modest. ''We can meet the region's energy demand without Indian Point,'' she said. For years, Ms. Lowey and other elected officials have fought to close the plant, which sits along the Hudson River in a densely populated area. That effort only gained momentum after the 9/11 attacks, when it was learned that Al Qaeda had considered attacking nuclear reactors and that one of the hijacked jets that crashed into the World Trade Center flew past Indian Point along the way. But the committee that released the report concluded that closing Indian Point would create enormous problems for the state. It found that although the two reactors at the plant make up only about 5.3 percent of New York's generating capacity, they produce 10.1 percent of its electricity output. Because of rapidly growing electricity demands in the area, the amount of generating capacity will be inadequate to meet peak demand in three years. If the plant is closed, the study found, that shortfall would be much greater. Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, Indian Point's owner, said the report ''could not have made a better case'' for keeping Indian Point open. Gays Married Elsewhere Now Recognized in County Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, signed an executive order on Wednesday guaranteeing that same-sex marriages performed in other states and countries would now be recognized in Westchester. The order, announced at a town hall meeting, grants gay couples access to family housing, family passes to county parks and a number of other programs and services available to heterosexual couples. But the order is also limited because it applies only to county departments and agencies, and does not grant same-sex couples various state and federal privileges, like the right to file joint tax returns. The order is the latest in a series of gay rights measures that Mr. Spano has pushed for since he entered office a decade ago, including a domestic partner benefits program he established in 1998. A handful of municipalities across the state, including New York City, have measures recognizing gay marriages similar to the one Mr. Spano signed on Wednesday, but his order makes Westchester the first county on that list. As of now, Massachusetts is the only state that allows gay couples to marry. Mr. Spano said he came up with the idea for the measure last year, but waited for the county's legal department to clear it. He received a standing ovation when he announced it at the town hall meeting, an event that was attended by hundreds of members of gay activist groups. ''It's a matter of equality,'' he said in an interview. ''We have kids who are picked on in school because they're gay or lesbian, we have churches that are trying to change people's orientations, and we can't allow that. We want to make sure that people feel comfortable.'' Laura Newman, Mr. Spano's liaison to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in Westchester, said the measure was a big step, but would be largely symbolic because the county already recognizes most gay couples as families. As a result of the measure, she said, more than half of all New Yorkers now live in areas where same-sex marriages are recognized. ''This will let the community know that they can expect to be treated fairly if they wish to access county services,'' she said. Smaller Tax Raise Proposed, But a Help Line Is Cut The $806.4-million budget that was approved by the Yonkers City Council last week contained some tradeoffs that signaled good news and bad news for residents. The council trimmed a proposed 5 percent property tax increase to 3 percent, but that gain meant a loss somewhere else -- the long awaited 311 nonemergency help line. The city had already spent $350,000 last April to buy the equipment for the system, with the approval of the City Council. Mayor Philip A. Amicone proposed the service in his State of the City address in February, saying that the system would make life easier for residents while adding about $100,000 to the city payroll each year. The system was modeled after the one in New York City, where operators take calls 24 hours a day about things like broken streetlights, cats stuck in trees and overflowing garbage cans. Mayor Amicone had predicted that the service would reduce calls to the city's overburdened 911 system by about 50 percent. But the City Council decided not to approve the proposal that would pay for the operators, in part because it wanted to keep property taxes down but also because it considered the system unnecessary, said Chuck Lesnick, the council president. Yonkers already has a help line, 377-HELP, that may not sound as catchy as 311, he said, but works well. ''If the mayor wants to rename 377-HELP so that it's easier to remember, that's fine with us,'' he said. In a city like Yonkers, where a recent audit found its school system so archaic that workers keep records on index cards instead of computers, the 311 line would have been a rare technological advance. Unlike the current help line, the 311 system would have been run by workers on computers with the ability to track complaints over time and provide immediate access to various city departments, said David Simpson, a spokesman for Mr. Amicone. ''I think a lot of residents are going to want to know why you would purchase a system if you're not going to fund the bodies to operate it,'' Mr. Simpson said. Photos: Representative Nita M.

Water in the pool is contaminated with tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that is incorporated into the water just as normal hydrogen is. Several weeks ago, samples from a new monitoring well found that the tritium has come closer to the Hudson River than previously believed, although the presumption since the leak's discovery was that the tritium would eventually reach the river. In its report, the commission said it had "not found any condition that indicates that occupational or public health and safety have been, or likely will be, affected by the current onsite groundwater contamination." The commission said it had reviewed, and did not dispute, an estimate by the plant owner, Entergy, that the largest direct exposure that a member of the public could receive from the leaking tritium was less than one ten-thousandth of 1 percent of the maximum that the plant is allowed to cause by leaking liquids. The figure refers only to the leak, and not from the routine, planned releases of slightly radioactive liquids into the Hudson River. Those are far larger than the amount being leaked, but still well below legal limits, plant operators say.

In fact, while stopping short of seeking its closure, she has been very publicly incensed over the plant's recent problems. These include repeated malfunctions of warning sirens, a small but steady leak of radioactive water from Unit 2's spent-fuel pool, and persistent public dissatisfaction with the evacuation plan. This stance would be typical of a liberal Democrat, but it is unusual for Congresswoman Kelly, who very often sides with the conservative right, and who counts the National Rifle Association among her top campaign contributors. Last week, for example, she voted to cut $50 million in benefits for the poor, joining with seven of nine New York Republican representatives. The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group that has been rating politicians' voting records for each session of Congress since 1970, gave Mrs. Kelly a 68 out of 100 for 11 votes in the 2003-4 session, according to Charles Porcari, a spokesman for the group. "A 68 is extraordinarily high for a Republican," he said, noting that Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, and Representative Nita M. Lowey, all Democrats, scored 100 percent for the 108th session. But Mrs. Kelly's well-publicized anxiety about Indian Point, which provides Westchester and New York City with 20 to 30 percent of their electricity, only mirrors the worries of her constituents, about 300,000 of whom live within 10 miles of its three reactors. According to a Pace University poll conducted this year, of 608 Hudson River area residents in 17 counties of New York State including Westchester, nearly half agreed that "New York should close its existing nuclear plants, which are too risky given the dangerous realities of today's world." A more comprehensive poll, conducted in 2002 by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, found 56 percent of New Yorkers who live within the 10-mile radius very concerned about a terrorist attack there, and the same proportion equally concerned about an accident caused by equipment failure or human error. The study, sponsored by the environmental group Riverkeeper, surveyed 1,118 residents who lived within 50 miles of the plant; it found that nearly as many of the farther-flung residents were just as worried as the others. If it were up to Julie Testwuide of Yorktown, the Indian Point plant would close tomorrow. "With the amount of people living close to the plant," said Mrs. Testwuide, "I'm astonished that it was ever allowed to be built around a crowded metropolitan area in the first place." Mrs. Testwuide, a photographer who is the mother of three, feels strongly that she and her neighbors should be better protected from potential dangers presented by the nuclear facility. Although she doesn't follow Mrs. Kelly's position on the issue very closely, the congresswoman "seems to have one of the strongest views on the plant," a stance that Mrs. Testwuide said would influence her vote in future elections. Support like this would probably please Mrs. Kelly, as her district includes Yorktown, as well as Buchanan and all of northern Westchester, as well as parts of four other counties. Indeed, Mrs. Kelly says that she feels accountable for the safety of everybody who lives near Indian Point.

This week, there was a leak from one of the pools containing the spent-fuel rods. The storm of protest over the handling of the leak, with several elected officials expressing anger that they were not notified sooner, recalled the months and years following the Sept. 11 attacks, when the movement to shut the plant down had the most momentum. But even if the plant were to be shut, as some state and federal lawmakers continue to urge, the issue of what to do with the highly radioactive spent-fuel rods would not go away. With plans to accept spent fuel, at Yucca Mountain in Nevada delayed, those rods would most likely remain here in northern Westchester County for many years. Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the plant, is now developing a storage system using dry casks or silos to contain the spent-fuel rods, because the pools that now hold the rods will eventually run out of room. It was during excavation work earlier this month in preparation for the transfer of rods that workers found dampness along a hairline crack on the outside wall of the pool at reactor No. 2. The leak was so small that it was difficult to collect enough water at first to test, and initial tests came back negative. But another test days later revealed low levels of radioactivity, and Entergy officials are now trying to determine its precise source, a process that could take weeks. It could be residual moisture from a much larger leak from the same pool that was repaired in 1992. Engineers are also considering the possibility that there is a small hole in the pool's steel liner through which water is seeping. Whatever its source, Entergy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal agency that oversees the nuclear industry, have said that the leak poses no health risk to the public or to workers at the plant. Tests show that the level of radioactivity in the leaking water is minimal - less than 1 percent of the amount in a household smoke detector. The level drops away to almost nothing 1 to 2 feet from the moisture On Friday, workers - whose radiation exposure at the plant is meticulously tracked - toiled within feet of the leak, without protective clothing Leaks are not unusual at nuclear power plants, Entergy officials say. For 15 years, water from a slow leak at another pool at the inactive Indian Point 1 reactor has been monitored, collected and disposed of. But what incensed elected officials this week was the delay in notifying them. They learned on Tuesday, along with the news media, about the leak, which was discovered to be radioactive nearly two weeks earlier. This week, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for Senate hearings. The Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, asked for a meeting with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's chairman, Nils J. Diaz. And the State Emergency Management Office, with Gov. George E. Pataki's support, wrote to the commission to demand an investigation. Entergy officials say they were taken aback by the official response, arguing that they followed all protocols in dealing with the leak. They said they would have alerted public officials sooner had there been any threat. Moreover, Entergy said, it needed time to assess the leak so that it had information. "If we were to try to communicate the minute we find evidence of something, we would be overwhelming the public with information," said Geoffrey E. Schwartz, the engineer in charge of the dry cask storage project. Don M. Leach, Entergy Nuclear Northeast's director of engineering, said: "There is nothing other than a completely aboveboard, rigorous process at work here." But Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, who has long been critical of Entergy, said the company should have alerted elected officials immediately. "They should have said, 'Here's what we know and we can't draw any conclusions, so sit tight,' " he said in a phone interview on Friday. "If they were to start engaging in that sort of pattern, eventually there would be a sense that there's a cop on the beat." On Tuesday, Representative Nita M. Lowey issued a statement voicing "outrage that Entergy left the public in the dark about this leak for over a week." She contended that Entergy would not have discovered the leak were it not for the construction work. But Entergy counters that any major leak would be apparent from dropping water levels in the pools. And chemists and engineers periodically bore into the soil for samples and continually monitor the air. "We have a lot of data points to give us information that something's not right," Mr. Leach said.

Entergy officials say they were taken aback by the official response, arguing that they followed all protocols in dealing with the leak. They said they would have alerted public officials sooner had there been any threat. Moreover, Entergy said, it needed time to assess the leak so that it had information. "If we were to try to communicate the minute we find evidence of something, we would be overwhelming the public with information," said Geoffrey E. Schwartz, the engineer in charge of the dry cask storage project. Don M. Leach, Entergy Nuclear Northeast's director of engineering, said: "There is nothing other than a completely aboveboard, rigorous process at work here." But Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, who has long been critical of Entergy, said the company should have alerted elected officials immediately. "They should have said, 'Here's what we know and we can't draw any conclusions, so sit tight,' " he said in a phone interview on Friday. "If they were to start engaging in that sort of pattern, eventually there would be a sense that there's a cop on the beat." On Tuesday, Representative Nita M. Lowey issued a statement voicing "outrage that Entergy left the public in the dark about this leak for over a week." She contended that Entergy would not have discovered the leak were it not for the construction work. But Entergy counters that any major leak would be apparent from dropping water levels in the pools. And chemists and engineers periodically bore into the soil for samples and continually monitor the air. "We have a lot of data points to give us information that something's not right," Mr. Leach said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/opinion/nyregionopinions/WE_Nuke.html?ref=entergycorporation">A Troubling Leak<date>Published: September 25, 2005</date><text>The seepage has been slow, showing up only in trace amounts.

The decision by Entergy and the commission to delay reporting a leak of radioactive water from a spent-fuel pool at Indian Point led to a predictable eruption of anger last week. Officials from Senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer to county executives in Westchester and Rockland expressed dismay at having been left in the dark for three weeks about the problem, which was discovered during excavation work and still has not been fixed.

The announcement was made by NuStart Energy, a consortium of companies that has substantial government financing. The consortium selected a site in Claiborne County, Miss., adjacent to Entergy Nuclear's Grand Gulf reactor, and another in northern Alabama, next to the Tennessee Valley Authority's long-abandoned Bellefonte nuclear construction project. The Energy Department is committed to sharing costs to develop the two applications, and has agreed to pay the application fee, about $30 million, for one of them; the consortium is asking the department for money for the other. At the same time, Entergy announced that it would act on its own to develop an application for a reactor at a site next to its Waterford plant, in Louisiana. The government, the reactor manufacturers and companies that own and operate existing reactors are testing a reformed licensing procedure, established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the 1990's to avoid the pitfalls of the 1970's and 80's, when several reactors were ordered and construction begun before design was completed or regulatory approval obtained.

That was because the same system, designed to warn residents who live in four New York counties within 10 miles of the plant here of a radiological accident, has had problems on three other occasions in just the last two months. Four years after the Sept. 11 attacks stoked fears about Indian Point's vulnerability, the response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster raised fresh anxieties over emergency plans at the plant. And to a large extent, those plans begin with the sounding of sirens that alert residents in parts of Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange Counties to listen to broadcast warnings. "I think it's devastating in light of what happened in New Orleans," Millie Rivera-Gutierrez, who lives a half mile from the plant's reactors, said of the most-recent siren failures. Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns Indian Point, acknowledged a handful of problems with the siren test on Wednesday evening, but concluded that over all it was "successful," said Jim Steets, a company spokesman. The test coincided with a review by the United States Department of Homeland Security of all security and emergency procedures at the plant as part of an assessment of the nation's infrastructure. Two sirens in Yorktown, in northern Westchester, did not go off. In Rockland County, the sirens did not work at first because of the failure of a backup activation system that relies on radio signals. (The sirens did sound minutes later when officials switched to phone lines, the system's primary activation tool.) And faulty sensors on 19 sirens indicated they did not rotate the way they should, to spread the alarm in every direction, but Entergy said observers on the ground found that most did rotate. "We're frustrated that the radio backup didn't work in Rockland, and we agree that is a problem and should be fixed," Mr. Steets said. He said Entergy was working on the sirens in Yorktown. As for the sensors, he said that Entergy needed the cooperation of county officials to resolve the problem because the sensors provide county emergency planners with information by computer. "There doesn't seem to be a willingness to work with us," he said. The shortcomings were just the latest in a string of breakdowns. On July 19, power failures caused by a storm disabled the entire emergency network for six hours. A week later, another storm knocked out 20 of the 156 sirens. And in August, problems with the phone lines that activate the sirens interrupted communications with parts of the system. "How many times does the system have to fail before immediate action is taken?" said Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, in a statement. In a phone interview on Friday, Mr. Spano said he was as frustrated by Entergy's response as he was by any faulty technology. "There's no sense of urgency," he said. "It's the constant defensiveness about it." After the problems in July and August, Entergy agreed to overhaul the siren system to include a backup power source. But it is still unclear how and when that will happen. Entergy told county officials that the company would revamp the system to include backup power within two years, but county officials have pressed for a shorter timetable. Entergy is also considering installing a reverse 911 system in which residents would also be notified of an emergency by telephone. Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef of Westchester had another suggestion. On Friday, she recommended to Entergy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the sirens be replaced with an automated-voice system that uses loudspeakers.

The review is part of a sweeping initiative by the federal government to assess the vulnerability of the nation's infrastructure. A dozen experts from several federal agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the F.B.I. and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, converged on Indian Point's two reactors, in Buchanan, N.Y., to conduct a three-day inspection. The team started its review of security and emergency plans for Indian Point last week in Washington, according to Kirk Whitworth, a spokesman for Homeland Security. The officials will identify gaps in those areas and suggest improvements in a report to be issued next week, Mr. Whitworth said. The report will not be made public, but it will be shared with local law enforcement officials and the plant's owner, Entergy Nuclear Northeast. As the agencies were working in private on the plant's grounds, across the Hudson River in Rockland County an environmental group that has called for Indian Point's closing was staging a flashy protest. The environmental group, Riverkeeper, like other critics of the plant, argues that it would be impossible to evacuate the more than 300,000 people who live within 10 miles of the plant, which is 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. Opponents also criticize what they call a lack of security at the plant. They are concerned, for example, that planes are allowed within 1,000 feet of the reactors and boats within 500 feet of the shore. To illustrate those points, a Riverkeeper boat bearing a large banner of a yellow "sitting duck" motored back and forth while a plane flew overhead dragging a sign that read, "FEMA: Late to Katrina, Lying to New York." The crafts were well outside the boundaries, but a law enforcement boat and helicopter tailed them for a time nonetheless. Alex Matthiessen, Riverkeeper's president, called the response "a farcical show of force to give the impression that they are actually protecting the plant." He said that the group's own boat passed by the plant about 100 times a year, and the group had concluded that the security is "very, very minimal." But Mr. Whitworth countered Riverkeeper's challenge, saying that the point of the review was to improve communication between the federal, state and local agencies that would be responsible for dealing with an accident at the plant. "We believe that this coordination is going to enhance security and emergency response at Indian Point," he said. In the next 18 months, federal agencies will conduct similar reviews of all the nuclear power plants in the country. The reviews started in May, with Indian Point the eighth of more than 70 to be assessed. The Department of Homeland Security, which was created after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, will also investigate the security at chemical plants, liquid-natural-gas facilities and transportation networks, Mr. Whitworth said. Mr. Matthiessen said that the federal government's handling of the Hurricane Katrina disaster did not augur well for a nuclear accident or a terrorist attack at Indian Point. "FEMA's gross incompetence has been on full display during the tragic events down in New Orleans," he said. "And that was a natural disaster for which we had several days' warning." He urged the federal government to withdraw its approval of the emergency plan for Indian Point, and for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to revoke Indian Point's license. The emergency plan was approved two years ago despite the protests of local officials and after a highly critical study commissioned by Gov. George E. Pataki by James Lee Witt, a consultant and former FEMA director.

Skip to next paragraph Hubert Worley/Entergy J. Wayne Leonard is dealing with dedicated, but exhausted, employees. Extended Version of the Saturday Interview (Sept. 10, 2005) Forum: Energy Entergy, which was based in New Orleans and is coping with the evacuation of thousands of employees even as it races to restore service, has been given high marks for its initial response. But conversations with Mr. Leonard, 54, do not get very far before it becomes clear that his pride in the company is tempered by dismay at the price the region's poorest citizens have paid for what he sees as society's unwillingness to invest more in their needs. Their plight has long been a concern for Mr. Leonard, who ordered that photographs of impoverished residents in Entergy's service region be put on display at its headquarters shortly after he became chief executive. Mr. Leonard spoke about the hurricane and its aftermath by telephone Thursday afternoon from Little Rock, Ark. Following are excerpts from that conversation: Q. Close to 10,000 linemen and tree trimmers from other utilities and contractors have joined the thousands of Entergy employees working to restore power, which creates huge logistics challenges for you. Does the industry need more extensive and formalized agreements to make emergency responses more efficient? A. No. It's the culture of people who have been in the business for a long time that we feel the exactly same sense of urgency whether it's our lights or someone else's. Other companies are eager to return the favor. Crews don't want to be sent home. They want to be sent to New Orleans. And these guys are exhausted. It's a wonderful business when something like this happens. You realize how dedicated people are. Q. You've spent a lot of time talking to government officials at all levels about the recovery process. What's your assessment of how well the various levels of government have understood and reacted to Katrina's impact on the power industry? A. They have been far more understanding of what we're up against than I've ever seen before. Nobody has said no to anything we've asked for. The Department of Commerce called me this morning before I even got out of bed to go over our list of long-term needs. When we've said we won't go there without protection, they've delivered it. Everybody understands now that power is an absolute necessity. Q. What advice would you give a business school that wanted to train tomorrow's executives for dealing with crises like Katrina? A. The easy part of this is that it's a crisis. We have all the skills and planning to deal with catastrophe because we deal with it on a small scale all the time. One of the most important things is that your plans can be useless but the planning process is invaluable. It teaches people how to get back on the page when you're off it. The second thing is that you always have to have a structure where someone's in charge. You have to have people on the front line empowered to make common-sense decisions. They have to know they can spend what they need to spend. You've got to make battlefield promotions and be willing to go in and divide up your organization. Some people will have half as much responsibility and twice as much work. And you have to stay ahead of your employees because they are totally stressed. You've got to get professional help for your people. Q. How have you gone about stress management in this case beyond providing counseling? A. On Day 1, we told them you're going to have a job. We may not know where yet, but you're going to have one. One woman who was working in the call center broke down crying when I was visiting yesterday. She apologized to me. She had been working for nine days straight and then her son called and said he missed his school bus. Obviously she wasn't crying over the missed bus. I just hugged her. You've got to give a lot of hugs that just don't seem very businesslike. When I walked away, she was right back on it. Q. You said when you announced last week that Entergy would temporarily move its headquarters to Clinton, Miss., that the company would return to New Orleans as soon as possible. If Baton Rouge were to emerge as the dominant business center in Louisiana, would Entergy still return to New Orleans and, if so, why? A. New Orleans is our home. It's festive and caring and our heart is certainly there. We'll do everything possible to make sure it returns to the city it was. But it's not carved in stone. That's one of the reasons that I want to be at the table when the decisions are made about money that needs to be put into restoring the coast, into the schools and into mass transportation. It's not a matter of just dropping a few sandbags on the levee. If those things don't happen, moving back wouldn't be the right answer for the business.

They have been far more understanding of what we're up against than I've ever seen before. Nobody has said no to anything we've asked for. The Department of Commerce called me this morning before I even got out of bed to go over our list of long-term needs. When we've said we won't go there without protection, they've delivered it. Everybody understands now that power is an absolute necessity. Q. What advice would you give a business school that wanted to train tomorrow's executives for dealing with crises like Katrina? A. The easy part of this is that it's a crisis. We have all the skills and planning to deal with catastrophe because we deal with it on a small scale all the time. One of the most important things is that your plans can be useless but the planning process is invaluable. It teaches people how to get back on the page when you're off it. The second thing is that you always have to have a structure where someone's in charge. You have to have people on the front line empowered to make common-sense decisions. They have to know they can spend what they need to spend. You've got to make battlefield promotions and be willing to go in and divide up your organization. Some people will have half as much responsibility and twice as much work. And you have to stay ahead of your employees because they are totally stressed. You've got to get professional help for your people. Q. How have you gone about stress management in this case beyond providing counseling? A. On Day 1, we told them you're going to have a job. We may not know where yet, but you're going to have one. One woman who was working in the call center broke down crying when I was visiting yesterday. She apologized to me. She had been working for nine days straight and then her son called and said he missed his school bus. Obviously she wasn't crying over the missed bus. I just hugged her. You've got to give a lot of hugs that just don't seem very businesslike. When I walked away, she was right back on it. Q. You said when you announced last week that Entergy would temporarily move its headquarters to Clinton, Miss., that the company would return to New Orleans as soon as possible. If Baton Rouge were to emerge as the dominant business center in Louisiana, would Entergy still return to New Orleans and, if so, why? A. New Orleans is our home. It's festive and caring and our heart is certainly there. We'll do everything possible to make sure it returns to the city it was. But it's not carved in stone. That's one of the reasons that I want to be at the table when the decisions are made about money that needs to be put into restoring the coast, into the schools and into mass transportation. It's not a matter of just dropping a few sandbags on the levee. If those things don't happen, moving back wouldn't be the right answer for the business.

Entergy, the electric utility that serves New Orleans and many other parts of the region damaged by Hurricane Katrina, indicated that despite the widespread damage, shareholders could expect no more than a slight, temporary dip in the company's profits. That is partly because New Orleans represents only a small portion of Entergy's overall revenues - about 7 percent - and an even smaller share of earnings. Skip to next paragraph Forum: Energy And it is partly because some of the lingering effects of the hurricane could actually benefit other business operations of Entergy, whose regulated utilities serve 2.7 million business and residential customers in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas. Also, Entergy's biggest unregulated unit is the nation's second-largest operator of nuclear power plants, after Exelon. Entergy's nuclear portfolio includes five Northeastern plants, which could benefit if natural gas prices continue to rise. "Ironic isn't really the right word," said Timothy M. Winter, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, noting that the storm that is hurting Entergy in Louisiana has contributed to rising energy prices that could help it elsewhere. No wonder the company's stock has been so buoyant. The shares, which closed at $77.38 on Aug. 23, the last trading day before Katrina came ashore, have already begun recovering from a low of $73.65 on Sept. 1. They rose 11 cents, to $75.66, on Tuesday. In a conference call on Tuesday, Entergy's chief financial officer, Leo P. Denault, said it was too soon to provide many of the details that Wall Street craves, like revised earnings projections. He conceded that revenue and profit would take a hit, saying the company could no longer stand by previous forecasts that it would earn $4.60 to $4.85 a share this year and achieve earnings growth of 8 percent to 10 percent in 2006. Mr. Denault also said that the company did not have insurance to pay for interruption to its business and that the reserve funds that regulators in Louisiana and Mississippi had authorized it to accumulate for storm restoration had been used up by earlier bad weather before Katrina arrived. But Mr. Denault outlined a number of steps that could soften the financial blow, beyond asking regulators to authorize customer rate increases. One possibility, for instance, would be reduced spending on electricity obtained from other utilities as power that would have gone to New Orleans can be shifted elsewhere in Louisiana. Mr. Denault also assured analysts that the disaster spending would not force Entergy to retreat from long-term financial targets like growth of 5 percent or more annually in earnings per share. Analysts had expected such assurance. "History shows that cities rebuild and regulators make utilities whole," said Mr. Winter, who follows the industry for A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. He predicted that the stock would trade based on the company's projected performance in 2007. Katrina forced Entergy to shut - temporarily in most cases - 15 fossil fuel plants and 3 nuclear units. Mr. Denault said that the only ones damaged were five fossil fuel plants on the eastern side of New Orleans. About 631,000, or just over 57 percent, of Entergy's customers, were reconnected by Tuesday morning. And because those back online include most of the big industrial customers, Entergy is now supplying 77 percent of its normal load. It is not yet clear how much of the remaining load represents customers in New Orleans or other flooded areas who may be disconnected for months, or even permanently. Mr. Denault noted that many of the evacuees were now in areas, like Baton Rouge, La., or Jackson, served by Entergy and that demand for power in those places could rise. Mr. Winter said that the company's growth could accelerate in 2007 if natural gas prices remained high, because the nuclear division could benefit from strong demand. Not right away though. Mr. Denault said yesterday that most of Entergy's available nuclear capacity for this year and 90 percent of next year's was already under contract. Mr. Denault said no decision had been made on whether to defer an anticipated increase in the company's dividend, a matter that will be discussed at the fall board meeting. For all the financial optimism, Katrina's impact on everyday life affected the conference call, which Mr. Denault made from Little Rock, Ark. The company, which was based in a 28-story tower in downtown New Orleans, had about 1,800 employees in the area before it was evacuated. It is setting up temporary headquarters in Clinton, Miss. Mr. Denault began the call by thanking analysts for their thoughts and prayers, and many of the analysts prefaced their questions with consoling or encouraging remarks. "Nothing," Mr. Denault said, "is as profound as experiencing tragedy firsthand."

Some, like the thousands transferred by the Southern Company, are on loan from other branches of big utility conglomerates with a presence in the storm-damaged region. Others, like the 10 two-man truck units dispatched from New York City by Consolidated Edison have been sent with the industry's tacit understanding that no company is an island on the weather-vulnerable power grid. ''You volunteer to go with the understanding that it's at least two weeks,'' Steve Daquila, the leader of the ConEd unit, said by cellphone yesterday on the way to Birmingham, Ala. The trip is Mr. Daquila's first on-the-job plunge into hurricane country -- his past repair sorties have been to clean up winter storm damage in upstate New York and New England -- but he expects most of the challenges to be familiar. The power industry has master plans honed by decades of experience with natural disasters. ''You go because you want to help other people out,'' Mr. Daquila said. The priorities, as always, are restoring service to hospitals and other vital service providers like water treatment plants. In the gulf region, attention is also focused on oil refineries and natural gas pipelines that play crucial roles in supplying energy to the rest of the nation. Telephone companies are a priority as well, because a lack of communication has been hampering rescue and repair operations of all sorts. [Page C7.] But even as the crews cleared trees from downed power lines, rebuilt transmission towers and carefully re-energized short-circuited lines, the utility companies warned that it might be weeks before the full extent of the rebuilding challenge would be known. Entergy, the region's biggest provider of electricity, said portions of New Orleans might be without power for at least two months. Some smaller nearby utilities in flooded areas were also pessimistic. ''We can't even estimate when restoration of power will begin in St. Tammany Parish,'' said Susan Broussard, a spokeswoman for Cleco, a utility serving 80,000 in St. Tammany, a southeastern Louisiana county just across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. The temporary migration of technical help has become a standard feature of the utility industry's response to earthquakes and violent weather. Regional utility organizations, in this case the Southern Electric Exchange in Atlanta, serve as clearinghouses linking those willing to send help with utilities that need it. In the gulf states, thousands of linemen and other technical workers from out of state are expected to join local workers before the repairs are completed. Mississippi Power expects 2,500 workers from New York, Maryland, Kentucky and Texas. Alabama Power and Light, which like Mississippi Power, is a subsidiary of the Southern Company, has received help from Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Oklahoma. Entergy, of New Orleans, has temporarily abandoned its headquarters and is managing its restoration efforts from a backup command center in Jackson, Miss., a city that has also suffered extensive damage. The command center operated on backup power until electrical service was restored early yesterday, a spokeswoman, Yolanda Pollard, said. Entergy said that 1.1 million of its 2.7 million residential and business customers were without power as of 5 a.m. yesterday. By yesterday afternoon, roughly 200,000 customers had power again. Many of Entergy's biggest industrial customers take power directly from the large transmission lines that run from Baton Rouge, La., to New Orleans. Those lines had been built to withstand 150 m.p.h. winds and were among the first restored to full service on Tuesday, according to George Bartlett, Entergy's director of transmission operations. He said that he expected most refiners and manufacturers in the corridor to be able to resume business and that some had already done so. Mr. Bartlett said that refineries owned by Exxon Mobil and Murphy Oil were the only major ones situated south of New Orleans, an area where marshy conditions had forced the company to build less storm-resistant transmission lines. Entergy has made helicopter surveys of those lines and hopes soon to complete projections about when they can be restored. The Mississippi Power unit of the Southern Company appears to have been the hardest-hit utility. Katrina damaged 70 percent of its 8,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines and blacked out all 195,000 of its customers in southeastern Mississippi, the company said. A generating station just east of Gulfport, Miss., was knocked out by flooding. ''It may take as long as four weeks to restore service in the worst-hit areas,'' said Michael L. Tyndall, a Southern Company spokesman. As of yesterday, only about 5,000 Mississippi Power customers in Meridian, an inland city, were back online. Technology for managing the power grid helped some utilities limit the damage and could speed repairs. Alabama Power, for instance, has new control systems that recognize when transmission and distribution lines have been disrupted by weather-related damage. The controls stop the system from trying to restore power automatically before the hurricane has passed. The grid in years past would repeatedly start up and shut down during storms, which sometimes damaged equipment and delayed the restoration of service. Generally, beyond the priority services and industries, repair work for other customers proceeds from the least damaged areas toward the hardest-hit regions. ''There's a massive logistical challenge involved,'' said Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison Electrical Institute, an industry trade group. For the workers from other states, who are generally housed in schools and armories, even details as mundane as laundry are a factor. ''You pack for a week,'' Mr. Daquila of ConEd said, and hope for the best. Photos: Gasoline prices at grim new heights in Chicago.

In other words, all the time. That is not the case now, as a recent series of failures in the plant's emergency siren system demonstrated. Power failures caused by storms brought the whole network down for nearly six hours on July 19 and disabled 20 of 156 sirens on July 27. Earlier this month, parts of the system were knocked out again, by problems with telephone lines, which are used to spread the alarm in the plant's 10-mile evacuation zone extending into Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange counties. Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns Indian Point, said that if an emergency had occurred, radios could have been used instead of phone lines to get the sirens going, but this promise of a Plan B provides little comfort when Plan A is so unreliable. County Executive Andrew Spano is right to have thrown a fit. Although Entergy has now promised to provide backup power for the sirens, Mr. Spano isn't satisfied. He insists that its two-year schedule for the overhaul is too slow, and that the siren system itself is outdated and should be replaced. Mr. Spano called a meeting last week with officials from Entergy, Verizon, the four counties and federal and state emergency and utility agencies. His spokeswoman, Susan Tolchin, said agreements were reached to keep closer tabs on the existing siren network, with particular attention to phone lines, and to enhance its redundancy while continuing the two-year overhaul. It's hard to argue with Mr. Spano's urgency, especially in the post-9/11 world, where terrorism fears have heightened chronic worries about nuclear power.

They are bought for safety and stability, not high performance. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Christophe Vorlet Better Bets Until lately, that is. Indexes of utility stocks have doubled since their lows of October 2002, far outpacing the rest of the stock market. It has been the sector's sharpest rally since World War II. The move has also produced high valuations, making some professional investors cautious. Others are unfazed; they acknowledge that the sector is not as cheap as it was, but they also say that it may not be as richly valued as a pessimist may contend. And they assert that the factors that sent prices higher are still in force. One of the skeptics is Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates. "I wish I'd owned them two years ago," Mr. Yardeni said. "They've had a good run, but they're back to being fully valued. It's unlikely they'll keep running like this." Based on its estimates of earnings over the next year, Morgan Stanley reckons that the average price-to-earnings ratio of companies in its utility index is 94 percent of the P/E of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. That is one reason the bank advises keeping less money in the sector than its weight in the S.&amp; P. 500 warrants. Tim O'Brien, who manages two utility funds for Evergreen Investment Management, says that this near-parity in valuations has not occurred since at least the 1950's. He finds this troubling and warns investors not to expect further outsized gains. "The bulk of the significant outperformance is behind us," he said. Still, Robert Becker, a manager of utility funds for Cohen &amp; Steers, said the stability of utilities could bring in more buyers. "We believe we're in a low-return environment," Mr. Becker said. "Companies with predictable earnings and cash-flow growth are attractive, and utilities offer that." They also offer growth potential through mergers, he said. A bill passed by Congress last week allows utilities greater latitude to buy one another. If President Bush signs it, as expected, the sector may lure new investors, in Mr. Becker's opinion. Richard Bernstein, a market strategist at Merrill Lynch, is hopeful, too, in part because Mr. Becker's enthusiasm for utilities is not widely shared. The absence of much desire to hop on the bandwagon after the rally, contrary to Wall Street custom, is one reason that Mr. Bernstein describes utilities as "our favorite sector." Investors are underestimating utilities' earnings growth, he said, while counting on growth from economically sensitive sectors when the country's expansion may be running out of steam. "The only sector that is supposed to have accelerating earnings in '04 to '06 is utilities," he said. "They're like salmon swimming upstream. They deserve a superior valuation." Giving utilities more credit and factoring in a more modest outlook for other industries "does take away the egregious overvaluation that people worry about," Mr. Bernstein said. It was just a few years ago that the sector was egregiously undervalued, with a P/E barely 40 percent of the S.&amp; P. 500's, by Morgan Stanley's calculation. That discount was a byproduct of the taint from "Enron and the Enron wannabes," Mr. O'Brien said. The Enron bankruptcy and scandal, and efforts by other companies to expand their business mix beyond power generation and other staid activities considered traditional for utilities, led to a "reign of terror" by credit rating agencies, he said. Utilities are big borrowers, so they are especially sensitive to the opinions of firms that judge creditworthiness. Those firms advised many utilities that their ratings would be cut if they did not reduce debt on their books, Mr. O'Brien explained. Utilities scrambled to sell new shares to pay down the debt, sending their stock prices lower. "It got pretty ugly," Mr. O'Brien said. After "the debacle of '01, '02," he said, life became better for utilities. Rating downgrades abated, and yields on long-term government bonds plunged. Bonds and utilities tend to appeal to the same sort of investor: someone interested in safety and income. When bond yields fall, the dividend yields on utilities become more attractive and shares are snapped up. The 2003 tax cut on dividend income provided an additional incentive to buy. The lower tax rates had the effect of raising dividend yields in the hands of investors, but Mr. Yardeni says the increase in share prices has more than made up for the gain. "The dividends are worth more after taxes, and that's why P/E's went up," he said. "But they are no bargains now. The stocks are fully valued even after factoring in the lower tax rates." Mr. Becker crunches the numbers differently. The after-tax yield on utilities, compared with Treasury bond yields, remains higher than the historical average, he said. Dividends are important to Mr. Becker, who calls himself a traditionalist. He prefers owning utilities that operate in regulated markets, where the stability of earnings allows for high dividend payments. Within that segment of the industry, he favors companies that have opportunities to sell excess output elsewhere at whatever price the market will bear. Some examples are the Southern Company and Exelon. Another holding is Duke Energy. Apart from the straight-ahead utility, Duke is engaged in a number of businesses - it processes natural gas and owns pipelines - that could be spun out into separate entities, enhancing value to shareholders, he said. Now that share prices have soared, Mr. O'Brien looks abroad for companies he thinks offer better-than-average growth prospects, but without higher-than-average risk or valuations. His favorites include British water companies like Kelda, United Utilities and Pennon. "They offer really good earnings growth," he said, "and they just went through a five-year regulatory review and got a good deal." Earnings growth of 8 to 12 percent a year is "locked in" for that period, he said. Other European holdings include two German electricity producers, Eon and RWE. In the United States, Mr. O'Brien likes Exelon and TXU for their "above-average earnings growth and above-average sensitivity to energy prices." Unless they operate in states with strong regulatory constraints, utilities adjust the prices they command for electricity, based on the cost of the most expensive source of energy. When oil and gas are expensive, companies that produce much of their power from cheaper sources like nuclear energy and coal can widen their margins. That is especially true in the sweltering conditions that much of the country has faced lately, Mr. O'Brien said. Hot weather tends to coincide with higher oil and gas prices, increasing the price discrepancies with other fuel sources. Mr. Bernstein rates Cinergy, Constellation Energy and Entergy highly for their ability to benefit from differences in fuel prices. He also likes several high-yielding utilities that are less free to raise customers' rates, including PG&amp;E, Progress Energy, FPL, Dominion and Ameren. Utilities can't maintain their high-octane performance forever, but if Mr. Bernstein's and Mr. Becker's assessments are accurate, there may be plenty of mileage left in the stocks.

Investors are underestimating utilities' earnings growth, he said, while counting on growth from economically sensitive sectors when the country's expansion may be running out of steam. "The only sector that is supposed to have accelerating earnings in '04 to '06 is utilities," he said. "They're like salmon swimming upstream. They deserve a superior valuation." Giving utilities more credit and factoring in a more modest outlook for other industries "does take away the egregious overvaluation that people worry about," Mr. Bernstein said. It was just a few years ago that the sector was egregiously undervalued, with a P/E barely 40 percent of the S.&amp; P. 500's, by Morgan Stanley's calculation. That discount was a byproduct of the taint from "Enron and the Enron wannabes," Mr. O'Brien said. The Enron bankruptcy and scandal, and efforts by other companies to expand their business mix beyond power generation and other staid activities considered traditional for utilities, led to a "reign of terror" by credit rating agencies, he said. Utilities are big borrowers, so they are especially sensitive to the opinions of firms that judge creditworthiness. Those firms advised many utilities that their ratings would be cut if they did not reduce debt on their books, Mr. O'Brien explained. Utilities scrambled to sell new shares to pay down the debt, sending their stock prices lower. "It got pretty ugly," Mr. O'Brien said. After "the debacle of '01, '02," he said, life became better for utilities. Rating downgrades abated, and yields on long-term government bonds plunged. Bonds and utilities tend to appeal to the same sort of investor: someone interested in safety and income. When bond yields fall, the dividend yields on utilities become more attractive and shares are snapped up. The 2003 tax cut on dividend income provided an additional incentive to buy. The lower tax rates had the effect of raising dividend yields in the hands of investors, but Mr. Yardeni says the increase in share prices has more than made up for the gain. "The dividends are worth more after taxes, and that's why P/E's went up," he said. "But they are no bargains now. The stocks are fully valued even after factoring in the lower tax rates." Mr. Becker crunches the numbers differently. The after-tax yield on utilities, compared with Treasury bond yields, remains higher than the historical average, he said. Dividends are important to Mr. Becker, who calls himself a traditionalist. He prefers owning utilities that operate in regulated markets, where the stability of earnings allows for high dividend payments. Within that segment of the industry, he favors companies that have opportunities to sell excess output elsewhere at whatever price the market will bear. Some examples are the Southern Company and Exelon. Another holding is Duke Energy. Apart from the straight-ahead utility, Duke is engaged in a number of businesses - it processes natural gas and owns pipelines - that could be spun out into separate entities, enhancing value to shareholders, he said. Now that share prices have soared, Mr. O'Brien looks abroad for companies he thinks offer better-than-average growth prospects, but without higher-than-average risk or valuations. His favorites include British water companies like Kelda, United Utilities and Pennon. "They offer really good earnings growth," he said, "and they just went through a five-year regulatory review and got a good deal." Earnings growth of 8 to 12 percent a year is "locked in" for that period, he said. Other European holdings include two German electricity producers, Eon and RWE. In the United States, Mr. O'Brien likes Exelon and TXU for their "above-average earnings growth and above-average sensitivity to energy prices." Unless they operate in states with strong regulatory constraints, utilities adjust the prices they command for electricity, based on the cost of the most expensive source of energy. When oil and gas are expensive, companies that produce much of their power from cheaper sources like nuclear energy and coal can widen their margins. That is especially true in the sweltering conditions that much of the country has faced lately, Mr. O'Brien said. Hot weather tends to coincide with higher oil and gas prices, increasing the price discrepancies with other fuel sources. Mr. Bernstein rates Cinergy, Constellation Energy and Entergy highly for their ability to benefit from differences in fuel prices. He also likes several high-yielding utilities that are less free to raise customers' rates, including PG&amp;E, Progress Energy, FPL, Dominion and Ameren. Utilities can't maintain their high-octane performance forever, but if Mr. Bernstein's and Mr. Becker's assessments are accurate, there may be plenty of mileage left in the stocks.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/opinion/nyregionopinions/WE_power.html?ref=entergycorporation">The Options at Indian Point<date>Published: June 26, 2005</date><text>There are lots of reasons to wish for the closing of the Indian Point nuclear plant, which looms on the Hudson like a nagging worry.

Skip to next paragraph "I hate litter so if I see paper I tend to pick it up and throw it away," said the Democratic legislator, Michael B. Kaplowitz, who opposes the power plant. What he had found was a printout of an e-mail exchange between an official of Entergy Nuclear Northeast, the plant's owner, and another county legislator, Robert P. Astorino, the Republican nominee in the race for county executive. The exchange included talking points for the meeting from Entergy's director of communications, Larry Gottlieb. A copy of the e-mail printout was given to The New York Times by a third party who is not involved in politics or in Indian Point issues, and Mr. Kaplowitz confirmed its discovery. In a telephone interview, Mr. Kaplowitz criticized Mr. Astorino for letting Entergy script his response to the Democratic county executive, Andrew J. Spano, who is running for re-election and is a relentless opponent of Indian Point. "This e-mail clearly showed that Rob is at the beck and call of Entergy," Mr. Kaplowitz said. "Who would he be representing as county executive? I think Entergy has enough spokespeople and high-paid lobbyists." Mr. Kaplowitz said he had given the printout to Larry Schwartz, the deputy county executive, soon after the May 10 meeting. But a spokeswoman for Mr. Spano, Susan Tolchin, said this week that Mr. Schwartz had not shared the e-mail printout with Mr. Spano because he could not be sure of its authenticity and "didn't want to play politics." After reading a copy of the e-mail exchange faxed to her by a reporter, however, Ms. Tolchin criticized Mr. Astorino, calling him a "puppet" of Entergy. She demanded that he release other e-mail correspondence with the company. "He's going to be the Indian Point candidate," she said. Mr. Astorino's campaign manager, David Simpson, dismissed the correspondence as an innocent exchange of information. "People send him stuff all the time," he said. Referring to an environmental group, Mr. Simpson added, "They're trying to pigeonhole Rob as being in the pocket of Entergy, but we can pigeonhole Spano as being in the pocket of Riverkeeper." In the e-mail exchange, Mr. Astorino wrote only two lines to Mr. Gottlieb. First, he mentionedthat he had seen another Entergy spokesman at a recent event. Then he wrote, "I'll be there tonight and ask for the report and challenge Spano (who by the time I speak, even if I immediately follow him, will already be on Route 9!)." Mr. Gottlieb responded with a longer e-mail message later that morning, suggesting ways for Mr. Astorino to rebut Mr. Spano's arguments on issues ranging from the plant's relicensing to the performance of sirens in case of a blackout. At one point, Mr. Gottlieb used a vulgarity to describe the N.R.C.'s view of Mr. Spano, and said the agency knew that "he is politicizing the Indian Point issues...and they've pretty much run out of patience with him." Later, as an example of what Mr. Astorino might say, Mr. Gottlieb wrote: "Andy, move on. ... Stop wasting county money on this issue." In a phone interview, Mr. Gottlieb said that his e-mail message had reflected his "usual frustration" with Mr. Spano's criticism of the plant. He added that he had found it refreshing that Mr. Astorino had sought out Entergy's positions.

The discovery that the material, sold under the trade name Hemyc, does not provide enough protection to meet the commission's rules, follows a major effort to replace a different material, Thermo-lag, used for the same purpose. Problems with Thermo-lag were discovered in 1992. "If we were smarter we would have not allowed this stuff to be used in the first place," Brian W. Sheron, associate director of the project licensing and technical analysis office of the commission, said in an interview on Tuesday. As potential problems are discovered, he said, the commission moves to make the reactor owners correct them, at a pace that depends on estimates of the degree of the hazard. In this case, the immediate risk may be small, commission officials said. The commission was prompted to study Hemyc, Mr. Sheron said, when an inspector noticed that it did not look much different from other material being replaced. Hemyc is made of a silicon and a ceramic. The commission plans a meeting Friday with reactor owners to ask them to demonstrate why their plants should not be shut down until the problem can be fixed. Hemyc, which is produced in blanket form, is often wrapped around cable trays or junction boxes and stitched together. Commission rules require that cables that power or control crucial equipment, usually pumps or valves, be protected with a fire barrier that would last an hour if the area has fire-detection equipment and sprinklers or other suppression systems. In other areas, the fire protection material is supposed to last three hours. According to tests commissioned by the agency, Hemyc shrinks by about 8 percent if exposed to temperatures of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and could then expose the cables. It is not clear whether a fire could reach that temperature, but the material does not meet the agency's standard. Mr. Sheron said that Hemyc was available in a form that was already shrunk and thus would not shrink further when heated, but that a different form was found in the reactors. In New York, Hemyc is used at Indian Point 2 and 3, in Buchanan, and the James A. FitzPatrick reactor, near upstate Oswego. All three of those plants are operated by Entergy, and a spokesman for the company, James Steets, said Entergy had established fire patrols in the area where Hemyc was used until it can determine the extent of the hazard and decide whether replacement is warranted. The Robert E. Ginna plant near Rochester also uses the material. Fires are believed to be one of the most important threats to nuclear reactors. In March 1975, a fire in a cable room under the control rooms for two of the Tennessee Valley Authority's reactors at Browns Ferry in Alabama burned for more than six hours and destroyed cables that controlled the operation of crucial pumps and valves, or supplied them with electric power. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that is often critical of nuclear safety, said it was not clear why the commission was still discovering inadequate materials 30 years after the Browns Ferry fire. "It would sure be nice someday to get a one-hour fire wrap that works," he said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/opinion/nyregionopinions/WE_Nuclear.html?ref=entergycorporation">The Nuclear Option<date>Published: April 3, 2005</date><text>ime will tell, to use an old editorial dodge, whether Josh Rattner is a prophet or just a noodge. Mr. Rattner pulled a driver from a burning gasoline truck last year, risking his life and earning an invitation to a "Heroes Breakfast" at the Hilton Rye Town last week. But when it came time to smile and accept his plaque, he pulled a Marlon Brando and refused it, saying he could not allow himself to be a public relations tool of one of the day's corporate sponsors, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the Indian Point power plant. Mr. Rattner says Indian Point is a menace that should be shut down. Mr. Rattner, an electrical contractor from Irvington, thus fired an early shot in what promises to be a long and ferocious struggle over the relicensing of Indian Point, the Hudson Valley's vital energy resource or nuclear nightmare - take your pick - in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Times Square. Already the environmentalists are out in force, firing away with news conferences and op-eds and calling in reinforcements from the hundreds of politicians and dozens of town and village boards that have called for the plant to be decommissioned. Besides traditional anxieties about meltdown, radioactive waste and the nuclear industry's wobbly economics, the enemies of Indian Point have a new trump card to play - the fear of terrorism - now that 9/11 has jolted people into taking long-shot possibilities seriously. Supporters of nuclear power have a trump card of their own: global warming, which looms as the environmental crisis of our age. This has prompted more than a few people in the green camp to argue that fossil fuel, not radiation, is the clear and present danger, and to embrace nuclear plants as a proven, readily available way to reduce carbon emissions and save the planet. This page has been largely agnostic about nuclear power in general and Indian Point in particular, though it has expressed serious reservations about security at the plant, which is badly placed in a densely populated region, where a mass evacuation in an emergency would be extremely difficult. We have called for greater fortifications and a competent security force at Indian Point, but have seen no immediate reason to shut it down. We hope the coming clashes will clarify what the region's residents think about whether to embrace or reject nuclear power along the Hudson. We hope further that this grappling will lay the groundwork for a much broader debate - the kind of national discussion the Bush administration should be leading but is not, given that its energy policies amount to little more than an unwavering fixation on the maximal extraction and consumption of fossil fuels from anywhere and everywhere. It may seem early in Westchester -Indian Point's reactor licenses are not up for renewal until 2013. But Indian Point is one of the biggest nuclear controversies around, aside from the long struggle over burying waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, and thus is a prime opportunity to sort out our energy priorities, reassess our seemingly boundless appetite for cheap power and weigh our tolerance for risk - not just in the region, but across the nation.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/nyregion/30hero.html?ref=entergycorporation">With a Few Words, a Hero Becomes a Gadfly<date>Published: March 30, 2005</date><text>he local Red Cross chapter's fourth annual Heroes Breakfast was going according to script yesterday, recognizing the bravery and good deeds of police officers, firefighters and good Samaritans from across Westchester. Then Josh Rattner was called to accept his award. In November, Mr. Rattner, an electrical contractor from the Village of Irvington, pulled the driver of a burning gasoline tanker away from the truck, doused the flames engulfing the man's body and saved his life. The American Red Cross of Westchester and the Westchester County government wanted to thank him. But Mr. Rattner had other thoughts. In front of nearly 300 well-wishers in Rye Brook - the friends, families and co-workers of the dozen or so honorees - Mr. Rattner, 28, said he could not in good conscience accept an award that was sponsored, in part, by Entergy Nuclear Northeast, the company that owns the Indian Point power plants. Advertisement "I'm not interested in being a public relations puppet so Entergy can mask their disregard for public safety," Mr. Rattner said later, recounting the event. "Heroism today would be permanently decommissioning Indian Point." In the silence that followed, the would-have-been hero and his family got up and left the celebration. Mr. Rattner insists that the doors were quickly and pointedly shut behind them, though others in the room disagree with that detail of the account. Laurence Gottlieb, director of communications for Entergy Northeast and co-chairman of the breakfast, called the statement a selfish act. "Obviously, Entergy is not afraid of controversy," Mr. Gottlieb said. "But I do think there is a time and a place. It was not right to take a political stance there and embarrass all the other honorees." Indeed, Mr. Rattner was not alone on the stage at the Rye Town Hilton when he spoke. Yanni Papanicolaou, a florist from Pleasantville, who saved the driver of the burning car that the gasoline tanker had collided with, was standing right behind him. "I was waiting to say thank you for the award," Mr. Papanicolaou, 29, recalled in a telephone conversation. "He started out nice, and suddenly it was just like, 'Whoa, where is he going with this?' I didn't know what to say. I was just kind of stuck on stupid, and then I went back to my seat." It was not just Entergy Mr. Rattner had harsh words for. "When I got the literature on this event, I was extremely surprised to see that the county was participating in it, even though Entergy was sponsoring it," Mr. Rattner said, referring to a letter in the program in which County Executive Andrew J. Spano thanked Entergy for sponsoring a community partnership with the Red Cross. Mr. Spano has repeatedly called for Indian Point to be closed and refused to endorse an emergency evacuation plan he called unworkable. "We agree with the statements made by Mr. Rattner," Susan Tolchin, Mr. Spano's chief adviser, said in a telephone interview. "We think Indian Point should be closed. We are a supporter of the American Red Cross, and Entergy is a supporter of the American Red Cross. We are not a supporter of Entergy." It was the chaos of the roads after the tanker explosion that started Mr. Rattner thinking about a nuclear disaster, he said, noting that he is not a political activist and has never taken part in a demonstration against Indian Point. "At the tanker explosion, the roads were clogged and you couldn't move," Mr. Rattner. "No one could get anywhere. I thought, 'Could you imagine if there was a nuclear accident?' I could have said thank you today and took the plaque that was partially paid for by Entergy. But if anything happened at Indian Point, I could never live with myself." Entergy supports many Red Cross programs, said Robert Sanders, a spokesman for the Westchester chapter of the American Red Cross. "It's not about Indian Point," Mr. Sanders said. "It's about being a good corporate citizen." Mr. Sanders said he did not believe that the Red Cross would lose donations because of Mr. Rattner's actions, but he said he was embarrassed for the other heroes, particularly Mr. Papanicolaou, whom he invited to a Red Cross event held to thank volunteers in June. That event is sponsored by MasterCard.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/11/national/11fire.html?ref=entergycorporation">11 Family Members Die in a House Fire Caused by Candles<date>Published: March 11, 2005</date><text>leven family members, including children as young as 6 months, were killed yesterday morning in a townhouse fire in the New Orleans suburb of Marrero after candles ignited bedding, the authorities said. The family had moved in Wednesday night and had no electricity. "From what we understand, one of the candles fell on top of one of the victims and the blanket caught fire," quickly spreading to the mattress, said Chief Rickie Eslick of the Marrero-Ragusa Volunteer Fire Company. As some ran to hide in the bathroom and others went to the windows, one of the survivors moved the mattress downstairs, but it burned his hands and he dropped it at the front door, Chief Eslick said. The man and his 17-year-old niece ran out the back door to kick in the front door. When they did, "she said the pressure was like to knock her across the street," Chief Eslick said. The flames and smoke made re-entry impossible. Another adult jumped from a window with a baby. The others perished inside. The coroner's office was still matching names to the bodies, said Mark Goldman, a forensic investigator with the Jefferson Parish Regional Forensic Center. Preliminary results indicated the victims died from smoke inhalation and heat and were aged 42, 34, 32, 16, 14, 12, 10, 9, 3, 2 and 6 months, Mr. Goldman said. Many were named Wilson, and they were all part of the extended family of Sabrina Wilson, who was killed. The building's owner, Sgt. Ernest Pierre of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's office, rented the three-bedroom townhouse to a woman who said five people would be living there, said Col. Robert Garner of the sheriff's office. The Entergy Corporation, the townhome's power company, released a statement, saying, "Apparently the customer chose to move into the premises before completing the application process for electric service." A neighbor who lives in the townhouse next door said he was waiting outside to take his wife to dialysis about 5 a.m. when he saw flames and smoke in the windows and heard a child screaming. "A little girl was hollering for help, saying, 'Call 911!' " said the neighbor, David Jarriet, 57. Mr. Jarriet made the call, got his wife outside and banged on his neighbors' doors. He could not help the victims, though; "you couldn't get in there," he said. Mr. Jarriet's townhouse was still standing and had a working telephone, but was soaked with water and covered with soot. On the second floor where the bedrooms were next door, "there ain't nothing left," he said. "My head's pounding right now," he said. "I just hate to see all them people get killed."</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E1DE173AF930A25751C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=entergycorporation">UTILITIES; Indian Point Readies Plans For Spent Fuel<date>Published: February 13, 2005</date><text>THE man who is in charge of the biggest project in years at the Indian Point nuclear power plant is wiry and serious and a self-described exercise addict. He works out twice a day, measures his food intake to the calorie and, though 53 years old, says he is careful to maintain his body fat at around 5 percent. Geoffrey E. Schwartz's personal punctiliousness extends to his work, his colleagues say, and that's a good thing. ''You know nothing's going to go wrong with a guy who knows his body fat,'' said Jim Steets, the spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which operates Indian Point's two functioning reactors. Mr. Schwartz, a nuclear engineer, is coordinating the preparation of a new storage system for the plant's spent fuel rods of used uranium, which, after six years in the reactor, must be removed. The plant now deposits spent fuel in 35-foot-deep storage pools that block radiation. But the pools are close to full. For years, like many other nuclear plants around the country, Indian Point planned to move used fuel to an underground federal storage facility at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. The government was supposed to begin accepting the waste in January 1998, but the project was delayed. The federal Energy Department is promising to begin accepting waste in 2010, but on Jan. 14, Spencer Abraham, the outgoing secretary of energy, acknowledged that this date was unlikely. In the face of prolonged doubts about the future of Yucca Mountain, Indian Point has resorted to a system called dry cask storage, in use at numerous nuclear plants across the country, to warehouse the fuel rods. They remain dangerously radioactive for tens of thousands of years. At Indian Point, the dry cask storage will involve locking the spent fuel rods in 19-foot-high concrete and steel silos. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Entergy say pool storage and dry casks are equally safe methods, but some critics of nuclear plants regard dry casks as the safer option because casks have no mechanical systems that could go awry and no cooling water that could leak out and contaminate the ecosystem. Entergy had hoped to begin the transfer of spent fuel rods in late spring or early summer. But the company has had to delay the transfer until at least late fall, in part because of unforeseen difficulties in excavating particularly hard bedrock to build a new floor for the loading bay inside the Indian Point 2 fuel storage building to support equipment used in the process. The company is planning to begin the pool-to-cask transfer at the still-active Indian Point 2 in late fall or early winter, officials said in mid-January. Fuel transfer from Indian Point 1, which is now defunct, is scheduled for 2007 and from the active Indian Point 3 in the fall of 2008. The plant has until 2010 -- a very comfortable cushion -- before the storage pools fill completely, but Mr. Schwartz said he expected to have the first six casks packed by the middle of next year. Entergy declined to say what the project would cost, except that it would be in the tens of millions of dollars and that it would seek to recover some of the costs from the Energy Department. Entergy and nuclear regulatory officials say the dry storage process is safe and simple and has been used for years around the country. ''It's so well thought out, so methodical, that's it's almost like a nonissue,'' Mr. Steets said. ''It'll be the first time we've done it here, but it'll be just another day.'' Some critics say that Indian Point's new storage plan is not necessarily hazardproof and that the calculations of Mr. Schwartz and others need to be updated. A lobby led by the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition, a group of civic organizations that wants to shut down the plant and its two reactors, has faulted Entergy for its choice of dry casks, saying the current model has design faults. But Entergy says the casks comply with federal regulations and are secure enough to prevent radiation leaks and survive terrorist attacks, even the impact of a commercial jet.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/national/27nuke.html?ref=entergycorporation">Mississippi Extends Hospitality to Nuclear Power<date>Published: January 27, 2005</date><text>ORT GIBSON, Miss., Jan. 20 - Facing the possibility that a utility company would try to build a new nuclear reactor here, the City of Port Gibson and surrounding Claiborne County moved swiftly last month to protect the interests of their residents. "We're willing to do whatever it takes to do to make this happen," said Amelda J. Arnold, the city's mayor. Last month, city aldermen voted unanimously to urge the Entergy Corporation, which already operates one reactor here, to build a second. The County Board of Supervisors did the same. The posture here is starkly different from that in New York, where town and county governments are trying to close two Entergy reactors at Indian Point in Westchester County. Around the country, supporters and opponents of nuclear power are newly energized because the economics for new reactors is no longer so unfavorable. With the nation's 103 power reactors turning into antiques - the newest design in service was ordered in 1973 - some utilities want to replace theirs. In three places, nuclear plant operators have applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for "early site approval," which would give them permission to build on particular sites anytime in the next 20 years. The furthest along in that process is Dominion Power, at North Anna, Va., about 40 miles northwest of Richmond, where it already operates two reactors. But Exelon, the nation's largest nuclear operator, is not far behind with an application to build an additional reactor at its site in Clinton, Ill. Entergy has mapped out a spot here, 25 miles south of Vicksburg, adjacent to the company's 20-year-old Grand Gulf reactor, near the banks of the Mississippi. Exelon and Entergy are part of a multicompany consortium, called NuStart Energy, that is seeking to prepare a license application for a plant, and Dominion Resources has established a partnership with General Electric for the same purpose, although no company has committed itself so far to ordering a reactor. Entergy's proposed site is in a region acutely sensitive to the price of natural gas, which has tripled in price in the last few years. Now it also has public support from local governments looking to create new jobs and more tax revenue. Local support is not enough to induce a company to take the billion-dollar plunge, but it helps. "You can get a federal license, but ultimately we work and live in these communities," Gary J. Taylor, president and chief executive of Entergy Nuclear, said in an interview at the company headquarters in Jackson. Mr. Taylor's company expects to spend about $10 million to get early site approval and an additional $7 million on the consortium seeking to develop an application, two steps that he hopes will cut at least three years off the plant-building timetable. At Exelon, John Rowe, the chief executive, said the company might order a new reactor as early as 2010. Older plants face retirement, natural gas is expensive, and at some point, concern over climate change will give nuclear power an edge, he said; one way would be for the government to give tax credits to reactor operators as it does to windmill operators. "My company, as long as I run it, will never make a decision except on the hard-boiled economics," Mr. Rowe said in a telephone interview. "But we believe, and, praise the Lord, the president of the United States believes, if we want to have a lower carbon future, a new generation of nuclear plants will be an essential part of that." In Port Gibson, people cite many advantages and many disadvantages to nuclear power, but they do not mention global warming. James E. Miller, the county administrator, said the county taxes on a $150,000 house here were $50 a year, compared with $500 to $800 in surrounding counties, because of tax revenues from Entergy. But the unemployment rate is still in the double digits, Mr. Miller said, and a new plant would bring jobs to the county.

It would be the second pipeline purchase for Loews, which bought Texas Gas Transmission, which operates a 5,800-mile pipeline system, from the Williams Companies in 2003.

In this case it was whether closing Indian Point would really make Westchester safer. These were not members of the League of Women Voters or a municipal planning board. They were a half-dozen high school students, from Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Edgemont, Hastings-on-Hudson, Sleepy Hollow and Woodlands. To set up the event, they considered position papers from both Entergy, which owns the Buchanan plant, and the environmental group Riverkeeper, which opposes it. And they questioned the assumptions behind each organization's conclusions. The planning bore fruit a week later, when 100 or so students and a few other area residents came together for the forum itself. In the words of Jon Weinstein, an Ardsley High School senior who took part, ''Both sides truly made valid arguments.'' But his next comment made it clear which argument had proved the more persuasive to him. ''It is truly scary knowing that Indian Point was originally a terrorist target,'' he said. ''I can't even begin to think of all the fatalities resulting from the meltdown of Indian Point.'' Jon's concerns were strongly echoed by the group, said Zachary Baum, the Edgemont High School junior who was the driving force behind the event. Surveys of those taking part reflect that their opinions were strongly affected. ''Before the event,'' Zachary said, ''54 percent thought that Indian Point should be kept open. After, 35 percent thought it should be kept open. ''Another question asked if Indian Point was adequately protected,'' he added. ''Before, 48 percent said yes. After the forum, 23 percent said yes.'' Zachary took his initial inspiration from research he had pursued on ocean policy as a member of his debate team. ''Originally,'' he said, ''I thought the event would be on the environment. Then I thought it would be more interesting to look at the safety and security of Indian Point, which has more of an impact on us.'' Some social studies teachers gave students extra credit for attending the nighttime forum, which as Zachary described it was more a means to raise awareness than an effort to advocate for one position or the other. ''The purpose was to inform about Indian Point. It matters to everyone.'' It has mattered ever since Sept. 11, 2001, when it dawned on many Westchester residents just how tempting the plant was as a target. But these students, perhaps befitting their status as members of the Gen Net Generation, preferred gathering information to storming the barricades or any other protest. The audience listened attentively as Kyle Rabin, a former senior policy analyst for the Riverkeeper, and Beverly Good, a health physicist for Entergy, answered questions from the high school panelists. ''It was a great way for students to look at this issue,'' Zack said, ''and it was great for Entergy and the Riverkeeper to be in the same room.'' Samantha Sugrue, a Woodlands senior and reporter for her school newspaper, said she had taken part because Indian Point is ''so close to us, and Woodlands is an evacuation site.'' She said those facts ''made me want to learn more about it.'' Josh Hammer, a Sleepy Hollow sophomore who is editor of his school paper, echoed Samantha, saying: ''I've always been interested in Indian Point. It's literally 10 to 15 miles from here. That proximity makes it more vital to our lives.'' And Maya Shulman-Ment, a Hastings High School senior who is president of the environmental club, summed up her experience this way: ''I know a lot about Indian Point, but I felt I hadn't explored the issue fully enough. I wanted to be able to take a side. It was a great experience. I learned so much more about the plant from doing the research. It was good to see people were interested and came to watch it. Now I feel more like shutting it down.'' Photo: Zachary Baum, whose idea led to the forum, leads a planning session.

The agency, which approved the increase in capacity, or "uprate," on Thursday, based its decision on a determination that the plant could safely increase output primarily by upgrading minor components, a commission spokesman said on Friday. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com The agency had published a notice about the uprate application in the Federal Register, inviting opponents of the plant to request a hearing or file a comment challenging an increase, but no one intervened, said the spokesman, Neil Sheehan. Alex Matthiessen, the executive director of Riverkeeper, an environmental group that has sought to shut down Indian Point's two operational reactors, said he chose not to protest the application. "We didn't have the staff time to devote to it," he said Friday. "You have to pick your battles." Safety experts have questioned the nuclear industry's use of uprates to increase capacity at existing plants. In the past two decades, total output nationally has been increased by the equivalent of three large reactors without building any new plants. Mr. Sheehan said that since 1977, the commission had approved 101 power upgrades of between 1 and 20 percent at nuclear power plants in the United States. They have been granted with almost no opposition, though critics contend that the uprates, on top of extensions of operating licenses, could imperil safety. The Indian Point 2 reactor, the one that received uprate approval last week, had three unplanned shutdowns in September because of equipment malfunctions, said a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, the plant's owner. "When you increase capacity to these plants, you are no doubt adding pressure on the existing facility," Mr. Matthiessen said. But plant owners and regulators contend that they are modernizing in a way that improves safety. Entergy plans to put the increase into effect after the plant's fall refueling operation, which is currently under way, Mr. Sheehan said. The last uprate at Indian Point 2, of 1.4 percent, was in 2003; its sister reactor, Indian Point 3, received an uprate of 1.4 percent in 2002. An application to increase the capacity of Indian Point 3 by 4.85 percent is being reviewed. Indian Point 1 closed in the 1970's.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E6DC1338F932A35753C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=entergycorporation">Metro Briefing | New York: Buchanan: Strike Averted At Indian Point<date>Published: October 1, 2004</date><text>Security workers at the Indian Point nuclear power plant ratified a new five-year contract with Entergy Nuclear Northeast yesterday, a company spokesman said.

First it was the announcement that West Lake Drive, above Kensico Dam in Valhalla, would be closed to vehicles for good. Andrew Spano, the county executive, had to decide between traffic headaches from the closed road or the possibility of a 60-foot wall of water washing away White Plains and leaving New York City without drinking water. He chose the headaches, but only after demanding, and getting, a federal study showing that the risk from a terrorist truck bomb at the dam was too great to ignore. Advertisement Then came a report from the group Riverkeeper, detailing what could happen if terrorists attacked the Indian Point nuclear plant: tens of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands fatally sickened and economic consequences in trillions of dollars. The arguments in the report, "Chernobyl on the Hudson?," are echoed in a new documentary film on HBO, "Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable," by the filmmaker Rory Kennedy, whose brother Robert Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer for Riverkeeper. The word "imagining" was well chosen, for the potential dangers the film describes exist in remote realms - a hijacked jetliner damaging the containment dome or terrorists sabotaging the plant. Such events may seem too farfetched to worry about, but - so did 9/11. Riverkeeper and Ms. Kennedy freely admit to using scare tactics to further their impassioned advocacy, and we have no major quarrel with that, particularly if their strategy increases the pressure on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Entergy Nuclear Northeast to keep security at the plant tight. Our impulse, though, is to be wary of arguments for rash action based on worst-case assumptions. Scary scenarios tend to remind us of President Bush's defense of the Iraq invasion - that he had to protect us from the Armageddon that Saddam Hussein was planning in his dreams. If Indian Point can be shuttered without disrupting the region's heavily strained power supply or increasing our dependence on dirty fuels like coal, fine. Mr. Spano, who has long wanted to close Indian Point, has commissioned a study by Levitan &amp; Associates to explore ways to do that. Next month, the firm will seek public input on ways to do without Indian Point. The discussion, county officials say, will focus on whether the plant's energy is needed, how it could be replaced and how a shutdown or county takeover might affect energy costs and taxes. This discussion may not be all that dramatic, but it promises to be particularly useful in the real world, where most of us want to keep on living.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/18/nyregion/18nuclear.html?ref=entergycorporation">Operator of Nuclear Plant Readying Strike Substitutes<date>Published: September 18, 2004</date><text>HITE PLAINS, Sept. 17 - The operator of the Indian Point nuclear power plant is training a replacement force to take over security should the regular guards go on strike when their contract expires on Oct. 2, officials said this week. Critics of the plant, however, said they doubted that a team of recruits could be prepared in time to protect the plant against attacks or intrusions. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com "When you're talking about nuclear security going to a scab force, it's simply unacceptable," said Alex Matthiessen, the executive director of Riverkeeper, an environmental group that has sought to shut down Indian Point's two reactors. "You're not talking about a bunch of Wal-Marts. You can't be fooling around with the quality of the guards." Spokesmen for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the plant's operator, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which began training the replacement guards in August, said that the replacement force would be prepared to operate at federally mandated levels of proficiency on a par with the regular force. "They will be required to carry out the security programs to the same degree as the current security force and will be required to execute to the ability of the current security force," said Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the commission, which oversees the nuclear industry. He said he was unable to find any record of a strike of security guards at a nuclear power plant in the United States. An official of Teamsters Local 456, which represents the plant's security workers, said the regular force numbered about 150. Officials from Entergy and the commission declined to reveal the size of the replacement force. Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said, "It wouldn't be a one-to-one replacement, but it would clearly be a replacement that would meet our security obligations and our expectations and the regulatory requirements." He said the substitutes were being provided by SOS Security Inc. of Parsippany, N.J. The commission has been reviewing Indian Point's strike contingency plan, and four permanent on-site inspectors and the commission's security experts will continue to assess Entergy's strike preparations, Mr. Sheehan said. "The expectations are that they will conform with all our requirements," he said. In the event of a walkout, he said, plant managers would remain in their jobs and National Guard troops and state police officers stationed there would also remain on duty. The commission, he added, would continue to monitor security operations around the clock for several days after the strike begins and would thereafter conduct what he called "periodic checks" with an expanded crew of inspectors. Critics of Indian Point questioned the ability of Entergy to assemble and prepare a sufficiently experienced replacement force by Oct. 2. "Not to state the obvious here, but if you're a terrorist group interested in attacking a nuclear power plant, and they have the bench warmers - or worse - in there, that makes the plant a more vulnerable target," Mr. Matthiessen said. Julie Edwards, a spokeswoman for Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester Democrat whose district includes parts of the plant's evacuation zone, an area within a 10-mile radius of the plant, said the congresswoman "has long had concerns with the ongoing inability to maintain a work force and to operate the plant at the security level required at the facility.'' Ms. Edwards added that the information "only adds to her belief that this facility should be decommissioned." Mr. Steets, however, said that a replacement force would be adequately prepared to guard the plant. "We would only have been concerned if we didn't have enough time to train them," he said. "There's enough time, and we've been doing it." The contract of the plant's regular security force expires at midnight on Oct. 2. The union's membership overwhelmingly voted down a contract proposal earlier this month that would have extended the current contract by two years. John Cuite, the assistant trustee of Local 456 and a union negotiator, said negotiations were expected to resume next week. Officials from the union and Entergy declined to discuss specifics of the latest contract offer, but Mr. Steets said that the union membership had blocked the proposal mainly because it was concerned about vesting and wanted a longer deal.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/nyregion/15profile.html?ref=entergycorporation">The Public, and Cheerful, Face of Nuclear Power<date>Published: September 15, 2004</date><text>HITE PLAINS ONE day it's a faulty steam valve causing a temporary shutdown; the next it's an environmental group clamoring for a permanent shutdown. No matter what the news swirling around the Indian Point nuclear power plant - and given the vehement opposition to it, the news is not always favorable - out trots Jim Steets, the plant's most visible spokesman, with an easy smile and an eagerness to field any question. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com He comes from his tan, 12th-floor office here in White Plains to step in front of the tape recorders and cameras and accuse the plant's critics of herd thinking, uninformed biases and worse. He then waxes close to rhapsodic about the benefits and proficiencies of Indian Point, located in Buchanan, in northern Westchester County. Though he occasionally gets tough, framing his argument with the subtlety of a medicine ball, Mr. Steets has such a friendly bearing that even those who complain that he argues in blind or bad faith concede that he is, well, a nice guy. Mr. Steets, boyish-looking at 51 despite a wintry thatch of hair, says the plant's detractors are simplistic and overly suspicious, but he sees some similarities in himself. "I am idealistic, just like they are," he said. "We're just on the opposite ends of what we believe in." Not that he isn't surprised sometimes to find himself cast as the public face of one of the nation's most criticized nuclear plants. "If you had asked me 20 years ago, I'd say, 'Nah, I'll never be a shill for nuclear power.' My image of it at that point was of the nuclear industry criticizing how it was portrayed on 'The Simpsons.' Give me a break." But in the three years since the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Steets's job as a spokesman for Entergy, which owns the plant, has not been an easy lift. The latest piece of bad news is "Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable," a documentary by Rory Kennedy that had its premiere on HBO last week. It contends that a terrorist attack on Indian Point could be easy and apocalyptic, calling the security inadequate and citing the plant's location 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, in one of the most densely populated spots in the country. Ms. Kennedy is the sister of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer for Riverkeeper, the environmental group that probably ranks as Indian Point's most vocal opponent. At one point in the movie, the two Kennedys hover unimpeded in a helicopter over Indian Point - proof, they say, of the plant's vulnerability. Mr. Steets scoffs, calling that action typical of the opposition's tendency toward stunts and polemics. "We knew it was R.F.K. up in that helicopter and were confident that he did not intend to fly it into a containment dome," he said. "Do we have to shoot him down to prove a point to him? If we play the game to their ridiculous level, someone would get hurt." Before Sept. 11, opposition to Indian Point, which supplies 20 to 40 percent of the electricity to New York City and Westchester County, came from a small assortment of groups concerned about its poor safety record, but the wider community seemed only vaguely aware of the plant's presence. After one of the hijacked planes flew by the plant on its way to the World Trade Center, public fear put Indian Point into a defensive crouch. Even Mr. Steets said he had worried briefly that the plant could be vulnerable. "I wasn't sure about the capabilities of the structures to withstand an assault from the air," he said. "We are all smart people," he added, referring to his colleagues in public relations, "but not that sophisticated." All it took to reassure him was visits from structural engineers who explained the "physics of force" and the soundness of the plant's containment domes. But Alex Matthiessen, executive director of Riverkeeper, is not reassured. "Jim is a nice, amiable guy," he said. "But he's regrettably guilty of using the same deceitful public relations tactics that his and other polluting industries are famous for.'' MR. STEETS'S interest in public relations was piqued early, when he was a communications student at Fordham University. He may be one of the few undergraduates to have sat in a dorm room lost in fascination at the concise, well-structured explanations coming from spokesmen interviewed on the television news. A few years later, Mr. Steets, who grew up a block from the beach in Spring Lake, N.J., was hired to handle publicity for power lines being installed by the New York Power Authority. He arrived at Indian Point a decade ago, working in the shadow of the domes until about 18 months ago, when he moved to his current office so he could be in the loop with the Entergy executives who work here. (He keeps the radio near his desk tuned to an album-rock station in the hope of hearing his favorite, Led Zeppelin.) He commutes from Middletown, N.Y., where he lives with his wife and three children; he plays basketball to stay trim and release the tension from his job. His office conveniently overlooks the county office building. That way, Mr. Steets jokes, he can stand up from his desk and "shake a fist at Andy Spano," the county executive, who began calling for the plant's closing after Sept. 11. Lately those calls have been muted. Indian Point's safety record has improved, electricity demand keeps increasing, and since the blackout last summer, the idea of importing power from afar is less attractive. Two years ago, Westchester residents were talking worriedly about matters like spent-fuel pools, but there is less of that today. "The middle-grounders have just gone back to the middle ground," Mr. Steets said, declaring victory. "People want to know the plant is safe. Then they want to turn on 'The Apprentice.'
