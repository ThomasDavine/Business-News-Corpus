Not being compared to the Mafia boss of a criminal enterprise run on fear and omertà. Not being accused of being willfully blind, shockingly incurious or curiously casual about his corporation’s money.During two and a half hours of forensic, skeptical and even rude questioning from a parliamentary panel on Thursday, Mr. Murdoch, the 38-year-old deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, never wavered from his original account: that he had learned only recently that phone hacking had been widespread at the company’s tabloid News of the World, now defunct. He said he had never misled the committee in earlier testimony in July. And he all but accused two former underlings, whose accounts directly contradicted his, of lying about it. Much was riding on how Mr. Murdoch handled the lawmakers’ questioning, including his personal credibility and the health of the News Corporation media empire. The hacking scandal has tarnished the company, forced it to summarily shut down a newspaper, scuttled its $12 billion bid to acquire the satellite giant British Sky Broadcasting, destroyed its symbiotic relationship with Britain’s political establishment, and added to the strains between Mr. Murdoch and his father, Rupert, the company’s chairman. At least 16 former employees have been arrested, including two former editors of The News of the World. (None has yet been charged.) A number of executives, including Les Hinton, publisher of The Wall Street Journal and chief executive of Dow Jones, have resigned. Throughout his appearance before the panel, the House of Commons’ committee on culture, media and sport, a calm and confident Mr. Murdoch sought to portray hacking as a problem of the past and something that had forced the company to re-evaluate its practices. “It is a matter of great regret that things went wrong,” he said. Mr. Murdoch said he had first been made aware of an unresolved hacking problem in the spring of 2008, when he was briefly executive chairman of News International, News Corporation’s British newspaper arm. That was when company executives asked for his approval to settle a case with Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, who had accused The News of the World of hacking his phone. The executives had in their possession several pieces of internal evidence showing that Mr. Taylor was right, and that phone hacking at The News of the World was not limited to one reporter or one incident, as the company would later publicly and repeatedly assert. But Mr. Murdoch said that no one showed any evidence to him, even as he was urged to approve a large payment to Mr. Taylor. “None of these things were made available to me or discussed with me,” he said. “I was given sufficient information to authorize an increase in the settlement offer. But I was given no more than that.” His assertion directly contradicted the testimony of two former executives — Colin Myler, then the editor of The News of the World, and Tom Crone, then News International’s chief legal officer. The pair contacted the committee in July, after Mr. Murdoch’s initial testimony, to say that he had not told the truth. They had indeed, they asserted, told him about an incendiary piece of evidence, the “for Neville” e-mail (a reference to Neville Thurlbeck, the chief reporter for The News of the World) that contained transcripts of hacked conversations and proved that hacking had gone beyond a single journalist. Mr. Murdoch said that although he was told the e-mail existed — a shift from his previous testimony, when he claimed never to have heard of it — no one had shown it to him or explained its significance. “I believe their testimony was misleading, and I dispute it,” he said of Mr. Myler’s and Mr. Crone’s statements. Later Thursday, Mr. Crone released a statement saying that Mr. Murdoch was being “disingenuous” at best. “The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning e-mail and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement,” he said. In his testimony, Mr. Murdoch went out of his way to criticize Mr. Myler, who became editor of The News of the World after the original phone hacking case, in which the newspaper’s royal reporter, Clive Goodman, was jailed in 2007. Mr. Myler should have told him what was going on and fixed it, he said. “This was the job of the new editor who had come in, for lack of a better word, to clean this up — to make me aware of these things,” he said. He said that in a company of 50,000 employees around the world, “We rely on executives at various levels of the business to behave in a certain way.” 1 2 Next Page » Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/world/europe/james-murdoch-faces-skeptical-british-lawmakers.html?ref=newscorporation">James Murdoch Denies Wider Knowledge of Phone Hacking<date>Published: November 10, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Nothing rattled James Murdoch.

Documents released since his first round of testimony in July have cast doubt on his version of events, while fresh revelations have spilled out about his company’s questionable practices.Mr. Murdoch, the company’s deputy chief operating officer and the younger son of its chairman, Rupert Murdoch, was a deft and deflecting witness in July, nimbly parrying lawmakers’ questions while maintaining essentially that he had learned only recently how widespread the hacking problem really was. Now, he will be faced with defending himself against mounting evidence that top executives at News International, the company’s British newspaper arm, knew a full three years ago that hacking was pervasive at The News of the World, the tabloid newspaper that the company shut down in July, and that the executives discussed it with Mr. Murdoch at the time. “Obviously, there are things which the committee wishes to raise with him, particularly in relation to some of the evidence we have received since he testified,” said John Whittingdale, a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the committee holding the hearings, the select committee on culture, media and sport. Mr. Murdoch will also be asked about News International’s behavior after the investigation into its hacking operation intensified. The company acknowledged this week that over the past year and a half, The News of the World had hired a private investigator to conduct covert surveillance of two lawyers representing victims of phone hacking. The admission was prompted by a report in The Guardian that the investigator, Derek Webb, followed and photographed the lawyers and their families, presumably in the hope of unearthing unsavory information about them and using it to discourage them from pursuing their cases. “While surveillance is not illegal, it was clearly deeply inappropriate in these circumstances,” the company said in a statement. “This action was not condoned by any current executive at the company.” Mr. Webb told the BBC that he had done such work for The News of the World routinely for eight years, spying on dozens of people, including Prince William; the sports broadcaster Gary Lineker; Lord Goldsmith, the former attorney general; Chelsy Davy, Prince Harry’s former girlfriend; José Morinho, the former manager of the Chelsea soccer team; and the parents of the actor Daniel Radcliffe. “I was working for them extensively on many jobs throughout that time,” Mr. Webb told the network. “They phoned me up by the day or by the night.” Recently released News of the World documents, some of them obtained by the parliamentary committee from News International’s former lawyers, Farrer &amp; Company, show that on June 3, 2008, a lawyer warned company executives in a memo that there was “a powerful case that there is (or was) a culture of illegal information access” at the paper. The lawyer, Michael Silverleaf, also said there was “overwhelming evidence of the involvement of a number of senior journalists” in the paper’s attempts to illegally obtain information about Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association. Mr. Silverleaf’s memo was written at a time when top News International executives, including James Murdoch, were mulling over how to respond to Mr. Taylor’s claim that his voice mail messages had been repeatedly hacked by the News of the World. Mr. Silverleaf counseled them to handle the case privately. “To have this paraded at a public trial would, I imagine, be extremely damaging” to the company, he said. Even more potentially worrying for Mr. Murdoch is the growing body of evidence that other executives discussed newly discovered details of phone hacking at the paper with him around the same time. For example, a May 27 note by Julian Pike, a Farrer &amp; Company lawyer, says that Colin Myler, the editor of The News of the World, spoke to Mr. Murdoch about Mr. Taylor’s claims and that the two men decided to refer it to outside counsel. Another note two weeks later — after Mr. Silverleaf wrote his damning conclusions — says that after meeting Tom Crone, who was the legal manager of News International at the time, Mr. Murdoch “said he wanted to think through options” about how to proceed in the case. Several days later, Mr. Murdoch authorized News International to pay Mr. Taylor more than £450,000 ($725,000) and legal fees exceeding $322,000. Mr. Pike has said that Mr. Murdoch personally authorized the amount, in exchange for a pledge of confidentiality, to keep the matter from being made public. Tom Watson, a Labour member of the parliamentary committee and a persistent critic of News International, said that the panel would question Mr. Murdoch further about the Taylor settlement. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/business/media/cable-tv-and-movies-buoy-news-corp-profits.html?ref=newscorporation">Cable TV and Movies Buoy News Corp. Profits<date>Published: November 2, 2011</date><text>News Corporation used its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday to highlight the success of its cable television and film units while trying to redirect investors’ attention from a phone hacking scandal at the company’s British newspaper unit.Buoyed by channels like Fox News and FX and the strong box-office performance of 20th Century Fox’s “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” News Corporation reported operating income of $1.39 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, up 21 percent from the same period last year. Cable television provided 56 percent of the company’s total operating income. News Corporation reported a slight drop in net income to $738 million, or 28 cents a share, from $775 million, or 30 cents a share, last year. The decrease in an otherwise strong quarter was partly the result of fees related to an abandoned bid for the British broadcaster BSkyB. The company dropped that bid in July amid the outrage that followed the phone hacking revelations. Also contributing to the decrease was a $90 million tax benefit that lifted net income for the same quarter last year, said Reed Nolte, the company’s senior vice president for investor relations. Chase Carey, News Corporation’s president and chief operating officer, said he did not have anything new to add about the hacking scandal, though he said the company had a “fully reserved” fund to pay legal fees related to it. Instead he chose to emphasize the company’s slate of diverse businesses. “An earnings call is a good time to shift gears to talk about our operations,” Mr. Carey said on a conference call with analysts and reporters. Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman and chief executive, did not participate in the call. This summer, News Corporation carried out a $5 billion stock repurchase plan, which helped deflect investors’ attention away from the company’s embattled British newspaper operation. The company’s earnings were reported after the markets closed on Wednesday, and in after-hours trading, News Corporation’s stock rose 1.18 percent, to $17.10. “The troubles raised by phone hacking have allowed shareholders to see some real positives,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities. The company’s push to get higher affiliate fees for cable networks paid off. Cable networks made $775 million in total operating income, an 18 percent increase from last year. Mr. Carey said shows like “Sons of Anarchy” helped ratings at FX climb 17 percent in the current season. He called Fox News a “juggernaut” and said the network’s affiliate fees should continue to grow. News Corporation’s film entertainment unit produced a 24 percent increase in operating income over last year, driven by $450 million in worldwide box office receipts for “Rise of the Planet of the Apes.” Higher retransmission fees and robust advertising spending on the Fox broadcast network helped offset expensive marketing campaigns to introduce fall shows. Operating income at the company’s publishing unit fell 38 percent, to $110 million, partly from the closing of its News of the World tabloid, which was shut down after an investigation into phone hacking. The company reported a $91 million pretax charge related to its British newspaper unit. The Wall Street Journal had an increase in advertising and subscription revenue. Mr. Carey said the company was on track to meet its financial goals for its fiscal year, which ends in June. Despite its efforts to deflect attention from the scandal, the problems in Britain are sure to draw new scrutiny. On Tuesday, Parliament released documents in which an outside lawyer hired by the British newspaper unit warned in 2008 of a “culture of illegal information access” at the tabloid. The documents do not say whether the lawyer directly alerted James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch’s son and News Corporation’s deputy chief operating officer. James Murdoch has said he did not know hacking extended beyond one rogue reporter. At a Parliamentary hearing in September, two former News Corporation executives contradicted earlier testimony from James. They said they had informed him that hacking at News of the World was more widespread. James will again testify before British lawmakers next week. Last month, 35 percent of votes cast by shareholders opposed the re-election of James Murdoch to the News Corporation board, raising questions about whether James would take over the company. His ascension once seemed inevitable. Similarly, 34 percent of shareholders opposed the re-election of Mr. Murdoch’s older son, Lachlan, to the board. Mr. Carey said the company took shareholder votes “seriously” but that it was “proud of the current board.” He defended James’s position in the company. “We have great confidence in James. James has done a good job and we are not contemplating any changes,” Mr. Carey said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/deadline-looms-for-directv-and-news-corp/?ref=newscorporation">DirecTV and News Corp. Avert Channel Blackout<date>October 31, 2011, 4:43 pm</date><text>6:30 p.m. | Updated | Representatives for DirecTV and News Corporation said Monday evening that they had averted a looming blackout of regional sports networks, FX and other Fox-owned cable channels. After warring in public for a week and a half, the two companies said they had come to a new contract agreement. “We both know the past ten days have been challenging, but we’re pleased that both sides could eventually come together to ensure our viewers continue to enjoy Fox programming,” the companies said in a joint statement. Both sides had been warning that many Fox-owned channels would be blacked out on DirecTV’s system beginning on Nov. 1 if a new contract agreement was not accepted. Such spats are usually resolved close to the self-imposed deadlines, but occasionally they do result in blackouts; Fox network programming was removed from Cablevision’s systems for two weeks last October. In this case, the companies resolved their differences about nine hours before the blackout would have taken effect. The fee fight would have affected far more people than past fights that pitted News Corporation against Cablevision and Time Warner Cable. DirecTV is the second-biggest pay television operator in the United States, behind Comcast, with more than 19 million subscribers. News Corporation had proposed higher rates for a bundle of channels that, in addition to FX and 19 regional sports networks, also included Speed, Fox Soccer, Fox Deportes, Fuel, Fox Movie Channel, and the National Geographic Channel. DirecTV customers were concerned about losing access to shows like “Sons of Anarchy” and “American Horror Story” that are broadcast on FX and the local pro and college football games that are televised by the regional sports networks. DirecTV publicly resisted the higher rates proposed by News Corporation. Privately, DirecTV also contested the very notion of bundling the channels together, a common practice in the industry. The companies did not comment Monday evening on the terms of the new deal. Notably, the deal includes DirecTV’s distribution for the Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and Fox-owned television stations. Those channels and stations were not immediately vulnerable to a blackout on Nov. 1, but Fox had warned that they could be affected by a feud in the near future.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/world/europe/les-hinton-ex-murdoch-executive-questioned-about-news-of-the-world.html?ref=newscorporation">Les Hinton, Ex-Murdoch Executive, Questioned<date>Published: October 24, 2011</date><text>LONDON — The focus on Rupert Murdoch’s senior executives in the wake of the News of the World phone hacking scandal intensified on Monday as his former right-hand man was questioned by lawmakers and his son James was summoned to give further testimony next month.Les Hinton, who had worked with Mr. Murdoch for more than five decades, remained inscrutable on Monday in the face of often incredulous questioning from a parliamentary committee concerning his time as chairman of News International, the British newspaper unit of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation media empire, which Mr. Hinton ran from 1995 to 2007. Sixteen former employees of The News of the World, the News International-owned tabloid at the center of the scandal, have been arrested this year. The company shut down the newspaper this summer after a series of revelations that phone hacking — breaking into the private voice mail accounts of people in the news — was widespread while Mr. Hinton ran the company, possibly touching thousands of unwitting targets. Mr. Hinton, who appeared before the committee by way of a video link from the United States, told the lawmakers that he still felt that he was right to say, at a previous appearance in 2009, that phone hacking was restricted to a single “rogue” reporter, Clive Goodman, who was jailed for the practice in 2007. It has since emerged that Mr. Goodman sent Mr. Hinton a letter that year reporting a much wider problem. “I don’t think I’d regard Mr. Goodman’s letter as evidence of anything,” Mr. Hinton said Monday. “They were accusations and allegations.” Mr. Hinton said he had not been questioned by the British police or by anyone within News Corporation over his role in the matter, and he denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Hinton stepped down from his most recent post at News Corporation — the publisher of The Wall Street Journal — in July, as the scandal was making headlines, saying that although he was “ignorant of what apparently happened,” he felt that resigning was the right thing to do. Two members of the committee criticized him at the hearing on Monday for his repeated insistence that he did not recall important events, was not told of significant developments or was absent at crucial moments. Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of Parliament with a background in journalism, described Mr. Hinton as “a mushroom” because he seemed “to have been kept in the dark by a lot of people.” Mr. Hinton responded that the events he was being asked to recall were several years in the past. Shortly after the hearing, the committee announced that it would recall James Murdoch, who heads his father’s European and Asian businesses, to give further testimony on Nov. 10. Former senior executives have said that James Murdoch was probably aware that phone hacking was widespread at the company before he authorized a large payment in 2008 to settle a lawsuit over the practice. He denies the accusation.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/news-corp-shareholders-slap-down-murdochs-sons/?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch's Sons Rebuked by News Corp. Shareholders<date>October 24, 2011, 7:17 pm</date><text>Olivia Harris/ReutersJames Murdoch News Corporation‘s independent shareholders voted largely against reinstating Rupert Murdoch’s sons James and Lachlan to the company board, according to a tally the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.   Although the Murdoch family’s control of a large percentage of voting shares all but guaranteed that all 15 board members would be re-elected after a contentious shareholder meeting on Friday, the detailed tally showed widespread opposition to the roles of James and Lachlan Murdoch. Investors also voted heavily against Natalie Bancroft, an aspiring opera singer and socialite, and Andrew S. B. Knight, a former News Corporation executive who serves as the head of the board’s compensation committee. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links News Corporation's S.E.C. filing The results of Friday’s vote were not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s leadership since the Murdoch family controls 40 percent of voting shares. And Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who controls about 7 percent of voting shares, has publicly backed the Murdochs and their management.   Still, James, the company’s deputy chief operating officer, has come under increased scrutiny in recent months as News Corporation’s British newspaper unit deals with a phone-hacking scandal at its now defunct News of the World tabloid. He was re-elected with 433 million votes, or 65 percent of the total. Paul Hackett/ReutersLachlan Murdoch His brother Lachlan received 440.9 million votes, or approximately 66.3 percent.   Ms. Bancroft, who joined the board after the acquisition of her family’s company, Dow Jones &amp; Company, was re-elected with 66.4 percent of the vote, while Mr. Knight received 67.7 percent. And while Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive, easily retained his additional position as chairman, he was re-elected with 84.4 percent of the vote, one of his lowest approval rates in years. Chase Carey, the chief operating officer and a likely successor to Mr. Murdoch, fared better, garnering a 90.5 percent vote. News Corporation scored some victories, to be sure. Its two newest directors, the former New York City schools chancellor Joel I. Klein and the venture capitalist James W. Breyer, were elected with more than 96 percent of the vote. And a floor proposal to prevent Mr. Murdoch from serving as both chairman and chief executive failed spectacularly: Just 0.22 percent of votes cast were in favor of the initiative. Still, such a significant vote against James and Lachlan Murdoch could eventually affect the future makeup of the company, analysts said. Until The News of the World scandal broke open this summer, James had been seen as a likely candidate to take over for his father.   “Shareholders can send a message that the company has to heed,” said Doug Creutz, a senior research analyst at the Cowen Group. In an interview ahead of the shareholder vote, he pointed to a 2004 campaign by several thousand shareholders to oust Michael Eisner from his chief executive post at the Walt Disney Company. Not long afterward, he was replaced by Robert A. Iger.

But stockholder dissent at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Friday led Mr. Murdoch to offer a lengthy apology to investors for the hacking scandal that embarrassed the company and led to calls for more responsible leadership from the board. While defending the company’s financial performance, Mr. Murdoch, 80, acknowledged its ethical lapses in the phone hacking by its British newspaper unit, News International. “We cannot just be a profitable company. We must be a principled company,” Mr. Murdoch told shareholders. “We must admit to and confront our mistakes and establish rigorous and vigorous procedures to put things right.” At the same time, Mr. Murdoch, who wore a black suit and blue tie and at times sparred with shareholders, urged investors to put the hacking imbroglio “in context.” Although the scandal had taken “a significant amount of my time,” he said, the vast majority of News Corporation employees have been “building our business and increasing our profitability.” In a statement on Friday evening, News Corporation affirmed that the board had been re-elected but did not provide a vote tally. Before the meeting, executives said they expected Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, to be re-elected with less than 90 percent of the vote, according to a person briefed on company discussions. Such a margin would signal significant disapproval of the company’s governance, considering the family owns 40 percent of the voting rights. News Corporation said voting totals would be filed next week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The meeting was held at the company’s Fox Studios lot in Los Angeles and ran 90 minutes. It gave the roughly 100 investors in attendance the chance to question Mr. Murdoch and vote on the leadership of a company with a market capitalization of $44 billion. Shareholders were eager to speak their minds. Julie Tanner, assistant director of socially responsible investing for Christian Brothers Investment Services, proposed that the company establish an independent chairman. “This pervasive and value-destroying scandal requires stronger independent leadership on the board,” she said. The proposal, which did not pass, set off a series of heated comments, the most contentious of which came from Tom Watson, the member of the British Parliament who has led the investigation into the phone hacking by News International. Mr. Watson asked Mr. Murdoch if he had heard about reports that journalists at the now shuttered tabloid News of the World had hacked computers as well as phones. Without presenting evidence, he said News International had hacked into the computer of a former army intelligence officer. “You haven’t told any of your investors what has to come,” Mr. Watson said. Mr. Murdoch said he was not aware of the accusations. “If you have further evidence, please let us know,” he said. “I promise you absolutely that we’ll stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this and put it right.” One board director, Viet D. Dinh, chairman of the board’s corporate governance committee, was questioned about his independence. Mr. Dinh is a friend of the Murdoch family and godfather to Lachlan Murdoch’s son. “I came to this country as a refugee on a boat,” Mr. Dinh said. “I would sacrifice my integrity for no one.” Hours before the meeting began, News Corporation announced it had reached a financial settlement with the family of Milly Dowler, the murdered British teenager whose phone was hacked by News of the World. The company said it would pay $3.2 million to the Dowlers and that Mr. Murdoch would personally donate $1.6 million to charities of the Dowler family’s choosing. The decision to hold the meeting at Fox Studios, rather than in New York City, was an effort to draw shareholders’ attention to the company’s lucrative entertainment unit and emphasize profitability. Standing in front of a screen that displayed images of Fox movies and TV shows like “American Idol,” Mr. Murdoch told investors, “The story of our company is the stuff of legend.” He praised the success of movies like “Avatar” and the company’s cable channels. At one point, he told investors that Mr. Watson, despite being a consistent critic of the company, had done an interview on Fox News. “We’re fair and balanced,” Mr. Murdoch said, echoing the network’s catchphrase and drawing laughs from the audience. In a 476-seat theater just past where Shirley Temple once rehearsed, Mr. Murdoch sat next to Chase Carey, the company’s chief operating officer. Investors filed through metal detectors past stacks of The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, both owned by News Corporation. A scattering of protestors, including one wearing an oversize Rupert Murdoch mask, picketed outside the studio’s Pico Boulevard gate. One sign carried the message, “Lying is wrong.” Mr. Murdoch appeared rested and ready to take on shareholder challenges. He grew impatient with speakers at times and asked them to limit their questions to one minute. When Edward Mason, a representative of England’s Church Commissioners, stood up to criticize the company’s corporate governance, Mr. Murdoch interrupted: “Your investments haven’t been all that great, but all right.” Activists and longtime Murdoch critics, some with odd agendas, dominated the meeting since large institutional investors do not typically air their grievances in such a public forum. In addition to questions about hacking, executive compensation and the dual-class share structure that gives the Murdoch family a controlling vote, investors asked Mr. Murdoch about animal rights and digital tools for teachers. Mr. Murdoch did get some support. A Fox employee stood to praise the company and said he had “never been asked to do something unethical, ever.” The billionaire Haim Saban congratulated Mr. Murdoch on his business acumen and said, “My money is on you.” One division of News Corporation failed to pay dividends for investors, Mr. Murdoch said. He called the handling of MySpace, which the company bought in 2005 for $580 million, a “huge mistake.” “We then proceeded to mismanage it in every possible way,” he said. In June, it sold MySpace for $35 million. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

Shareholders to Take Murdoch to the Woodshed<date>Published: October 20, 2011</date><text>The annual News Corporation shareholders meeting has always been a raucous and unpredictable event.In a 12-minute exchange last year, one disapproving shareholder gave Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman and chief executive, a copy of “Man Bites Murdoch,” an autobiographical book about an editor’s clashes with the media giant, and asked if he would be attending the comedian Jon Stewart’s “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear” in Washington. Mr. Murdoch said he would be in Australia. But that incident might seem tame once this year’s meeting ends Friday afternoon in Los Angeles. The gathering is expected to be the company’s most contentious in years, with frustrated shareholders taking the microphone to demand accountability after a phone-hacking scandal in Britain that has embarrassed the company. Investors will also have the chance to vote on the company’s board members, including Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan. While the family’s 40 percent stake virtually guarantees they will be re-elected, the chorus of discontent has put the company in an uncustomary defensive position. The most forceful, and potentially most ominous protest is likely to come from Tom Watson, the British Labour Party legislator who has led the investigation into phone-hacking at News Corporation’s British newspaper unit. Mr. Watson, who acquired nonvoting proxy shareholder status to attend the meeting, said he planned to accuse the company of engaging in further criminal wrongdoing involving surveillance techniques that extend beyond the phone hacking. He did not discuss potential evidence. “A lot of institutional investors do not know the scope nor the implications of what’s happening in the U.K.,” Mr. Watson said in a phone interview. “You can delegate power but not responsibility, and Rupert Murdoch for whatever reason has failed to put in corporate governance arrangements that prohibit crimes from being committed.” A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment. The company has done its part to carefully orchestrate the gathering. For the first time, News Corporation, citing security concerns, has made attendees register and R.S.V.P. before the event. Rather than holding the meeting at its usual venue, the Hudson Theater in New York, it will take place at the 476-seat Darryl F. Zanuck Theater on the gilded Art Deco-style Fox Studios lot near Beverly Hills, Calif. News Corporation said attendance would be similar to previous years and that it was not uncommon for companies to change locations for annual meetings. The Los Angeles venue was chosen because the company’s entertainment division, which makes shows like “Modern Family” and movies like “Avatar,” is a major contributor to its financial growth, News Corporation said. Some shareholders will get up to 15 minutes to speak directly to Mr. Murdoch, according to people who have attended previous meetings. “That can be a pretty long 15 minutes,” said Digby Gilmour, head of telecommunications and media research at C.L.S.A. Australia. Stephen Mayne, a director at the Australian Shareholders’ Association, and the person who presented Mr. Murdoch with the book last year, said he planned to travel from Sydney to attend. A former News Corporation employee and longtime shareholder, Mr. Mayne has attended 12 annual meetings. Mr. Murdoch has in recent years grown increasingly impatient with shareholder speeches, Mr. Mayne said. “I got 40 minutes of back and forth in 1999,” he said, adding: “But he’s gotten a lot tougher as he’s gotten older.” Mr. Mayne’s advice for shareholders standing up to confront Mr. Murdoch? “He’ll shut you down. You’ve got to be quick and polite but firm at the same time.” Any dissent will largely be symbolic. Mr. Murdoch owns nearly 40 percent of voting shares, and 7 percent belong to Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who has expressed his support for the board. As many as 30 percent of shareholders are expected to cast votes against Murdoch family members, several analysts estimated. Shareholder activists will dominate the meeting, since large institutional investors do not typically air grievances in such a public forum, analysts said. “There will be a lot of noise, but at the end, not a lot of change,” Mr. Gilmour said. The meetings typically begin with Mr. Murdoch opening the floor to questions, Mr. Mayne said. At the end of the exchanges, he gives a state-of-the-company address. That talk could become a more prominent part of the presentation as Mr. Murdoch lays out the shareholder-friendly actions News Corporation has recently taken, said a Deutsche Bank Securities analyst, Doug Mitchelson. One of them is a $5 billion stock buyback program currently under way, which has countered some investors’ concerns about News Corporation’s decision in July to withdraw its $12 billion bid for the British Sky Broadcasting Group. Chase Carey, chief operating officer, has said he would pursue additional stock buybacks on top of the $5 billion program. “As much as we thought Sky was a good deal, buying back stock is a better deal,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities. Company executives are sure to point out on Friday that even as most media companies struggle, News Corporation shares are up about 14 percent with a 52-week high of $18.35. The stock closed at $17.05 on Thursday. Last year, before the revelations of widespread phone-hacking, Mr. Mayne questioned Mr. Murdoch about allegations of hacking in 2006 involving two News of the World journalists, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson. “There has been two parliamentary inquiries, which have found no further evidence or any other thing at all,” Mr. Murdoch responded, according to a transcript. “If anything was to come to light, we challenge people to give us evidence, and no one has been able to do so.” In the end, the meeting will most likely give a platform to critics of the company’s corporate governance and not be a referendum on its financial performance.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/british-lawmaker-intensifies-pressure-on-news-corp/?ref=newscorporation">British Lawmaker Intensifies Pressure on News Corp.<date>October 20, 2011, 3:47 pm</date><text>New accusations of criminal wrongdoing could be lodged at News Corporation executives on Friday at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Los Angeles. Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament who has led efforts to investigate the phone-hacking scandal at News Corporation’s British newspaper unit, said Thursday that an investigation into surveillance techniques reportedly used at News Corporation could uncover other illegal activity. Mr. Watson acquired a shareholder proxy to attend the meeting. “Be in no doubt, this isn’t just about phone hacking. This company is facing criminal charges from bribing police officers” to perjury, Mr. Watson said on a conference call with reporters. “I don’t think investors have been given the full picture, and that’s really why I’ve decided to come out here.” A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment. On Wednesday, a parliamentary hearing in London raised new questions about the testimony provided by James Murdoch, News Corporation’s deputy chief operating officer. Les Hinton, former Dow Jones chief executive and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, will testify to Parliament via video conference on Monday. Mr. Watson is one of hundreds of investors who will have the opportunity to address Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation chief executive and chairman, and vote on the company’s leadership. Although the vote will be largely symbolic, with Mr. Murdoch controlling nearly 40 percent of shares, shareholder activists have flown to Los Angeles from Australia and the U.K. to attend. Mr. Watson said he plans to allege further illegal activity at News Corporation, though he would not get into specifics, saying he wants to “save” something for shareholders on Friday. Several shareholder groups and outside advisory firms have encouraged stockholders to vote against Mr. Murdoch and several other board members, including Mr. Murdoch’s sons, James and Lachlan. Mr. Watson echoed that sentiment. “You’ve got a $32 billion transglobal media empire that is currently being run like a dysfunctional family firm,” he said. Mr. Murdoch is expected to defend the company’s corporate governance and praise its financial performance. In a symbolic move, the shareholder meeting will be held on the Fox Studios lot, the epicenter of one of the most lucrative pieces of the News Corporation empire. Hit TV shows like “Modern Family” and “Glee” come from Fox, as do movies like the “Planet of the Apes” remake. Additionally, News Corporation’s $5 billion stock buyback program that is currently under way has largely eased investors’ concerns about phone-hacking, analysts said. In July, News Corporation shuttered its 168-year-old “News of the World” tabloid. “The one thing investors who own News Corporation should care about is the return of capital,” said Anthony DiClemente, a media analyst at Barclays Capital.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/business/media/murdochs-infighting-clouds-future-of-news-corp.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdochs’ Infighting Clouds Future of News Corp.<date>Published: October 18, 2011</date><text>LONDON — It was a striking display of unity: Rupert and James Murdoch, father and son, walking side by side through central London as they faced a crisis that had laid siege to their company. Pushing through a crush of paparazzi on a street not far from Buckingham Palace, James reached out to place a reassuring hand on his father’s back.But behind that facade, the disclosure of widespread phone hacking at News Corporation’s British newspaper division was only the latest and most serious episode to test a father-son relationship that has frayed over the last few years, leaving both men at times not even on speaking terms. And that rift, which has been known only to those closest to the company, has opened up a question central to Rupert Murdoch’s legacy — can one of his children ever take the helm of his $62 billion media giant? Their disagreements, which were described in detail by more than half a dozen former and current company officials and others close to the Murdochs, stemmed in large part from the clashing visions of a young technocratic student of modern management and a traditionalist who rules by instinct and conviction. The tension grew worse as the gap between the New York headquarters and James’s London operations, where he oversees the company’s European and Asian holdings, proved difficult to bridge. The elder Mr. Murdoch reached his boiling point last winter, said one of the former officials, and delivered a blunt ultimatum to his son. “You’re coming back to New York, or you’re out.” The son consented. But now, as investors place more pressure on the Murdochs to disentangle themselves from the company they have tightly controlled for three generations, his role in the company is under threat. Shareholders will meet on Friday in Los Angeles to decide whether to re-elect the News Corporation board, which includes Rupert, James and Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son. Though the family holds a 40 percent stake, giving the Murdochs effective control, and most analysts expect them to be re-elected, several large shareholders and a prominent investor advisory firm have recommended voting against them. James Murdoch, 38, who approved a settlement in 2008 of more than $1 million to help resolve allegations of voice mail hacking at News of the World, the tabloid that News Corporation shut down in July, faces additional pressure back home in London. He is scheduled to testify before Parliament for a second time next month to address questions about the payment, with several ministers suggesting that it was part of an intentional cover-up of the phone hacking. Within the company, James’s position became tenuous enough at one point this summer that he and other senior executives considered whether he should step aside, said one person with knowledge of the conversations. Both Murdochs, through representatives, declined interview requests. Rupert Murdoch, now 80, has long said he hopes one of his children will eventually run the company he built from an Australian newspaper franchise into one of the world’s most powerful and profitable media empires. With his daughter Elisabeth focused on her television production company in London, and Lachlan determined to continue running his media business in Sydney despite the elder Murdoch’s desire to bring him back into the company, James has been the heir apparent. But the hacking scandal and the simmering animosity with his father have destabilized his once inexorable ascent within the company. “Rupert always thought of News Corp. as a family company because it had been given to him,” said Barry Diller, who helped the elder Mr. Murdoch build Fox into a formidable rival to the traditional networks. “It had been given to him through a tiny newspaper in Adelaide, but nevertheless it was his father’s company. I think that meant to him that tradition should continue. If, as he’s always said, his children were worthwhile.” Succession Twist James was not always viewed as the Murdoch who would end up running News Corporation. That mantle, it seemed to everyone inside the company, belonged to Lachlan. James, the youngest of Rupert’s four adult children, was a willful child. When he was served last at dinner, as was the family custom for the last born, James strenuously objected and, according to the Murdoch biographer Neil Chenoweth, repeatedly tried to rearrange the seats around the table. He attended Harvard, but in 1994 dropped out to start a hip-hop record label, Rawkus, which News Corporation bought two years later. But once inside the corporate fold, James made a rapid ascent. At 24, he was put in charge of the digital publishing business in the United States. At 27, he was named executive chairman for Star TV, News Corporation’s Asian satellite television service, and three years later, he was installed as chief executive of BSkyB. Even by independent assessments, his stints leading both satellite providers were successful. He expanded Star’s businesses into India and subscribers to BSkyB soared. 1 2 3 Next Page » Bill Carter contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4D81438F936A25753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=newscorporation">Pension Funds Challenge News Corporation Board<date>Published: October 15, 2011</date><text>A week before the News Corporation's annual shareholder meeting, the company is facing a growing chorus of investors rallying against company leadership after a phone-hacking scandal in Britain and a controversy this week over an unorthodox circulation arrangement in Europe. On Friday, California's two huge public sector pension funds said they would withhold support from some or all of the News Corporation's board nominees, including the chairman and chief executive,Rupert Murdoch, and push for the election of an independent chairman. The State Teachers Retirement System, also known as Calstrs, with 852,300 members, said it would withhold its support from all board nominees. The larger California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, with 1.6 million members, said it would not back some of the directors, including Mr. Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan. Calpers said in a proxy filing on Friday that it would not vote for Rupert Murdoch ''because there needs to be an independent chairman to oversee News Corp. at this critical juncture.'' A Calstrs spokesman, Ricardo Duran, said in an e-mail, ''Trying to effectuate governance changes at News Corp. has been a challenging task for shareholders.'' He added, ''The recent scandal has underscored the need for the highest ethical and governance standards.'' Also on Friday, Hermes Equity Ownership Services, which represents British Telecom and other large pension funds, said it planned to vote against the re-election of Mr. Murdoch and his sons. ''Members are either family members, owe their position to a relationship with the family or are somehow linked to the family,'' said Jennifer Walmsley, a director at Hermes EOS. ''We want to see family members and affiliated directors replaced.'' As of June 30, 2010, Calstrs held about 1 percent of the company's shares. Calpers said it typically held no more than half a percent. That may not hold much sway in a company in which Mr. Murdoch controls nearly 40 percent of voting shares. But their stance is part of an increased challenge to News Corporation leadership ahead of an Oct. 21 shareholder vote. In July, the media conglomerate shuttered its 168-year-old News of the World tabloid after accusations of phone hacking. Several of its former executives have been arrested or have resigned. A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment. Earlier this week, the publisher of the European edition of The Wall Street Journal, owned by the News Corporation, resigned after an internal investigation into the paper's circulation practices. Ms. Walmsley said the incident at The Wall Street Journal Europe underscored Hermes EOS's insistence that an independent investigation be made into the corporate culture at the News Corporation. The company has not reacted with ''sufficient urgency to investor concerns,'' she said. Some independent investor advisory firms have expressed concerns about other News Corporation business practices. In an Oct. 6 report, Glass, Lewis &amp; Company, an investor advisory firm, questioned the company's $680 million deal in April for Shine Limited, a television production company owned by Mr. Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth. In August, the News Corporation dropped its plan to have Ms. Murdoch join the board, an effort to appease shareholders. ''The News of the World scandal is an opportunity to re-examine this board for shareholders and note this traditionally very cozy board that has lacked sufficient independence,'' said David Eaton, vice president of proxy research at Glass, Lewis.

Hits a Bump as Investors Prepare to Meet<date>Published: October 13, 2011</date><text>The European edition of The Wall Street Journal accounts for less than 1 percent of total business at its parent company, the News Corporation. But the controversy this week over an unorthodox circulation deal that resulted in the resignation of the newspaper’s publisher could carry outsize influence among investors already concerned about ethical practices at the company, analysts said Thursday.The revelation of another journalistic lapse at News Corporation — though minor compared with the phone hacking scandal in Britain — further complicates matters for the leadership at News Corporation as it prepares for its annual shareholder meeting next Friday. “No news of impropriety at News Corporation is a blip when they’re under such scrutiny,” said Doug Creutz, a senior research analyst at the Cowen Group. “This adds to the general question of how the company is being run.” He pointed to several independent investor advisory groups that have recently recommended that shareholders vote against some members of the News Corporation board, “especially those whose name ends in Murdoch,” he said. Rupert Murdoch is the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, and his sons James and Lachlan, have large roles in the company. The scrutiny on the company increased on Thursday when the bureau that audits newspaper sales in Britain said it was reviewing new information about The Wall Street Journal Europe’s circulation arrangement that could lead to further investigation. Under the deal, The Journal used a third party to channel money to a Dutch consulting firm, which bought thousands of copies of The Journal each day for as little as one euro cent (1.37 American cents). The practice helped bolster The Journal’s subscription rate in Europe. The publisher of The Wall Street Journal Europe, Andrew Langhoff, resigned on Tuesday after an internal investigation revealed that the circulation deal also led to an agreement that provided the Dutch company, Executive Learning Partnership, with two positive articles in exchange for its financial support. “We have always been transparent with the A.B.C., and they have certified this program over recent reporting periods,” Dow Jones &amp; Company, which owns The Journal, said in a statement, using an acronym to refer to the circulation auditing agency in Britain. “We plan to meet with them soon and review all the details with them again.” The incident at The Wall Street Journal Europe also puts the spotlight on how newspapers report circulation numbers, which are crucial to determining how much publications can charge for advertisements. At a time when the industry is struggling, many newspapers rely on heavily discounted copies to prop up circulation numbers. Last year, the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the regulatory agency in the United States, added a new category on how publications should report copies that are sold to schools, bought by businesses for their employees, or bought in bulk by third parties, like advertisers, which include promotional inserts or wraps and distribute the copies free. The new category, called “verified,” is separate from paid circulation totals that include home delivery and newsstand sales. Michael J. Lavery, the president and managing director of the Audit Bureau, said the popularity of the third party bulk sales that are considered verified had waned over the last several reporting cycles. He said the bureau no longer included third-party sales as a paid category that could determine advertising rates. “There are other distribution channels that helped media buyers and advertisers get their message to their target audiences,” Mr. Lavery said, citing new programs, like Sunday Select by the Gannett newspaper division, where nonsubscribers could opt to have advertising circulars delivered to them directly. The New York Times does have third-party agreements but does not include those sales in its report to the bureau, the company said Thursday. Around 9 percent of The New York Times’s print and digital circulation of 917,000 comes from verified subscriptions, though that figure does not include Web site subscriptions. 1 2 Next Page » Eric Pfanner contributed reporting.

While the bureau had signed off on The Journal’s circulation figures for the time periods in question, “there now appears to be additional new information which may give grounds for further investigation,” Jerry Wright, chief executive of the bureau, said in a statement. The scrutiny of The Wall Street Journal Europe’s circulation has developed into the latest in a series of headaches for News Corp., which owns the paper. News Corp. is embroiled in a scandal over intrusive reporting methods at a former News Corp. tabloid in Britain, The News of the World, which was recently shut down by the company’s chief executive, Rupert Murdoch. On Tuesday, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal Europe, Andrew Langhoff, resigned over questions of journalistic ethics related to the circulation deal that subsequently came under scrutiny, involving a company called Executive Learning Partnership. The Journal said Mr. Langhoff had breached the paper’s guidelines on editorial independence, putting pressure on reporters to write articles in which employees of Executive Learning Partnership, based in Amsterdam, were quoted extensively. A British newspaper, The Guardian, which has covered the scandal at The News of the World with vigor, followed up on Thursday by reporting that Mr. Langhoff’s forays into The Journal newsroom were only a small part of what it referred to as a circulation “scam.” Under this arrangement, 12,000 copies of the European Journal were sold to Executive Learning Partnership at 1 euro cent per copy, for distribution at universities and business schools, according to The Guardian. Thousands of other copies were sold to other “sponsors” under the program, which had been approved by the British circulation bureau, the paper said. Even though Rien Van Lent, a partner in Executive Learning Partnership, is the former managing director of The Wall Street Journal Europe, the relationship apparently took a turn for the worse. The Journal came up with a new arrangement in which it channeled payment for the 12,000 copies back to the company via third parties — “effectively buying the papers with The Journal’s own cash,” as The Guardian put it. Dow Jones, the News Corp. unit that publishes The Journal, reacted angrily to the report, saying in a statement that it was “replete with untruths and malign interpretations.” “Andrew Langhoff resigned because of a perceived breach of editorial integrity, not because of circulation programs, whose copies were certified by the ABC U.K.,” Dow Jones said. The payments to Executive Learning, while “admittedly complex,” were for “legitimate services rendered,” Dow Jones said. “As we’ve stated, while the copies associated with E.L.P. were legitimate and appropriate, we were not comfortable with the appearance of the programs and no longer have relationships with any of the third parties directly involved in these agreements. ” Dow Jones added that it was inaccurate of The Guardian to refer to a main source for its story as a “whistleblower.” “In fact, that employee was first investigated by the company because of concerns around his business dealings,” Dow Jones said. The Journal, in its own story on the matter, identified a former circulation department employee, Gert Van Mol, whose job was eliminated this year, as the developer of the sponsorship arrangement.Mr. Van Mol did not respond to telephone calls or e-mail. In an e-mail, Nick Van Heck, a partner at Executive Learning, also disputed The Guardian’s version of events, saying the story appeared to have been distorted by “internal dynamics” at the European Journal “and the current investigative climate around News Corp. organizations.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/pension-investor-calls-for-murdoch-ouster-from-news-corp-board/?ref=newscorporation">Pension Investor to Vote Against Murdochs on News Corp.

The publisher of The Wall Street Journal Europe, a unit of News Corporation, resigned Tuesday after an internal investigation revealed an agreement between the paper's circulation department and a Netherlands-based company that was featured positively in two articles. In an e-mail to his staff, the publisher, Andrew Langhoff, who is also managing director of the European, African and Middle East operations of Dow Jones &amp; Company, said he would leave his post immediately. ''Because the agreement could leave the impression that news coverage can be influenced by commercial relationships, as publisher with executive oversight, I believe that my resignation is now the most honorable course,'' Mr. Langhoff wrote in the e-mail. Dow Jones said on Wednesday that its editors in New York learned of the circulation agreement with the consulting firm Executive Learning Partnership and began an inquiry. That agreement prompted two favorable articles in The Wall Street Journal Europe's Special Reports section. The deal was part of a larger agreement between the paper and corporate sponsors to increase the Journal's European circulation figures. Beginning in 2008, the Journal held seminars intended for university students - called the ''Future Leadership Institute'' - that provided corporate sponsors with inexpensive copies of the paper. The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday that The Journal used a third-party intermediary to make payments to Executive Learning Partnership, a sponsor of the institute. In turn, the company bought thousands of copies of the newspaper at a heavily discounted rate, The Guardian said. Dow Jones said The Journal's circulation programs were fully disclosed and certified and that sponsored distribution was a common practice among newspapers. ''Andrew Langhoff resigned because of a perceived breach of editorial integrity, not because of circulation programs,'' a spokeswoman, Bethany Sherman, said Wednesday in a statement. ''While the copies associated with E.L.P. were legitimate and appropriate, we were not comfortable with the appearance of the programs and no longer have relationships with any of the third parties directly involved in these agreements.'' Executive Learning Partnership did not respond to requests for comment. The incident comes at a pivotal time for News Corporation, which has been dealing with the effect of a hacking scandal at its now closed News of the World tabloid. Several of its executives have been arrested, others have resigned because of the scandal. On Oct. 21 the media giant will hold its annual shareholders' meeting, during which investors will have the chance to vote on the company's leadership, including the roles of Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive, and his sons, James and Lachlan. Early next month News Corporation will release earnings for its most recent quarter. On Monday, an investors' advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, advised shareholders to vote against 13 of the 15 current board members. On Tuesday, British lawmakers said that Les Hinton, the former chief executive of Dow Jones &amp; Company and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, would testify before Parliament via videoconference on Oct. 24. Mr. Hinton previously ran News International, the company's British unit, which oversaw News of the World. He resigned from his latest post in July. In the last several years, News Corporation has invested in the London-based Wall Street Journal Europe in a bid to compete with Pearson's Financial Times. But The Journal has had a hard time gaining traction. It currently has a circulation of 74,800, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations in Britain. As part of the circulation agreement with Executive Learning Partnership, an Oct. 14, 2010, article relied on its poll and quoted one of its executives. In March, The Journal featured a question-and-answer session with an Executive Learning Partnership partner. A clarification published on Wednesday by The Journal said that despite the Executive Learning Partnership agreement the ''reporting and writing were solely the responsibility of the news department.''

In a short statement, the owner group said that each of its members found value in holding on to the Web video company instead of selling it to any of a number of potential bidders. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release “Since Hulu holds a unique and compelling strategic value to each of its owners, we have terminated the sale process and look forward to working together to continue mapping out its path to even greater success,” the consortium said. Speculation that Hulu’s owners would decide against a sale had been building up for months. Helping drive that were cryptic comments by the News Corporation’s chief operating officer, Chase Carey, during that company’s earnings call in August. “Does it make sense to pursue that path or does it make sense for us to stay in an ownership position and continue to have it driven by content owners?” he asked. As bids came in last month from Amazon, Dish Network, Google and others, Hulu’s owners expressed less interest in the valuations of the offers, people briefed on the bids said previously. Most of the bids did not exceed $2 billion, the valuation Hulu was aiming for in a potential initial public offering last year, these people said. Since then, however, Hulu has begun programs like a $7.99-a-month subscription service that its owners argued significantly bolstered the company’s value. As of Oct. 5, Hulu counted more than one million subscribers to its Hulu Plus service, according to a blog post by its chief executive, Jason Kilar. Many of the potential bids also hinged on striking longer-term deals with the content providers.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/dow-jones-european-executive-resigns/?ref=newscorporation">Dow Jones European Executive Resigns<date>October 12, 2011, 12:14 pm</date><text>9:30 p.m. | Updated The News Corporation, already dealing with the fallout from a phone-hacking scandal in Britain, has suffered another blow to its European operations. The publisher of The Wall Street Journal Europe, a unit of News Corporation, resigned Tuesday after an internal investigation revealed an agreement between the paper’s circulation department and a Netherlands-based company that was featured positively in two articles. In an e-mail to his staff, the publisher, Andrew Langhoff, who is also managing director of the European, African and Middle East operations of Dow Jones &amp; Company, said he would leave his post immediately. “Because the agreement could leave the impression that news coverage can be influenced by commercial relationships, as publisher with executive oversight, I believe that my resignation is now the most honorable course,” Mr. Langhoff wrote in the e-mail.

The firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, wrote in a report that the News Corporation's incumbent directors, 13 out of 15 board members, failed to prevent the company from stumbling into a morass of corporate troubles. Chief among these is the phone-hacking scandal in Britain that has led to the arrests of several News Corporation executives, parliamentary hearings and a public apology by Mr. Murdoch. The scandal flared up in July, when The Guardian newspaper of London reported that reporters for a News Corporation publication, News of the World, had hacked into the voice mails of a 13-year-old murder victim, Milly Dowler. It eventually grew to encompass charges of widespread hacking and illicit bribes paid to British police officers. The scandal has cost the News Corporation financially. The company eventually closed News of the World after 168 years and scuttled plans to buy control of a major satellite television provider, British Sky Broadcasting, for about $12 billion. Institutional Shareholder Services wrote that the phone-hacking revelations had exposed ''a striking lack of stewardship and failure of independence by a board whose inability to set a strong tone-at-the-top about unethical business practices has now resulted in enormous costs - financial, legal, regulatory, reputational and opportunity - for the shareholders the board ostensibly serves.'' Only two of the News Corporation's director nominees, Joel I. Klein and the venture capitalist James Breyer, received the advisory firm's approval, since they have served on the board for only a few months. Mr. Klein, who formerly served as the chancellor of New York City's public schools, is helping supervise the phone-hacking inquiry. Firms like Institutional Shareholder Services can hold great sway over public companies' investors. Many large shareholders often follow proxy advisers' recommendations. Still, the firm's call to arms is largely symbolic, since Mr. Murdoch, the News Corporation's chairman and chief executive, controls about 40 percent of the company's voting shares. Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who owns about 7 percent of News Corp.'s stock, publicly backed the company's management in July. Institutional Shareholder Services also took issue with the News Corporation's executive compensation plans, particularly the near-tripling of Mr. Murdoch's cash bonus for the 2011 fiscal year to $12.5 million. It noted that Chase Carey, the News Corporation's deputy chairman and chief operating officer, received a tax benefit when his contract was renewed, although his base salary was cut in half to $4.05 million. The firm recommended voting against the executive compensation proposal, although it is only advisory. As expected, the News Corporation took issue with the recommendations, saying it ''strongly disagrees'' with them. ''The company takes the issues surrounding News of the World seriously and is working hard to resolve them,'' Teri Everett, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''However, I.S.S.'s disproportionate focus on these issues is misguided and a disservice to our stockholders. Moreover, I.S.S. failed to consider that the company's compensation practices reflect its robust performance in FY 2011 driven by its broad, diverse group of businesses across the globe.'' Shares in the News Corporation closed up more than 4 percent on Monday, at $16.97. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Filing Rebuts Criticism of Board<date>October 11, 2011, 12:44 pm</date><text>News Corporation went on the defensive Tuesday morning after an investor advisory firm urged shareholders to vote against reinstating several key members of the media giant’s board of directors, including the chairman and chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, and his son James Murdoch. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company reminded shareholders ahead of an Oct. 21 vote that News Corp. “reported a strong performance for fiscal 2011” and that despite the global economic downturn, the company “delivered extraordinary total shareholder return.” The filing praises the performance of Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey, points out that he has been working under reduced compensation and defends Mr. Murdoch. “Our CEO is critical to the value we create for our stockholders,” it says. The filing represented a forceful rebuttal to a report released Monday by Institutional Shareholder Services, which said that 13 of the firm’s 15 board members have insufficiently handled News Corp.’s involvement in an ongoing phone-hacking scandal in Britain. Fallout from the scandal included the shuttering of the 168-year-old News of the World tabloid, the arrest of several top executives, a public apology by Mr. Murdoch and widely-followed parliamentary hearings. “A striking lack of stewardship and failure of independence by a board whose inability to set a strong tone-at-the-top about unethical business practices has now resulted in enormous costs — financial, legal, regulatory, reputational and opportunity — for the shareholders the board ostensibly serves,” the report by the proxy firm said of the phone-hacking scandal. In the S.E.C. filing News Corp. fired back. “ISS’s disproportionate focus on News of the World is misguided,” the report said. “The drivers of our business are intact, our position is strong and our future is promising.” The filing also reminded investors that the company is “fully cooperating” in the ongoing investigations into its media arm in Britain, News International, which oversaw News of the World. “We disagree with recommendations that stockholders should vote against our directors,” the company advised. “We respectfully request that stockholders vote ‘FOR’ all directors.” Shareholders often take into account the advice of independent concerns such as International Shareholder Services. News Corp. investors will have a chance to vote on this and other matters at next week’s shareholder meeting. The company is expected to report its quarterly earnings on Nov. 2. Despite News Corp.’s heated defense, in reality calls to diminish the roles of Mr. Murdoch and his son may not carry much weight. Mr. Murdoch controls 40 percent of News Corp. voting shares. In July Saudi Arabia’s Prince Walid bin Talal, who owns 7 percent of the company’s voting shares, publicly defended News Corp. management.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/i-s-s-urges-ousting-majority-of-news-corp-directors/?ref=newscorporation">Advisory Firm Urges Ouster of Murdoch and His Sons<date>October 10, 2011, 5:26 pm</date><text>Mark Wilson/Getty ImagesRupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of the News Corporation. 8:00 p.m. | Updated A major investor advisory firm recommended Monday that shareholders of the News Corporation vote against the re-election of a vast majority of the media conglomerate’s board, including Rupert Murdoch and his sons, who control the company.

He said he had hired Norman Siegel, a New York lawyer who has represented many of the families of those killed in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, to handle the case. In an interview with Sky News, a British television network that is part of the Murdoch empire, Mr. Lewis said that the legal action in the United States would focus on the “News Corporation’s liability for actions by its foreign subsidiaries,” including the tabloid The News of the World, which has been at the center of the phone hacking scandal and was closed in July. He said the lawsuits would focus on the revelations of widespread phone hacking in Britain and on accusations that the police were bribed to assist in the tabloid’s pursuit of scoops. Mr. Lewis did not respond to voice mail messages requesting an interview on the issue. In another development, Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World, has sued News International, the News Corporation’s British subsidiary, because it stopped paying for his legal fees in the hacking case, the BBC reported. Mr. Coulson, who was arrested in July in connection with the investigations into phone hacking and payments to police officials under his editorship, resigned in January as the communications director for Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr. Lewis, based on his remarks in the interviews with Sky News, the BBC and the newspaper The Guardian, appeared to be relying, as a basis for the American legal action, on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 statute that holds American companies and their executives liable for corrupt activities abroad, including bribery of foreign officials. In the Sky News interview, he said part of the reason for pursuing the News Corporation in American courts was the prospect of higher damage settlements than are customary in the British courts. The prospect of defending itself against civil suits in American courts would add a daunting new dimension to the challenges facing the News Corporation as a result of the phone hacking revelations in Britain. But some legal experts in Britain said that Mr. Lewis’s announcement was a publicity stunt, and that the move could complicate legal proceedings in Britain. Mark Thomson, a British lawyer who also represents phone hacking victims, issued a brusque statement disassociating himself from Mr. Lewis’s action. Mr. Thomson said the class-action lawsuit he has filed on behalf of his clients will go to trial in Britain in January, adding, “My clients are not taking part in the reported action in New York.” This week, News International offered a settlement of about $3.2 million, and a further payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity, to the family of Milly Dowler, a teenage murder victim whose voice mail messages were intercepted by The News of the World. The scandal has led to strong pressures on James Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch who leads the company’s European and Asian operations. Both denied any prior knowledge of the practices at The News of the World.

The case was closed in July 2010 by an Ibiza judge for lack of evidence, but that decision was appealed to a Spanish provincial court for the Balearic Islands, which include Ibiza. The provincial court ordered the Ibiza judge, Carmen Martín Montero, to resume the case and to summon the prince to appear. The accuser, who has been identified only by her middle name, Soraya, said she was drugged at an Ibiza nightclub and then taken to the yacht and raped there. Traces of semen were collected when the woman went to the police. One of the woman’s lawyers, Javier Beloqui, said on Tuesday that “instead of documents, the prince should simply provide a DNA sample if he wants to close this matter,” so that it could be compared with the semen samples. A spokeswoman for Prince Alwaleed’s company said last week that the accusations against him were “completely and utterly false.” She said the prince did not charter a yacht in Ibiza, or take his own yacht there, at the time when the model said she was assaulted. “Neither the prince nor his lawyers have ever been contacted by the court in Spain,” the spokeswoman said on Tuesday in an e-mail. “However, we have widely disseminated this documentation into the public record, and certainly expect that Spanish authorities now have full access to these materials.” Prince Alwaleed is the largest individual stakeholder in Citigroup and, among his other major holdings, is the second-largest investor in the News Corporation. Forbes valued his fortune this year at $19.4 billion, making him the 26th richest man in the world and the richest in the Arab world.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/world/europe/14spain.html?ref=newscorporation">Spain Reopens Rape Case Against Saudi Prince, Alwaleed<date>Published: September 13, 2011</date><text>MADRID — A Spanish judge has reopened an abandoned sexual assault case against a Saudi prince who is one of the world’s richest men, reviving accusations that he raped a 20-year-old model on a luxury yacht in the Spanish Mediterranean in August 2008.The prince, Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a nephew of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, is the largest individual stakeholder in Citigroup and, among his other major holdings, is the second largest investor in the News Corporation. Forbes valued his fortune this year at $19.4 billion, making him the 26th richest man in the world and the single richest in the Arab world. The accuser did not go public, and the original complaint appears to have remained largely unknown. The case was quietly closed in July 2010 for what a judge on the Mediterranean resort island of Ibiza called a lack of evidence. But on appeal, a Spanish provincial court for the Balearic Islands, which has jurisdiction over Ibiza, ordered the judge to resume investigating and to summon the prince to appear. The provincial court said the judge, Carmen Martín Montero, was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. Heba Fatani, a spokeswoman for Prince Alwaleed’s investment arm, the Kingdom Holding Company, called the accusations “completely and utterly false.” “The alleged encounter simply never happened,” Ms. Fatani said in a statement. Ms. Fatani also said the prince was never in Ibiza in 2008 and provided pages of his calendar indicating that he spent time that summer in Paris; Cannes, France; and Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. He did not charter a yacht in Ibiza, nor did he take his own there, she said. Other people who spent time with the prince that summer can confirm his whereabouts, she said. Prince Alwaleed first learned of the 2008 case on Tuesday, Ms. Fatani said, and his lawyers had not been informed about it. Son of a gadfly senior prince, Talal ibn Abd al-Aziz, Prince Alwaleed has long been outspoken about expanding opportunities for women in the kingdom. The women who work in his Saudi offices are not segregated, nor do they have to wear the enveloping black abayas — his royal stature keeps them out of reach of the religious police who enforce such measures. The model, whose lawyer has identified her by only her middle name, Soraya, filed a police complaint in August 2008, saying the prince had raped her on the yacht after she was drugged. She said she had been invited to the yacht at an Ibiza nightclub. The Balearic archipelago is one of the most popular vacation destinations in the Mediterranean and welcomes a flotilla of luxury yachts during the summer months. According to a summary of a provincial court’s order to reopen the case, medical tests conducted by departments of Spain’s National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Science turned up traces of semen and a sleep-inducing chemical, nordazepam, in her urine. In the 2010 decision to close the case, the Ibiza judge said the forensic and medical tests had shown no signs of physical violence that could confirm a rape. The judge also questioned whether the sleep-inducing chemical found in the model’s body could have acted swiftly enough to induce a semiconscious state between the time she left the nightclub and reached the yacht. Her lawyer, Javier Beloqui, said the tests supported her claim that her drink had been spiked and that she was sexually assaulted. He called on Prince Alwaleed to provide at least a DNA test in order to compare it with the traces of semen found. Mr. Beloqui welcomed the decision to reopen the case. “Nobody was even questioned at the time,” he said, “which is unbelievable when you consider the seriousness of the crime and the evidence that has been gathered.” Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from New York.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/dealbook-accels-breyer-to-join-news-corp-board-as-perkins-departs/?ref=newscorporation">DealBook: Accel's Breyer to Join News Corp.

So what does News Corporation want with James W. Breyer? On Friday, Rupert Murdoch’s media empire announced that Mr. Breyer, a prominent partner at the venture capital firm Accel, has been nominated to join its board of directors. It’s a notable coup for News Corp., which has been embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal that has battered its reputation and shaken its operations. Since the controversy broke, several executives have departed, its multibillion-dollar takeover bid for British Sky Broadcasting has crumbled, and The News of the World, a century-plus-old newspaper, has shuttered. Enter Mr. Breyer. The addition of Mr. Breyer does not in itself restore News Corp.’s reputation, but the venture capitalist, widely regarded for his savvy bets on Internet start-ups, adds some sheen to the media company. Revolving Door View all posts Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links News Corp. Shakes Up Its Board Mr. Breyer has led or had a hand in several of Accel’s big investments in the social Web, including an early $13 million financing round in Facebook in 2005 and a 2009 investment in Groupon. Both have proven to be smart investments. In 2005, Facebook was valued at nearly $100 million, and is said to be on track for an I.P.O. next year that could value it at $100 billion or more. Mr. Breyer, who invested some of his personal fortune in the Facebook round, also sits on the company’s board, along with its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg; the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings; and two venture capitalists, Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel. Mr. Breyer’s deep connection to Facebook and his insight into the world of social media has likely made him an alluring candidate for News Corp., which has fumbled in its efforts to capitalize on the Internet boom. Mr. Murdoch has been ambitious in the realm of social media, sinking $580 million to buy Myspace six years ago. After several quarters of mounting losses and decreasing market share, News Corp. unloaded the business to Specific Media in June for $35 million. While few believe Mr. Murdoch is considering another social network acquisition, Mr. Breyer could help shape the digital strategies of News Corp.’s disparate properties. “Myspace was broadly considered the biggest failure of large media companies in this new social media world,” said Lou Kerner an analyst of Wedbush Securities. “The great thing about Jim Breyer is that he’s actually a user of Facebook; the fact that he’s also on the board of Facebook is a plus.” Although Mr. Breyer is perhaps best known for his investment in Facebook, his connections span across technology, entertainment and retail. He sits on the boards of Dell, Wal-Mart, Brightcove, the e-commerce marketplace Etsy and the gaming start-up Vostu. The investor, a former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant, was also a board member for Marvel Entertainment, before it was acquired by the Walt Disney Company. “What Facebook is doing is going to be incredibly important to every business in the world,” Mr. Kerner said. “News Corp. recognizes that it has to understand Facebook and the broader ecosystem.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/accels-breyer-appointed-to-news-corp-board-as-perkins-cowley-depart/?ref=newscorporation">Accel's Breyer to Join News Corp.

Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release Sorkin: Murdoch's Board Stays Silent As Scandal Widens Shareholders will vote on Mr. Breyer at the company’s annual meeting, scheduled for Oct. 21. “Jim has a remarkable track record in the investment community and his background in media and technology will enable him to make significant contributions to News Corporation’s board,” Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation’s chief executive, said in a statement. The changes comes as the media conglomerate continues to wrestle with a wide-ranging phone-hacking scandal that has led to the departure of several top managers and the closure of The News of the World, the company’s long-running British tabloid. In August, Mr. Murdoch told investors that he had the support of the board and planned to remain as its chief executive. With Mr. Breyer, the company will add a prominent Silicon Valley investor to its board, even as it loses Mr. Perkins, one of the founding members of Kleiner Perkins. Mr. Breyer, who also serves on the boards of Wal-Mart Stores and Dell, led Accel’s first investment in Facebook in 2005 and was a major player in the firm’s investments in Brightcove, Groupon and Etsy, an online e-commerce site. “I consider it a privilege to be nominated, and I am excited about the prospect of joining News Corp.’s distinguished board at this exciting time in the company’s history,” Mr. Breyer said in a statement. In its statement, the company did not explain why Mr. Cowley, who has served on the board since 1979, and Mr. Perkins are leaving. Mr. Cowley has long been a part of the News Corp. family, joining the media empire in 1964 to help launch The Australian. He later served as the chief executive of News Limited, a unit of News Corp., from 1980 to 1997. Mr. Perkins, a board member for some 15 years, has been a vocal defender of the company’s management. When the scandal broke, he was the first board member to discuss the controversy, telling The New York Times in July that the board “is fully supportive of the top management.” He added, the board members “were stunned to discover the magnitude of the scandal.” Still, some analysts say, Mr. Perkins may have been more agitated behind closed doors. He abruptly resigned from Hewlett-Packard’s board in 2006 over the company’s handling of a separate scandal involving phone records.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/news-corp-board-undergoes-a-shuffle/?ref=newscorporation">News Corp. Board Undergoes a Shuffle<date>September 2, 2011, 10:43 am</date><text>7:24 p.m. | Updated The News Corporation’s board of directors underwent significant reshuffling on Friday with the departure of two long-serving members and the nomination of a new independent voice. James W. Breyer, a prominent venture capitalist and member of Facebook’s board, will be nominated for election to the board when shareholders gather for their annual meeting in October. He is expected to lend an outside perspective to a body that is viewed as highly deferential to its chairman, Rupert Murdoch. At the same time, Thomas J. Perkins, a leading Silicon Valley entrepreneur who joined the board in 1996, and Kenneth E. Cowley, a former executive at Mr. Murdoch’s Australian media division who has been a senior official for the News Corporation since the 1960s, both said they were stepping down. The company, which is under investigation on two continents for improper business and journalism practices, is facing growing questions about the independence of its board. While the News Corporation complies with Nasdaq guidelines for the number of directors who lack direct ties to the company, many of the directors who are considered independent for practical purposes have long histories with Mr. Murdoch. In many cases, they owe their personal wealth to him. Though Mr. Perkins, 79, had minimal ties to News Corporation before joining the board in 1996, Mr. Cowley, 76, ran Mr. Murdoch’s Australian operations for nearly 20 years. Both were considered independent under Nasdaq rules. Mr. Breyer appears to have no direct links to the News Corporation. His experience on corporate boards is deep. In addition to Facebook, he serves on the boards of Wal-Mart, where he is the presiding independent director, and Dell. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Perkins defended the board’s independence and said his departure had nothing to do with the company’s troubles. He said his decision to step aside was related largely to his age, as he told Mr. Murdoch when Mr. Perkins said the pair first discussed the issue in May. “If I remained on the board, you’d have two 80-year-olds and one of them owns the company,” Mr. Perkins said. He said he felt corporate governance experts might consider it to be a problem to have two octogenarians on the board and, he added, he has been increasingly less comfortable doing work travel and undertaking other board activities as he has gotten older. Mr. Perkins, an avid sailor and water sportsman, continues to travel for pleasure, including taking dives in his personal submarine. Speaking publicly for the first time about the role of the board since the scandal, he said independent directors had been playing an integral role in the internal investigation. He said he expected the News Corporation to come forward shortly with the results if its investigation, some of which would be quite damning. “It will be answers to every question — a convincing revealing of everything,” Mr. Perkins said, suggesting that it would include addressing issues “we’re very ashamed of.” The nomination of Mr. Breyer, 50, is in step with the News Corporation’s strategy to make digital businesses a focal point of its growth strategy. In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said: “Jim has a remarkable track record in the investment community and his background in media and technology will enable him to make significant contributions to News Corporation’s board.” Just last month, the board was expected to add Elisabeth Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch’s daughter. But she and the company decided it was best to delay her nomination. Not only is the company facing questions about hacking voice-mails of private citizens in Britain and anticompetitive practices in the United States, but it is being sued over its acquisition of Ms. Murdoch’s production company, Shine. The purchase spawned a lawsuit last spring on behalf of some shareholders. The suit, filed by Amalgamated Bank, asserted that Mr. Murdoch ran his company “as his own private fiefdom with little or no effective oversight from the board.” The News Corporation has moved to dismiss the suit. But on Friday, it was one of Mr. Murdoch’s other children who was the focus of attention. James, the company’s London-based chief operating officer who has been the focus of unrelenting criticism in Britain, said he was declining his $6 million bonus. Weighing in on James’s future at the company, Mr. Perkins defended him, saying the board had “total confidence in him,” as well as in the whole Murdoch family. He added: “If you don’t like nepotism, you don’t buy shares in News Corp.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/a-news-corp-decision-according-to-joel-klein.html?ref=newscorporation">A News Corp.

Subsidiary Wireless Generation<date>Published: August 29, 2011</date><text>The New York State comptroller’s office has rejected a $27 million contract with a News Corporation subsidiary to build a data system for tracking student performance, as fallout widens against the international media conglomerate due to a phone hacking scandal in Britain. Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, had given the green light to state education officials in June to pursue a no-bid contract with Wireless Generation, an education technology company based in Brooklyn in which News Corporation had acquired a 90 percent stake last November for more than $360 million. Last week, however, Mr. DiNapoli decided that the revelations surrounding News Corporation had made final approval of the contract untenable. In a rejection letter, first reported on Saturday by The Daily News, he told state education officials that they should instead put the project out to bid to a variety of companies. “We believe the record remains incomplete with respect to the vendor responsibility issues involving the parent company of Wireless Generation,” the letter said. The comptroller’s office also said it now believed other companies could do the work, making a competitive bid necessary. The concerns that killed the state contract follow other questions raised about Wireless Generation’s work in New York City. The company was acquired by News Corporation just weeks after Joel I. Klein, a former New York schools chancellor, left city employment to work for News Corporation as vice president of educational technology. Wireless Generation helped to develop and run the city’s $80 million student data system, known as ARIS, as well as the technology behind one of Mr. Klein’s favorite projects, a computer-based learning model known as School of One. Strict city ethics rules prevent former officials from working on matters they had substantial involvement in as city employees; News Corporation said Mr. Klein had no involvement with the purchase of Wireless Generation, which had been in the works for several months before he joined the company. New York will still work with Wireless Generation indirectly, as part of a consortium of states building a shared data framework known as the Shared Learning Collaborative. Financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the $44 million project, awarded to Wireless Generation in June, is being directed by Stacey Childress, a former board member at Wireless Generation. She stepped down and sold her stock in the firm before taking the position at the Gates Foundation, a Wireless Generation spokeswoman said. In the wake of the most recent revelations of phone hacking by The News of the World, the British tabloid that News Corporation closed in July, the state and city teachers’ unions and other critics wrote to the comptroller to ask him to deny the data system contract on ethical grounds. “It is especially troubling that Wireless Generation will be tasked with creating a centralized database for personal student information,” the New York State United Teachers wrote in a letter, “even as its parent company, News Corporation, stands accused of engaging in illegal news gathering tactics, including the hacking of private voice mail accounts.” Wireless Generation said it was disappointed with the comptroller’s decision and was weighing whether to submit another bid. The State Education Department — which had been trying to move quickly with the project because it is part of a series of efforts being financed by a Race to the Top federal grant with a four-year timetable — accused the comptroller’s office of playing politics. “The comptroller has allowed political pressure to get in the way of vital technology that would help our students,” said Jonathan Burman, a spokesman for the department. “Our office will review all options to implement the kind of system our schools need to move forward.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 31, 2011 An article on Tuesday about the New York State comptrollerâs rejection of a deal with Wireless Generation, an education technology company that is a subsidiary of the News Corporation, misstated, in some copies, the month in which the contract was signed. It was June, not May.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/27/technology/apple-ends-its-tv-episode-rental-service.html?ref=newscorporation">Apple Ends Its TV Episode Rental Service<date>Published: August 26, 2011</date><text>Nearly a year after Apple persuaded the television networks to try out a television episode rental service through its iTunes store, it has quietly taken the service down. Customers, it seems, did not want to rent TV episodes through an online store. “iTunes customers have shown they overwhelmingly prefer buying TV shows,” an Apple spokesman said Friday, confirming the take-down. The slight retreat by Apple comes two days after Tim Cook was named the chief executive of Apple, replacing Steve Jobs, who was named chairman. And it comes at a time when the company is widely believed to have its industry-disrupting sights set on the television industry. The company has sold episodes of TV shows through iTunes for years for $1.99 to $2.99. The sales have been beneficial for Apple and for television networks, but have not had major effects on consumer behavior. The rental service, announced last fall, was an experiment of sorts to see if a lower price point and a short viewing window would entice consumers and encourage sales of the Apple TV product. But as Apple’s statement indicated, rentals did not take off. The News Corporation, which owns the Fox network, said in a statement that after studying the results of the experiment, “it became clear that content ownership is a more attractive long-term value proposition both for iTunes customers and for our business.” News Corp. said it was working with Apple to make TV shows available within iTunes in the Cloud, a new online service that makes content more portable by securely storing it online. In its statement Friday, Apple promoted the new service, saying that it lets users “enjoy their programming whenever and however they choose.” The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, also offered some shows for rent; the company did not respond to a request for comment Friday evening.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/world/europe/23hacking.html?ref=newscorporation">Editor in Hacking Case Kept Getting Payments, BBC Reports<date>Published: August 22, 2011</date><text>LONDON — The former News of the World editor Andy Coulson received hundreds of thousands of dollars in severance pay from his former employer after joining now-Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative Party as director of communications in 2007, according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report on Monday evening.Mr. Coulson was arrested last month in connection with investigations into phone hacking and payments to police officials under his editorship. Although he has denied any wrongdoing, his role at Mr. Cameron’s side from 2007 until he stepped down this year had become the topic of political intrigue and swirling rumors here since the scandal came to dominate headlines last month. In its report, the BBC said that the severance payments, part of an agreement that included company health care benefits and a car, were received in installments that continued after he joined the Conservative Party in July 2007. A person in the party, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the legal and political sensitivity of the topic, said on Monday that there was confusion in the party over the report. Although some had suspected such an arrangement, the details cited by the BBC were not known, the source said, citing conversations with senior officials. When Mr. Coulson was first hired, the person added, party officials had been uncomfortable over his high wages from the party itself — around $400,000 a year. Mr. Coulson was widely credited as being crucial to the strategy that saw Mr. Cameron elected prime minister last year, with the endorsement of The News of the World and other British newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. A spokesman for 10 Downing Street directed inquiries on the BBC report to the Conservative Party, which said via a spokeswoman that “senior party officials have no knowledge of Andy Coulson’s severance arrangements.” She declined to answer further questions. The revelations could well reignite controversies over whether Mr. Cameron ignored signs that one of his closest colleagues might have known about, or even endorsed, hacking, and Mr. Murdoch’s influence over Britain’s politicians. Mr. Coulson resigned from the weekly tabloid in January 2007 after the arrest and imprisonment of two people who worked for the newspaper, the private detective Glenn Mulcaire and the reporter who covered the royal family, Clive Goodman, for phone hacking. Mr. Cameron has insisted that he gave Mr. Coulson “a second chance” by bringing him to the heart of the Conservative Party and then to the heart of government despite the scandal. The payments that Mr. Coulson received after he stepped down as editor also raise questions, according to people familiar with continuing investigations into phone hacking at Mr. Murdoch’s companies, about the unusual practice of giving severance to senior staff over time rather than with a one-time payment. It raises, they said, potential issues about buying continued loyalty. The company has admitted that, until recently, it paid Mr. Mulcaire’s extensive legal fees long after he ceased to work for it, and in a letter submitted to Parliament last week it became known that Mr. Goodman had also been paid by the tabloid while in prison. Agreements with more junior News of the World staff, who lost their jobs when the tabloid was shuttered last month, will pay a lump sum, not installments, according to former employees. Although it is unclear who authorizes such arrangements, one former journalist said Mr. Murdoch had been involved. A spokeswoman for News International, a British unit of News Corporation, declined to answer questions. Tom Watson, a member of the opposition Labour Party and a leading figure in parliamentary investigations into the scandal, suggested Monday evening on Twitter that the severance payments to Mr. Coulson might be “an undeclared donation” from Mr. Murdoch’s company to the Conservative Party, and that he would refer the matter to Britain’s electoral commission.

He has not been charged, but was released and ordered to report back for further questioning on Sept. 29. He has been suspended from his job. The police would not identify the detective, but said he was assigned to Operation Weeting, which is looking into allegations of phone hacking at the now-defunct tabloid The News of the World and other newspapers. Leaking to the news media is technically a criminal offense. But such disclosures have long been common practice for some police officers who work frequently with the news media, and it is highly unusual for an officer to be arrested on suspicion of merely leaking information. A second investigation is looking at charges that some reporters and editors paid the police for information, but no officers have been arrested in that case. A person close to the investigation said it was likely that the Operation Weeting leaks at issue in Thursday’s arrest were recent ones, perhaps having to do with the disclosure of the names of people arrested so far on suspicion of phone hacking. The police typically do not name suspects until they have been formally charged, identifying them instead by gender and age. The arrest of the suspected leaker seems designed to send a signal that the leader of the investigation, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers, is angry about the disclosures and is determined to keep details of the investigation out of the public domain. “I made it very clear when I took on this investigation the need for operational and information security,” Commissioner Akers said in a statement. “It is hugely disappointing that this may not have been adhered to.” She added that the police department “takes the unauthorized disclosure of information extremely seriously and has acted swiftly in making this arrest.” A former Scotland Yard official with knowledge of the inquiry said it was both surprising and unusual that the first arrest of an officer was for reportedly leaking information to the news media about the phone hacking investigation rather than selling information to The News of the World. A separate Metropolitan Police inquiry is investigating e-mails that suggest police officers sold classified contact information about public figures, including members of the royal family, to reporters and editors at The News of the World. The police also said that a second man was arrested on Friday as part of Operation Weeting, bringing to 14 the number of people arrested so far on suspicion of phone hacking or illegally accessing voice mail messages. With the recent addition of 20 new officers, there are now 65 investigators working full time on the case. The man, 35, was named by Sky News as Dan Evans, a former reporter for The News of the World. The newspaper suspended Mr. Evans in the spring of 2010 after his name emerged as part of a civil suit brought against it by the interior designer Kelly Hoppen. Ms. Hoppen, the stepmother of the actress Sienna Miller, claimed that her phone had been hacked into. Ms. Hoppen’s case began with information seized by the police in 2006, when the first phone hacking case — involving Clive Goodman, the former royal reporter for The News of the World, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired by the paper — came to light. At the time, the police seized 12,000 pages of documentation from Mr. Mulcaire that included lists of cellphone numbers, PINs and names of people whose messages he might have illegally intercepted. Both Mr. Mulcaire and Mr. Goodman were convicted in 2007; each served several months in jail. But this arrest seems to stem from a more recent episode. If that is the case, it would contradict assertions at the time by the paper’s parent company, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, that after the arrests The News of the World cracked down, putting a stop to phone hacking. Until last winter, the company said that the hacking had been limited to one “rogue” reporter — Mr. Goodman. According to Sky, the detective arrested on Thursday is suspected of leaking information to the newspaper The Guardian, which has consistently revealed more details than its competitors about the hacking arrests. On its Web site, The Guardian said it would not comment on the allegations, merely saying, “We note the arrest.” The paper quoted a spokesperson as saying: “On the broader point raised by the arrest, journalists would no doubt be concerned if conversations between off-the-record sources and reporters came routinely to be regarded as criminal activity. In common with all news organizations we have no comment to make on the sources of our journalism.” News International, the British newspaper arm of the News Corporation, said it was cooperating with the investigation and would have no comment about the arrests. Don Van Natta Jr. contributed reporting from Miami.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/world/europe/17hacking.html?ref=newscorporation">Letter Counters Hacking Avowals From News Corp.<date>Published: August 16, 2011</date><text>LONDON — An influential parliamentary committee investigating phone hacking at Rupert Murdoch’s now-defunct tabloid, The News of the World, released a potentially damning four-year-old letter Tuesday claiming that hacking was routine and “widely discussed” at the paper, a direct contradiction of repeated assertions by the paper’s owners and editors that until recently they were unaware of the breadth of the problem.The letter, from Clive Goodman, a former News of the World royal correspondent who briefly went to jail in 2007 for intercepting voice mail messages of members of the royal household, is important because it challenges the claim by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation that until last December it believed that the hacking was limited to one “rogue” reporter — Mr. Goodman — and that it had conclusively investigated the matter. Mr. Goodman sent the letter, including the now-redacted names of others he said knew about the hacking, to the company after he was fired. The disclosure is a further embarrassment to Prime Minister David Cameron, who has already been ridiculed by his political rivals for his decision to hire a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his director of communications. Mr. Coulson resigned from the paper during the initial phone hacking imbroglio in 2007 and from his government job in the wake of new evidence early this year. He was arrested last month on suspicion of conspiracy in the phone hacking and of corruption in approving payments to the police for information. In his letter, Mr. Goodman said that phone hacking was regularly discussed in the paper’s daily news conference “until explicit reference to it was banned by the editor,” presumably meaning Mr. Coulson. Mr. Coulson has always claimed he knew nothing about phone hacking. Mr. Goodman sent the letter containing his accusations to a human resources official at News International and copied it to Les Hinton, then the executive chairman of News International. Mr. Hinton, a close associate of Mr. Murdoch who went on to become the chairman of Dow Jones after it was bought by the News Corporation, resigned from the company this summer after it became apparent that phone hacking at The News of the World had been endemic during his time at News International. He has always claimed he knew nothing about it. He told Parliament in 2007 that he believed the hacking was limited to Mr. Goodman and a hired investigator. The scandal has already swept through the upper echelons of Britain’s political, media and law enforcement worlds, resulting in a dozen arrests, the resignations of top officials from the News Corporation and the Metropolitan Police, the withdrawal of the News Corporation’s $12 billion takeover bid for the satellite company BskyB and the summary closing of the 168-year-old News of the World. None of those arrested in the case have yet been formally charged. The parliamentary panel, the Commons committee on culture, media and sport, said that in light of Mr. Goodman’s letter and other documents, it would re-call for further questioning at least four former employees of The News of the World. It also said it might re-call Mr. Coulson as well as Rupert Murdoch’s son James, who runs the News Corporation’s European and Asian operations. Both Murdochs appeared last month before the committee in a dramatic hearing punctuated by a bizarre episode in which a self-described comedian attacked the 80-year-old Rupert Murdoch with a plate of shaving cream, only to be slapped down by Mr. Murdoch’s wife, Wendi. Meanwhile, other letters written to the committee at its request in the last few weeks — including one from an outside law firm hired briefly to advise The News of the World in 2007, a second from a former editor at the paper and a third from a former lawyer for News International, the British newspaper arm of the News Corporation — all cast doubt on previous assertions by the Murdochs and other company officials. Particularly embarrassing is the letter from the law firm, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, which was hired by News International in 2007 in the wake of Mr. Goodman’s court case. The Murdochs and others have repeatedly said that they had relied on the firm to investigate whether the hacking was limited to Mr. Goodman and the investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, who was also jailed for hacking, and that the firm had assured them it was. But Harbottle &amp; Lewis said that was a mischaracterization. For one thing, it said, News International provided it with only a limited selection of e-mails in five electronic folders on the company server; the law firm was “not given free rein to look through whatever it wanted.” 1 2 Next Page » Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/business/media/comedy-podcast-inside-news-corp-feasts-on-a-scandal.html?ref=newscorporation">Comedy Podcast Inside News Corp. Feasts on a Scandal<date>Published: August 14, 2011</date><text>Sitting in a windowless London recording studio at the start of the phone hacking scandal that engulfed Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, Chris Skinner faced a dilemma.The Bugle, a news satire podcast, had just recorded a blistering show about the closing of The News of the World tabloid, and now he had to edit the less-than-kind audio that included riffs on the soullessness of those responsible and the opinion that the paper “would not be missed at all.” The Bugle is published by The Times of London, also owned by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation. “It was comedian’s gold, but an editor’s nightmare,” he remembered. As some Murdoch-owned media properties chose to minimize the unfolding scandal, Mr. Skinner and the pair of comedians behind the podcast, Andy Zaltzman and John Oliver, went straight for the jugular. The Bugle, among the most popular comedy podcasts in Britain with roughly 400,000 weekly downloads, spent three weeks hammering their corporate owners, News International, and Mr. Murdoch himself. Mr. Zaltzman compared the scene outside The Times of London’s recording studio in Wapping to war-ravaged Stalingrad and Nagasaki, described The Bugle “the last remaining pillar of Murdochia” and reveled in both the firing of Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, and the shaving cream pie that had struck Mr. Murdoch. For Mr. Zaltzman, 36, the decision to go hard on News International was a natural for the four-year-old weekly podcast that takes on the main news of the day with the least reverence possible. “It was a news story that we had to address — and address it funnily — and I think we succeeded,” he said in a phone interview. The show has recently found a surge of interest from the United States, owing in part to Mr. Oliver’s frequent appearances on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.” The number of downloads has nearly doubled in the last 18 months, according to rough statistics provided by Mr. Skinner, with much of the increase coming from American listeners. It is currently ranked among the top podcasts on iTunes. The Bugle began in October 2007 shortly after Mr. Oliver, 34, moved to New York. The two comedians, who had worked together onstage in Britain and whose comedy closely follows the news, were approached by The Times of London to do a satire podcast. “It took a while for us to find the best way to do it,” said Mr. Zaltzman. “But once it fell into the pattern it’s in, it’s stayed.” Each show is a combination of scripted material and ad libs and is recorded and published on Fridays, with Mr. Zaltzman and Mr. Skinner sitting in the London studio, and Mr. Oliver joining by phone from New York. The comedians write their jokes after briefly discussing the topics for the next program, but generally have not heard each other’s material until recording time. Spontaneous trans-Atlantic cackling is a large part of the appeal, for them and for the listener. “We try and make each other laugh while we’re recording it,” Mr. Zaltzman said. As with most popular online productions, the show has spawned legions of loyal fans — known as Buglers — who have developed their own profane insider gags — like sending Mr. Skinner e-mail and Twitter messages telling him off — and even a Wikipedia-style site devoted to cataloging the show. (The official Web site is behind the newspaper’s paywall.) The show follows a long tradition of British news satire from “That Was the Week That Was” in the early 1960s, to the 1990s radio show “On the Hour,” which Mr. Zaltzman said was among his inspirations. Pairing a comedian with a newspaper to make a podcast is a newer phenomenon, beginning most notably with Ricky Gervais and The Guardian in 2005. Mr. Zaltzman also comes from a podcasting family: his sister, Helen Zaltzman, appears on another popular British comedy show, “Answer Me This!” “What podcasting does is give acts who want to get into the mainstream media a platform to prove their talents,” said Richard Berry, a lecturer in radio at the University of Sunderland who has written about podcasting. “It can bring radio talent or writers the same opportunities that YouTube gives filmmakers.” It was the freedom to do what they wanted that drew Mr. Zaltzman and Mr. Oliver to making the show. “There’s not been any guidance or request from the Times Online hierarchy about what we can and can’t say,” Mr. Zaltzman said. With new hacking-scandal developments each week, the show appeared to push the boundary of that freedom, especially after a man hit Mr. Murdoch with a plate of shaving cream during a Parliamentary inquiry. “I’m not saying Rupert Murdoch’s face didn’t look better with a shaving cream pie in it,” Mr. Oliver said during one episode. “You just don’t want to find yourself with any misplaced sympathy for Rupert Murdoch.” The two then jokingly wondered on air whether anyone higher up at News International was listening. “Should this not have been stopped by now?” Mr. Oliver asked. “It doesn’t make sense!” “I can take up busking, John, it’s all right,” Mr. Zaltzman responded. But no one from the company has complained, Mr. Skinner and Mr. Zaltzman said, and the show goes on. After a break last week, the podcast returned on Friday to tackle the most recent devastating events from Britain: the London riots. They have had a front-row seat at that as well. “Last night was a very scary journey home,” said Mr. Skinner, 32, who lives in the Hackney neighborhood of London where rioters rampaged last Monday. Newsrooms in the late summer are generally quiet places. But this year, the big events have been coming steadily. “It’s a bit of a summer of rage in the U.K.,” Mr. Skinner said. “We seem to be bouncing from one story of anger into another.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/business/while-reporting-robust-profit-murdoch-vows-to-stay-head-of-news-corp.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch Vows to Stay Head of News Corp.<date>Published: August 10, 2011</date><text>While defending his company as it faces accusations of widespread phone hacking in Britain, Rupert Murdoch insisted on Wednesday that he had the backing of News Corporation’s board and would stay on as its chief executive for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, his company reported a drop in fourth-quarter profit but a gain for the year. Buoyed by strong advertising growth at its television division, particularly from the broadcast of Super Bowl XLV on Fox, News Corporation said its net income from April through June was $683 million, down from $875 million a year earlier. The otherwise strong results were sapped by a $254 million loss on Myspace, the social networking site, which the company sold for just $35 million in June, a small fraction of the $580 million it paid for the site six years ago. For the full fiscal year, which ended June 30, News Corporation earned $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion the year before. “We have the most robust balance sheet in our history,” Mr. Murdoch declared in a conference call with financial analysts and reporters that drew considerably more attention than usual because Mr. Murdoch had not spoken publicly since his testimony before the British Parliament last month. The earnings report — which showed growth across News Corporation’s vast holdings in film, television, publishing and satellite broadcasting — was a testament to the company’s size and diversity. Yet Mr. Murdoch spent much of his time on Wednesday answering for malfeasance in a small corner of his media empire: The News of the World, the Sunday tabloid he recently closed in Britain after widespread voice mail hacking by its employees was revealed. He pressed the point that none of the issues at The News of the World had affected the other parts of News Corporation. “There’s been no material impact on our operations outside the closure of News of the World,” he said. And he once again insisted that the acts were an aberration and not the kind of behavior that he or the company would ever condone. “We’re all committed to doing the right thing,” he said. “We have taken decisive actions to hold people accountable and will do whatever is necessary to prevent anything like this from occurring ever again.” As he tried to end speculation that he would be forced to give up his job, Mr. Murdoch also dismissed the suggestion that his son James was at risk of losing his job as a deputy chief operating officer. “Chase and I have full confidence in James,” he said, referring to Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer. “I think that’s all I need to say about it.” Mr. Murdoch blithely addressed questions about who would replace him, joking that Mr. Carey would succeed him should he meet an untimely demise. “I’m sure he’d get it immediately if I run under a bus,” Mr. Murdoch, 80, said. Analysts raised what has become a perennial issue for News Corporation: what would it do with its underperforming publishing division, which includes money-losing newspapers like The New York Post and The Times of London. After the hacking scandal erupted, word that News Corporation might spin off its newspapers spread on Wall Street. Mr. Murdoch rejected the notion outright. “No,” he said. “I’m feeling very confident.” Except for The News of the World, he added, referring to the newspapers, “Everything else is fine.” Cable television remained an especially powerful engine of growth for the company, accounting for $631 million of its operating income for the quarter and $2.8 billion in operating income for the year — more than its 20th Century Fox Films, the Fox Network and satellite broadcasting divisions combined. Advertising at its domestic cable channels, which include Fox News, FX and the National Geographic Channel, grew 23 percent over the fourth quarter last year. Operating income at the film division was helped by strong performers like the computer-animated “Rio,” and grew by 53 percent, to $210 million. But for the year, operating income in film was down 31 percent to $927 million, largely because of the success in 2010 of “Avatar,” which made for difficult comparisons.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/business/media/for-murdoch-a-board-meeting-with-friendly-faces.html?ref=newscorporation">For Murdoch, a Board Meeting With Friendly Faces<date>Published: August 9, 2011</date><text>When Rupert Murdoch sat down with his board on Tuesday for the first time since a phone hacking scandal overseas plunged his company into turmoil, he was surrounded by a lot of familiar, friendly faces.The meeting, held on the studio lot of 20th Century Fox and timed to coincide with News Corporation’s quarterly earnings announcement on Wednesday, included many people with deep and longstanding ties to Mr. Murdoch, his company and his family. One is a former Goldman Sachs president who helped News Corporation broker mega-deals. Another is godfather to one of Mr. Murdoch’s grandchildren. Another ran Mr. Murdoch’s Australian subsidiary, News Limited. And those are just some of News Corporation’s directors who are designated as independent — chosen because they comply with regulations intended to ensure that companies maintain a layer of objective oversight. A perceived absence of true independence has long been a sore spot for those who criticize the News Corporation board as too deferential to Mr. Murdoch. Last week, in a rare attempt to mollify shareholders, News Corporation decided not to add Mr. Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth to the board. It was widely expected she would join the board after the company bought Shine, her television production company, for about $675 million earlier this year. News Corporation considers nine of its 16 directors independent, in keeping with Nasdaq rules requiring a majority of board members with limited company ties. Yet many of them owe their careers to Mr. Murdoch. Others made millions of dollars making him richer. Those include: ¶Roderick Eddington, the former chief executive of British Airways, who became deputy chairman of News Limited in 1997, a year after he was chosen to run Ansett Australia, the airline in which News Corporation owned a 50 percent stake. ¶Natalie Bancroft , the opera singer whose family agreed to sell Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal to Mr. Murdoch in 2007, and who made a sizable fortune of her own from News Corporation’s $5 billion purchase. ¶Kenneth E. Cowley, who was chief executive and chairman of News Limited for nearly 20 years in the 1980s and 1990s. ¶Andrew Knight, who was executive chairman of News International from 1990 to 1994. ¶John L. Thornton, the former Goldman Sachs president, who advised News Corporation in a number of major deals. ¶Viet Dinh, a former senior official in George W. Bush’s Justice Department and the principal author of the Patriot Act. Mr. Dinh is also godfather to a son of Lachlan Murdoch, the oldest of Mr. Murdoch’s children. Mr. Dinh is ultimately responsible for the independent internal investigation going on into the phone hacking scandal at News Corporation’s British subsidiary, News International. Mr. Dinh has brought on some of the biggest names in white-collar criminal defense to advise him and the other independent directors on the matter, hiring Mary Jo White, the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey. News Corporation’s board is hardly the only one in corporate America that is stacked with independent directors who have close relationships with the companies that shareholders have elected them to serve. But corporate governance experts said that the long history between News Corporation and many of its independent directors is a glaring example of how chumminess in the boardroom can allow and even contribute to mismanagement. “I keep watching this and thinking that they don’t realize we can see them,” said Lucy P. Marcus, chief executive of Marcus Venture Consulting who writes about corporate governance issues for The Harvard Business Review blog network. “The reason we have corporate governance is not because it’s a nice thing to do. It’s because if you actually have a robust board, it can be beneficial. I don’t think News Corp. would be in the same trouble that they are in now if they had an independent board.” To overhaul the News Corporation board or any other corporate board, the rules governing who is eligible to serve as a director would need to change. Right now News Corporation is in full compliance of the rules set by Nasdaq, the exchange on which its stock is traded, and federal law. Nasdaq’s rules state broadly that independent directors cannot have a relationship that “would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.” Specifically, Nasdaq excludes anyone who was employed the company in the previous three years. The rules do allow, however, for former employees collecting retirement benefits to serve as independent directors. Some News Corporation shareholders have already started to press the issue. Wespath Investment Management, a division of the board of pension and health benefits for the United Methodist Church and owner of about 1.1 million News Corporation Class A shares, wrote to the board last week objecting to, among other things, its seeming lack of independence. “As shareholders interested in preserving the long-term value of the company, it is important that the board of directors act quickly to improve its governance standards,” the letter said.

As it turns out, a News Corporation division has twice come under significant civil and criminal investigations in the United States, but neither inquiry went anywhere. Given what has happened in Britain with the growing phone-hacking scandal, it is worth wondering why. Both cases involve News America Marketing, an obscure but lucrative division of the News Corporation that is a big player in the business of retail marketing, including newspaper coupon inserts and in-store promotions. The company has come under scrutiny for a pattern of conduct that includes below-cost pricing, paying customers not to do business with competitors and accusations of computer hacking. News America Marketing came to control 90 percent of the in-store advertising business, according to Fortune, aided in part by a particularly quick and favorable antitrust decision made by the Justice Department in 1997. That year, the News Corporation announced it wanted to buy Heritage Media, a big competitor, for about $754 million in stock plus $600 million in assumed debt. The News Corporation said it would sell the broadcast properties and hang onto the marketing division, which serviced 40,000 groceries and other retailers. The deal would make News America Marketing the dominant player in the business and, for that reason, the San Francisco field office of the Justice Department recommended to Washington that the News Corporation’s takeover bid be challenged on antitrust grounds. Typically, such a request from a field office would carry great weight in Washington and, at a minimum, delay the deal for months. But the Justice Department brass overrode San Francisco’s objections and gave its blessing in just two weeks. So who ran the antitrust division at the Justice Department at the time? Joel Klein, who this year became an executive vice president at the News Corporation, head of its education division and a close adviser to Rupert Murdoch on the phone-hacking scandal in Britain. It’s worth noting that less than a year later, the Justice Department division led by Mr. Klein blocked the News Corporation from selling its share of a satellite company to PrimeStar, owned by a group of cable providers, on antitrust grounds, so any suggestion that a department of the United States government was snugly in the hip pocket of Mr. Murdoch would not be correct. None of this suggests that Mr. Klein cut some sort of a deal that resulted in a job 14 years later. But the speed of the antitrust decision surprised even the people involved in the takeover. One of the participants, who declined to be identified discussing private negotiations, said he thought the sale was effectively blocked before the surprising turnaround. “After that meeting with the San Francisco office, we all looked at each other and said, ‘This deal is not going to happen,’ ” he said. My colleague Eric Lipton and I spent a few days trying to tease apart who made the actual decision to give the purchase the go-ahead — “It was as if a magic button had been pushed somewhere. We were all in shock,” said one of the same participants in the deal — but there is no paper trail. People who worked at the Justice Department back then either could not recollect how the decision was made or declined to share information if they knew. A spokeswoman for the News Corporation released this statement: “Joel didn’t know Mr. Murdoch at the time of the Heritage Media transaction 14 years ago. A year later, the D.O.J. under his leadership challenged the PrimeStar transaction in which News Corporation had a major interest. Any suggested inference is ludicrous.” A lawyer who worked in the Justice Department in Washington at the time but did not want to be identified discussing internal matters, said: “This decision was made on the merits. The front office in Washington didn’t think a case could be won in court based on the very narrow definition of the market.” But in retrospect, the anticompetitive fears of the San Francisco office were well founded. After the Heritage Media deal, News America Marketing was in a position to throw its weight around and it did just that, drawing a variety of lawsuits in which competitors claimed they had been threatened and harassed. The News Corporation has settled those cases at a cost of over $650 million, and now the F.B.I. is looking into whether there was a pattern of illicit tactics by that division of the News Corporation. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter.com/carr2n</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-great-fleet-street-novel-evelyn-waughs-scoop.html?ref=newscorporation">The Great Fleet Street Novel - Evelyn Waugh's ‘Scoop’<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>“If you’d gone to a publisher in 1981 with a proposal for a science-fiction novel that consisted of a really clear and simple description of the world today,” William Gibson told The Paris Review recently, “they’d have read your proposal and said: ‘Well, it’s impossible. This is ridiculous.’ ” You’d have gotten a similar reaction if you’d gone to a publisher earlier this year with a proposal for a novel that went something like this: journalists on a British tabloid hack into and delete the voice mail messages of a missing (murdered, it turns out) teenage girl. Their activities are exposed by a rival outfit, to widespread public outrage. The paper in question is shut down by its owner, despite having a circulation of millions. Senior policemen, who hired former journalists from the paper as press officers, resign. Evidence emerges of illegal payments from the paper to corrupt police in exchange for information about celebrities, politicians and crime victims. Several journalists are arrested, including two former editors of the paper, one of whom had worked for the prime minister. A whistle-blower is found dead (though police say it isn’t suspicious). The paper’s owner, mogul of an international media empire, is summoned to testify before Parliament. And the allegations of wrongdoing just keep coming.The scandal that started at The News of the World and is now threatening to spread to the rest of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire and beyond, appears, on the face of it, to have more in common with a British remake of “24” than with “Scoop,” Evelyn Waugh’s 1938 “Novel about Journalists,” still widely acknowledged as the unrivaled masterpiece of Fleet Street satire. Its plot turns not on criminal wrongdoing but on a classically farcical case of mistaken identity. Instead of sending John Courteney Boot, fashionable novelist and travel writer, to cover “a very promising little war” in the East African republic of Ishmaelia, The Daily Beast dispatches William Boot, the mild-mannered and absent-minded author of the paper’s “biweekly half-column devoted to nature.” His complete lack of journalistic experience comes in handy when, instead of charging up a false trail with the rest of the international press corps, he stays behind in the Ishmaelian capital, Jacksonburg, and scoops the lot of them. The journalists’ herd mentality and disregard for anything so tedious as “the truth” is partly what Christopher Hitchens had in mind when, in his introduction to the 2000 Penguin Classics edition, he called it (and he should know) “a novel of pitiless realism; the mirror of satire held up to catch the Caliban of the press corps, as no other narrative has ever done save Hecht and MacArthur’s ‘Front Page’ and, to a smaller extent, Michael Frayn’s ‘Towards the End of the Morning.’ ” Frayn’s novel, published in 1967, the year before Murdoch bought The News of the World, can be seen as foreshadowing the transformation of the British press that Murdoch brought about. It’s based on Frayn’s experiences at The Guardian and The Observer, left-of-center broadsheets as far from The News of the World as British newspapers can be. The manageable chaos of a quiet corner of an unnamed paper where the “nature notes” (shades of William Boot), obituaries and crossword puzzles are put together is disturbed by the arrival of a terrifyingly efficient young man. “You really see yourself working on a paper for the rest of your life?” another character asks him. “I see myself owning one,” he replies. The transformation was more fully registered in Martin Amis’s “Yellow Dog” (2003), whose psychotic tabloid journalist, Clint Smoker, makes almost any other fictional Fleet Street Caliban look like Ariel. Smoker, “a very fine journalist indeed,” works for The Morning Lark, where the staffers refer to readers with an unprintable epithet and “no global cataclysm had yet had the power to push the pinup off the front page.” He is racist, misogynist, hideously ugly and fixated on his tiny penis. He concocts stories by setting up liaisons between soccer players and models. “You might think that the contempt shown by the reporters for both their subjects and their readers is overdone,” Hitchens has written of his friend Amis’s novel, “but you would be wrong.” No doubt. But Amis’s chthonic hatred for the functionaries of the gutter press is so overwhelming that he misses a trick: Smoker’s depravity stands in murky isolation from the rest of society. 1 2 Next Page » Thomas Jones is a contributing editor at The London Review of Books.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/06/business/james-murdoch-misses-an-opportunity.html?ref=newscorporation">James Murdoch Misses an Opportunity - Common Sense<date>Published: August 5, 2011</date><text>When the News Corporation announced it would stop paying the legal fees for Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator at the center of Britain’s tabloid phone hacking scandal, the consequences were swift. Mr. Mulcaire could obviously shed light on who at the News Corporation knew about the phone hacking and efforts to conceal it.After four years of silence, and just hours after the News Corporation said it would stop paying, he stepped before television cameras outside his home to say, “I have no further comment to make at this stage.” He added, “This may change.” Mr. Mulcaire is said to employ a lawyer full time as well as several more part time, an arrangement he surely can’t afford for long on a private investigator’s income. In Parliament, the Labour member Paul Farrelly asked James Murdoch, who heads the company’s international operations, if he understood why people might interpret paying those legal fees as an effort to buy the private investigator’s cooperation or silence. Mr. Murdoch murmured his agreement, saying his lawyers had told him “it’s important and customary” to pay such fees. “I’ve asked for those things to cease.” After the company cut Mr. Mulcaire loose, two former executives came forward to accuse Mr. Murdoch of being “mistaken” in his testimony to Parliament about his knowledge of phone hacking. Now Mr. Murdoch is under investigation for potentially misleading Parliament. As Mr. Farrelly put it, “It now seems to be everyone for themselves. The edifice is cracking. They’re all fighting like rats in a sack.” However controversial in Britain, the practice of companies’ paying their officers and employees’ legal expenses in criminal investigations is not only routine in America but has been elevated by some to the status of a constitutional right. A little-discussed but open secret among defense lawyers and prosecutors alike is that who pays the legal fees often decides the outcome of an investigation. As John C. Coffee Jr., Berle professor of law at Columbia, told me: “Someone whose legal fees are not paid may have a strong and urgent need to cooperate with the government. The employee, if he can’t afford to defend himself, has to cut a deal, and he might, shall we say, color his testimony. Who’s going to get the benefit of that, the company or the government? Lawyers know very well how to coach witnesses on what to say without telling them to lie.” Confronted in the 1990s with an unprecedented wave of white-collar crime at major corporations like Enron and WorldCom, Justice Department prosecutors grew exasperated with companies that made public pledges to cooperate with investigators only to unleash a phalanx of defense lawyers bent on anything but. In 2003, when he was chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division, Larry Thompson wrote that a factor in whether a company, as opposed to individuals, would be charged with a crime would be the extent of its cooperation, one measure of which “is whether the corporation appears to be protecting its culpable employees and agents,” among other things, “through the advancing of attorneys fees.” Mr. Thompson might well have added lavish severance packages and other forms of hush money to the list. In 2005, the accounting firm KPMG admitted to creating fraudulent tax shelters that enabled wealthy clients to evade $2.5 billion in federal taxes, and six former partners, including the firm’s former deputy chairman, were indicted. KPMG, as it had in the past, paid their legal bills. All pleaded not guilty and declined to cooperate with the government. As an accounting firm dependent on public trust, KPMG recognized that its survival depended on the firm’s escaping criminal charges. At a meeting with prosecutors, the firm’s lawyer, Robert Bennett, emphasized that KPMG “had decided to change course and cooperate fully.” The prosecutors zeroed in on the issue of legal fees, with one saying that “misconduct should not be rewarded” and another warning that with respect to legal fees, “we’ll look at that under a microscope,” according to notes taken at the meeting. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/monday-motorsports-back-to-back-mclaren-victories-put-red-bull-on-the-defensive/?ref=newscorporation">Monday Motorsports: Back-to-Back McLaren Victories Put Red Bull on the Defensive<date>August 1, 2011, 11:08 am</date><text>Srdjan Suki/European Pressphoto AgencyJenson Button celebrating his victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel may have finished first in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday, but as heavily favored teams in the National Football League can slip on any given Sunday, so, too, can dominant Formula One drivers, especially in the wet. Vettel, his fellow competitors and their respective pit crews confronted a Hungaroring on Sunday that began wet, dried out, got soaked and finished merely damp, rendering much of Sunday’s action a tactical game of tire choices. Jenson Button won the chess match, delivering crucial team points to McLaren-Mercedes and, combined with Lewis Hamilton’s victory on July 24 at the Nürburgring, securing the team’s first back-to-back victories of 2011. Vettel, the Red Bull driver and overall leader in the series, started off the line cleanly, but surrendered his lead to Hamilton on lap No. 5 after a spirited duel on the slick surface. But the more intriguing standoff came on the 47th lap, as the teammates Hamilton and Button freely challenged each other for the lead without any interference from the team’s strategists. It was a rare sight, as Brad Spurgeon at the Formula One blog noted: On lap No. 47, Button passed Hamilton for the lead after Hamilton spun in the middle of the track. On lap No. 50, both Vettel and Button slid off the track and Hamilton took the lead again. Then the two McLaren drivers began to attack each other again as at the beginning of the race in a fratricidal duel of the kind racing fans love and rarely get to see thanks to the high stakes of team points. Button said the team gave no team orders over the radio, preferring to leave them to race and concentrate. Ultimately, Button prevailed, with Hamilton losing position to Vettel, followed by Fernando Alonso, the Ferrari driver. Hamilton finished fourth. Red Bull maintains a significant advantage over McLaren-Mercedes in the points, 383 to 280, but with eight races left on the calendar, at least Button says he believes a Red Bull victory is not a foregone conclusion. “They should be worried,” he said after his victory Sunday. The victory also coincided with the 200th Formula One grand prix of Button’s career. In other motorsports news: • After 167 career starts in Sprint Cup, Paul Menard won his first race in the Nascar series Sunday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It was the first time that a Sprint Cup driver won his first race at the Brickyard. Menard, who had managed fuel optimally in the closing laps of the Brickyard 400, held off a charge by Jeff Gordon on the final lap to claim the victory. He moved into 14th place over all, 129 points behind Carl Edwards, the series leader, with 682 points. • The Citroën driver Sebastien Loeb increased his lead in the overall World Rally Championship Saturday with a win at the Neste Oil rally in Finland. Loeb maintained a 10-second cushion over the field on Saturday, the final day of competition, as Loeb, a Frenchman, became the first non-Scandinavian driver to win the rally twice; he first prevailed there in 2008. The two entries fielded by Mini, making a return to WRC competition after a decades-long absence, failed to finish. • The International Motorcycle Federation restated its commitment to holding the Japanese MotoGP race at Twin Ring Motegi on Oct. 2, despite the refusals of top riders to compete. The race, which was scheduled originally for April 24, was postponed after the March earthquake and subsequent nuclear emergency. Fearing radiation exposure, Jorge Lorenzo, the 2010 MotoGP champion, and Casey Stoner, the 2011 season leader, have refused to compete at the track, despite a preliminary report finding radiation levels to be negligible in the vicinity of the circuit. • Though they historically have been broadcast on free television channels, only half of the scheduled Formula One races in 2012 will be aired by the BBC, while every race will be viewable on BSkyB, a premium network. The News Corporation held a 39 percent stake in BSkyB, but abandoned its plan to take over the network following a scandal over phone hacking by a tabloid newspaper published by the company. Financial details of the arrangement with the BBC were not disclosed.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/gauging-impact-of-a-scandal/?ref=newscorporation">Gauging Impact of a Scandal<date>July 31, 2011, 9:35 pm</date><text>How worried is The Wall Street Journal that it could be tainted by the scandal roiling Rupert Murdoch’s British newspapers? Worried enough that it is asking its readers point-blank: What impact, if any, do the illegal acts by News of the World journalists have on their impression of The Wall Street Journal? Subscribers to The Journal are being given that and other questions in a survey that tries to gauge whether News Corporation’s problems in Britain have become a serious issue in the United States. Mr. Murdoch’s stewardship of the paper is also put to the test. The questionnaire asks readers to weigh in on whether they feel the paper has improved since he bought it in 2008. The survey, which some subscribers received last week, starts out benignly with a simple yes-or-no question: “Have you heard or seen anything in the news or elsewhere over the past few weeks about News Corp. or News of the World, a U.K.-based tabloid?” It continues: “Have you seen or heard anything in the news or elsewhere recently about Rupert Murdoch, C.E.O. of News Corp.?” Then readers are asked whether they are aware that Mr. Murdoch is also chairman of Dow Jones, the publisher of The Journal. They are also asked whether the chief executive of a company should be held responsible “for all the actions of all its employees, no matter how large the corporation is.” Respondents are asked to give their answer on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning they “disagree completely” and 10 meaning they “agree completely.” The survey concludes with two questions about the paper since Mr. Murdoch’s purchase. The first asks whether the changes in content have improved The Journal. The second asks whether the expansion in the number of topics covered by the paper has increased its value. Two respondents will be picked at random for their choice of a prize: a digital camera, an iPod Touch or a Kindle e-reader.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/world/europe/29hacking.html?ref=newscorporation">British Judge Outlines Hacking Investigation<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Britain was awash in a new surge of outrage over the phone hacking scandal on Thursday as news emerged that Scotland Yard had added to the list of probable victims a woman whose 8-year-old daughter was murdered by a repeat sex offender in 2000.The tabloid at the center of the scandal, The News of the World, aggressively championed the campaign of the grieving mother, Sara Payne, for a law warning parents if child sex offenders lived nearby. Mrs. Payne had written warmly of the paper in its final issue, calling it “an old friend.”  A statement released on behalf of Mrs. Payne by  the Phoenix Foundation, a children’s charity she founded,  described her as devastated and disappointed. “Today is a very sad dark day for us,” the charity added in a posting on Facebook. “Our faith in good people has taken a real battering.” Other postings noted that she was struggling in light of the  July 1 anniversary of her daughter’s abduction and from the effects of a stroke she suffered 19 months ago, which paralyzed her left side. The Guardian was the first to report Scotland Yard’s alert to Mrs. Payne, but the e-mail newsletter Popbitch suggested earlier this month that Mrs. Payne’s voice mail had been hacked and that the phone in question might have been provided to her by Rebekah Brooks, then the editor of The News of the World. In a statement, Ms. Brooks confirmed that The News of the World had provided Mrs. Payne with a cellphone “for the last 11 years” as part of the campaign for the law, but said that “it was not a personal gift.” She said that she found the allegations that Mrs. Payne’s voice mail had been hacked “abhorrent and particularly upsetting, as Sara Payne is a dear friend.” In recent testimony on the scandal in Parliament, Ms. Brooks cited the measure named after Mrs. Payne’s daughter, Sarah’s Law, as evidence of the good she had done in her years at the tabloid’s helm. Ms. Brooks was The News of the World’s editor during periods when hacking appeared to have been widespread, but has maintained she knew nothing of it. She stepped down July 15 from her executive role at News International, the British arm of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and the owner of The News of the World, and was later arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and payments to the police. The company issued a brief statement on Thursday that said:  “News International takes this matter very seriously and is deeply concerned like everyone. As the facts are established, the Company and the independent Management and Standards Committee will take all appropriate actions, including cooperating fully with any potential criminal enquiries or civil proceedings which may arise.” Scotland Yard officers told Mrs. Payne that details about her were among the papers held by the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, according to the Phoenix Foundation statement. Mr. Mulcaire, who had an exclusive contract with the tabloid, had a list of about 4,000 potential targets and was convicted on hacking charges related to the paper five years ago. The hacking scandal had been smoldering for years, but ignited in recent weeks after assertions that hacking on behalf of The News of the World had interfered with the investigation into the 2002 murder of a 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler. The man eventually convicted of her killing committed two more murders before he was caught. More revelations appear imminent. Members of Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee said Thursday that they would gather this week to discuss whether to call further witnesses in their inquiries into the scandal and an alleged cover-up by News International. On Aug. 8, previously unseen documents relating to hacking from News International as well as a portion of Mr. Mulcaire’s documents held by the police will be released to those who have filed lawsuits. On Aug. 10, the News Corporation — which has been bolstering its stock price with buybacks — will announce its quarterly results. In central London on Thursday, the British judge leading the inquiry into the scandal held a news conference, saying that the panel planned to hold its first public hearings in September and that it would have the power to compel witnesses to testify. An initial phase will focus on press regulation and the relationship between the press and the public, said the judge, Lord Justice Leveson. A second, which will begin after the current police investigation is finished, will focus on specific allegations of phone hacking and other journalistic malfeasance. Justice Leveson was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron after it became clear that hacking at The News of the World extended not only to public figures like celebrities and politicians, but also to Milly Dowler and possibly to the families of those killed in terrorist attacks. Mr. Cameron, a Conservative, initially resisted setting up an immediate inquiry, but changed his mind in response to widespread public disgust and growing political pressure from the opposition Labour Party. One of the issues the judge will consider is the coziness of the ties between politicians and the news media — particularly the relationship between lawmakers and editors and executives at News International. In another sign of how far in British public life News International’s influence extends — or has extended, until now — it emerged last week that Justice Leveson himself attended two parties last year at the home of Elisabeth Murdoch, a daughter of Mr. Murdoch’s, and her husband, Matthew Freud, a powerful public relations executive. Justice Leveson said that because he and the rest of the inquiry panel — which includes former journalists and a former high-ranking police officer, among others — had been chosen for their experience, it was inevitable that “there are such contacts or links, and there should be no apology for this.” He added: “Had I had the slightest doubt about my own position, I would not have accepted the appointment, and I also make it clear that I am satisfied that what the panelists have said creates no conflict of interest for them or me.” In another development that might spell trouble for News International, Tim Godwin, the temporary chief of Scotland Yard, told a committee of lawmakers at City Hall that a new inquiry would most likely be opened into the 1987 ax murder of a private investigator. The case has become newly relevant in light of revelations that Scotland Yard told Ms. Brooks in 2003 that it had evidence that one of her editors at The News of the World had hired people to conduct surveillance of the lead investigating police officer in the case. She was told that there was evidence that the surveillance was ordered as a favor to the chief suspects, Jonathan Rees and Sidney Fillary, investigators who had worked for the tabloid. Efforts to bring them to trial have fallen apart repeatedly.

Murdoch won the backing of British Sky Broadcasting’s board on Thursday to retain his role as chairman. 7:51 p.m. | Updated LONDON — British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company partly owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, said on Friday that it would buy back some of its own shares and increase its dividend to compensate investors. BSkyB, as the company is also known, said it planned a share buyback worth £750 million, or $1.2 billion, and would return another £253 million to shareholders through a final dividend of 14.54 pence a share. BSkyB’s shares have fallen more than 15 percent since the News Corporation dropped its bid earlier this month for the 61 percent of BSkyB it did not own because of political opposition after the growing phone hacking scandal at one of the company’s British tabloid newspapers. The News Corporation plans to participate in the share buyback, meaning its 39 percent stake in BSkyB will not increase. BSkyB also said its board unanimously voted in favor of keeping James R. Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch’s son and a senior executive at the News Corporation, in his job as chairman of BSkyB’s board. It was the board’s first meeting since the News Corporation was forced to abandon its BSkyB bid. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “It was obviously a very full discussion,” BSkyB’s chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said in a conference call. “At the end of that, the board was unanimous in its support for James to continue as chairman.” Pressure on James Murdoch and BSkyB’s board to replace him had mounted ever since new allegations emerged about phone hacking at the British tabloid The News of the World, which fell under James Murdoch’s purview at the News Corporation. Mr. Darroch told the BBC in an interview on Friday that James Murdoch “got strong support” at BSkyB. He added that judging by his work at BSkyB, “he always acted with the highest degree of integrity.” But some shareholders, including large British pension funds, have criticized BSkyB’s choice of chairmen in the past, saying they would prefer a chairman who was not directly linked to the company’s largest shareholder, the News Corporation. There were signs that the phone hacking scandal also hurt other parts of the Murdoch media empire beyond The News of the World, which was closed. The Times of London lost some subscribers in the immediate aftermath of the phone hacking scandal, James Harding, editor of the newspaper told the BBC on Wednesday. “We saw small numbers of people canceled their digital subscription or print subscription,” Mr. Harding said. “Those have largely come back.” BSkyB, which owns several satellite channels, said Friday that operating profit for the full year that ended in June rose 23 percent, to £1.07 billion ($2.8 billion) from £872 million a year earlier. That beat the average £1.06 billion in profit forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. BSkyB’s shares slipped 0.6 percent in London on Friday. “Recent hysteria may have affected the share price,” Richard Hunter at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London wrote in a note to clients. “But the underlying business remains defiantly strong.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/world/europe/29bskyb.html?ref=newscorporation">BSkyB Board Is Said to Keep James Murdoch as Chairman<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>LONDON — James Murdoch won unanimous backing from British Sky Broadcasting’s board on Thursday for his role as chairman despite the phone hacking scandal that has roiled the News Corporation, his family’s media empire.The board of British Sky Broadcasting, a satellite television company known as BSkyB, discussed Mr. Murdoch’s role “at length” and decided he should keep the job, said a person with direct knowledge of the decision. The board planned to closely monitor developments linked to the phone hacking scandal, said the person, who declined to be identified because the meeting was private. It was the first time BSkyB’s 14-member board had met since a public and political outcry over phone hacking at The News of the World, the now shuttered tabloid, forced the News Corporation, the global media company controlled by Mr. Murdoch’s father, Rupert Murdoch, to withdraw its offer for the rest of BSkyB. The News Corporation owns a 39 percent stake in BSkyB. The board meeting had been initially scheduled to discuss BSkyB’s annual earnings, which are to be released on Friday, but the phone hacking scandal had obliged it to also address the question of whether James Murdoch should stay on as chairman. James and Rupert Murdoch faced angry questions from British lawmakers this month about how much they knew about phone hacking practices at The News of the World. Keeping James Murdoch on the board of BSkyB, one of the best-performing and most important parts of the News Corporation’s British business, is essential to the Murdoch family’s media empire, some analysts said. James Murdoch runs the News Corporation’s European operations, which include the BSkyB stake and News International, the newspaper group that published The News of the World. He is also the News Corporation’s deputy chief operating officer. Pressure on James Murdoch intensified last week when two former News International executives contradicted testimony he had given to a parliamentary committee. The executives said that in 2008 they had made Mr. Murdoch aware of evidence that suggested phone hacking at The News of the World was more widespread. Mr. Murdoch denied he had ever been told that underlying evidence in the case implicated more than one reporter at the tabloid. James Murdoch became chairman of BSkyB’s board, which also includes three other members who are on the News Corporation’s payroll, at the end of 2007, amid opposition from some institutional investors and pension funds. Some shareholders criticized the election process and said they would have preferred a chairman who was not linked to BSkyB’s biggest shareholder. Lorna Tilbian, an analyst at Numis Securities in London, said James Murdoch’s support among BSkyB’s board members did not come as a surprise. “He’s done a good job as BSkyB’s chairman, and it’s innocent until proven guilty,” Ms. Tilbian said. The phone hacking scandal might affect BSkyB in other ways. Ofcom, the British broadcasting regulator, is proceeding with inquiries into whether BSkyB remains “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license because of the hacking scandal still unfolding at the News Corporation. The scandal took a toll on BSkyB’s share price because some investors were concerned that new investigations into phone hacking and bribery allegations could distract management. BSkyB’s shares slumped 16 percent from their peak this month. The shares remained unchanged at 7.2 pounds in London on Thursday. BSkyB’s board also discussed whether  to either  pay a special dividend or buy back its own shares to compensate BSkyB shareholders, which includes the News Corporation, for the recent drop in the share price.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/brooks-boasted-of-papers-campaign-in-murdered-girls-memory/?ref=newscorporation">Brooks Boasted of Paper's Campaign in Murdered Girl's Memory<date>July 28, 2011, 4:46 pm</date><text>Stefan Rousseau/Press Association, via Associated PressRebekah Brooks, left, in 2002 with Sara Payne,  the mother of an 8-year-old girl who was murdered by a pedophile in 2000. Updated | Friday | 11:31 a.m. As my colleagues Sarah Lyall and Ravi Somaiya report, British police officials investigating the hacking of phones by News of the World journalists “have added to the list of probable victims a woman whose 8-year-old daughter was murdered by a repeat sex offender in 2000.” The woman, Sara Payne, is known in Britain for a successful campaign she led to change British law following the death of her daughter, Sarah. Under the terms of the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme, parents are allowed to ask the police if a known sex offender lives nearby.  After a trial period, the law was implemented across England and Wales last year. Mrs. Payne fought for the law, which became known as Sarah’s Law in memory of the murdered girl. Her killer lived within five miles of the Paynes and was on Britain’s sex offender registry, and Ms. Payne was convinced that her daughter’s death could have been prevented had she known his history. Rebekah Brooks, who was the editor of The News of the World at the time, threw her newspaper’s support behind the campaign; the tabloid even provided Mrs. Payne with a cellphone to help her with the campaign. According to Nick Davies and Amelia Hill of The Guardian, who first reported on Thursday that the London police told Mrs. Payne that she might have been targeted, “Friends of Payne have told the Guardian that she is ‘absolutely devastated and deeply disappointed’ at the disclosure.” In a tribute to The News of the World published in the newspaper’s final edition, Mrs. Payne wrote that she regarded the staff members as “very good and trusted friends.” She added: It is easy to forget in these dark times that The News of the World has often been a force for good and that has more than anything to do with the people that work on it. And it’s these people I have come to respect and it is for these people I write this piece. I do not pretend that they are perfect or always got it right but I can tell you on a personal level there have been many times when they have stayed close and stood beside me — not for the headline or public credit but just because it was the right thing to do. In response to the news that Mrs. Payne’s voice mail might have been hacked into by Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who worked for The News of the World, Ms. Brooks said in a statement on Thursday: For the benefit of the campaign for Sarah’s Law, The News of the World has provided Sara with a mobile telephone for the last 11 years. It was not a personal gift. The idea that anyone on the newspaper knew that Sara or the campaign team were targeted by Mr. Mulcaire is unthinkable. The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension. It is imperative for Sara and the other victims of crime that these allegations are investigated and those culpable brought to justice. Throughout the hacking scandal, Ms. Brooks — who recently resigned as the chief executive of News International, the British newspaper division of the News Corporation, owner of The News of the World — has denied ever knowing that illegally intercepted voice mail was used as a source of information by News of the World journalists. She has also repeatedly referred to her role in helping to publicize the Sarah’s Law campaign. Earlier this month, after The Guardian reported that the voice mail of a murdered 13-year-old girl had been hacked into and deleted in 2002 by reporters working for Ms. Brooks, she wrote in a letter to employees: I hope that you all realize it is inconceivable that I knew, or worse, sanctioned these appalling allegations. I am proud of the many successful newspaper campaigns at The Sun and The News of the World under my editorship. In particular, the 10-year fight for Sarah’s Law is especially personal to me. The battle for better protection of children from pedophiles and better rights for the families and the victims of these crimes defined my editorships. The News of the World campaign for Sarah’s Law began in 2000, the year Ms. Brooks became the tabloid’s editor and the paper set out to ”name and shame” sex offenders. As my colleague Ms. Lyall reported in 2001: The campaign led to lynch-mob attacks, firebombings and rioting in at least 11 communities, with vigilantes in some cases attacking people who looked like the men pictured or who had been incorrectly identified as past offenders. In one town, the home of a pediatrician was attacked when anti-pedophile campaigners got their spelling confused. Ms. Brooks brought up her support for the Sarah’s Law campaign four times last week, during her testimony to a parliamentary committee investigating phone hacking. Asked by one member of the panel about her newspaper’s use of private detectives, Ms. Brooks said, “In the main, my use of private investigators while I was editor of The News of the World was purely legitimate,” and used to determine the addresses and whereabouts of convicted pedophiles for Sarah’s Law.” Pressed by another questioner about her level of involvement with the reporting on the murdered 13-year-old, Milly Dowler, whose voice mail was accessed by her paper, Ms. Brooks said: The one thing that I would say is that under my editorship we had a series of terrible and tragic news stories, starting with Sarah Payne, Milly Dowler’s disappearance and subsequent murder. … The main focus of my editorship of The News of the World was convincing Parliament that there needed to be radical changes to the Sex Offenders Act 1997, which came to be known as Sarah’s Law. … So I suppose, if I had a particular extra involvement in any of those stories, then it would have been on the basis that I was trying to push and campaign for readers’ rights on the 10 pieces of legislation that we got through on Sarah’s Law. Another member of the panel noted that a contemporary News of the World article on the frantic search for Milly Dowler had cited specific details about the young girl’s voice mail account, without any explanation of how that information had been obtained. The newspaper, Ms. Brooks was reminded, had reported that someone had left a “message on [Milly's] voice mail after the 13-year-old vanished at 4 p.m. on March 21… on March 27—six days after Milly went missing in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey… [an] employment agency appears to have phoned her mobile.” Ms. Brooks insisted that, even though she was the paper’s editor at that time, she had no idea that the article citing the details of the missing girl’s voice mail had been based on hacking. Asked by another member of Parliament how the public interest might have been served by breaking the law to obtain private phone numbers, Ms. Brooks said, “Many people disagreed with the campaign, but I felt that Sarah’s Law, and the woeful Sex Offenders Act 1997 that needed to be changed to protect the public, I felt was absolutely in the public interest.” Later in the hearing, when Ms. Brooks was asked by a fourth member of Parliament to describe her recollection of a meeting with senior London police officers, in which she was reportedly warned that her newspaper was interfering with a murder investigation, Ms. Brooks said that she remembered no such meeting. But, she added, “Because of the Sarah’s Law campaign, I had pretty regular meetings at Scotland Yard, mainly with the pedophile unit there.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/world/europe/27bskyb.html?ref=newscorporation">James Murdoch’s Future at Stake as BSkyB Board Meets<date>Published: July 26, 2011</date><text>LONDON — The phone hacking scandal riling the British political and media worlds has posed a significant challenge to British Sky Broadcasting, the lucrative satellite television network that has long been the centerpiece of Rupert Murdoch’s European ambitions.On Thursday, BSkyB’s board will meet for the first time since the outcry over phone hacking by one of Mr. Murdoch’s tabloid newspapers forced his News Corporation to drop its bid to buy the 61 percent of outstanding shares in the network that it does not already own. The future of BSkyB’s broadcasting license and the fate of its current chairman, Mr. Murdoch’s son James, are on the line, analysts said. “The biggest issue is whether James Murdoch is to remain chairman,” said Steve Liechti, an analyst at Investec Securities in London. “Given the issues going on with News Corp. and James Murdoch’s position within that business, it may be seen that it is not appropriate.” The meeting comes as Ofcom, the British broadcasting regulator, proceeds with inquiries into whether BSkyB remains “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license because of the scandal unfolding at the News Corporation. BSkyB’s share price has dropped 14 percent since the latest phase of the affair erupted this month. Several former employees of News International, the News Corporation’s British newspaper empire, have been arrested in the investigations into telephone voice mail hacking and corruption at The News of the World, which Mr. Murdoch shuttered this month. James Murdoch, who is head of the News Corporation’s European operations, which include News International and BSkyB, approved a £725,000 settlement (about $1.1 million) to a hacking victim in 2008. In Parliament last week, he denied he was ever told that underlying evidence in the case implicated a second reporter at the tabloid, in addition to one convicted in 2007, although two former senior executives of News International have questioned his testimony. Executives at BlackRock, BSkyB’s largest shareholder after the News Corporation with a 7.7 percent stake, and other large shareholders declined to comment about the matter, citing company policies not to speak to the news media about their holdings. But some smaller shareholders and corporate governance experts have expressed concerns about the board structure at BSkyB and have raised questions about whether Mr. Murdoch should stay as chairman. A BSkyB spokesman would not say whether the scandal or Mr. Murdoch’s position would be discussed at Thursday’s board meeting. “The company is very committed to good governance,” the spokesman said. A spokeswoman for the News Corporation offered no comment. Theo Blackwell, a councilor for London’s Camden district, whose public pension fund invests in BSkyB, said he has requested a review of the investment. Paul Myners, Britain’s former government minister for financial services, said BSkyB’s 14-member board urgently needs a change because “a significant number” — four members — have been directors for more than nine years. Four others are on the News Corporation payroll. Mr. Myners said Mr. Murdoch probably should remain on the board but not as chairman. “Most corporate problems can be traced back to poor corporate governance and this company falls short in that respect,” he said. Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which offers independent advice to institutional investors, has advised BSkyB shareholders to urge that James Murdoch be replaced. “His relationship to the controlling shareholder clearly compromises his independence,” said Alan MacDougall, the firm’s managing director. “Questionable governance practices have been tolerated at BSkyB for a long time, and unfortunately many shareholders have not effectively challenged them. That must change. “In light of current events, it is time for the board to review whether BSkyB and its shareholders would benefit from a new, independent chair,” Mr. MacDougall said. At least three shareholders in BSkyB voted against James Murdoch’s appointment in 2008: Aviva, Legal &amp; General and Co-operative Asset Management, money managers whose BSkyB investments are mainly part of an index-linked fund. “There were concerns about him being named and the way he was parachuted in,” said one of these investors, speaking on condition of anonymity because he prefers not to discuss the issues with the news media. “These concerns remain.” Co-operative, which owns a 0.003 percent stake in BSkyB and a 0.1 percent stake in the News Corporation, said in an e-mailed statement that “radical reform” was needed at both companies but especially at the News Corporation, “and indeed in the newspaper industry in the U.K., to stamp out the kind of illegal and grossly invasive practices that are alleged.” Julian Franks, a finance professor at London Business School, said: “The board’s independent directors have to ask themselves” what happens if James Murdoch resigns and none of Rupert Murdoch’s other children can get into the job? “Murdoch might think, ‘What’s the point in me being in that business,’ ” and could sell his BSkyB investment, which would hurt the share price, Mr. Franks said. In a letter to lawmakers last week, Ed Richards, Ofcom chief executive, said its judgment on whether BSkyB was fit and proper to hold a broadcasting license did not depend on criminal convictions in the case. A spokesman for Ofcom, Ed Taylor, said the concept of “fit and proper” had no fixed definition and it was the regulator’s responsibility to interpret it. There was no timeline for ending its inquiries.

The chairman of the British parliamentary panel that questioned Rupert and James Murdoch last week about phone hacking wants to hear from three men who claim that the Murdochs gave inaccurate testimony. John Whittingdale, a Conservative member of Parliament who chairs the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, told The Evening Standard of London on Tuesday: “It is somewhat frustrating to keep hearing media reports about people wishing to correct evidence. If they have doubts about any testimony they should get in touch with us immediately.” Mr. Whittingdale was referring to statements released in recent days by three men who all held senior positions at News International, the Murdochs’ British newspaper division, until earlier this month. Colin Myler, who was the editor of The News of the World, the British tabloid at the center of the hacking scandal, and Tom Crone, who was the chief legal adviser to News International, said in a joint statement on Thursday that James Murdoch “was mistaken” when he told the committee that he had not been made aware of an incriminating e-mail in 2008, when he agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by a phone hacking victim. The e-mail, from a News of the World journalist, strongly suggested that phone hacking was more widespread at the paper in 2005 than the company had previously acknowledged. Then on Friday, Jon Chapman, News International’s director of legal affairs until this month, said in a statement that he wanted to cooperate with the committee to correct “serious inaccuracies in statements made” at last week’s hearing. Mr. Whittingdale told The Standard, “If Mr. Chapman has information which he believes calls into question the evidence provided by James Murdoch, then we would be very keen to speak to him.” The Standard notes that Mr. Chapman was a senior executive at Enron before he started working for News International in 2003. During last week’s hearing, James Murdoch was asked if he was familiar with the term “willful blindness,” which was used to describe the behavior of senior executives at Enron who averted their eyes from wrongdoing. As The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by the Murdochs’ News Corporation, explained on Friday: Mr. Chapman had served on the front lines since News International started having to deal with the allegations back in 2006, when News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were arrested. Mr. Chapman ultimately reported to Les Hinton, a top aide to Rupert Murdoch and executive chairman of News International until December 2007. Mr. Hinton then became head of News Corp.’s Dow Jones &amp; Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Hinton recently resigned from that role, saying he was “ignorant of what apparently happened” at The News of the World. Mr. Chapman played a key role in settling an unfair-dismissal dispute brought by Mr. Goodman after his conviction — a settlement that was approved by Mr. Hinton and the unit’s head of human resources, according to testimony by Mr. Chapman before the parliamentary committee. He also played a role in an internal inquiry that resulted from that dispute, in which Mr. Chapman and a colleague reviewed a batch of e-mails between Mr. Goodman and five others, and then forwarded some or all of them to an outside law firm for review. That law firm, Harbottle &amp; Lewis LLP, at the time found no “reasonable evidence” that others knew about or were carrying out similar illegal procedures. Another lawyer recently hired by News International, Ken MacDonald, said following a review of nine or 10 of those emails that there was “blindingly obvious” evidence of corrupt payments. During testimony on Tuesday to the parliamentary committee, Rupert Murdoch appeared to lay responsibility with Mr. Chapman, who helped oversee the Harbottle review, saying the former legal counsel would have been familiar with the file’s contents “for a number of years.” Mr. Chapman was a central figure in an internal inquiry conducted by News International into phone hacking in 2007. He has also previously provided evidence on the matter to the parliamentary committee. In response to a request from the committee in October 2009, News International provided a copy of the letter sent to Mr. Chapman on May 29, 2007, from Lawrence Abramson of Harbottle &amp; Lewis. Here, from the House of Commons Web site, is the full text of that letter: Re Clive Goodman We have on your instructions reviewed the emails to which you have provided access from the accounts of: Andy Coulson Stuart Kuttner Ian Edmondson Clive Goodman Neil Wallis Jules Stenson I can confirm that we did not find anything in those emails which appeared to us to be reasonable evidence that Clive Goodman’s illegal actions were known about and supported by both or either of Andy Coulson, the Editor, and Neil Wallis, the Deputy Editor, and/or that Ian Edmondson, the News Editor, and others were carrying out similar illegal procedures. Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance. In hindsight, what is striking about the letter is that it suggests that Harbottle &amp; Lewis was instructed by News International to conduct a very narrow review of the e-mails; the lawyers looked only for evidence that Mr. Goodman’s superiors knew about his use of the illegal technique or that others at the paper were using it. They were not asked to look for evidence of other kinds of illegal activity, like payments to the police, or to review e-mails sent by other reporters at the paper, like the one that contained a transcript of 35 hacked voice mail messages that Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone said they told James Murdoch about in 2008. As my colleagues Jo Becker and Ravi Somaiya reported last weekend, while some of the e-mails reviewed for News International’s internal inquiry in 2007 “showed no direct evidence of hacking, according to three company officials they did contain suggestions that Mr. Coulson may have authorized payments to the police for information.” They also reported that, according to News International officials, the 2007 review of e-mails was not undertaken to find out if hacking had been widely practiced by News of the World journalists. Rather, the review “was aimed at defending the company from a lawsuit filed by Clive Goodman,” who had been fired for hacking. Mr. Goodman claimed that his dismissal was unfair because his colleagues had also used the technique. This might explain why Harbottle &amp; Lewis was asked to review e-mail traffic only between Mr. Goodman and his editors. Three of the five editors named in the Harbottle &amp; Lewis letter — Andy Coulson, Neil Wallis and Ian Edmondson — have been arrested in recent months in connection with new police investigations into phone hacking and illegal payments to police officers.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/world/europe/26murdoch.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch Veterans Portray an Engaged Boss<date>Published: July 25, 2011</date><text>LONDON — It was the political scoop of the year, a damning, serialized exposé in The Daily Telegraph about how British politicians were abusing their parliamentary expense accounts to pay for things like moat-cleaning and wisteria-trimming.The articles, in May 2009, shook up Parliament and shamed lawmakers. They also irritated Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, for the simple reason that two of his own newspapers, The Times of London and The Sun, had been offered the chance to buy the information that led to the exposé, but had turned it down. “There was anger wafting across the Atlantic,” said a former reporter for one of Mr. Murdoch’s papers here. At News International, Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper arm, executives scrambled to deflect responsibility. The blame fell largely on an in-house lawyer who had cautioned against paying some $450,000 for a stolen disc containing the parliamentary expense records. (A few months later, the lawyer was asked to leave News International, where he had worked for 33 years, apparently after another disagreement over advice.) While it is not clear whether Mr. Murdoch played a direct role in the matter, there is little question that The Telegraph’s scoop remained a sore point for him and that his feelings seeped down through various layers of his company. Soon afterward, The Wall Street Journal, his flagship American newspaper, did its own investigation of American lawmakers’ expenses. And the editor of the rival Telegraph who got the scoop, William Lewis, a former business editor at The Sunday Times of London, was then rehired by Mr. Murdoch as News International’s group general manager, in charge of all the company’s print publications in Britain. The expenses story was still on Mr. Murdoch’s mind two years later: it was the one big British story he mentioned by name at last week’s parliamentary hearing on phone hacking. In that appearance before the House of Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, Mr. Murdoch sought to distance himself from the hacking scandal, explaining that because he employs “53,000 people around the world” he cannot be expected to know everything everyone is doing at The News of the World. He may have come across at the hearing as vague, detached and unfocused — as an old man who was at times not quite all there. Investors in the News Corporation have been pressing for years for the company to arrange a clear succession plan for Mr. Murdoch, who is 80 years old, and speculation about his future is rife now that the company has suffered a significant blow to its reputation. But Mr. Murdoch, who every morning reads avidly from what one former editor referred to as “the best clippings service I have ever seen,” has never been a disengaged boss, especially from his newspapers. “I really didn’t buy that, to be honest,” said Roy Greenslade, a former Murdoch editor who is now a professor of journalism at City University London. “I’m sure he’s not as interfering as he was 20 years ago, but you can see through the way The Sun and The News of the World operate that his word remains law.” Indeed, in January, as the phone hacking scandal began to gain traction and Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor, quit his job as the government’s top spokesman (he has since been arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and bribing the police), Mr. Murdoch postponed his trip to the World Economic Forum and swept into London to take charge. Surrounded by the editors of The Sun and The Times of London; his son James; and Rebekah Brooks, then chief executive of News International (she has also since been arrested on the same suspicions as in Mr. Coulson’s case), Mr. Murdoch ate lunch in the News International staff cafeteria. He then appeared at The Times’s editorial conference, where he weighed in on one of the day’s big stories: the decision by Sky News to fire the host of a sports program who had made lewd remarks to his co-host, a woman, including suggesting that she tuck her microphone in his pants. To make matters more complicated, Sky is part of the media conglomerate British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, which is controlled by the News Corporation, and the co-host in question, Andy Gray, had recently sued The News of the World, claiming his phone had been hacked. Taking all this in at the news conference, Mr. Murdoch said, according to accounts at the time, “This country has lost its sense of humor.” Mr. Murdoch began his career when he inherited his father’s small newspaper business in Australia. He remains at his core a hard-nosed businessman with the instincts of a tabloid reporter, said many former and current employees, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to make Mr. Murdoch angry. “He vicariously lives through his papers in many ways,” said a former editor at one of News Corporation’s major papers. “He’s a news junkie. He’s interested in what’s driving the sales, what’s on the front page. He’s always talking to his editors.” 1 2 3 Next Page » Tim Arango contributed reporting from Baghdad, and William K.

Those conditions, the writer declares, have “made my continuance as editor untenable.” Another departure from News Corp., following revelations of phone hacking by one of the company’s newspapers? No. The letter was written last spring by N. Ravi, former editor of The Hindu newspaper of India, to announce his resignation. As the News Corp. scandal unfolds, his florid prose has been circulating on the Internet, his concerns seemingly of broader relevance to a troubled newspaper industry, even if the proximate cause — a boardroom feud — is different. The unethical practices at the News Corp. tabloid, The News of the World, are an extreme example of what can happen when newspapers go the way of plastic buckets. Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who intercepted voice mail messages for The News of the World, has said he was under “relentless pressure” from the paper to deliver headline-worthy information. There are also growing suggestions — though no hard evidence, yet — that The News of the World was not the only British paper to hire phone hackers like Mr. Mulcaire. Journalistic competition is mostly a good thing. But in Britain, newspapers may be suffering from too much of a good thing. Few Fleet Street papers make any money, and times are especially tough on the high-quality end of the market. The Times of London, which is also owned by News Corp., loses tens of millions of pounds a year. The Guardian, which has led the way in uncovering the phone-hacking scandal, reported an operating loss of £33 million, or $53.8 million, for its most recent financial year. The Guardian survives because it is owned by a well-endowed charitable foundation. The Times survives largely because Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corp., loves newspapers. In a publicly traded company like News Corp., these kinds of losses have to be balanced out with earnings from other operations. So The News of the World was expected to deliver sizable profits — and did. The Sun, a News Corp. tabloid, is also a big moneymaker. With a sudden void of more than 2.6 million newspapers — the circulation of The News of the World — in the British market, it is not surprising that no one seems to be talking about filling it with unprofitable broadsheets. Instead, all expectations are that, once the dust settles, News Corp. will move toward seven-day publishing of The Sun. Associated Newspapers, which produces The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday — “middle-market” tabloids with no Page 3 girls but lots of scare stories about immigrants — may introduce a lower-end tabloid to try to mop up leftover News of the World readers. In the short term, the biggest beneficiary of the scandal was The Sunday Mirror, another tabloid, which reportedly added more than 700,000 sales on the first Sunday without a News of the World. The demise of The News of the World has also given a lift to The Mail on Sunday, as well as two papers whose journalistic contributions are especially meager: The Sunday Express and The Daily Star Sunday. In other words, if anyone was expecting the demise of The News of the World to result in a new commitment to editorial quality over commercial considerations, forget it. In the longer term, if British tabloids are no longer able to engage in phone hacking and other unsavory practices to generate scoops, the tabloids might fall out of favor. For now, the plastic buckets could come in handy.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/business/media/scandal-splinters-the-murdoch-family-business.html?ref=newscorporation">Scandal Splinters the Murdoch Family Business<date>Published: July 24, 2011</date><text>The News Corporation, the global enterprise controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has a history of living by its own rules and operating beyond consequence. That ended last week.Mr. Murdoch, long a spectral presence who made his plays on a chess board of his own making, was brought low before a committee of Parliament composed of people he could not have been bothered with three weeks ago. In testimony last Tuesday, he appeared as a supplicant, a faltering one at that, who interrupted his son James in the opening moments of the hearing, not to correct him, but to tell the members of the committee how sorry he was. He is very sorry. Sorry that one of his tabloids hacked into the voice mail of a 13-year-old murder victim. Sorry that the scandal threatens to derail his plans of succession. And sorry to find himself suddenly in the public stockade. Is he sorry that he and his employees created a culture and a business where all that seemed cricket? Probably not so much. His family and the board of his company are sorry as well, but that will probably not end up meaning much. The protective instincts of the family were on broad display last week. James sought to leap in front of every hard question while Mr. Murdoch’s wife, Wendi, inserted herself into the fray when someone tried to shove a shaving cream pie at her husband. She has a mean right hook. Rupert has his own protective streak when it comes to his family, and has gone to great lengths to make them central to the News Corporation’s success structure. But what his sons and daughters could soon find out is that if Mr. Murdoch is forced to choose between the family and the company he has built, he will choose the News Corporation. “Rupert may end up having to make a choice between his son and the company, which is fairly biblical,” said a friend of the family who works in the media business and who declined to be identified when speaking about private family matters. James Murdoch is done. He and his father both know that. His testimony curdled as he emitted it, and within two days a couple of former News Corporation executives publicly challenged it. The hooks are still in him, as Prime Minister David Cameron made clear when he said James still had “questions to answer.” And so he will, gradually sinking further into the mess he has overseen. Oddly, the News Corporation’s stock began to tick up during the hearings as Rupert Murdoch testified, his large hands thumping as he dropped them to the table. But it was less about his performance than about the clear message that emerged: an era had ended. The family business is splintering. If James is out, as would seem to be the case, will his other offspring, Elisabeth and Lachlan, come swinging into view? I and others doubt that the charms of a global media enterprise being run as a corner grocery store will continue. While the family reign seems certain to fracture, the News Corporation’s own fortunes are less predictable. A report by the analyst Michael Nathanson of Nomura Capital Investments nicely captured the moment. The market does not care if you have done bad things; it cares when you get caught. “While we remain disappointed by the actions of a muckraking newspaper and frustrated that perhaps the least-valuable asset in the News Corp. portfolio could cause this much value destruction,” Mr. Nathanson wrote, “we continue to believe that the risk/reward for News Corp. investors remains positive.” Reached later by phone, Mr. Nathanson suggested that the News Corporation had been cornered into doing the right thing, after doing a lot of not-so-right things. The fact that the company moved swiftly to buy back its stock — approving $5 billion of the oodles of cash the company has on hand — calmed the markets, if not the troubled waters that the company finds itself in. “The loss of the BSkyB deal is significant and not good for the company, but in the long term, I think this will force the company to take a hard look at where they are putting capital,” he said, referring to the company’s abandoned bid for British Sky Broadcasting, Britain’s most lucrative satellite television network. Historically, Mr. Murdoch has used the digital and broadcast parts of his empire to make money, and the more quotidian assets — newspapers, family influence and raw political power — to create running room for the rest of the organization. That was fine as far as it went. The hacking scandal changed the dynamics. Suddenly, Mr. Murdoch’s fetish for newspapers looked like an ill-advised indulgence. The News Corporation’s prized relationships with 10 Downing Street and Scotland Yard became liabilities, with all of the coziness on view for inspection. It speaks to the scale of the drama and the company that it is almost an afterthought that the government of Britain hangs in the balance. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter.com/carr2n This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 29, 2011 The Media Equation column on Monday, about a phone hacking scandalâs effect on the News Corporation, referred imprecisely to the conditions under which Peter Chernin, a former chief executive, and Gary Ginsberg, a former communications executive, left the company.

He quoted Shakespeare. Explaining the swiftness of his resignation, he mangled a bit of Macbeth: ''If 'twere best it were done, 'twere well it were done quickly.'' The reference was perfectly fitting for a scandal whose defining adjective is coming to be ''Shakespearean.'' Many have noted superficial similarities between the scandal and Shakespearean tragedy: overheard messages, hired thugs. There's a hashtag sprawling through Twitter: #shakespeare4murdoch. (My favorite so far: ''remorse, remorse, my kingdom for remorse.'') Usually comparisons between events in the news and Shakespeare are strained, cropping up with each downfall of a prominent public figure. Eliot Spitzer slept with a hooker. He is not Marc Antony. Tony Hayward, formerly of BP, is not Julius Caesar. Neither is Dominique Strauss-Kahn an aging version of Prince Hal. But in the case of Rupert Murdoch, the comparison is, for once, accurate: the scandal is exactly like a Shakespearean tragedy, in specific and profound ways. The great Shakespeare tragedies fuse crises in families and in states, connecting the most significant historical events with the most delicate psychological realities. In ''King Lear,'' a family squabble about a retiree can be rectified only by a full-scale invasion by France. In ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' the fate of the Roman Empire hinges on a man who likes his Egyptian mistress more than his family. In ''Hamlet,'' Shakespeare makes it clear that Claudius is a capable ruler, but because he has killed his brother and married his brother's sister, the state must fall. The corruption within a family matters more to the health or disease of government than any policy matter. The domestic has always mingled with the political for the Murdochs as well. The children have occupied different outposts of the empire. Rupert Murdoch's marriage to Wendi Deng Murdoch was supposed to open access to Chinese media markets. (On Tuesday, defending her husband against a pie-wielding protester, she provided instead a sweet right hook.) But the real scandal in Britain is how far a modern democracy came to resemble a family. Hacking into a murdered girl's voice mail is grotesque, but the coziness of everyone involved is the bigger danger to society. Perhaps the most damaging revelation about Prime Minister David Cameron is that he had dinner over the Christmas holiday last year at the home of the former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks (often described as another Murdoch daughter) along with Mr. Murdoch's son James. The corrupting power of such connections is one of the core anxieties in Shakespeare's great tragedies. ''Lear'' shows a king dividing his kingdom on the basis of his daughters' love. Goneril and Regan are happy to play the game, but Cordelia refuses to exaggerate her love for her father in order to procure power. Later, the bastard Edmund, after betraying his father in an attempt to take his title, seduces both Goneril and Regan -- the ultimate incestuous political order. Family should not act like politicians, and vice versa. The Murdoch drama is now entering its fifth act, the part when the bodies start to pile up. At the hearing before a parliamentary committee, Mr. Murdoch interrupted his son near the beginning of the proceedings to say: ''This is the most humble day of my life.'' His native Australian optimism may be misleading him, however. The mood in Britain seems to desire nothing less than his complete destruction. Everything he cherishes must be sacrificed. The paper. The BSkyB deal. Rebekah Brooks. Possibly his son's takeover of the company. We go to tragedy to watch a man be destroyed. Macbeth must be destroyed for his lust for power, Othello for his jealousy, Antony for his passion, Lear for the incompleteness of his renunciation. They are tragic precisely because their flaws are all too human. We do not yet know how far Mr. Murdoch is implicated in the crimes of his company, so we do not know which of Shakespeare's tragic heroes he resembles most. If he didn't know the extent of the phone hacking, then he's most like the bungling Richard II, who fails to spot the decay within his kingdom. If he did know, then he's more like the conniving Richard III, whose love of the machinations of power eventually grinds him into the machinery he's created. Regardless, Mr. Murdoch's distinguishing flaw is common ambition -- an outsider's desire to force his way into the establishment. He has been singled out because his flaw is so ordinary, so widespread. Putting aside for a moment the complicity of every single reader of The News of the World, nearly all journalists and politicians played the same game, only Mr. Murdoch played it better. One of the most profound feelings that follows watching a Shakespearean tragedy, once we have witnessed the destruction we crave, is how empty the world seems. The tension of tragedy lays bare a part of our hypocrisy that we should at least recognize in the case of Rupert Murdoch: Maybe he is a monster. Maybe he needs to be punished. But he is being destroyed because we cannot stand seeing ourselves, whether on stage or before Parliament.

Readers offer divergent views in response to a letter on Thursday. The Letter To the Editor: Re “Murdochs Deny That They Knew of Illegal Acts” (front page, July 20): Do British parliamentary inquiries into Rupert Murdoch’s media empire offer any lessons for the United States? Perhaps, if they alert us to the power of a “political-journalistic complex” no less dangerous than the “military-industrial complex” that President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned about half a century ago. Have similar abuses been committed here, or do Fox News and others scrupulously observe the rule of law on this side of the pond? Are elected officials too cozy with representatives of a news industry that is supposed to “cover” them? Which Congressional committees, headed by which party, are prepared to launch the appropriate investigations? RICHARD STEIN Eugene, Ore., July 20, 2011 The writer is a retired professor of English at the University of Oregon. Readers React Mr. Stein’s letter tries to connect Fox News in the United States with the News Corporation scandal in Britain. This has been the hope of the left all along — that the phone-hacking scandal will somehow snare Fox News and cause the demise of Rupert Murdoch’s whole right-wing media empire. The real problem for Mr. Stein and the left is not “political-journalistic complexes” — it’s when those complexes are right-wing. Everything was fine when the left controlled the vast majority of the media. To be sure, it wasn’t all under one owner, but it might as well have been since the political-journalistic bias was all the same. Now that the popularity of Fox News and talk radio has cut that percentage, there’s a perceived problem. But don’t worry, Mr. Stein. You’ve still got the television networks, NPR, PBS, MSNBC, CNN, The New York Times and most major newspapers, Hollywood, academia — but I run out of space. MARK R. GODBURN North Canaan, Conn., July 21, 2011 Time will tell whether the hacking and payoffs were repeated on this side of the Atlantic. But as awful as these are, they pale by comparison to what Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News has done to our democracy. By slanting and distorting the news and promoting, whether for influence or profit, a peculiar brand of rabble-rousing right-wing radicalism, Mr. Murdoch has misled many decent Americans into acting against their own interests, and those of the country. We see the consequences in the senseless attacks on programs like Medicare and Social Security, and the cynical refusal, at a time when so many are suffering, to repeal tax cuts for the rich. We see the consequences in our failure to act on global warming even as our nation suffers from freakish storms and drought. And most chillingly, we see the consequences in the attempt by one house of Congress to blackmail the country into adopting the extremist program of the Tea Party. One can only hope that here, as in Britain, evidence of wrongdoing will prove sufficient to break the bonds of fear and fealty that are the basis of Mr. Murdoch’s influence on Republican politicians, and to reveal to the American public the cynicism of the man behind Fox News! JOSHUA P. HILL New London, Conn., July 21, 2011 The acts of The News of the World newspaper in Britain were undeniably despicable. But I find ironic the holier-than-thou news articles pretending that such invasions of privacy and news-at-any-cost intrusions by the media are limited to a few disreputable media that just happen to promote political views contrary to theirs. What about the plagiarism by certain reporters at other newspapers, including The New York Times? Or the media’s encouragement of stealing state secrets by publishing the Pentagon Papers and the WikiLeaks documents? I find those acts just as despicable as those of The News of the World. 1 2 3 Next Page »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/business/media/joel-klein-ex-schools-chief-leads-internal-news-corp-inquiry.html?ref=newscorporation">Joel Klein, Ex-Schools Chief, Leads Internal News Corp. Inquiry<date>Published: July 23, 2011</date><text>This article is by Jeremy W. Peters, Michael Barbaro and Javier C. Hernandez.Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor, was in a tricky position. Three weeks ago, Rupert Murdoch asked Mr. Klein, now his trusted deputy, to oversee an investigation into the phone hacking scandal that has deeply wounded the News Corporation and its chairman, something Mr. Klein was eager to avoid. “I am trying to get as far away from this as I can,” he lamented to a friend. He has not succeeded. Mr. Klein, who joined the News Corporation as a senior vice president in January, is not only responsible for the investigation that could uncover what company managers knew about the hacking, but he also has become one of Mr. Murdoch’s closest and most visible advisers throughout the crisis. His seemingly contradictory roles — de facto chief of internal affairs officer and ascendant executive with Mr. Murdoch’s ear — are raising questions about how robust and objective the internal inquiry can be. When Mr. Murdoch summoned a team of top deputies and outside consultants to London to help him manage the fallout from the hacking, Mr. Klein was one of the first to arrive, moving into a temporary office 20 feet from the chairman’s. When Mr. Murdoch and his closest advisers debated whether to accept the resignation of Rebekah Brooks, a newspaper executive at the center of the controversy, Mr. Klein pushed for her exit. When Mr. Murdoch wrote a statement to deliver to Parliament last week, Mr. Klein weighed in on the drafts. And while the world watched Mr. Murdoch and his son James testify, Mr. Klein sat directly behind them for three hours, occasionally cleaning his rimless glasses with his tie as he looked on in support. Mr. Klein’s dizzying journey, in under a year, from one of the nation’s foremost education reformers to the corporate consigliere for a media titan whose politics are far to the right of his own, has surprised and unsettled many friends and colleagues, who fear that he will be unable to extricate himself from a scandal that shows no sign of abating or, they say, ending well. “This was nothing he could have ever expected,” said Barbara Walters, a longtime friend of Mr. Klein’s. But in many ways, interviews suggest, his emergence as a dominant figure within the News Corporation is consistent with a biography that combines high-minded legal and social aims — antitrust law and education — with a driving, sometimes overwhelming competitive fire. “He has a take-no-prisoners attitude,” said Randi Weingarten, who battled Mr. Klein when she was head of the New York City teachers union. “He is a litigator. He is about winning.” It is a sign of how delicate Mr. Klein’s position inside the News Corporation has become that he was initially against the idea of an internal review. In April, after London’s Metropolitan Police arrested three News of the World journalists on suspicion of hacking, some executives pushed for an investigation that would have the full backing of the company’s board and senior management, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions taking place at the time. Mr. Murdoch opposed the idea outright. Standing firmly in his corner was Mr. Klein. “There was a clear message,” said one of the people who knew of Mr. Klein’s role and requested anonymity to divulge private conversations. “Stay out. And let Joel handle it.” Top lawyers and experts in corporate governance said the News Corporation should have hired outside legal counsel to oversee the inquiry, as dozens of companies like the American International Group and Fannie Mae have done in the past, rather than rely on an insider. “That is not standard practice,” said Charles M. Elson, an expert on corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “You cannot be seen as objective if you are inside.” The News Corporation says the investigative body will have true independence and the power to compel employees to cooperate. The company points to the appointment of Lord Anthony Grabiner, a prominent British lawyer who also sat behind the Murdochs during their testimony before lawmakers last week, as the body’s independent chairman. Lord Grabiner will report to Mr. Klein. Mr. Klein, in turn, will report to Viet Dinh, an independent director on the News Corporation board. Mr. Klein declined to be interviewed for this article. “We’ve been given a free hand,” said Lord Grabiner, who added that he and Mr. Klein never would have agreed to take on the job if they felt the committee was a sham. 1 2 3 Next Page »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/sports/olympics/murdoch-newspapers-may-lose-exclusive-access-to-2012-british-olympians.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch Newspapers May Lose Exclusive Access to 2012 British Olympians<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>Rupert Murdoch’s British newspapers could lose exclusive access to the country’s athletes as they prepare for next year’s Summer Games in London because of the phone-hacking scandal that led to the closing of the tabloid The News of the World and testimony before Parliament by Murdoch and his son James.“The shuttering of The News of the World means that the terms of the contract could no longer be fulfilled,” said Andrew Owen, a spokesman for Team 2012, which raises money for British Olympians. He said that the media partnership with Team 2012 and News International, the unit of the News Corporation that owns the newspapers, had not been terminated. Owen said that News International could “explore remedies” for its deal with its other newspapers — The Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun. But it was unclear how much leeway Team 2012 has contractually to end the deal, with The News of the World gone, and seek a new media sponsor. It is also not known how vigorously News International will fight to retain the deal as it copes with the phone-hacking scandal, which has embroiled not only the company but also Scotland Yard. A spokeswoman for News International declined to comment. Team 2012 is a joint venture of the British Olympic Association, the London Olympic organizing committee, the British Paralympic Association and UK Sport. The presenting sponsor of the fund-raising organization is Visa, which is also a worldwide Olympic sponsor. The deal between Team 2012 and News International involved all four of its newspapers, which were all entitled to carry the slogan “Official Newspaper of Team 2012.” But the potency of the partnership with News International was diminished by the loss of The News of the World’s 2.7 million Sunday circulation. According to a news release last January that announced Team 2012’s partnership with News International, the four newspapers were part of a campaign to help the British public “get behind each of the athletes, their sports and their personal stories.” At the time, Rebekah Brooks, who was the chief executive of News International, offered a reason for the company’s interest in the deal. “This unique partnership gives our newspapers unrivaled access to the Team 2012 athletes,” she said, “and means we will be able to throw our full support behind the team and give our readers the inside track.” Brooks, who was the editor of The News of the World when the phone-hacking abuses began in 2002, has resigned from the company and testified before Parliament, along with the Murdochs.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/world/europe/23iht-letter23.html?ref=newscorporation">The Shifting Nature of News<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>LONDON — What is news? News, they used to say at reporters’ training courses in Britain, was the kind of snippet you might relay to a housebound relative, an interesting quirk that amused or informed or both. Dog bites man was not news. Man bites dog was. But in recent times, the news seems to have shifted into ever more improbable terrain, even by the lights of a generation that grew up in the shadow of momentous change. Consider the events of recent weeks in Britain: a newspaper, The News of the World, sold and read in the nation for 168 years, has been summarily closed by its owner, Rupert Murdoch, who subsequently was splattered by a shaving-cream pie as he testified before a panel of lawmakers about a sordid phone-hacking scandal within his media empire that threatens to rewrite the rules and codes of power built up over decades. “Over the past two weeks, a torrent of revelations and allegations has engulfed some of this country’s most important institutions,” Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament. “It has shaken people’s trust in the media and the legality of what they do, in the police and their ability to investigate media malpractice, and, yes, in politics and in politicians’ ability to get to grips with these issues.” But the intertwined issues of trust and seismic shocks to the system spread much wider in a world where the certainties assumed by earlier generations have crumbled. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the underpinnings of the Western world have fallen into disrepute while China’s economic power looms on an ever-closer horizon. Bankers, once accorded a measure of public confidence, now occupy much the same place in public perceptions among the bottom-feeders of a new era as journalists and politicians. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, we knew that — or assumed that — the alternative to Communism was democracy. A few years later in South Africa we knew that the alternative to apartheid was freedom. The world was in balance between past and future. Leaders like Helmut Kohl in Germany and George H.W. Bush in the United States believed they could manage the transition to a new world order. But who foresaw a shift that has left Western strategists uneasily eyeing Beijing’s century? In the early 1990s, the Gulf War had clear aims to expel Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait and a clear end when they had been routed. A decade later, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, turned the kaleidoscope again, propelling Western armies into far murkier commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Arab Spring, once unthinkable in a regime of iron control by insouciant elites, has turned into the Arab Summer and soon-to-be Fall without a clear vision of where revolutions are going in Egypt and Tunisia, or where bloody uprisings will lead those still fighting stubborn dictatorships in Syria and Libya. And what alternatives offer themselves at this time, in this specific week? Despite a last-minute bailout of Greece, the longer-term survival of the euro currency, barely more than a decade old, is still a matter of fevered debate. The national stereotypes assembled in the great European project — profligate southerners, industrious northerners — have reasserted themselves over the notion of a common destiny that has driven and expanded Western Europe since the 1950s. Europe’s uncertainty is rooted in runaway debt. The dominoes of potential default stretch from Greece and Ireland to major economies like Italy and Spain. But debt is something that raises an even bigger question in the United States: will America default on its multitrillion-dollar borrowings — a nightmare scenario without coordinates for a way forward? If U.S. Treasury bills can no longer be trusted, what can? And that perhaps is what makes the news so different now — we know where we came from; but events offer no clear signposts to the future. Previous assumptions are inoperative. Another adage from journalism school was that all news is local — and so it still is. Yet, few things remain local in a new and unfiltered world of tweets and social networking, bloggers and broadband. Potentially, all news is global, or at least viral. So the consumer must beware of its provenance — caveat emptor. Nothing, it sometimes seems, can be taken at face value. The so-called mainstream media have lost their cherished claim to act as the sole filter of raw information. Their exclusive lock on the dissemination of news has dissolved. If events themselves are opaque, then the plethora of versions brings no special clarity. So what is news? It is, still, the moment of disclosure when hidden facts are revealed: whatever else has changed, the notion of a scoop has not. Indeed, that raw hunger for exclusives was a contributing factor in Britain’s phone-hacking scandal, made all the more visceral as traditional newspapers fight for survival against digital upstarts. News is still the grist of our understanding of the world around us, beyond the narrow perspective of our own backyard. It is the incremental step propelling our comprehension of events. Once, purveyors of news claimed that their product signaled the destination, too. “Read all about it,” the news vendors cried with a degree of chutzpah, as if the stories on those inky front pages contained all the answers. These days, the call might need some rephrasing — less catchy but more modest — to say: “Read what we know so far.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/world/europe/22murdoch.html?ref=newscorporation">Former News Corp. Executives Dispute James Murdoch’s Testimony<date>Published: July 21, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Two former News International executives publicly contradicted James Murdoch’s testimony to a parliamentary committee, saying Thursday that they told him of evidence in 2008 that suggested that phone hacking at one of the company’s tabloid newspapers was more widespread.The former executives said they informed Mr. Murdoch at the time that he was authorizing an unusually large secret settlement of a lawsuit brought by a hacking victim. Mr. Murdoch, who runs the News Corporation’s European and Asian operations, including News International, the British subsidiary, told the committee on Tuesday that he agreed to pay £725,000, which was then about $1.4 million, in the case because it made financial sense. He testified that he was not aware at the time of the evidence, which most likely would have become public had the case proceeded and undermined the company’s assertion that hacking was limited to “a lone rogue reporter.” But Colin Myler, the former editor of the tabloid, The News of the World, and Tom Crone, the former News International legal manager, said Mr. Murdoch was “mistaken” in his testimony delivered to the parliamentary committee. They said he knew when settling the lawsuit brought by a soccer union leader, Gordon Taylor, about a crucial piece of evidence that had been turned over to the company: an e-mail marked “for Neville” containing the transcript of a hacked cellphone message, apparently a reference to the paper’s chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck. “In fact, we did inform him of the ‘for Neville’ e-mail which had been produced to us by Gordon Taylor’s lawyers,” Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone said in the statement released Thursday night. The circumstances surrounding the settlement of the Taylor case are a focus of the parliamentary inquiry because they could shed light on whether there was an effort by News International to obscure the extent of the hacking. It was the first lawsuit brought by a hacking victim, and it came while the company, which owned the tabloid, was reeling from the 2007 guilty pleas of Clive Goodman, the paper’s royal reporter, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, for hacking the phones of the royal household. Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone’s statement seems to mark a round of finger-pointing, coming days after the testimony of Mr. Murdoch and his father, Rupert, the News Corporation chairman, who testified that he was not to blame for the hacking and was let down by people he trusted. Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone spoke out because they were angered that the company was telling reporters that they had failed to tell James Murdoch about critical facts in the civil lawsuit, three executives said in interviews. In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said, “I stand by my testimony to the select committee.” On Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch also told the committee that he “did not get involved in any of the negotiations directly” and that the settlement seemed reasonable at the time. Beyond Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone, other News International executives, as well as members of Mr. Taylor’s legal team, painted a picture of Mr. Murdoch as being quite engaged in keeping the case from going to trial. They say that the size of the settlement he authorized reflected that. In July 2008, News International’s chief financial officer, Clive Milner, was asked to endorse a check for £725,000. He was not told what it was for — only that “the check is for James Murdoch,” according to a company official with direct knowledge of the matter and an account Mr. Milner has shared with friends. The negotiations were so tightly held that only Mr. Crone, Mr. Myler and Mr. Murdoch knew about them, said two company officials. The officials said that even employees who were typically involved in legal decisions did not learn of the settlement until it leaked in a newspaper. “I was gobsmacked” at the amount, said one of them. 1 2 Next Page » Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/james-murdochs-evidence-was-mistaken-former-news-of-the-world-executives-say/?ref=newscorporation">James Murdoch's Testimony Called Into Question by Former News of the World Executives<date>July 21, 2011, 4:37 pm</date><text>Two former executives who worked at The News of the World released a statement on Thursday in which they said James Murdoch was “mistaken” when he told a parliamentary committee investigating the phone hacking scandal at the newspaper that he was not aware of a key piece of evidence in 2008. Colin Myler, who was the editor of the tabloid until it was shuttered this month, and Tom Crone, who was the chief legal adviser to News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation until last week, said that Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of the division, was told in 2008 that an e-mail had been discovered that indicated that more than just one reporter at the newspaper had relied on phone hacking for information. As my colleagues Don Van Natta Jr. and Jo Becker reported after James Murdoch and his father, Rupert, appeared before the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday: The decision by James Murdoch to authorize a confidential £725,000 settlement ($1.1 million) in the first hacking lawsuit filed against The News of the World also came under scrutiny. A payment intended to settle the case, filed by the soccer union boss Gordon Taylor, came in June 2008 after News International learned of the evidence that he had managed to pry from Scotland Yard. That included a transcript of one of his voice mails marked “For Neville,” an apparent reference to The News of the World’s chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck. Had that been revealed in court, it would have contradicted News International executives’ evidence given to the same House of Commons committee that hacking was limited to one “rogue” reporter, Mr. Goodman, the royal reporter. James Murdoch said Tuesday that he had been given an oral briefing on the Taylor case and “did not get involved directly” in the negotiations. Asked whether he was aware that hacking was illegal, James Murdoch acknowledged, “That was my understanding.” Near the end of Tuesday’s hearing, after the pie attack on Rupert Murdoch distracted many observers, Tom Watson, a member of the panel, asked James Murdoch: “When you signed off the Taylor payment, did you see or were you made aware of the full ‘Neville’ e-mail, the transcript of the hacked voice mail messages?” Mr. Murdoch replied, “No, I was not aware of that at the time.” In their joint statement on Thursday, Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone wrote: Just by way of clarification relating to Tuesday’s CMS select committee hearing, we would like to point out that James Murdoch’s recollection of what he was told when agreeing to settle the Gordon Taylor litigation was mistaken. In fact, we did inform him of the “For Neville” e-mail, which had been produced to us by Gordon Taylor’s lawyers. In a very brief statement posted on the News Corporation’s Web site later on Thursday, James Murdoch said, “I stand behind my testimony to the select committee.” A lawyer and a journalist who worked with Mr. Crone told Reuters last week that he was “responsible for approving many of the front pages” of The News of the World. Tim Bratton, the general counsel of the Financial Times, observed on Twitter that Mr. Crone’s part in the statement “is significant because he is a libel expert and so must be “confident,” that it is true.

Peter Lilley, for instance, said: “I welcome the recall of Parliament. I am only sorry that we are not being recalled to discuss the problems of the euro zone, the slowdown in the world economy in the face of higher energy prices, and the famine in east Africa.” On Thursday, that idea was expressed clearly, and controversially, on the pages of Rupert Murdoch’s Times of London, in the form of an editorial cartoon with the headline “Priorities.” The cartoon showed a starving Somali child holding his distended stomach and saying, “I’ve had a bellyful of phone-hacking.” Katharine Viner, an editor at The Guardian, posted a snapshot of the cartoon online and asked: “What do people think of this cartoon in The Times?” Earlier this week, another Murdoch-owned newspaper, The Wall Street Journal ran a combative editorial saying that news organizations not owned by News Corporation were reporting so heavily on the hacking scandal purely to damage a rival. The Journal’s opinion editors complained about “the commercial and ideological motives of our competitor-critics,” adding, “The schadenfreude is so thick you can’t cut it with a chain saw.” During his testimony to a parliamentary committee in London on Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch himself made a similar charge. When asked whom he blamed for the scandal, he replied: “A lot of people had different agendas, I think, in trying to build this hysteria. All our competitors in this country formally announced a consortium to try and stop us. They caught us with dirty hands and they built the hysteria around it.” The defenses of the phone hacking at The News of the World, which has been closed, came on the editorial pages of the most respected newspapers in Mr. Murdoch’s media empire. In 2007, when Mr. Murdoch moved to buy The Journal, Ken Auletta of The New Yorker reported that part of the negotiation “focused on whether Murdoch could be trusted to keep his distance from news coverage, and what kind of independent board could assure this.” To assuage the fears of the family that owned the newspaper, Mr. Murdoch “said that he would be willing to establish an independent board to assure that editors were free from his whims.” As Mr. Auletta explained, Mr. Murdoch offered to set up “a board like the one he had established for The Times of London and The Sunday Times, where of the 15n members only seven have no ties to News Corp., and where he can theoretically hire or fire the editor only with the assent of the board. In London, The Times board rarely meets, and is reliant for much of its information on Murdoch.” The composition of that board, known as a “special committee,” was eventually outlined in detail as part of the News Corporation’s ultimately successful bid to buy Dow Jones, the publisher of The Journal. Last week, Dow Jones reported that the special committee, “formed to monitor editorial integrity and independence at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires” in 2007, had issued a statement clearing the American news organization of any connection to the hacking scandal. The Dow Jones report continued: The statement of the committee, which is composed of independent journalism professionals, came a few hours after Les Hinton, Dow Jones’s chief executive officer, resigned. Hinton had been executive chairman of News International, the U.K. unit responsible for the News of the World newspaper at the center of the hacking allegations. Of the hacking scandal, the committee said, “Such matters are deeply concerning to us, suggesting as they do a serious default of basic journalistic standards in certain units of News Corp.” The committee added: “To date, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that today’s resignation of Les Hinton as publisher of The Wall Street Journal is [in] any way related to activities at The Wall Street Journal or Dow Jones or that any of the London offenses or anything like them have taken place at Dow Jones. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.” The committee has quarterly meetings. The members, each paid $100,000 a year by the company, are Thomas J. Bray, former editorial page editor of the Detroit News; Louis Boccardi, former chief executive of The Associated Press; Jack Fuller, retired president of the Tribune Publishing Co.; Nicholas Negroponte, co-founder of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Susan M. Phillips, dean of the George Washington University School of Business. In 2007, Mr. Auletta suggested that Mr. Murdoch “seems to value even a trophy property like The Times of London less for its prestige than for its influence — its power to help sway elections, to promote his political ideas, and to protect his corporate interests.” Minutes after Mr. Murdoch concluded his appearance before the parliamentary committee in London on Tuesday, Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University, commented on Twitter: “News Corp. isn’t a news company at all, but a global media empire that employs its newspapers (and in the U.S., Fox News) as a lobbying arm.” News Corp. isn’t a news company at all, but a global media empire that employs its newspapers (and in the US, Fox News) as a lobbying arm.Tue Jul 19 18:37:50 via webJay Rosen jayrosen_nyu</text></article><article index="5" href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/if-it-were-hearst-instead-of-murdoch/?ref=newscorporation">If It Were Hearst Instead of Murdoch ...<date>July 21, 2011, 8:19 am</date><text>Rupert Murdoch, who became a force to reckon with in this city when he bought The New York Post 35 years ago, is routinely compared to a news media titan of the past, William Randolph Hearst. Not that “news media” was a term in vogue in Hearst’s heyday, the early decades of the 20th century. “Press baron” was more like it. The Day Clyde Haberman offers his take on the news. But in important ways, the two men share the same journalistic DNA. Like Hearst, Mr. Murdoch has used his newspapers to promote the politicians he favors and punish the ones he scorns. As was the case with Hearst’s papers, including The New York American and The New York Evening Journal, those owned by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation have a curtain between the news-gathering and opinion-writing departments that can be exceedingly diaphanous. Like Hearst, Mr. Murdoch seeks to shape the world around him through his news outlets. And like Hearst, he has given the news business a thorough — some would say needed — shaking up, albeit at a price, in the form of accusations that he has “debauched journalism,” to borrow a charge that H. L. Mencken aimed at Hearst. Hearst was “the first publisher to understand that the communications media were potentially more powerful than the parties and their politicians,” the historian David Nasaw has written. Much the same could be said of Mr. Murdoch. Mr. Nasaw, a professor at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center, wrote those words in his acclaimed biography of Hearst, “The Chief,” published by Houghton Mifflin in 2000. Out of curiosity, we sought his thoughts on W.W.W.R.D. — What Would William Randolph Do? How might Hearst have handled the phone hacking and bribery scandals in Britain that have shaken News Corporation to its core and threatened the government of Prime Minister David Cameron? Appearing on Tuesday before a parliamentary committee, Mr. Murdoch pronounced himself humbled by all that has happened, but he rejected any notion that he bore responsibility for misdeeds committed by newspapers under his dominion. The sins of his underlings could not be visited upon him, he said. The buck stopped elsewhere. That would have been an alien concept to Hearst, Mr. Nasaw said. “He made it clear that his newspapers were his newspapers, and he took responsibility for everything that was in them,” the historian said, adding that Hearst “would have been able to defend himself by saying he was the people’s tribune and that the people deserve to know what’s going on.” Not that Hearst should be mistaken for “a saint or a particularly moral human being,” Mr. Nasaw said. Hardly. He and other press lords of his day “were perfectly capable and believed it their responsibility to use whatever means they could, including bribery and trickery, to get the news.” But the gap in defining news is vast, he said. Mr. Murdoch’s minions in Britain gleaned tidbits about people like a girl who was murdered or the son of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a boy with cystic fibrosis. Hearst’s troops went after far bigger and more significant game, Mr. Nasaw said. As an example, he cited how Hearst’s New York American paid two low-level Standard Oil employees to engage in a 1904 equivalent of phone hacking. They rummaged through desks and trash baskets to find letters that would show that the giant oil trust was bribing politicians. If Hearst had ever been hauled before a committee, Mr. Nasaw said, “he would have said, ‘If the Senate policed its own members and reined in Standard Oil, I wouldn’t have had to do this. So the fault is yours, not mine.’ ” “He would have taken absolute responsibility, and been proud to take responsibility,” Mr. Nasaw continued, “because he wasn’t reporting on Gordon Brown’s child or the life of a girl or whatever other scandals have erupted.” “Nothing would have made Hearst happier than to be given a seat before a parliamentary commission so he could explain why he did what he did, and condemn the government for making it necessary for him to do it.” For more local news from The Times, including an examination of New York’s growing Amish population in the wake of a tragic accident, the gruesome details of Leiby Kletzky’s killing and the evolution of long-term commercial renters in Grand Central, see the N.Y./Region section.

Phone-hacking and bribery charges already threaten Rupert Murdoch’s hold on pay-TV company British Sky Broadcasting, known as BSkyB. But his ownership of 27 United States Fox Broadcasting stations, home to hit shows like “American Idol,” could also be in jeopardy if the accusations prove true.The scarcity value of broadcast frequencies is a big reason the Federal Communications Commission keeps close watch over them. The regulator, which allows their use by people of good “character” who will serve “the public interest” and speak with “candor,” approved Mr. Murdoch’s foray into the business 25 years ago. But the F.C.C. also has at times seen fit to reverse course. In 1987, the commissioners withdrew RKO’s radio and broadcast licenses because its parent company lied and bribed foreign officials. In 2003, the F.C.C. pushed out owners of radio station WMGA in Georgia because they lacked “basic character qualifications.” Mr. Murdoch’s Fox stations aren’t accused of any such misconduct. But the allegations of wrongdoing at other parts of News Corporation have been enough for Britain’s broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, to investigate whether the company is a “fit and proper” owner of BSkyB. Theoretically that’s enough for the F.C.C. to scrutinize Fox. In practice, though, aside from Democratic commissioner Michael J. Copps, the five-member F.C.C. — three Democrats and two Republicans — has shied from enforcing the character test. And “bad character” now generally requires a criminal conviction or other findings of wrongdoing. The stiffer test is aimed at encouraging companies to invest in stations without fearing their licenses will be arbitrarily yanked. Actions abroad also rarely prompt the F.C.C. to question American licensees, and the commission typically holds only a station’s direct owners accountable. If, however, allegations of wrongdoing lead far enough up the News Corpoartion chain of command, the F.C.C. may have enough to question the company’s fitness to own Fox channels. The law is certainly broad enough. The chances may look remote, but a few weeks ago, so did the idea of someone hurling a shaving-cream pie at Mr. Murdoch in the House of Commons. Dodd-Frank’s Effect With a final 848 closely printed pages of law and over 3,300 pages of rules, the financial reforms passed a year ago are cumbersome. But they can’t be written off as a useless doorstop. Despite flaws and industry bleating, sound new measures are taking shape. Chief among the better outcomes is higher bank capital, helped by the internationally agreed Basel III standards. And with a bit of luck, the new systemic risk council will force regulators to talk to each other about where trouble might be brewing. Potentially, that could even result in pre-emptive action to spike the next obvious credit bubble. It’s also virtually unassailable that the over-the-counter derivatives market, formerly all but untouched by regulation, needed to be reined in. The devil is in the details, and bankers worry about the different paces and directions of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Though some rulemaking has unsurprisingly been delayed, what’s emerging is more pragmatic than many in the financial industry had feared. One disappointment is the evident failure to end “too big to fail” — one of the law’s few specific objectives. Instead, the biggest financial firms will, in essence, be designated as such. That should mean they hold extra capital or take less risk. And efforts to ensure banks can be wound down safely are laudable, if practically challenging. But it’s a pity there’s still an implication that the government may still need to step in. Smaller reforms, like say-on-pay shareholder votes at public companies, are good for keeping over-greedy managers honest. But there’s plenty in Dodd-Frank that seems misplaced, from the too-blunt Volcker rule to the conflict inherent in regulating credit rating firms more tightly while aiming to eliminate their ratings from rules and regulations. And though America is ahead of Europe in adopting reforms, it’s unfortunate that the early solidarity about international consistency has now diminished. Oddities like making companies disclose the use of certain African minerals look incongruous alongside glaring gaps, like a reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Dodd-Frank does punch — if below its printed weight. But that’s one missed blow that could yet cause political and financial trouble.

The confrontation in the House of Commons — a day after appearances before a parliamentary committee by Rupert and James Murdoch, whose News of the World newspaper, now defunct, has been at the heart of the scandal — capped a difficult period in which the politically agile prime minister appeared to lose his normally assured demeanor, allowing Labour to get ahead of him in putting an end to the Murdochs’ bid for Britain’s top satellite television company. Mr. Cameron flew back from a shortened trade trip to Africa on Tuesday and worked late into the night preparing for the showdown over revelations about the tabloid that have exposed cozy and sometimes corrupt relations among the press, politicians and the police, and that have crystallized into the most serious crisis of credibility and confidence of his 15 months in office. As the eight-hour Commons showdown ended, the prime minister appeared to have quieted the worst anxieties in his Conservative Party, whose most powerful backbench group gave him a desk-banging thumbs up. Several Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, emerged from the session to say that the emphasis should be on reforms to rid Britain of the excesses of its tabloids, and not on efforts to topple Mr. Cameron, unless there were new disclosures implicating him in efforts to stifle the police investigation of the issue or to mislead Parliament. Only a week ago, the Liberal Democrats seemed to be edging closer to an alternative compact with the Labour Party that could have threatened the government’s survival and its program of harsh spending cuts. Still, with police inquiries into the affair accelerating, posing the potential for further revelations and arrests, Mr. Cameron may, at best, have only stalled the Labour onslaught that has sought to link him to the scandal through his close ties to Mr. Murdoch and two former editors of The News of the World, one of whom was Mr. Cameron’s communications chief for nine months. After more than two weeks in which Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, outflanked Mr. Cameron at virtually every turn, the prime minister appeared to hit his stride, coupling incensed denials of personal wrongdoing in the affair with a new, hard-edged attitude toward his former media chief, Andy Coulson, one of 10 people linked to the Murdoch newspapers who has been arrested in the scandal. Showing an edge of bitterness toward a man he was describing only days ago as a friend, Mr. Cameron said that “with 20-20 hindsight and all that has followed, I would not have offered the job, and I expect that he wouldn’t have taken it.” “You live and you learn,” he added, “and, believe you me, I have learned.” Mr. Cameron also took on Mr. Miliband, saying that most of the abuses now under investigation within the Murdoch newspapers took place when Labour was in power and that the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had taken no action on evidence that serious wrongdoing had occurred. He also said that Labour’s ties with Mr. Murdoch and his executives, and the party’s pursuit of Mr. Murdoch’s political favor, were more extensive than his own. “I can assure the House that I’ve never held a slumber party or seen her in her pajamas,” Mr. Cameron said, referring to Rebekah Brooks, a onetime editor of The News of the World, who resigned as chief executive of News International, the paper’s parent company, late last week. The gibe referred to a gathering Mr. Brown’s wife held in 2008 at the prime minister’s country retreat, which British newspaper accounts have said was attended by Ms. Brooks; Mr. Murdoch’s wife, Wendi; and his daughter Elisabeth. A Daily Mail account said guests were told to bring their pajamas “for the sort of sleepover usually favoured by teenage girls.” Mr. Cameron’s defense on Wednesday — and his continuing vulnerability — rested on two potentially explosive issues. First was why he hired Mr. Coulson only months after Mr. Coulson’s 2007 resignation as The News of the World’s editor, then took him to Downing Street, in the face of a flurry of private warnings, after the Conservatives won the May 2010 general election. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/world/europe/21mulcaire.html?ref=newscorporation">News Corp. to Stop Paying Legal Fees of Investigator in Hacking Case<date>Published: July 20, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Under pressure in the widening phone hacking scandal, the News Corporation on Wednesday said that it would no longer pay the legal fees for the private investigator at the center of the hacking and partly lifted a confidentiality agreement on one of its law firms to allow the firm to give evidence to Parliament and to the police.The two concessions, coming a day after the appearance by Rupert Murdoch and his son James before a fractious parliamentary hearing, may shed further light on the extent of knowledge of the illegal phone hacking among executives inside Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper empire and whether some tried to conceal it. A parliamentary committee report published separately on Wednesday criticized executives for trying to “deliberately thwart” a police investigation about phone hacking in 2005 and 2006 that ended with the jailing of the private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire. The News Corporation said that it was immediately terminating “any arrangement to pay the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire,” who pleaded guilty in 2007 to hacking into the phones of staff members of the royal family while under contract to The News of the World, the News Corporation-owned tabloid shut down by Mr. Murdoch this month. The move to end the arrangement raises the question of whether Mr. Mulcaire will break his long silence over the phone hacking scandal that has engulfed the News Corporation. After refusing to speak publicly for four years since leaving jail about his role or about what his superiors at The News of the World might have known about his practices, within hours of the announcement he appeared in front of television cameras for the BBC outside his home to suggest he might speak soon. “As you can appreciate, we are in the middle of a number of inquiries at the moment,” he said. “It’s a very fluid and developing situation. Like I said, the developments have been different from day to day, and I have no further comment to make at this stage. However, this may change.” His trove of detailed private notes, seized from his home by the police in 2006, is at the core of the widening scandal. Names, numbers and details of phone hacking from the notes have come into public view through legal discovery in the courts, and show an array of victims well beyond the royals including celebrities, government officials and most notably a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and killed in 2002. Mr. Mulcaire himself is now a defendant in 37 lawsuits over phone hacking claims, with more suits being prepared and filed every week. Mr. Mulcaire employs at least one lawyer full time, and several others part time, according to two lawyers with firsthand knowledge of the arrangements, and there have been questions about how he could afford so costly a defense. In the hearing Tuesday, James Murdoch confirmed that the News Corporation was paying Mr. Mulcaire’s legal expenses, only for the company to move a day later to end the payments. Mr. Mulcaire could not be reached for further comment. Mr. Murdoch also confirmed payment of legal fees for Clive Goodman, the tabloid’s royals reporter who was also jailed in 2007, but the News Corporation did not say Wednesday whether it was ending those payments. Mr. Goodman has since been re-arrested in a new police investigation over allegations of police corruption. The Murdochs repeatedly said in their testimony before Parliament on Tuesday that they had not known about the hacking. In a separate, qualified concession, the News Corporation also announced that it would release the law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis from some of its client confidentiality requirements so that it could address questions from police and parliamentary inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption with respect to “what they were asked to do.” The law firm, which has counted the queen among its clients, was embroiled in the scandal because it reviewed The News of the World e-mail that suggested payments to the police. News International, the News Corporation’s British newspaper group, did not turn that information over to the police for four years. A full waiver could open up those files to victims of hacking who are lining up to sue the company. 1 2 Next Page » Don Van Natta Jr. contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/world/europe/21nova.html?ref=newscorporation">Janet Nova, Murdoch Lawyer, Helped Blocked Pie Attack<date>Published: July 20, 2011</date><text>LONDON — The heroics of Wendi Deng Murdoch drew gasps of awe when she lunged out of her seat in a committee room on Tuesday to protect her husband, Rupert Murdoch, from a protester wielding a shaving cream pie.But there was another woman who actually intervened before Mrs. Murdoch did: Janet Nova, the News Corporation’s interim group general counsel. It may have gone unnoticed in the scuffle and in the media hype that ensued, but Ms. Nova was the first to react to the protester’s approach. She leapt to her feet and, clutching her iPad, tried to block the man’s reach toward her boss. Mrs. Murdoch followed right behind her, and she appeared to reach over Ms. Nova as she swung her arm in a great arc to deliver a sharp punch. Ms. Nova, who is 46 and based in New York, is a graduate of Princeton and Columbia Law School who has been with the company since 1997. She was one of the troupe of lawyers and public-relationship advisers who prepared Mr. Murdoch for his appearance before a parliamentary committee looking into phone hacking by the company’s British newspapers. Through over two hours of questioning, Ms. Nova, wearing a gray suit, sat patiently a few feet behind and to the left of Mr. Murdoch. When the protester — identified in British news reports as Jonathan May-Bowles, a comedian who performs under the name Johnnie Marbles — stormed toward the witness table, Ms. Nova provided the first line of defense and Mrs. Murdoch the second, while James Murdoch, Rupert’s 38-year-old son, seemed frozen in surprise. It was a curious moment, transforming a hearing that was, for many onlookers, mainly about seeing Rupert Murdoch humbled into one in which he enjoyed at least a little bit of sympathy from the crowd in the room and from the millions of viewers who watched on television. While Ms. Nova’s role has gone largely unsung, Mrs. Murdoch’s actions immediately became a sensation on the Internet, where some people posting on Twitter coined a new verb — “I’ll Wendi you!” — and others sought more information about “the woman behind the punch.” Ms. Nova has been in her post for only a short time. Rupert Murdoch wrote in a company e-mail announcing her promotion on June 20 that she “has handled a number of major acquisitions for the company over the past several years, in addition to managing our corporate reporting and governance matters.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/latest-updates-on-phone-hacking-scandal-2/?ref=newscorporation">Latest Updates on Phone Hacking Scandal<date>July 20, 2011, 6:34 am</date><text>The Lede continued to follow developments in the phone hacking scandal in Britain on Wednesday. Video of Prime Minister David Cameron’s complete statement to the House of Commons on the scandal, and his answers to questions from members of Parliament, is embedded above. 2:10 P.M. |Commons Debate on Phone Hacking Ends The debate in the House of Commons on phone hacking has just ended and Parliament has now started its summer recess. On Twitter, one Conservative member of Parliament who has been at the center of the drama this week, Louise Mensch, writes that she is going to Disney World. In that spirit, The Lede is going to wrap up for the day, but we will be back on Thursday to cover any new developments in the scandal. In the meantime, please visit the home page of this Web site for any breaking news and to read what my colleagues in London have to say about the day’s events. Here is Alan Cowell’s overview of the latest developments and Graham Bowley’s report on News Corporation’s decision to stop paying the legal fees of the private investigator who hacked into phones for The News of the World, four years after he was jailed for doing so. As the American Journalism Review explains, supporters of the Murdochs, or those interested in a very different perspective on the scandal, might enjoy this Wall Street Journal editorial. Thanks for your comments. 1:56 P.M. |Is News Corp. Paying Anyone Else’s Legal Fees? The debate in Parliament is now coming to an end, with a statement from Jeremy Hunt, the culture, media and sport secretary. On The BBC News Web site, Robert Peston has an interesting new blog post about the legal questions that are emerging as central issues. One is the fact that News Corporation has, until today, been paying the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who was jailed for phone hacking on behalf of The News of the World. Another is that a London law firm retained by the company to review internal e-mails in 2007, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, has asked News Corporation to release it from its obligation of confidentiality so that it can respond to criticism of its work by James Murdoch. Mr. Peston writes: For months journalists, including myself, have asked News Corporation whether it was still paying the legal expenses of Glenn Mulcaire, the private detective imprisoned for phone hacking in 2007 who carried out illegal voice mail interceptions for the News of the World. The company controlled by the Murdoch family consistently refused to answer. Until yesterday, when James Murdoch – deputy chief operating officer of News Corp. – confirmed to MPs that those expenses had been paid by his company. And today, News Corp.’s newly created Management and Standards Committee decided it would stop paying Mr Mulcaire’s legal costs. So what about other former employees of the News of the World, who have been arrested? Is News Corp. continuing to pay their legal expenses? All of that’s under review, said a company spokesman. Separately News Corp. said it could not give permission to Harbottle &amp; Lewis, the firm of solicitors, to talk about how the solicitors had come to write a letter in May 2007, which was given to MPs, saying that illegal hacking was confined to a single rogue reporter…. The reason Harbottle’s letter has become so resonant is because it was based on a file of 300 News of the World emails (see my earlier posts – News International ‘found smoking gun e-mails’ and Police officer ‘sold royal family contact details’ – for more on this), which on June 20 of this year was passed to the Metropolitan Police. Yesterday, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald – who for News Corporation reviewed the emails in the file that related to bribes allegedly paid to the police – told MPs “I cannot imagine anyone looking at that file and not seeing evidence of crime on its face.” One of the unanswered questions about the News of the World scandal is why it took four years for News Corporation to pass these smoking-gun emails to the Met. 1:33 P.M. |Gobby Saved Writing on Twitter, Lousie Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament, reports that the Commons official in charge of security, the Serjeant at Arms, has decided to restore the credentials of a BBC journalist who was punished on Wednesday for securing images of the man who attacked Rupert Murdoch with a pie. Ms. Mensch writes that the journalist, Paul Lambert, known by the nickname Gobby, has gotten his Commons pass back — as has another reporter who was similarly sanctioned. The Serjeant at Arms informs me that the two journalists are having their Lobby passes restored. #SaveGobbyWed Jul 20 17:32:22 via webLouise Mensch LouiseMensch 1:16 P.M. |The Role of The BBC Enters the Debate As the debate continues in the House of Commons, several Conservative members of Parliament have suggested that the public inquiry into the media should include a review of what they call the liberal bias of The BBC’s news reports. The Conservatives uniformly claim that The BBC needs more commercial competition, since its reports are so widely-viewed. According to one member of Parliament, who is a former television executive, the nightly BBC News is watched by 5 million viewers, while ITV, the commercial channel, reaches about half that audience and Sky News, on the BSkyB satellite network started by Rupert Murdoch, is viewed by just 200,000 people a night. In response, Don Foster, a Liberal Democrat, says that he hopes the inquiry will not be used “to clip the wings of The BBC,” which is, incidentally, exactly what Mr. Murdoch has been demanding for years. Mr. Foster mentions that James Murdoch launched a ferocious assault on The BBC in a 2009 address to the Edinburgh Television Festival. Mr. Foster noted that the younger Mr. Murdoch said in that lecture, “The only reliable, durable, and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit.” On The Guardian’s live blog, Andrew Sparrow explains that Mr. Murdoch’s lecture that year apparently disturbed Gordon Brown, who was then the prime minister. According to Mr. Sparrow, an article in last week’s Sunday Times (another newspaper owned by the Murdochs) said that Mr. Brown “hated every word” of Mr. Murdoch’s attack on The BBC and the television regulator Ofcom. Isabel Oakeshott of The Sunday Times reported: Inside Downing Street, he pored over the text, line by line. “I can’t overstate how important that speech was,” said a former Labour strategist who was with Brown at the time. “It changed everything. He saw it as very rightwing and a direct attack on what we were doing. He felt the Murdochs didn’t share any of our values.” From the Labour benches, several speakers have defended the role of The BBC as a source of news but suggested that rules mandating impartial news reporting on British television should not be applied to newspapers. 12:32 P.M. |Complaints About Sanction for a BBC Journalist Louise Mensch, the Conservative member of Parliament who was questioning James Murdoch on Tuesday when his father Rupert was attacked by a pie-wielding “activist/comedian,” mentions that a BBC journalist who secured video of the attacker in police custody has had his credentials removed. Ms. Mensch suggests that the House of Commons should act to have this sanction reversed, in the interest of fostering freedom of the press. A very decent BBC producer has just had his parliamentary pass withdrawn PERMANENTLY (thus threatening his ability to do his job)…Wed Jul 20 15:11:00 via webtom bradby tombradby Paul Waugh, the editor of the Web site PoliticsHome.com, who witnessed the attack on Tuesday, reports: Thanks to the BBC’s fixer Paul Lambert, the world managed to see some great TV footage of Murdoch’s pieman as he was being held by the cops yesterday. But it seems that the House authorities, already furious at the breach of security by Jonathan May-Bowles (aka @jonniemarbles), were not pleased with all of the actions of the man known universally as Gobby. Some in the House were unhappy at the way Gobby and his TV camera pursued May-Bowles and the cops through the building, (at one stage intrepidly running down an up escalator, I hear). As a result, Gobby has had his Westminster pass withdrawn. Ms. Mensch also took to the Twitwaves to express her support for the new #SaveGobby campaign on the social network. Gobby banned by parliamentary authorities! Blimey this Murdoch thing is getting quite serious #savegobbyWed Jul 20 15:50:33 via webRobert Peston Peston Ms. Mensch’s Twitter feed reveals that, during the upcoming parliamentary recess, she plans to read the autobiography of Piers Morgan, a former editor of The News of the World and The Daily Mirror. On Tuesday, Ms. Mensch mistakenly claimed during the parliamentary hearings that Mr. Morgan boasted of phone hacking in his book. In fact, he wrote that he learned of the technique when he suspected that his own voice mail might have been hacked into by rival journalists. After Mr. Morgan rebuked Ms. Mensch on CNN for failing to read his book, and making accusations about his conduct only under the cloak of parliamentary privilege (which prevents him from suing her for libel), she asked him, via Twitter, to send her an autographed copy of his autobiography. Mr. Morgan replied that hre would do so, and write: “Louise, next time you lie about me under the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege, try reading the book first.” Sure @LouiseMensch : ‘Louise, next time you lie about me under the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege, try reading the book first.’Wed Jul 20 15:33:07 via webPiers Morgan piersmorgan 11:30 A.M. |More on Mulcaire’s Legal Fees Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament — who first asked Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of The News of the World, if her newspaper had paid police officers for information in 2003 — suggests that News Corporation continued to pay legal fees for Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator jailed in 2007 for phone hacking, until today because “they wanted to make sure he didn’t say anything additional that further incriminated anyone in the newspaper or the wider company.” David Allen Green a legal blogger for The News Statesman wrote on Wednesday: Since the revelations in the New York Times revived the phone hacking scandal back in September 2010, one of the most puzzling aspects has been the “settlement” agreement that News International had entered into with Glenn Mulcaire. In particular, as was pointed out at Jack of Kent, a conventional settlement agreement made no sense if Mulcaire was not actually an employee to begin with. Since then, it has become clear that the agreement had two key terms in addition to any cash payment for Mulcaire to compromise all and any legal claims against News International, if he ever had any such claims at all. First, there was an obligation of confidentiality on Mulcaire. This is standard in such agreements, though in this case it was clearly convenient to News International. A cynic may even suggest that was the whole point. Second, there appears to have been an indemnity for the payment of Mulcaire’s legal fees for defenses to civil claims. This may have been tied into a further right of News International to conduct his defense. This would have been sensible from a strategic point of view, as it appears News International was facing a number of actions as co-defendant with Mulcaire. … it would now seem that Mulcaire has no direct interest in co-ordinating any defense to the civil claims with News International. He may well feel at least morally released from any obligation of confidentiality. 10:58 A.M. |Piegate, Hackgate and ‘Dear Mr. Murdoch’ The debate in the House of Commons continues, although most of the benches have now emptied. This might be a good moment to catch up on some of the ways in which the scandal has moved into popular culture. First, there is an article on The Guardian’s Web site in which Jonathan May-Bowles, the “activist/comedian” who goes by the name Jonnie Marbles, explains and defends his decision to attack Rupert Murdoch with a pie plate filled with shaving-cream on Tuesday. (This .gif loop makes some forensic analysis of the pie attack possible, and raises the question of why it was just the women on the parliamentary panel who jumped to htier feet whn the attack was launched, as the men sat and watched.) The Guardian also has the news that Roger Taylor of the band Queen has released an updated version of his 1994 song, “Dear Mr. Murdoch.” Mr. Taylor’s song has been posted on Queen’s official YouTube channel. Elsewhere on YouTube, there is this highly unofficial fake trailer for a movie about the hacking scandal: 10:13 A.M. |Questions About a Whistle-Blower’s Testimony Earlier in the debate, Ed Miliband, the opposition leader, read aloud from an article on phone hacking at The News of the World published by The New York Times Magazine on Sept. 1, 2010. That article included statements by two sources that Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World who was at the time a media adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, knew about and approved of phone hacking by his reporters. In that article, my colleagues Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker and Graham Bowley reported: A dozen former reporters said in interviews that hacking was pervasive at News of the World. “Everyone knew,” one longtime reporter said. “The office cat knew.” One former editor said Coulson talked freely with colleagues about the dark arts, including hacking. “I’ve been to dozens if not hundreds of meetings with Andy” when the subject came up, said the former editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The editor added that when Coulson would ask where a story came from, editors would reply, “We’ve pulled the phone records” or “I’ve listened to the phone messages.” Sean Hoare, a former reporter and onetime close friend of Coulson’s, also recalled discussing hacking. The two men first worked together at The Sun, where, Hoare said, he played tape recordings of hacked messages for Coulson. At News of the World, Hoare said he continued to inform Coulson of his pursuits. Coulson “actively encouraged me to do it,” Hoare said. Hoare said he was fired during a period when he was struggling with drugs and alcohol. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Commons committee on culture, media and sport, points out that one of the two sources who connected Mr. Coulson to phone hacking was anonymous. The other, he notes, was Sean Hoare, a former News of the World reporter who died on Monday. According to Mr. Whittingdale, Mr. Hoare, who struggled with subsrance abuse, might not have been seen as a credible witness in a legal proceeding. He says: “it was widely believed that Sean Hoare’s testimony would not stand up in court.” 10:03 A.M. |Lawyers Ask Murdochs to Allow Them to Testify John Whittingdale, the Conservative chairman of the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport, rises to speak. Mr. Whittigndale’s committee questioned Rupert Murdoch and his son James on Tuesday. During their appearance, the two men repeatedly said that they had relied legal advice from a respected law firm, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, for advice on whether or not a cache of 2,500 internal e-mails contained no evidence of wrongdoing by senior editors at The News of the World. Mr. Whittingdale says that he has received a letter from Harbottle &amp; Lewis, in which the firm explained that it has now asked News Corporation to release the firm’s lawyers from “their obligation of confidentiality,” so that they can respond to the accusation that they failed to uncover evidence of wrongdoing in those e-mails. Mr. Whittingdale says that News Corporation has not yet agreed to the request from Harbottle &amp; Lewis, but urges the company to do so, “in the light of the assurances that we were given of their willingness to cooperate fully.” 9:37 A.M. |Miliband Defends His Media Adviser Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, rises to give his party’s view on the motion before the House of Commons, “that this House has considered public confidence in the media and the police.” He says that while there are indeed other important issues, the revelations that phone hacking was used to gather private information about not just celebrities and politicians but also “about the lives of others who never sought the public eye,” makes it vital to discuss the misconduct fully and put a stop to it. Mr. Miliband says, “we do not want to live in a country where the depraved deletion of a dead teenager” is considered acceptable. He adds that failures of the police and politicians to stop phone hacking need to end. From the Conservative benches, Mr. Miliband is asked about the conduct of one of his current aides, Tom Baldwin, who is a former reporter at The Times of London. A leading Conservative, Lord Ashcroft, who helped finance the last election campaign by his party, claimed this month that Mr. Baldwin had used illegal techniques to obtain his bank records when he was a reporter. Mr. Miliband replies that he has asked Mr. Baldwin and his former employer, The Times, which is also owned by Rupert Murdoch, about this allegation and both have denied that there is anything to it. The Times, Mr. Miliband says, “specifically confirm that he did nothing illegal.” As the Conservative benches laugh at the fact that Mr. Miliband is falling back on assurances from one of Mr. Murdoch’s newspapers, the leader of the opposition points out that, when he was at The Times, “Tom Baldwin’s line manager was the current education secretary.” 9:12 A.M. |A ‘Private and Confidential’ Letter From John Yates Alan Johnson, who was the home secretary before last year’s election, says that John Yates, the former assistant commissioner of Scotland Yard, told him in “a private and confidential letter” last week that the reason that a new police investigation into phone hacking commenced this year is that “in January 2011, News International began to cooperate properly with the police.” Mr. Johnson asks Mr. Cameron if the fact that this cooperation began at about the same time that Andy Coulson resigned from government was “a coincidence.” 9:02 A.M. |Did Cameron Have Advance Warning of New Investigation? Barry Gardiner, a Labour member of Parliament, intervenes to ask the prime minister if he had any advance notice of the new police investigation into phone hacking, which began just days after Andy Coulson resigned as his media adviser. Mr. Cameron says that he cannot speak for all of his staff, but he did not have any such warning himself. 9:00 A.M. |Main Debate Begins on Phone Hacking Moving on from the discussion of the prime minister’s statement on phone hacking, a formal debate in the House Commons begins with remarks from Mr. Cameron. He says that Parliament has led the public debate on phone hacking in recent weeks, which led to the end of News Corporation’s bid for full control of BSkyB, the satellite television network. 8:49 A.M. |Members of Parliament Asked to Drop Their Phones As the discussion of Mr. Cameron’s statement on phone hacking continues in Westminster, the Commons speaker, John Bercow, asks members of Parliament who are standing in an attempt to attract his notice to “stop fiddling with” their phones as they do so. 8:27 A.M. |Video of Cameron’s Complete Statement on Hacking Here, from Britain’s Channel 4 News, is video of Prime Minister David Cameron’s complete statement on phone hacking to the House of Commons, which was made about two hours ago: 8:21 A.M. |News Corp. Reportedly Stops Paying Mulcaire Legal Fees Laura Kuenssberg, chief political correspondent for The BBC News Channel, reports on Twitter that “News Corp. is terminating the payment of legal fees to Glen Muclaire, the private investigator convicted of hacking.” Mr. Mulcaire was jailed in 2007 for the phone hacking he did on behalf of The News of the World. During his testimony to the Commons select committee on home affairs on Tuesday, James Murdoch admitted that his company had continued to pay legal fees for Mr. Mulcaire after he was released from prison, even as it said that the investigator’s phone hacking operation was despicable and unsanctioned by editors and executives.

Referring to Mr. Coulson, Ms. Clwyd suggests that the prime minister “obviously cannot smell a rat when he has one in his midst.” Mr. Cameron chides Ms. Clwyd’s use of metaphor and does not address the question of Mr. Coulson retaining his pass, despite having resigned from the government in January. 8:01 A.M. |‘Gotcha!’ Pressed further about his employment of Mr. Coulson, the prime minister names former journalists who have worked as media advisers to the Labour Party and says, “Gotcha!” Mr. Cameron mentioned both Alastair Campbell, a former tabloid journalist who worked as Tony Blair’s media strategist, and Tom Baldwin, a former reporter for Rupert Murdoch’s Times of London who is currently an aide to the Labour leader Ed Miliband. A controversial headline from 1982. Mr. Cameron’s use of the word “Gotcha” recalls a 1982 headline from The Sun, Mr. Murdcoh’s tabloid, which featured that word on its front page with a report on the sinking of an Argentine ship, the General Belgrano, during the Falklands War. Roy Greenslade, a columnist for The Guardian who was an editor at The Sun in 1982, reported that Rupert Murdoch himself played a role in the use of that headline by the newspaper. Mr. Greenslade explained in 2002: By chance, the war coincided with a pay strike by the journalists’ union so, on the evening of May 2, only a dozen executives, including me, were producing the paper when the first genuinely dramatic war news broke. A news agency reported that the General Belgrano had been hit. Wendy Henry shouted “Gotcha!” not as a suggested headline but as a spontaneous reaction, the kind of black joke common to every newspaper office. [The Sun's editor, Kelvin] MacKenzie seized on it and designed a front page which said: “GOTCHA. Our lads sink gunboat and hole cruiser.” The first edition was off stone before more detailed news of the Belgrano’s sinking arrived. It dawned on us that there might have been a huge loss of life, and as Petrie read the agency reports aloud, the mood changed. Realising that “Gotcha” might be inappropriate, MacKenzie drew up another front page with a new headline: “Did 1,200 Argies drown?” The Sun’s owner, Rupert Murdoch, happened to walk on to the floor as MacKenzie was completing the new layout and said he didn’t see the need to replace “Gotcha.” MacKenzie disagreed and subsequent editions carried the less controversial line. Without a strike, it’s likely that the original page one would have been altered so quickly that few copies would have left the building. But the time it took to make the change ensured that hundreds of thousands of the first edition were published and “Gotcha” came to symbolize ever after the Sun’s, and MacKenzie’s, cynical, jingoistic, bloodthirsty war coverage. 7:51 A.M. |Cameron’s ‘Permanent Conversation’ With Coulson Mr. Cameron is asked another direct question about how he responded in 2010 to allegations that his media adviser, Andy Coulson, knew about phone hacking when he was the editor of The News of the World. The prime minister says that, as new reports were published last year about phone hacking, he had “a permanent conversation if you like,” with Mr. Coulson asking all the time, “was this new evidence that he knew about phone hacking?” Mr. Cameron adds, “if it was he would have to go.” Mr. Cameron leaves unanswered the question of whether any doubts about Mr. Coulson’s knowledge of phone hacking were raised in his mind by those reports. 7:38 A.M. |Cameron Set Himself a ‘Test’ on Coulson Emily Thornberry, a Labour member of Parliament, asks Mr. Cameron to say when he read the Sept. 1, 2010 New York Times article which suggested that Andy Coulson did know about phone hacking. Mr. Cameron replies that the article’s allegations were republished in the British press. “I set myself a credible test,” he says, “if anybody brought me credible information that he knew about hacking, I’d fire him.” In response to further questions, Mr. Cameron refuses to say if he ever discussed News Corporation’s effort to take full control of the satellite broadcaster BSkyB with executives from that company. 7:32 A.M. |On Cameron’s Friendship With Brooks David Lammy, a Labour member of Parliament, describes informal meetings Mr. Cameron has had with his friend, Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of New International, and asks if “such informality on his behalf” is improper. Mr. Cameron replies that it is not, and notes that Ms. Brooks said in her testimony on Tuesday that she visited the prime minister’s residence about six times a year when Labour was in power. He also refers to the fact that Ms. Brooks had a “sleepover” at No. 10 Downing Street when Gordon Brown was prime minister. He says that he has never seen Ms. Brooks “in her pajamas.” 7:23 A.M. |On the New Home Affairs Select Committee Report Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons select committee on home affairs, asks Mr. Cameron if he has had time to read his panel’s new report, published early on Wednesday, which suggests that News Corporation’s British newspaper division, News International, “deliberately” tried to obstruct the initial police investigation of phone hacking. Mr. Vaz also says that a former director of public prosecutions told the committee that any proper review of a cache of internal News International e-mails, which have been held by the law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis for years, would have made it plain in five minutes that crimes were committed. As Christopher Hope of The Daily Telegraph reported on Wednesday morning: Harbottle &amp; Lewis took possession of hundreds of internal emails from the News of the World in 2007 after being hired by News International. The firm indicated in a short letter to News International that the emails did not show wider evidence of criminality. This document was relied upon by the publisher during parliamentary inquiries in 2009. Yesterday, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, the former director of public prosecutions, who in May was asked to review the information, told members of the Commons media select committee that evidence of criminality in the files was “blindingly obvious”. He said that if police had seen the scale of criminality in the file when it was compiled in 2007 they would have opened a corruption inquiry immediately. 7:12 A.M. |What Was Cameron’s Response to Times Article? Mr. Cameron is pressed to say what his response was to The New York Times article last September that suggested that Andy Coulson knew about and sanctioned phone hacking when he was a tabloid editor. Mr. Cameron replies that there was no new information in that article to raise any questions in his mind. That article, like a July, 2009 report in The Guardian, dealt not with new evidence gathered by the police after Mr. Coulson resigned, but about how much of the evidence gathered by the police in 2006 was not properly examined. 7:06 A.M. |Miliband Claims Cameron Had a ‘Conflict of Interest’ Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, asks Mr. Cameron to address what he calls the prime minister’s “conflict of interest” regarding wrongdoing at the British newspaper division of News Corporation. Mr. Miliband claims that Mr. Cameron’s aides “built a wall of silence between the facts and the prime minister.” The opposition leader suggests that Mr. Cameron’s failure to ask questions about Mr. Coulson’s role in phone hacking after an article published by The New York Times on Sept. 1, 2010 suggested that the practice had been more widespread during his editorship than the initial police investigation revealed. In response, Mr. Cameron objects that he had now made all of his meetings with News Corporation officials before the election public, but Labour Party leaders have not done so. He continues to detail what he says was the overly close relationship between Labour officials and editors and executives in Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. 6:53 A.M. |Cameron’s Statement on Hiring Coulson Mr. Cameron says that his chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, behaved entirely properly in refusing to accept a briefing from John Yates, the assistant police commissioner, on phone hacking, last September. He says that it would have been improper for anyone on his staff to receive privileged information on police inquiries into phone hacking at The News of the World. It emerged that in September 2010 after allegations appeared in the New York Times about the extent of phone hacking at the NoW, the Met offered the PM a briefing. The prime minister continues to say that Neil Wallis, a former deputy editor of The News of the World, was never employed by the Conservative Party. Mr. Wallis, who was arrested last week in connection with phone hacking, might, Mr. Cameron adds, have provided informal advice to Andy Coulson, who was then Mr. Cameron’s media aide, before last year’s election. Mr. Cameron then defends his decision to employ Andy Coulson in 2007, just months after he had resigned from The News of the World over the first reported instances of phone hacking. Mr. Cameron says that if Mr. Coulson knew about phone hacking, “he will not only have lied to me,” but also “perjured himself in a court of law.” Mr. Cameron adds, “I have an old-fashioned view about innocent until proven guilty,” but says that “if it turns out I have been lied to,” by Mr. Coulson, he will then apologize for the decision to hire him. He also says that Mr. Coulson’s “work at Downing Street has not been the subject of any serious complaint.” 6:42 A.M. |Cameron’s Promises to Answer All Questions Reuters TVPrime Minister David Cameron addressed Parliament in London on Wednesday on the phone hacking scandal. At the start of his statement, Mr. Cameron says that he will review recent developments and name the people he has appointed to a panel of inquiry into phone hacking and media practices. He also promises to answer “at some length all of the questions” that have been raised about his relationship to Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World who was arrested recently in connection with a new police investigation into the scandal. 6:33 A.M. |Cameron Recalls Parliament British Prime Minister David Cameron has recalled Parliament for a debate on developments in the phone hacking scandal. He is due to make a statement to the House of Commons in a few minutes. Readers can watch live video of that statement and the ensuing debate on The BBC’s Democracy Live site. We will have updates here on The Lede.</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/opinion/20dowd.html?ref=newscorporation">From Gallipoli to Singapore<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>Right before a clown threw blue shaving cream on Rupert Murdoch and Murdoch’s pink-clad wife threw a roundhouse at the clown, the most powerful media mogul in history was reminiscing about his father.In a meeting last week in London with the parents of the murdered 13-year-old Milly Dowler, whose cellphone was hacked by his hacks — digital activity that left her family with a hope that she might still be alive — Murdoch said The News of the World had not lived up to the standards of his father and mother. Now he was talking sentimentally to British members of Parliament investigating the hacking and Scotland Yard bribery scandal about how his father had seen newspapers as a force for good. “I just wanted to say that I was brought up by a father who was not rich but was a great journalist,” the 80-year-old Murdoch said. “And he, just before he died, bought a small paper specifically saying in his will it had given him the chance to do good. And I remember what he did and what he was most proud of and for which he was hated by many people in this country for many, many years, which was expose the scandal in Gallipoli, which I remain very, very proud of.” The late Keith Murdoch, the grandson of two Scottish ministers, was a media baron in Australia who wielded the power to make and break prime ministers, just as his son later would. And like Rupert, Keith’s heart, or as one Australian writer put it, “what he would have called his heart,” was drawn to brash tabloids. As a young journalist during World War I, Keith Murdoch became famous when he visited the Gallipoli campaign and broke censorship rules barring any criticism of the conduct of war or tally of casualty figures. He wrote home to the Australian prime minister, a family friend, and he sneaked off to London to blow the whistle there — in a jingoistic, exaggerated way his son would appreciate — about the incompetence of the British command in charge of the decimation in Turkey, where 120,000 soldiers died, including 8,500 Australian infantry and light horsemen. Old posters for the brilliant 1981 movie “Gallipoli” give Rupert Murdoch a producing credit. He financed half the movie to show the world why his father had been right. Rupert wanted to avenge his father with the British establishment, and what sweeter way to do it than to take over the British press, including its most prestigious broadsheet, The Times of London, and help decide who runs Britain. At Tuesday’s hearing before a parliamentary committee, Murdoch smiled as he admitted that he sometimes had to go in the backdoor of 10 Downing Street to have tea with a grateful prime minister. But even the backdoor may be barred to him now. And, as the scandal creeps up the trellis of British power, who knows now how long it will be David Cameron’s home? The hunters became the hunted during three hours of riveting testimony in the House of Commons. The News Corporation trio, baked in the bottom-feeding and whatever-it-takes business, seemed coached. They would say whatever it takes. They stuck to a hoary formula for scandals, claiming the cognitive advantage that being on top of the world left them out of touch. Mistakes were made, but not by the captains of the ship. We deeply regret these things we were in no way involved in. We’re transparent, even though we’re still paying off former employees to keep their mouths shut. Playing the ruthless mogul reduced to helpless victim, Rupert came across better than his 38-year-old son James, with the Haldeman buzz cut, the American Harvard dropout accent, the “Mad Men” skinny blue tie, and the ingratiating over-articulateness hiding the arrogant entitlement. Rebekah Brooks, the 43-year-old former editor of The News of the World and daughter-figure to Rupert, was a prideful pre-Raphaelite Medusa, with a sweet face and soft voice spinning tales of innocence that didn’t quite gel. At hearings revealing their corruption, the police revealed their incompetence, unable to stop a lame comedian from further victimizing their self-professed victim. Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids pandered to the lowest common denominator, but, in the end, his sleazy henchmen were lower than the people they pandered to. People had a limit, as it turned out. Citizen Murdoch was brought low, his grip loosened and his myth deflated, by the power of social opprobrium. His most revealing moment was when he volunteered his admiration of Singapore, calling it the most “open and clear society in the world.” Its leaders are so lavishly paid, he said, that “there’s no temptation, and it is the cleanest society you’d find anywhere.” It was instructive that Murdoch chose to praise a polished, deeply authoritarian police state. Maybe that’s how corporations would live if they didn’t have to believe in people.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/world/europe/20factcheck.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch, ‘Surprised and Shocked,’ Is Likely to Face More Questions<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Rupert and James Murdoch said repeatedly during their extended testimony before a parliamentary committee in Britain that their involvement in managing the News Corporation’s response to the phone hacking scandal was limited. Rupert Murdoch said he felt let down by “the people that I trusted and then, maybe the people they trusted.”Even so, the Murdochs’ defense of their roles highlighted several issues that continuing investigations by parliamentary committees and the police are likely to examine in greater detail. Among them: PAYMENTS FOR DEFENSE James Murdoch, the 38-year-old News Corporation deputy chief operating officer who oversees News International, the News Corporation’s British subsidiary, told members of Parliament that he was “as surprised as you are” to learn that the company had been paying the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire, The News of the World’s phone hacking specialist, and Clive Goodman, the tabloid’s royal reporter. Both men pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges and went to jail in January 2007. At another point, Murdoch described himself as “surprised and shocked” when he was told about the legal aid to the former employees. The statements were surprising because the legal arrangements are costly for the company. Mr. Mulcaire is now listed as a defendant in 37 phone hacking claims, with more being prepared and filed every week, lawyers say. Mr. Mulcaire has at least one full-time lawyer devoted to defending the crush of civil cases and several others working part time, according to two lawyers with firsthand knowledge of the arrangement. James Murdoch also told Parliament that he did not know how much Mr. Mulcaire’s legal fees have cost or whether the payments have stopped. Pressed by members of the committee, Mr. Murdoch seemed open to the idea that the company would stop paying Mr. Mulcaire’s legal fees. “I would like to do that,” he said. “I don’t know what the status of what we are doing now or what his contract was.” But both he and Rupert Murdoch said such “contracts” could make it difficult to stop the payments. They did not provide more detail about the contracts, including who authorized them or whether they had the ability to terminate them. Since his release from jail in the summer of 2007, Mr. Mulcaire has never spoken publicly about his role in phone hacking — or what his superiors might have known about his activities. With his wife and five children, Mr. Mulcaire lives in a modest home in Cheam, south of London. For four years, he has steadfastly refused constant requests for comment from the news media and has invoked his right against self-incrimination in every lawsuit. PAYMENTS TO THE POLICE Members of Parliament pressed for more information about whether Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who became Prime Minister David Cameron’s communications director at 10 Downing Street, had authorized payments to the police in return for information. Mr. Coulson was arrested on July 8. Both James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks, the former head of News International, were asked about reports that for four years, News International had e-mail evidence that it had handed over for review to the London law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis that included revelations about payments to the police during Mr. Coulson’s time as editor. The firm had been hired to help defend the company against a wrongful termination lawsuit. They both said they had become aware of the incriminating information last spring after executives decided to re-examine the 2007 material given to the law firm as the hacking scandal gained momentum. James Murdoch said he was shown the evidence, and agreed “immediately” that it should be turned over to the police. Ms. Brooks said that the discovery occurred in April. However, the company turned over the evidence to the police on June 20. Members of Parliament may also seek to question Les Hinton, who resigned on Friday as publisher of The Wall Street Journal and headed News International during the initial phone hacking inquiry. James Murdoch said he “can’t speak” to what Mr. Hinton knew when the initial phone hacking review was conducted and had not asked him. In response to these comments by James Murdoch and Ms. Brooks, Harbottle &amp; Lewis issued a statement that suggested it had information that would contradict Mr. Murdoch’s account, but they were prevented from sharing it. “We asked News International to release us from our professional duties of confidentiality in order that we could respond to any inaccurate statements or contentions and to explain events in 2007,” the managing partner, Glen Atchison, said in the statement. “News International declined that request, and so we are still unable to respond in any detail as to our advice or the scope of our instructions in 2007, which is a matter of great regret.” PAYMENTS TO VICTIMS The decision by James Murdoch to authorize a confidential £725,000 settlement ($1.1 million) in the first hacking lawsuit filed against The News of the World also came under scrutiny. A payment intended to settle the case, filed by the soccer union boss Gordon Taylor, came in June 2008 after News International learned of the evidence that he had managed to pry from Scotland Yard. That included a transcript of one of his voice mails marked “For Neville,” an apparent reference to The News of the World’s chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck. Had that been revealed in court, it would have contradicted News International executives’ evidence given to the same House of Commons committee that hacking was limited to one “rogue” reporter, Mr. Goodman, the royal reporter. James Murdoch said Tuesday that he had been given an oral briefing on the Taylor case and “did not get involved directly” in the negotiations. Asked whether he was aware that hacking was illegal, James Murdoch acknowledged, “That was my understanding.” He declined to answer a question, put to him several times, as to whether he would release Mr. Taylor and his lawyers from the confidentiality clause in the agreement so that they might speak publicly about their knowledge of the negotiations. “It is a confidential agreement,” he said. Mr. Murdoch also denied that the settlement was motivated by a desire to keep the matter from becoming public. His father said he knew nothing about it until he read about it in July 2009, although he stopped short of naming the newspaper that had first published it (The Guardian). James Murdoch said the decision to settle was a pragmatic one because he had been advised by outside lawyers that his newspaper would lose in a judgment at trial, and damages and legal costs were estimated to run as high as £500,000 to £1 million, or $800,000 to $1.6 million. At that time, settlements in privacy violation cases typically ran in the tens of thousands of pounds, and legal fees rarely ran that high, lawyers who handle those cases said. Indeed, when the Formula One boss Max Mosely later won a £60,000 settlement ($96,000) in a privacy case, it was considered a record payout in such cases. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 22, 2011 An article on Wednesday about important questions that the News Corporation is likely to confront as it continues to deal with the British phone hacking scandal misstated, in some editions, the age of James Murdoch, the companyâs deputy chief operating officer. He is 38, not 43.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/arts/television/at-fox-news-a-scandal-hits-home.html?ref=newscorporation">At Fox News, a Scandal Hits Home<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>The pie attack may have been the best thing that happened to Fox News on Tuesday.A protester accosted Rupert Murdoch with a shaving cream pie as Mr. Murdoch was appearing before a British parliamentary committee. And that disruption was a welcome diversion for Fox News anchors struggling to cover their boss as he struggled to prop up the reputation of his troubled media empire. All the cable news networks covered the parliamentary hearing live on Tuesday. So did Fox News, though its producers didn’t have much of a choice — the scandal that has engulfed the channel’s parent company, the News Corporation, is too big to ignore. Or examine too closely. Moments after the pie incident, the pool camera in the committee room abruptly cut away. Fox turned the newscast over to Sky News, its sister network in Britain (also owned by Mr. Murdoch), and let British colleagues report on the commotion. (They showed lots of slow-motion replays of Mr. Murdoch’s wife, Wendi, smacking the intruder.) When other cable news programs moved on to critique what Mr. Murdoch and his son James had said, Fox News stayed with the pie until the hearing resumed. After Mr. Murdoch and his son were excused, the Fox anchor Bill Hemmer gave a brief, stilted summary, then segued to a bit of good news, noting that News Corporation shares “went up 5 percent” during the testimony. And that gingerly restraint was all the more noticeable at a channel known for its brio and lack of nuance. Perhaps accordingly, rival cable shows gleefully reveled in the News Corporation’s fall from grace: a Bloomberg News analyst on CNN likened Mr. Murdoch to King Lear; on Current TV, Keith Olbermann, who once worked at Fox Sports, said Mr. Murdoch was closer to the evil Emperor Palpatine in the “Star Wars” films. The CNN correspondent Richard Quest noted that James Murdoch seemed “out of his depth,” while his father appeared “out of touch.” The British documentary filmmaker Michael Cockerell agreed, announcing that “the emperor has no clothes.” And just before the proceedings began, CNN showed a disturbing home video of the teenager Milly Dowler that was made not long before she was murdered. It was the revelation that News of the World reporters had hacked into her phone and erased messages while she was believed to be missing that led to the cataclysmic shakeup at the paper’s owner, the News Corporation. On Tuesday morning Fox News focused more on Mr. Murdoch’s apology to the Dowler family. It showed a clip of Mr. Murdoch telling the committee that he wasn’t aware of the misdeeds at The News of the World because the newspaper, now defunct, accounted for “less than 1 percent of my company.” And it showed the chairman of the News Corporation saying that the rest of his more than 50,000 employees around the world are “proud, ethical and distinguished people.” It wasn’t that easy for Fox News to find feel-good clips. Mr. Murdoch said he was shocked and appalled by the hacking and other criminal acts, but throughout the hearing he bridled at any suggestion that he did anything wrong. When asked by a member of Parliament whether he should resign, his answer was anything but humble. “No,” he replied shortly. He blamed employees whom he had trusted and who let him down. “It’s for them to pay,” Mr. Murdoch said, adding later, “Frankly, I’m the best person to clean this up.” It was a remarkably peppery performance by Mr. Murdoch, 80, who is not accustomed to being publicly questioned about his leadership. American viewers, too, are also not used to that kind of precision grilling. Too often, televised Congressional hearings in Washington are self-serving rituals by elected officials eager to assure constituents that they, too, are angered by golden parachutes, credit-default swaps or deficit spending. Witnesses read long prepared statements and so do senators and members of Congress — the give-and-take is more about political grandstanding than fact-finding. On Tuesday, the chairman of the British committee turned down Mr. Murdoch’s request to open with a prepared statement. (He still managed to read it at the end.) But there was also comparatively little bombast and preening by the members of Parliament. They mostly looked like lawyers taking a deposition from a tricky defendant, trying to pin down the mogul and his top executives on facts and apparent contradictions. Viewers who tried to follow the questioning may have been confused by the accumulation of unfamiliar names and dates. But there was no mistaking the discomfort on Fox News.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/business/media/murdochs-caught-a-break-with-testimony-analysts-say.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdochs Caught a Break With Testimony, Analysts Say<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>After days of intense anxiety over their appearance before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday, there seemed to be consensus inside the company and out that the Murdochs and the News Corporation had finally caught a break.Instead of finding a signal that this was the beginning of the end of Rupert Murdoch’s run at the helm of his company, analysts stressed that there was no single revelatory moment during the proceedings. If the Murdochs seemed at times distant, even oblivious, to what was going on in their own company, there were no obvious admissions of wrongdoing or glaring contradictions in their testimony, analysts said. “This was the best day these guys have had in a really long time,” said David Bank, media analyst for RBC Capital Markets. “No shoe dropped, no smoking gun was found, it all sort of sounded kind of contained.” After losing billions of dollars in market value, the News Corporation’s stock recovered a significant chunk of its value on the Nasdaq, rising almost 6 percent during the day to close at $16.25 a share. And after Mr. Murdoch and his son James concluded two hours of often tense testimony to a House of Commons committee, there was little of the widespread scorn that has greeted almost everything the Murdochs have said and done in the more than two weeks since the most recent voice mail hacking scandal at News Corporation’s British newspaper operation erupted. Summing up the high stakes and low expectations surrounding the hearing, another analyst, Thomas Eagan of Collins Stewart, noted: “Neither Rupert nor James did any damage to the company.” Inside the company, executives seemed relieved at how relatively smoothly the process went. “No one is despondent, no one thinks this went poorly,” said one person briefed on Tuesday’s events who asked not to be identified revealing private conversations. “I wouldn’t bet against those two.” The day was not without its moments of anxiety for News Corporation executives and the team of outside personnel who spent the weekend preparing the Murdochs for their testimony. Both men expected to deliver opening statements. But just minutes before the hearing began, they were informed that no such remarks would be permitted. The elder Murdoch’s headline remark from the hearing — that Tuesday was “the most humble day of my life” — was actually part of the scripted statement he had hoped to make. The News Corporation released the statement while Mr. Murdoch was still testifying. And Mr. Murdoch spoke it in full at the very end of the hearing. Mr. Murdoch did appear to be thrown off in the beginning, struggling to complete his thoughts and pausing often as he spoke — a loss of orientation that some in his inner circle attributed to his surprise over not being allowed to deliver introductory remarks. But as the afternoon wore on, he appeared more collected. The same was true of his son. Analysts noted that the market was watching James in particular, looking for signs of whether the man who is presumed to be the chief executive heir apparent was up to the task. “It was a credibility-building day for James,” Mr. Bank said. “I don’t know that it makes succession by him any more definite, but it prevented what could have been the event of making it far less likely.” And the market appeared to like what it saw. “Every time James spoke, the stock ticked up,” Mr. Bank added. The elder Murdoch was being carefully watched by analysts who had been critical of his recent decisions at News Corporation and who have argued that he should step down as chief executive to remove the financial drag his leadership is causing the stock. Instead, Mr. Murdoch took the opportunity to reassert his control of the company. When he was asked by Louise Mensch, a Conservative lawmaker, if he had ever considered resigning. “No,” he said emphatically. “Because I feel that people that I trusted let me down, I think that they behaved disgracefully,” he said. “Frankly, I am the best person to clean this up.” Even the attack by a pie-wielding assailant on the elder Murdoch seemed to work in his favor. After a 15-minute break in which the assailant was taken away by the police, Rupert Murdoch reappeared at the witness table in shirtsleeves and the dynamic in the room and on the cable channels covering the hearing live shifted in his favor. The company still faces a reckoning on multiple fronts — in the British and American legal systems, on Wall Street and in the court of public opinion — that threatens its reputation and certainly its future in the newspapers. Reuters reported Tuesday night that the company’s independent directors had hired two prominent lawyers, former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and Mary Jo White, a former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, to advise them. Though Mr. Murdoch may have outperformed many expectations on Tuesday, he showed signs of strain at times. Martin Dunn, a former News Corporation executive who most recently edited a rival newspaper, The Daily News in New York, said the elder Mr. Murdoch seemed tired, stressed and “a little beaten up” by the hearing process. “It must be very hard, at 80 years of age, after spending four decades building up a company, to find yourself under attack in what is an unprecedented way,” Mr. Dunn said of the elder Mr. Murdoch. “I think that showed.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/world/europe/20hacking.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdochs Deny That They Knew of Illegal Acts<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>LONDON — It was riveting theater, a newly emboldened parliamentary committee facing off against the 80-year-old Rupert Murdoch, the world’s most powerful media mogul, in a series of exchanges designed to get to the bottom of the phone hacking scandal that has engulfed not just Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation, but also Britain’s political and law-enforcement elite.In two hours of intense questioning broken only by a bizarre incident in which Mr. Murdoch was accosted with what appeared to be a foil pie plate filled with shaving cream, both he and his son James declared repeatedly that they had been shocked to discover something that has become increasingly apparent: that phone hacking and other illegal behavior were endemic at their News of the World tabloid, which is now defunct. Even so, the Murdochs and Rebekah Brooks, a former editor at the paper who resigned from the News Corporation on Friday, only to be arrested on Sunday on suspicion of phone hacking and bribing the police, apologized again and again for the failures at their company. “I would just like to say one sentence,” Rupert Murdoch said, breaking at one point into a long answer by his son, the News Corporation’s deputy chief operating officer. “This is the most humble day of my life.” But his humility did not extend to declaring that he was at fault or that he should step down from his company. “I feel that people I trusted — I don’t know who, on what level — have let me down, and I think they have behaved disgracefully, and it’s for them to pay,” he said. “And I think, frankly, that I’m the best person to see it through.” While the elder Mr. Murdoch has long had the reputation of being a hands-on manager, pressing for and savoring the scoops scored by the newspapers he had always felt were the soul of his media empire, he said in his testimony that in the case of The News of the World, he had no knowledge of the specifics of what was going on. He did not know, for example, that his company had paid confidential out-of-court settlements of £600,000 and £1 million to two victims of phone hacking. Nor, he said, did he know that the company was paying the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator under contract to The News of the World who was convicted in 2007 of hacking into the phones of staff members of the royal family. James Murdoch said he had not known about paying Mr. Mulcaire’s legal fees either, and was “as surprised as you are that some of these arrangements had been made.” The Murdochs shut down the tabloid last week in a futile effort to contain a crisis that has also claimed the careers of two high-ranking police officers and two top News Corporation officials, caused the company to withdraw a much-wanted $12 billion takeover bid of a broadcasting company, and led to the arrests of 10 former News of the World editors and reporters. The hearings (Ms. Brooks appeared separately) provided a gripping spectacle of executives who once commanded unassailable political power enduring sustained questioning from lawmakers enjoying a newfound confidence. There was Rupert Murdoch, looking every bit his age, appearing at times to lose his concentration and sometimes taking so long to answer questions that he seemed not to have heard them at all. There was James Murdoch, his 38-year-old heir apparent, sharp, engaged and seeming alarmed at the prospect that his father would lose his way, quick to leap in when the elder Mr. Murdoch wavered or appeared uncertain. Mr. Murdoch’s glamorous wife, Wendi Murdoch, 42, sat directly behind her husband in the visitors’ section of the hearing room. At one point, a man suddenly rose from his seat and advanced on Rupert Murdoch, striking him with what appeared to be a pie tin filled with shaving cream, or possibly custard. That caused Mrs. Murdoch to rise from her chair and slug the attacker with a swift right swing. The committee chairman, John Whittingdale, a Consevative member of Parliament, hastily declared a short recess. The attacker was later identified in British news reports as Jonathan May-Bowles, a stand-up comedian. According to The Guardian, he was sending Twitter messages about the incident. “It is a far better thing that I do now than I have ever done before #splat,” the attacker apparently wrote, in a homage to “A Tale of Two Cities,” just before unleashing the foam. He was escorted from the building in handcuffs. Members of the committee tried their best to get the Murdochs to explain why the company had repeatedly claimed that phone hacking was limited to a single “rogue” reporter. The answer, James Murdoch said, was that he had received bad advice — from his own executives, from the police, from his lawyers, even from the Press Complaints Commission. All had told him, he said, that “there was no illegality,” and he said he had no reason to doubt their word. It was a matter of “deep frustration” and “real regret” that the facts had not emerged sooner, he said. 1 2 Next Page » Alan Cowell, Ravi Somaiya and Graham Bowley contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/opinion/20linkof.html?ref=newscorporation">Why We Need the Tabloids<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>Los AngelesAS long as we have had tabloids, we have had tabloid scandals. Weighing in on the spate of scandals plaguing the British tabloid press, one commentator in 1936 acidly condemned what he called “the almost unbelievable indecency of the intrusion of the tabloid newspaper into people’s private lives.” Surely only the most degraded, low-minded people, he claimed, could produce this kind of news.  The article, from the magazine Fortnightly, was part of an ongoing debate in the interwar years about the intrusions of certain newspapers — the tabloids chief among them — into moments of “private grief.” The debate eventually made its way into the House of Commons, where major news agencies were encouraged to punish reporters who violated standards of decency in pursuit of a story. Surely, 75 years on, newspapers should have learned their lesson.  As recent events have shown, the tabloids have not lost their grip on indecent reporting, especially when it comes to breaches of privacy.  Yet this is, I think, for the better.  Rupert Murdoch, in his grilling before a Parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, said that he did not support an absolute right to privacy. He should be commended for that, even though many of the tactics used by journalists at his now-shuttered News of the World — hacking into the cellphone messages of crime victims, slain soldiers’ families, government officials and members of the royal family, and paying police sources for information — were beyond the pale of acceptable reporting. One does not have to support illegal activity in order to defend intrusive reporting. Perhaps intrusiveness is “indecent,” but who’s to say that is reason enough to tighten restrictions or create new laws to prevent it (or create another flaccid governmental investigation into the activities of the press, as Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered)?  The concepts of privacy and decency are so slippery (and class-bound) that they are not really the stuff of effective (or desirable) legislation when it comes to the press.    Leaving aside the illegal activities of News of the World, part of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation empire, the truth is that the vast majority of the tabloids carry out their news coverage above board. They are not an external source of infection, slowly contaminating the mainstream press, but rather an extension, and often an exaggeration, of the basic logic that animates all news reporting.  Every journalist, not only those working for the tabloids, is called upon to take risks in the pursuit of truth — usually within agreed-upon limits. And it is true that, to a remarkable degree, even the most egregious news outlets adhere to those limits. The tabloids may be sneakier and more persistent than more respected news sources, but this is a matter of degree, not kind. The tabloids may test the limits of the ethically or legally acceptable, but they are often doing so in the service of a popular desire to see behind the facade of public life. They rely on the appeal (a very human one) of seeing elements of our societies that are often shamefully hidden away from view.  The tabloids are the newspapers most dutifully dedicated to ideas of exposure, and are willing to take risks in the service of that goal. It may be the case that much of what they expose is perhaps of little social import, but this is more a matter of taste, and the tabloids certainly never claimed to be tasteful.  Certainly the fact that the American tabloids first broke important news stories, like the extramarital affair of John Edwards, the former United States senator and Democratic vice-presidential nominee, suggests that they are not merely peddling insignificant gossip.  Watching the painfully choreographed, and highly policed, red-carpet arrival of Prince William and Kate Middleton at a recent Los Angeles polo match reminded me why intrusive journalistic tactics are often called upon. They exist to break down the barriers of access that keep social elites at a remove from ordinary people. The tabloids, throughout history, on both sides of the Atlantic, have been predicated on chipping away at that division. They play a fundamental role in democratic cultures, especially in societies characterized by the pull between the demands of a mass society and the persistence of social and economic inequality.  Of course, not all of the hacking at the center of the News of the World scandal had to do with social elites.  Some very ordinary, private people have been harmed merely because their lives had been touched by horrible crimes — perhaps most sensitively, the terrorist bombings of the London transit system on July 7, 2005.  Certainly laws protecting citizens from wiretapping and computer hacking should apply just as readily to those people, but that does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that any coverage of ordinary people, even if it might be considered invasive, should not be allowed, or even that it should be condemned as indecent.  Within limits, digging into private lives and exposing unsettling information is, and will most likely remain, a basic feature of popular culture in the West.  The work of the tabloids can be irritating, provocative, ethically questionable and even (as the scandal spectacularly shows) highly illegal, but when practiced according to existing laws, tabloid journalism can be an important player in modern culture, helping to mitigate some of the central tensions in democratic society. Journalism has always been marked by a battle to define the boundaries of acceptable investigative behavior.  The tabloids — just as they ought — constantly test those boundaries. Ryan Linkof, a lecturer in history at the University of Southern California, wrote a doctoral dissertation on the origins of tabloid photojournalism in Britain.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/business/media/murdoch-scandal-stirs-us-debate-on-big-media.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch Scandal Stirs U.S. Debate on Big Media<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>Progressive activists and public interest groups have long blasted Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation for political biases. But in recent weeks they have seized on a new and more tangible reason to call for the revocation of his TV licenses and the breakup of his company: the British hacking scandal.The scandal, they say, is an opportunity to raise awareness of — and, they hope, objection to — media consolidation at a time when the American government is reviewing the rules that govern how much companies like News Corporation, Comcast and the Walt Disney Company can own. “For those of us who’ve been warning about the dangers of too much media power concentrated in too few corporate hands, this scandal is a godsend,” said Jeff Cohen, the founding director of the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College. The scandal is also giving Democratic lawmakers an opportunity to call for more attention to the practices of such companies. Representative Bobby Rush, a Democrat of Illinois and a past critic of Mr. Murdoch, questioned in an interview whether the media mogul had been allowed to amass too much media power. “We can’t forget the fundamental tenet of media ownership in the United States. It’s not a right, it’s a privilege. And it’s a privilege based on trust and responsibility,” he said. Representative Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat of Wisconsin, said that along with media consolidation, the scandal raised questions about “privacy expectations in the digital world” and about how “we support freedom of the press while ensuring the integrity and truthfulness of the press.” There are few if any immediate threats to Mr. Murdoch’s American portfolio, which includes the Fox network, two dozen local television stations, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. The Federal Communications Commission signaled last week that it regarded the hacking scandal as isolated to Britain. But the scandal in Britain could influence the F.C.C. review of media ownership rules, especially if there is perceptible public discord about powerful media moguls like Mr. Murdoch. The discord is already evident in Britain, where politicians have talked openly about considering new laws that would lead to a breakup of the News Corporation, which owns 39 percent of British Sky Broadcasting as well as numerous newspapers there. In the United States, politicians have called for investigations into whether News Corporation entities hacked into the phones of Americans, including the victims of Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now investigating; on Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch said that he was aware of no evidence that any 9/11 American victims had been affected. But media reform groups like Free Press, which advocates for more diversity in media ownership, say their interest extends far beyond any single investigation. “I think this is the moment to contend with the serious damage the Murdoch empire has done to our media system over the past few decades,” Craig Aaron, the head of that group, said last week. The 2004 book “The New Media Monopoly” by Ben H. Bagdikian found that more than half of the radio and television stations, daily newspapers, magazines, publishers and movie studios in the United States were owned by five companies. In January, in the most recent case of consolidation, the government approved a bid by Comcast to take control of NBC Universal. Proponents of media mergers say such combinations improve consumer access to news, information and entertainment. They say the Internet has fostered competition, creating new choices for consumers. Groups like Free Press say the opposite — that such combinations reduce the country’s journalistic corps and decrease the diversity of voices in print and on the air. Mr. Aaron said he sensed that most Americans were aware of big media brands like Fox and NBC but unaware that their owners also controlled dozens of other brands. Media companies present an obstacle to awareness: “Most media outlets don’t like to cover themselves.” But “when people find out just how much those companies own, they are worried about it and want to know more,” he said, adding that the who-owns-what chart was the most popular feature on the Free Press Web site. This week, the F.C.C. declined to comment on the status of its ownership review, which is supposed to assess whether the existing rules are effectively promoting diversity, localism and competition. Earlier this month, an appeals court upheld most of the steps that the commission took in 2007 to loosen ownership rules, but it rejected on procedural grounds one rule that enabled more companies to own a newspaper and a station in the same local market. Cable outlets like Fox News — the scourge of liberals and a symbol of Mr. Murdoch’s political power — are not under the purview of the F.C.C. or its ownership review, but the News Corporation’s 27 local stations are, because each is dependent on a federal license for use of the public airwaves. License revocations are extremely rare, and analysts said they did not anticipate problems for the stations as a result of the hacking scandal. But an F.C.C. provision assessing the character of a station owner could be invoked by the News Corporation’s opponents when the company’s licenses for Fox and MyNetwork stations come up for renewal. The broader problem for Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Aaron suggested, is that he “had an air of invincibility” before the scandal became one of the most talked-about news stories in Britain and the United States. “Whatever happens now, that’s gone,” he said. Andrew Jay Schwartzman of the public interest group Media Access Project, said he doubted that loyal viewers of Fox News, a News Corporation property, would change their views. But, he added, “a much larger group of people have an instinctive mistrust of powerful media, and they understand that consolidation of media ownership is not good for democracy.” “For better or worse,” Mr. Schwartzman said, “News Corporation’s misdeeds will fuel that skepticism.” Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/world/europe/20wendi.html?ref=newscorporation">Wendi Murdoch Protects Her Husband From Pie Thrower<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>LONDON — The Murdoch who may have emerged in the best light from the grueling question-and-answer session in the British Parliament on Tuesday was not Rupert Murdoch or his son James, but his wife, Wendi.It was Mrs. Murdoch, 42, who lunged across the hearing room to defend her husband when, after about two hours of intense questioning, a protester stormed the witness table, trying to hit Mr. Murdoch, 80, with a shaving cream pie on a paper plate. Even as James Murdoch seemed frozen to his seat, shock written across his face at the sight of the intruder, Mrs. Murdoch leaped quickly to her feet from her chair just behind her husband, swung her arm in a great arch and punched the protester. The speed of her reactions left even a police officer trailing as he ambled over to sort out the melee. Her actions brought immediate praise even from those lawmakers who had directed the toughest questions at Mr. Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation. “Mr. Murdoch, your wife has a very good left hook,” said Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament. And it made her an instant hero among the millions of television viewers who had tuned in to watch the face-off between the Murdochs and their parliamentary interrogators. “Wow, Wendi Murdoch giving whole new meaning to the term tiger mother ... insanity!” Katie Couric, the former “CBS Evening News” anchor, said in a comment on Twitter about Mrs. Murdoch, who was born in China. Mrs. Murdoch, who is Mr. Murdoch’s third wife, had sat behind her husband loyally throughout the more than two hours of tense questioning, her long black hair and bright pink jacket caught in the television frame. Her presence perhaps should not have been a surprise in this difficult public moment for him. Although she has no formal high-ranking title in Mr. Murdoch’s companies, she acts as counselor to her husband and by all accounts has asserted influence in his global media empire. She has proved to be a particularly important asset as he has sought to develop his business interests in China. A daughter of a factory director in Guangzhou, China, Mrs. Murdoch moved to the United States with the aid of a California couple, according to a Wall Street Journal profile of her in 2000. She learned English, eventually went to the Yale School of Management and then returned to Asia, where she worked at Star TV in Hong Kong. It was at Star TV, once owned by Mr. Murdoch, that she met the press tycoon. She now lives with Mr. Murdoch and their two daughters, Grace and Chloe, in a penthouse apartment previously owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller on Fifth Avenue in New York — for which they paid a record-breaking $44 million. She has long been a subject of gossip columns. But she rose to new prominence with her actions in the committee room in Parliament on Tuesday. Some reports in the British press suggested that after the thwarted attack she even picked up the paper plate from the witness table and shoved it into the protester’s face, screaming as she did so. The protester — identified in news reports here as Jonathan May-Bowles, a k a Jonnie Marbles, a comedian — was later led away by the police with his face covered in white cream. And after an approximately 15-minute suspension, the hearing resumed. Rupert Murdoch had removed his jacket. And Mrs. Murdoch had once again taken her place close behind him.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/opinion/19nocera.html?ref=newscorporation">The Tables Are Turned on Rupert Murdoch<date>Published: July 18, 2011</date><text>You have to love the fact that when John Yates resigned on Monday as the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London — a k a Scotland Yard — he complained about the “huge amount of inaccurate, ill-informed and, on occasion, downright malicious gossip” that had finally forced his hand.My first thought was: He didn’t really say that, did he? My second thought was: Can any human being truly be that unaware? When the writers and editors of the late, unlamented News of the World were busy bribing Mr. Yates’s police officers, what they wanted in return was — gosh! — malicious gossip. When they were hacking the phones of royal family members and murdered teenagers, they were seeking, you know, malicious gossip. When the recently arrested Rebekah Brooks called Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, to tell him that Rupert Murdoch’s Sun, which she then edited, was about to reveal that his infant child had cystic fibrosis — information that Brown is convinced came from a hacked phone message — she was telling him the paper was going to print a piece of gossip that a more humane institution would have let pass. She might not have viewed this as malicious, but the Brown family certainly did. Let’s be honest here. There is something undeniably rich about seeing the tables turned like this. When I see photographs of Brooks, or Murdoch, or his son James (who until a few weeks ago was his father’s heir apparent at the News Corporation), sitting in their cars, staring blankly ahead, I can just picture the paparazzi horde jostling to get a decent shot of its prey. Murdoch’s papers have always feasted on scandals like this, picking the bones of their victims. Now Murdoch’s the one whose bones are being picked. “The schadenfreude is so thick you can’t cut it with a chainsaw,” wrote The Wall Street Journal in an editorial on Monday, defending Rupert Murdoch and the News Corporation. (That’s right. After woefully undercovering the scandal in its news pages, The Journal’s editorial page is now leaping to the defense of its owner. Proving, yet again, that The Journal knows where its bread is buttered.) Well, yes, the schadenfreude is pretty darn thick. Who would deny it? The whole thing reminds me a little of the ending of Ian McEwan’s wonderful novel “Solar,” in which the many awful things the central character has done in his long life suddenly come together to bury him in an avalanche of comeuppance. I’m O.K. with that. Although I generally admire entrepreneurs who build giant companies, Rupert Murdoch, despite giving us Homer Simpson, generally has not been a force for good over the course of his long career. His Bill O’Reilly-ed, Glenn Beck-ed Fox News has done a great deal to coarsen the political discourse. His tabloids have lowered the standards of journalism on three continents — and routinely broken the law on at least one of them. He had dumbed down his prestige papers, like The Times of London. He has run roughshod over cross-ownership rules meant to prevent one man or company from having too much power — and then used his lobbying might to get those rules diluted. He has put kowtowing to China ahead of freedom of the press, even killing a book set to be published by his HarperCollins unit that the Chinese authorities objected to. He has consistently used his media properties to reward allies and punish enemies. It’s a long list. Throughout his career, Murdoch has never just been satisfied with besting the competition, as most decent businessmen are. He’s not truly happy unless he has his foot on a competitor’s neck and is pressing it downward. Felix Salmon, a blogger for Reuters, unearthed testimony about an executive who ran one of Murdoch’s more obscure divisions. “I will destroy you,” the man told a competitor, according to the testimony. “I work for a man who wants it all and doesn’t understand anybody telling him he can’t have it all.” One feature of Murdoch’s career is that he’s never played by the rules that apply to other businessmen. That’s one reason I think he seems so shellshocked in those paparazzi photographs: unable in this dire circumstance to make his own rules, he simply doesn’t know how to react or what to do. On Tuesday, when he is excoriated in Parliament, it will be the first time he has ever truly been held to account. It undoubtedly won’t be fun for him. But there are many people who are going to take great glee in his misery — not unlike the way his newspapers have always taken such glee in the misery of others. In the e-mails I trade back and forth with friends, we can’t stop marveling at the scandal, at the head-spinning twists and turns. “It’s the best kind of story,” one wrote me, “because none of us really knows how it ends.” All we can do is read the paper every day, searching for more malicious gossip.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/world/europe/19tactics.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch Aides Long Tried to Blunt Scandal Over Hacking<date>Published: July 18, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Two days before it emerged that The News of the World had hacked the cellphone of a murdered schoolgirl, igniting a scandal that has shaken the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, his son James told friends that he thought the worst of the troubles were behind him. And he was confident that the News Corporation’s $12 billion bid for the satellite company British Sky Broadcasting would go through, according to a person present.Now, with their most trusted lieutenant, Rebekah Brooks, arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and paying the police for information, the broadcasting bid abandoned, the 168-year-old News of the World shuttered, and nine others arrested, Rupert and James Murdoch are scheduled to face an enraged British Parliament on Tuesday. It is a spectacle that Rupert Murdoch’s closest associates spent years trying to avoid. Interviews with dozens of people involved in the hacking scandal, including current and former News Corporation employees, provide an inside view of how a small group of executives pursued strategies for years that had the effect of obscuring the extent of wrongdoing in the newsroom of The News of the World, Britain’s best-selling tabloid. And once the hacking scandal escalated, they scrambled in vain to quarantine the damage. Evidence indicating that The News of the World paid the police for information was not handed over to the authorities for four years. Its parent company paid hefty sums to those who threatened legal action, on condition of silence. The tabloid continued to pay reporters and editors whose knowledge could prove embarrassing even after they were fired or arrested for hacking. A key editor’s computer equipment was destroyed, and e-mail evidence was lost. Internal advice to accept responsibility was ignored, former executives said. John Whittingdale, a Conservative member of Parliament who is the chairman of the committee that will question the Murdochs, said they need to come clean on the depth of the misdeeds, who authorized them and who knew what, when. “Parliament was misled,” Mr. Whittingdale said. “It will be a lengthy and detailed discussion.” Mr. Murdoch has indicated he wants to cooperate. “We think it’s important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public,” he said last week. “It’s best just to be as transparent as possible.” Ms. Brooks’s representative, David Wilson, said she maintained her innocence and looked forward to clearing her name, but declined to answer specific questions. As a trickle of revelations has become a torrent, the company switched from containment to crisis mode. Ms. Brooks and others first made the case that other newspapers had also hacked phones, and they sought to dig up evidence to prove it, interviews show. At a private meeting, Rupert Murdoch warned Paul Dacre, the editor of the rival Daily Mail newspaper and one of the most powerful men on Fleet Street, that “we are not going to be the only bad dog on the street,” according to an account that Mr. Dacre gave to his management team. Mr. Murdoch’s spokesman did not respond to questions about his private conversations. Former company executives and political aides assert that executives at News International, the News Corporation’s British subsidiary, carried out a campaign of selective leaks implicating previous management and the police. Company officials deny that. The Metropolitan Police responded with a statement alleging a “deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation into the alleged payments by corrupt journalists to corrupt police officers.” Mr. Murdoch was attending a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, early this month when it became clear that the latest eruption of the hacking scandal was not, as he first thought, a passing problem. According to a person briefed on the conversation, he proposed to one senior executive that he “fly commercial to London,” so he might be seen as a man of the people. He was told that would hardly do the trick, and he arrived on a Gulfstream G550 private jet. Evidence Was There All Along The storm Mr. Murdoch flew into had been brewing since 2006, when the tabloid’s royalty reporter and a private investigator were prosecuted for hacking into the messages of the royal household staff in search of juicy news exclusives. For years afterward, company executives publicly insisted that the hacking was limited to that one “rogue reporter.” Andy Coulson resigned as editor of The News of the World after the prosecution, but said he knew nothing. “If you’re talking about illegal tapping by a private investigator,” Rupert Murdoch declared in February 2007, “that is not part of our culture anywhere in the world, least of all in Britain.” But it turns out that almost from the beginning, executives of News International, the British subsidiary that owns the tabloid, had access to information indicating that other reporters were also engaged in the practice. During the royal hacking case, Scotland Yard had seized thousands of pages of records with the names of thousands of possible hacking targets from the home of the private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, who worked for the tabloid. While the police largely limited their investigation to the royalty case, lawyers representing people believed to be victims of hacking fought for access to Mr. Mulcaire’s records and made them available to the tabloid executives during the litigation. 1 2 3 Next Page » Don Van Natta Jr. contributed reporting.</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/world/europe/19hacking.html?ref=newscorporation">Another Top Police Official Resigns in British Scandal<date>Published: July 18, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a state visit to Africa as he confronted a growing scandal over his cozy ties with Rupert Murdoch’s top lieutenants in Britain and the challenge it posed to his year-old government.Mr. Cameron, the leader of the Conservative Party, agreed to return hurriedly Monday from Africa to hold a special session of Parliament on Wednesday. He did so after coming under renewed assault from a reinvigorated Labour Party, which has repeatedly pressed him to explain in more detail his decision to hire Andy Coulson, the former editor of the now-defunct News of the World, as his communications director. His close personal ties to Rebekah Brooks, the former head of News International and a confidante of Mr. Murdoch, are also under scrutiny. Both Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks have been arrested in a widening probe into hacking the phones of British celebrities, government officials, members of the royal family and victims of high-profile crimes and terrorist attacks. Beyond the immediate politics, there was a growing sense across the country that the crisis had raised fundamental questions about the culture of collusion between politicians and the press and revealed a deeper malaise in British life that could dominate the national political scene for months or years to come. Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour opposition, delivered a broadside against Mr. Cameron on Monday that sought to tap into the public outrage over the scandal by linking it to a series of crises in recent years — the role of the banks in the financial crisis that hit in 2008, the furor over lawmakers’ expense abuses in 2009 and now the tabloid scandal. Commentators said his goal was to weaken Mr. Cameron’s coalition government if the scandal continues to escalate, and to cast himself as a credible alternate prime minister should Mr. Cameron fall. Mr. Miliband said the prime minister “hasn’t even apologized for hiring Mr. Coulson” and that he was “hamstrung” by his association with his former media chief and Ms. Brooks, who were among the Murdoch executives that Mr. Cameron has admitted to meeting almost twice a month during his 15 months in office. He said the country “needs leadership to get to the bottom of what happened” — a code, as some commentators saw it, for suggesting that Mr. Cameron may have to quit before the scandal has run its course. The parade of casualties from the scandal continued to lengthen one day after the head of Scotland Yard resigned, when one of his deputies, John Yates, also stepped down. The investigation also took a grim turn when Sean Hoare, a former reporter in his mid-40s who was the first to say publicly that Mr. Coulson was aware of the widespread “phone hacking” at News of the World when he was the paper’s editor, was found dead in his north London home. The police said they did not initially regard the death as suspicious. Mr. Hoare’s interview implicating Mr. Coulson in a New York Times magazine article last fall was one of the factors, the police have said, that prompted them to reopen an investigation into The News of the World after the probe had brought convictions and jail sentences for two men then faltered, with Scotland Yard officers saying there was nothing more to pursue. Top police officials and senior executives of News Corporation, including Rupert and James Murdoch and Ms. Brooks, are scheduled to appear before parliamentary committee hearings on Tuesday that many expect to be part of a lengthy and open-ended inquiry into the origins of the phone hacking, the legal culpability of News Corporation officials, the failure of the police to uncover the full extent of the hacking and the connections between Mr. Murdoch’s empire and senior British politicians. Mr. Miliband, widely viewed as a weak rival to Mr. Cameron until the recent revelations about the extent of phone hacking emerged this month, appeared to view the matters as weighty enough to form a new platform for Labour, issuing a sonorous call that sounded like a promising election plank. “We have to ask ourselves deeper questions,” he said. “What does it say about our country? How did we let this happen? And how do we change to ensure that this does not happen again?” He said all the recent scandals in British life were caused by a lack of accountability among those in high places. “All are about the irresponsibility of the powerful, people who believed they were untouchable,” like the Murdoch executives who ran the company’s newspapers in Britain, he said. 1 2 Next Page » Sarah Lyall, Jo Becker and Alan Cowell contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E4DD153CF93AA25754C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=newscorporation">DEALBOOK; Murdoch's Board Stays On Sidelines<date>Published: July 19, 2011</date><text>The board of the News Corporation might as well be named ''Friends of Rupert.'' The independent directors - who have a fiduciary responsibility to the company's shareholders - have remained silent amid the widening scandal at Rupert Murdoch's media empire. Despite multiple arrests stemming from the phone hacking accusations so far, not one independent board member has made a statement denouncing the company's dubious activities. Not one has publicly called for the resignation of top officials at the company. And not one has pushed for an outside investigation, although the company has started its own. ''This is a board that qualifies for an 'F' in every category,'' Nell Minow, a member of the board of GovernanceMetrics International and founder of the Corporate Library, a governance firm, said without any hesitation. ''It is the ultimate crony board.'' A spokeswoman for the News Corporation declined to comment. Given the Murdochs' tight rule over the company, crossing the family might seem futile. In reality, its directors serve at the pleasure of Mr. Murdoch, since the company was purposely set up with a dual-class stock structure that gives him 38 percent of the votes. (The New York Times Company also has two classes of shares.) Legally at least, the News Corporation directors are supposed to serve the interests of all shareholders. Of the 16 board members, nine are technically considered independent. But few would truly qualify under any definition of good corporate governance. One supposed independent voice, Kenneth Cowley, is a former News Corporation executive who has been on the board since 1979. Natalie Bancroft, an opera singer, was named to the board when the company acquired Dow Jones, mainly as a way to way to placate its former owners, the Bancrofts. Incidentally, the News Corporation picked Ms. Bancroft. That's not to say the company board doesn't include some heavyweights - if they ever decide to use their muscle. There's John Thornton, the former president of Goldman Sachs; Jose Maria Aznar, the former prime minister of Spain; Viet Dinh, a professor at Georgetown University and former assistant attorney general under President George W. Bush who helped draw up the Patriot Act; Sir Roderick Ian Eddington, the former chief executive of British Airways; and Thomas J. Perkins, the billionaire venture capitalist who co-founded Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. But those directors, too, have not criticized management - even Mr. Perkins, who knows a thing or two about phone hacking. In 2006, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard during a ''pretexting'' scandal in which the company secretly obtained the telephone records of reporters. At the time of his resignation from H.P., Mr. Perkins wrote to the board, ''I resigned solely to protest the questionable ethics and the dubious legality of the chairman's methods.'' So it is somewhat surprising that Mr. Perkins defended the News Corporation top management in an interview with The New York Times on Monday. Fred Tannenbaum, a lawyer at Gould &amp; Ratner who specializes in governance issues related to family-run companies, said, ''You have to expect that the directors are carefully reading their D.&amp;O. policies,'' referring to the insurance policies that companies take out to protect directors and officers from civil and criminal lawsuits.

The meekness of the company's directors has been questioned by shareholders before. ''The fact that the board has been so passive despite years of misconduct is a testament to how lacking in independence its members are from the Murdoch family. This has led to a 'Murdoch discount' in the marketplace,'' a small group of shareholders wrote in a lawsuit earlier this year.

The board of the News Corporation might as well be named “Friends of Rupert.” The independent directors — who have a fiduciary responsibility to the company’s shareholders — have remained silent amid the widening scandal at Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Despite multiple arrests stemming from the phone hacking accusations so far, not one independent board member has made a statement denouncing the company’s dubious activities. Not one has publicly called for the resignation of top officials at the company. And not one has pushed for an outside investigation, although the company has started its own.

It is hard to argue with the shareholders about the “Murdoch discount.” Over the last five years, the company’s stock has fallen precipitously after a series of strategic missteps that appeared to be more about indulging Mr. Murdoch’s personal interests than helping the company. The acquisition of Dow Jones is, mathematically at least, an unmitigated disaster. The News Corporation has written off $2.8 billion of the acquisition, or nearly half the value of the deal. For a brief moment, Mr. Murdoch’s acquisition of MySpace seemed genius — then it didn’t. He paid $580 million in 2005 and sold it last month for slightly more than $30 million. The stock continues its decline today. As the scandal has unfolded, shares of the company have dropped 7 percent in the last month. Oli Scarff/Getty ImagesLord Grabiner, a commercial lawyer. In an effort to placate shareholders, the company announced on Monday that it had named Lord Grabiner, a commercial lawyer, to head an “independent” committee to address the myriad government investigations. But there should be an asterisk next to the word “independent.” Lord Grabiner will report to Joel Klein, the former assistant attorney general in the United States Justice Department. Despite that solid credential, Mr. Klein is now an employee and director of the company. Mr. Klein, in turn, will report to Mr. Dinh, the “independent director.” And there’s one more footnote: the committee’s only mandate is to deal with the newspapers in Britain, not the rest of the company. Somewhat sadly, the News Corporation has a history of setting up independent committees that do little more than provide cover for Mr. Murdoch. When it acquired Dow Jones, it pledged to create an editorial oversight committee to keep Mr. Murdoch from trying to install his own people at The Wall Street Journal. However, within a year of the takeover, Mr. Mudoch had negotiated a hefty payout for the paper’s top editor, Marcus Brauchli, in exchange for his resignation. Mr. Murdoch then tapped his own editor, a longtime friend from the News Corporation. It’s no secret that buying shares of the company is a direct bet on Mr. Murdoch. After all, he controls it lock, stock and barrel. But the role of the board — even for a company controlled by a family dynasty — is to provide a modicum of oversight. Now is the time for its directors to try to be “Friends of Investors.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/business/media/for-news-corporation-troubles-that-money-cant-dispel.html?ref=newscorporation">For News Corporation, Troubles That Money Can't Dispel<date>Published: July 17, 2011</date><text>“Bury your mistakes,” Rupert Murdoch is fond of saying. But some mistakes don’t stay buried, no matter how much money you throw at them.Time and again in the United States and elsewhere, Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation has used blunt force spending to skate past judgment, agreeing to payments to settle legal cases and, undoubtedly more important, silence its critics. In the case of News America Marketing, its obscure but profitable in-store and newspaper insert marketing business, the News Corporation has paid out about $655 million to make embarrassing charges of corporate espionage and anticompetitive behavior go away. That kind of strategy provides a useful window into the larger corporate culture at a company that is now engulfed by a wildfire burning out of control in London, sparked by the hacking of a murdered young girl’s phone and fed by a steady stream of revelations about seedy, unethical and sometimes criminal behavior at the company’s newspapers. So far, 10 people have been arrested, including, on Sunday, Rebekah Brooks, the head of News International. Les Hinton, who ran News International before her and most recently was the head of Dow Jones, resigned on Friday. Now we are left to wonder whether Mr. Murdoch will be forced to make an Abraham-like sacrifice and abandon his son James, the former heir apparent. The News Corporation may be hoping that it can get back to business now that some of the responsible parties have been held to account — and that people will see the incident as an aberrant byproduct of the world of British tabloids. But that seems like a stretch. The damage is likely to continue to mount, perhaps because the underlying pathology is hardly restricted to those who have taken the fall. As Mark Lewis, the lawyer for the family of the murdered girl, Milly Dowler, said after Ms. Brooks resigned, “This is not just about one individual but about the culture of an organization.” Well put. That organization has used strategic acumen to assemble a vast and lucrative string of media properties, but there is also a long history of rounded-off corners. It has skated on regulatory issues, treated an editorial oversight committee as if it were a potted plant (at The Wall Street Journal), and made common cause with restrictive governments (China) and suspect businesses — all in the relentless pursuit of More. In the process, Mr. Murdoch has always been frank in his impatience with the rules of others. According to The Guardian, whose bulldog reporting pulled back the curtain on the phone-hacking scandal, the News Corporation paid out $1.6 million in 2009 to settle claims related to the scandal. While expedient, and inexpensive — the company still has gobs of money on hand — it was probably not a good strategy in the long run. If some of those cases had gone to trial, it would have had the effect of lancing the wound. Litigation can have an annealing effect on companies, forcing them to re-examine the way they do business. But as it was, the full extent and villainy of the hacking was never known because the News Corporation paid serious money to make sure it stayed that way. And the money the company reportedly paid out to hacking victims is chicken feed compared with what it has spent trying to paper over the tactics of News America in a series of lawsuits filed by smaller competitors in the United States. In 2006 the state of Minnesota accused News America of engaging in unfair trade practices, and the company settled by agreeing to pay costs and not to falsely disparage its competitors. In 2009, a federal case in New Jersey brought by a company called Floorgraphics went to trial, accusing News America of, wait for it, hacking its way into Floorgraphics’s password protected computer system. The complaint summed up the ethos of News America nicely, saying it had “illegally accessed plaintiff’s computer system and obtained proprietary information” and “disseminated false, misleading and malicious information about the plaintiff.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/news-corp-braces-for-legal-trouble-in-the-u-s/?ref=newscorporation">News Corp.

Richards/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Wall Street Journal defended its parent company, the News Corporation, in an editorial on Monday. The burgeoning scandal at the News Corporation has crossed over to the United States as federal investigations of the company’s conduct have started. There is no clearer sign of the seriousness of the company’s potential exposure to criminal prosecution than its hiring of Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. of Williams &amp; Connolly, one of the most aggressive criminal defense lawyers in the country. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook Column: Murdoch’s Board Stands By as Scandal Widens The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation of suspected efforts to obtain voice mails and telephone records of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and their families. Attorney General Eric S. Holder Jr., responding to requests by four Democratic senators — Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, both of New Jersey, Barbara Boxer of California and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia — confirmed that the Justice Department will also look into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to payments to Scotland Yard officers in Britain as part of the phone-hacking efforts by the News Corporation’s British newspapers, in particular the now-closed News of the World. The revelations of how reporters gathered information and paid bribes raise serious questions about the News Corporation’s internal governance and journalistic ethics. Even Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler, called out Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chief executive and controlling shareholder, arguing in an op-ed article in The Washington Post that “if the News Corporation’s reported wrongdoings are true, what Murdoch’s company has been up to does not just brush against boundaries — it blows right past them.” Whether any American laws were violated, however, is a very different question. Here is a look at the statutes that are likely to be the focus of federal investigations on this side of the Atlantic and that potential problems that prosecutors would face if they want to pursue criminal charges against the News Corporation and any of its executives. Phone Hacking The F.B.I. is looking into a claim that a former New York City police officer was offered money for information about Sept. 11 victims, and that reporters for The News of the World may have illicitly obtained their telephone records and voice mail recordings. At this point, the allegations are quite sketchy, particularly regarding the time frame for any contended efforts to gather the information. If telephone records were accessed, that could be a violation of the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1039, which prohibits making false or fraudulent statements to obtain another person’s telephone records. Congress enacted the statute in December 2006 in response to negative publicity about a private investigation authorized by board members at Hewlett-Packard that sought to track down leaks of corporate information by obtaining the telephone records of reporters. If reporters for The News of the World obtained records of Sept. 11 victims and their families, the key initial question is when did that take place. The statute went into effect on Dec. 27, 2006, so any conduct before that date could not be prosecuted because of the constitutional protection against ex post facto application of criminal laws. If voice mails were obtained, then that could be a violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2511, which makes it a crime to intercept “any wire, oral, or electronic communication.” Whether hacking into a voice mail account constitutes interception has not been addressed in any cases yet. It is at least arguable that listening, or even recording, another person’s voice mail message after it has been left is not a violation because the conduct takes place after the communication. The language of the statute focuses more on contemporaneous conduct, like listening to conversations while they take place, and not accessing recordings afterward. In addition, the timing of any misconduct would also be key to determining whether a violation could be pursued if the law does apply to voice mails. The federal statute of limitations period in which a criminal prosecution can be instituted is five years from the violation. Any conduct before July 2006 could not be pursued at this point, although a conspiracy charge is possible for acts before that date so long as one co-conspirator engaged in conduct that was part of the conspiracy within the last five years. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Information has come out that the News Corporation paid officials at Scotland Yard to obtain telephone numbers of various individuals as part of the phone hacking program, including members of the royal family. The payment of a bribe to a foreign official by an American company — the News Corporation is incorporated in Delaware — can be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act. Both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission can investigate potential violations. A violation requires proof that the payment was made “in order to assist such issuer in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.” The typical F.C.P.A. case involves payments for the award of government contracts or to continue a business relationship in the foreign country, like getting approval for a facility or transporting goods into a country. It is questionable whether bribing police officials in the pursuit of information for a newspaper article would assist the News Corporation in “obtaining or retaining” business, unless selling more newspapers is construed to come within the statute. Unlike the new Bribery Act that just went into effect in Britain on July 1, which prohibits any type of corrupt payment regardless of its connection to business operations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is more limited and arguably does not apply to the bribes paid. Another provision of the act, however, does apply to the News Corporation and may be the basis for a case. The law requires publicly traded companies to maintain accurate books and records, so how the News Corporation recorded payments to the police officials may have resulted in false reports in the company’s accounts. This type of case is usually handled by the S.E.C. and is rarely the basis for a criminal prosecution of a corporation. Other Statutes The investigations of the News Corporation are at a very early stage, so it is not clear what information might emerge that could indicate other potential violations. Investigators will no doubt look for evidence that might support a charge against individuals or the company involving broad federal criminal statutes, like mail and wire fraud, false statements and incomplete disclosure to the company’s auditors and the S.E.C. And federal investigations may not be the only ones the company faces. Many states have their own privacy laws, so do not be surprised if a state attorney general announces an investigation into the News Corporation’s conduct if a resident was involved. There could be other collateral consequences from the investigation, even if no criminal charges are filed. The News Corporation owns 27 television stations, and CourtTV’s founder, Steven Brill, noted that challenges to their licenses could be mounted on the ground that the company does not meet the “good character” requirement for station ownership. Mr. Sullivan and his law firm certainly have their work cut out for them. Mr. Murdoch may have thought the damage was contained, but it appears this scandal will persist for quite a while. Peter J.

But he said that he had done nothing wrong and that he would not “lose sleep over my personal integrity.” He also said that because he had not been involved in the original phone-hacking investigation, he had had no idea that Neil Wallis, a former News of the World deputy editor who had become a public-relations consultant for the police after leaving the paper, was himself suspected of phone hacking. Mr. Wallis, 60, was arrested last Thursday. The commissioner’s resignation came as the London political establishment was still digesting the stunning news about the arrest of Ms. Brooks — who apparently was surprised herself. A consummate networker who has always been assiduously courted by politicians and whose friends include Prime Minister David Cameron, Ms. Brooks, 43, is the 10th and by far the most powerful person to be arrested so far in the phone-hacking scandal. Her arrest is bound to be particularly wounding to Mr. Murdoch, who, asked early last week to identify his chief priority in the affair, pointed to Ms. Brooks and said, “This one.” Ms. Brooks has not yet been formally charged, but it is significant that she is being questioned in connection with two separate investigations. One, called Operation Weeting, is examining allegations of widespread phone hacking at the News of the World, the tabloid at the center of the scandal, where Ms. Brooks was editor from 2000 to 2003. The other is Operation Elveden, which is looking into more serious charges that News International editors paid police officers for information. Ms. Brooks has always maintained that she was unaware of wrongdoing at The News of the World, which was summarily closed by Mr. Murdoch a week ago in an unsuccessful damage-control exercise. But the tide rose against her, and on Friday she resigned, saying in a statement that her presence was “detracting attention” from the company. The arrest was a shock to the News Corporation, the parent company of News International, and the other properties in Mr. Murdoch’s media empire, which is reeling from the traumas of last week: the forced withdrawal of its cherished $12 billion takeover bid for British Sky Broadcasting and the resignations not only of Ms. Brooks but also of Les Hinton, a longtime Murdoch ally and friend who was the chairman of Dow Jones and the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Speaking of Ms. Brooks, an official at News International said: “When she resigned on Friday, we were not aware that she would be arrested by the police.” Another person briefed on the News Corporation’s plans said that on Friday, when the company was preparing to announce her exit and the departure in New York of Mr. Hinton, the possibility of her arrest was not discussed. Investor unease about the scandal appeared to be affecting News Corporation shares, which were down nearly 6 percent in early Monday trading on the Australian exchange in Sydney. Until Ms. Brooks arrived at a London police station by prearranged appointment on Sunday, she believed she would merely be helping the police as a witness, her spokesman said. “She was very surprised, I think, to then be arrested,” said the spokesman, David Wilson, chairman of the Bell Pottinger public relations firm. Mr. Wilson said it all happened so quickly that both her lawyer and he were brought in to handle her case over the weekend. Ms. Brooks was arrested “under caution,” he said, meaning that she was read her rights and treated as a suspect. “She maintains her innocence, absolutely,” he said. She was released on bail after about 12 hours in police custody, news services reported.For months, Ms. Brooks had been willing to talk to the police but had been rebuffed, Mr. Wilson said. “As recently as last week, she was told she wasn’t required to do so and she wasn’t on their radar.” 1 2 Next Page » Jo Becker and Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting from London, and Jeremy W.

The hacking group Lulz Security claimed responsibility for a string of attacks on Web sites belonging  to the News Corporation on Monday. Among the attacks, the hacking group planted a fake article about the death of Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, on one of the company’s newspaper sites. The fake article appeared on a page at new-times.co.uk, which had apparently been used to inform readers about a new design for the site of The Times of London. It said Mr. Murdoch had died from a drug overdose. Mr. Murdoch’s company is facing a sweeping scandal in Britain, set off by revelations that journalists at his newspapers hacked into voice-mail accounts in search of news. After posting the fake article, LulzSec apparently altered the Web site of The Sun, another Murdoch paper, so that it sent site visitors to the article. Soon after, the Sun site instead forwarded visitors to the LulzSec Twitter page. LulzSec also claimed it had changed the DNS addresses for all of News International’s Web sites, making them completely inaccessible to the public. DNS refers to the Domain Name System, which is a directory that connects Web site names to numerical Internet addresses. When News International, the British newspaper division of the News Corporation, posted what appeared to be a statement about the hacking of The Sun’s site on its corporate site, those who tried to read the statement were also sent to the Twitter page. The sites of News International, The Sun and The Times were all unreachable later in the evening. LulzSec said last month that it was closing up shop and would discontinue a hacking spree, but the group seems to have reorganized and is now active again. The group has claimed responsibility for hacking a number of sites over the last two months, including those of PBS, the United States Senate, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and the Web site of a company associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As the hacking was unfolding online, LulzSec said on its Twitter feed that it had gained access to News Corporation networks and taken internal e-mail. It said it planned to release more information in the coming days. Members of Anonymous, another hacking group that is intertwined with Lulz Security, also chimed in and began posting Twitter messages with mobile phone numbers and e-mail passwords that it said belonged to editors at News of the World, the now-closed newspaper at the center of the hacking scandal. Former employees of News of the World received an e-mail late Monday in response to the attacks, warning them to change their e-mail passwords. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. The e-mail for a Times of London staff member had been hacked, the staff member said, rendering it completely nonfunctional on Monday evening.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/world/europe/17britain.html?ref=newscorporation">Phone-Hacking Inquiry’s Tentacles Reach Out to Cameron<date>Published: July 16, 2011</date><text>LONDON — As Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire on Saturday published full-page ads in every national newspaper in Britain under the words “We are sorry,” the government of Prime Minister David Cameron released information documenting the prime minister’s close ties to Murdoch company executives that continued even as the phone-hacking scandal grew.The apology by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation was a U-turn from his previously defiant handling of the crisis. The banner headline in Saturday’s editions of The Times of London read “Day of Atonement,” and it was all the more striking for the fact that it ran in the 226-year-old newspaper that is the flagship of the print empire that Mr. Murdoch has assembled in Britain over the past 40 years. At the end of a week that rocked the interwoven worlds of the press, politicians and the police in Britain, and spread across the Atlantic with the opening of an F.B.I. investigation into allegations of associated abuses in the United States, penitence was the buzzword far beyond the London headquarters of Mr. Murdoch’s British-based newspaper subsidiary, News International. The crisis seemed far from over for Mr. Murdoch, as the scandal that began over illegal phone hacking by one of his newspapers, The News of the World, now defunct, widened to include a second newspaper in his stable, The Sunday Times, officials said Saturday. Nor was the crisis abating for Mr. Cameron. As presses rolled Friday night with the Murdoch bid for redemption in the “sorry” ad, and with front-page stories telling of his face-to-face, head-hanging apology to the parents of a murdered girl whose cellphone voice mails were hacked, Mr. Cameron’s aides released a diary of his meetings with executives and editors of News International. The diary shed light on what Mr. Cameron acknowledged last week was the “cozy and comfortable” world in which politicians, the press and the police in Britain have functioned for decades, one he said had to yield to much greater public scrutiny. The diary showed that since taking office in May 2010, Mr. Cameron has met 26 times with Murdoch executives, including Mr. Murdoch; his son James, the top official of News International; and Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of the British subsidiary and editor of The News of the World, who resigned on Friday. Her resignation was quickly followed by that of Les Hinton, the News Corporation executive and former chief of News International who had been publisher of The Wall Street Journal, another Murdoch property, since 2007. All four executives are expected to testify before a parliamentary oversight committee on Tuesday. Most of the meetings cited in the diary took place at the prime minister’s London headquarters at 10 Downing Street, or at Chequers, his official country residence northwest of London. His meetings with the Murdoch officials exceeded all those with other British media representatives put together. Ms. Brooks was the only person on the guest list for Chequers who had been invited there twice. Another guest was Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who resigned as Mr. Cameron’s Downing Street media chief under the pressure of the phone-hacking scandal in January. That visit occurred in March, two months after he resigned. Downing Street officials noted that Ms. Brooks and her husband have a country home near Chequers. As for Mr. Coulson, they said, he and his family had been invited for an overnight stay to thank him for his work for the government and the Conservative Party, where he held a similar post before the election. The list did nothing to assuage the questions about Mr. Cameron’s judgment in maintaining close ties with executives of a media enterprise that has been under a faltering police investigation for years and has come under intense scrutiny. The ties to Mr. Coulson, in particular, have been assailed by the Labour opposition leader, Ed Miliband, but have also spread dismay among Mr. Cameron’s Conservatives. Foreign Minister William Hague defended those ties on Saturday, telling the BBC that inviting Mr. Coulson to Chequers was “a normal, human thing to do” and that it was “not surprising that in a democratic country there is some contact” between political leaders and media officials. “Personally I’m not embarrassed by it in any way,” he said. Mr. Cameron hired Mr. Coulson in 2007, shortly after he resigned at The News of the World and against the strong urging of some other Conservatives. His defense has been that Mr. Coulson deserved “a second chance,” and he has said that if Mr. Coulson’s assurances of guiltlessness in the phone-hacking scandal prove to have been false, he should be prosecuted. While the police investigation has largely centered on cellphone hacking by journalists at The News of the World, it has now spread to the investigative unit of The Sunday Times, a person familiar with internal News Corporation discussions said. That person, as well as a person with knowledge of the scope of the inquiry, said the investigation would expand to include hacking into e-mail accounts and other online privacy invasions. One target of the investigation is Jonathan Rees, a private detective employed by The News of the World with ties to corrupt police officers and a criminal record. Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament who has been briefed on the inquiry, said the police had evidence that Mr. Rees was paid by News International and that he had claimed to have met with members of The Sunday Times investigation unit.

Yet from August 2006, when the items were seized, until the autumn of 2010, no one at the Metropolitan Police Service, commonly referred to as Scotland Yard, bothered to sort through all the material and catalog every page, said former and current senior police officials. During that same time, senior Scotland Yard officials assured Parliament, judges, lawyers, potential hacking victims, the news media and the public that there was no evidence of widespread hacking by the tabloid. They steadfastly maintained that their original inquiry, which led to the conviction of one reporter and one private investigator, had put an end to what they called an isolated incident. After the past week, that assertion has been reduced to tatters, torn apart by a spectacular avalanche of contradictory evidence, admissions by News International executives that hacking was more widespread, and a reversal by police officials who now admit to mishandling the case. Assistant Commissioner John Yates of the Metropolitan Police Service publicly acknowledged that he had not actually gone through the evidence. “I’m not going to go down and look at bin bags,” Mr. Yates said, using the British term for trash bags. At best, former Scotland Yard senior officers acknowledged in interviews, the police have been lazy, incompetent and too cozy with the people they should have regarded as suspects. At worst, they said, some officers might be guilty of crimes themselves. “It’s embarrassing, and it’s tragic,” said a retired Scotland Yard veteran. “This has badly damaged the reputation of a really good investigative organization. And there is a major crisis now in the leadership of the Yard.” The testimony and evidence that emerged last week, as well as interviews with current and former officials, indicate that the police agency and News International, the British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and the publisher of The News of the World, became so intertwined that they wound up sharing the goal of containing the investigation. Members of Parliament said in interviews that they were troubled by a “revolving door” between the police and News International, which included a former top editor at The News of the World at the time of the hacking who went on to work as a media strategist for Scotland Yard. On Friday, The New York Times learned that the former editor, Neil Wallis, was reporting back to News International while he was working for the police on the hacking case. Executives and others at the company also enjoyed close social ties to Scotland Yard’s top officials. Since the hacking scandal began in 2006, Mr. Yates and others regularly dined with editors from News International papers, records show. Sir Paul Stephenson, the police commissioner, met for meals 18 times with company executives and editors during the investigation, including on eight occasions with Mr. Wallis while he was still working at The News of the World. Senior police officials declined several requests to be interviewed for this article. The police have continually asserted that the original investigation was limited because the counterterrorism unit, which was in charge of the case, was preoccupied with more pressing demands. At the parliamentary committee hearing last week, the three officials said they were working on 70 terrorist investigations. Yet the Metropolitan Police unit that deals with special crimes, and which had more resources and time available, could have taken over the case, said four former senior investigators. One said it was “utter nonsense” to argue that the department did not have enough resources. Another senior investigator said officials saw the inquiry as being in “safe hands” at the counterterrorism unit. Interviews with current and former officials show that instead of examining all the evidence, investigators primarily limited their inquiry to 36 names that the private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, mentioned in one list. 1 2 3 4 Next Page » Jo Becker contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/16/opinion/16nocera.html?ref=newscorporation">The Journal Becomes Fox-ified<date>Published: July 15, 2011</date><text>It’s official. The Wall Street Journal has been Fox-ified.It took Rupert Murdoch only three and a half years to get there, starting with the moment he acquired the paper from the dysfunctional Bancroft family in December 2007, a purchase that was completed after he vowed to protect The Journal’s editorial integrity and agreed to a (toothless) board that was supposed to make sure he kept that promise. Fat chance of that. Within five months, Murdoch had fired the editor and installed his close friend Robert Thomson, fresh from a stint Fox-ifying The Times of London. The new publisher was Leslie Hinton, former boss of the division that published Murdoch’s British newspapers, including The News of the World. (He resigned on Friday.) Soon came the changes, swift and sure: shorter articles, less depth, an increased emphasis on politics and, weirdly, sometimes surprisingly unsophisticated coverage of business. Along with the transformation of a great paper into a mediocre one came a change that was both more subtle and more insidious. The political articles grew more and more slanted toward the Republican party line. The Journal sometimes took to using the word “Democrat” as an adjective instead of a noun, a usage favored by the right wing. In her book, “War at The Wall Street Journal,” Sarah Ellison recounts how editors inserted the phrase “assault on business” in an article about corporate taxes under President Obama. The Journal was turned into a propaganda vehicle for its owner’s conservative views. That’s half the definition of Fox-ification. The other half is that Murdoch’s media outlets must shill for his business interests. With the News of the World scandal, The Journal has now shown itself willing to do that, too. As a business story, the News of the World scandal isn’t just about phone hacking and police bribery. It is about Murdoch’s media empire, the News Corporation, being at risk — along with his family’s once unshakable hold on it. The old Wall Street Journal would have been leading the pack in pursuit of that story. Now? At first, The Journal ignored the scandal, even though, as the Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff pointed out in Adweek, it was front-page news all across Britain. Then, when the scandal was no longer avoidable, The Journal did just enough to avoid being accused of looking the other way. Blogging for Columbia Journalism Review, Dean Starkman, the media critic, described The Journal’s coverage as “obviously hamstrung, and far, far below the paper’s true capacity.” On Friday, however, the coverage went all the way to craven. The paper published an interview with Murdoch that might as well have been dictated by the News Corporation public relations department. He was going to testify before Parliament next week, he told the Journal reporter, because “it’s important to absolutely establish our integrity.” Some of the accusations made in Parliament were “total lies.” The News Corporation had handled the scandal “extremely well in every way possible.” So had his son James, a top company executive. “When I hear something going wrong, I insist on it being put right,” he said. He was “getting annoyed” by the scandal. And “tired.” And so on. In the article containing the interview, there was no pushback against any of these statements, even though several of them bordered on the delusional. The two most obvious questions — When did Murdoch first learn of the phone hacking at The News of the World? And when did he learn that reporters were bribing police officers for information? — went unasked. The Journal reporter had either been told not to ask those questions, or instinctively knew that he shouldn’t. It is hard to know which is worse. The dwindling handful of great journalists who remain at the paper — Mark Maremont, Alan Murray and Alix Freedman among them — must be hanging their heads in shame. To tell you the truth, I’m hanging my head in shame too. Four years ago, when Murdoch was battling recalcitrant members of the Bancroft family to gain control of The Journal, which he had long lusted after and which he viewed as the vehicle that would finally allow him to go head-to-head against The New York Times, I wrote several columns saying that he would be a better owner than the Bancrofts. The Bancrofts’ history of mismanagement had made The Journal vulnerable in the first place. I thought that Murdoch’s resources would stop the financial bleeding, and that his desire for a decent legacy would keep him from destroying a great newspaper. After the family agreed to sell to him, Elisabeth Goth, the brave Bancroft heir who had long tried to get her family to fix the company, told me, “He has a tremendous opportunity, and I don’t think he’s going to blow it.” In that same column, I wrote, “The chances of Mr. Murdoch wrecking The Journal are lower than you’d think.” Mea culpa.

At first incensed by the assault on his company’s reputation, Mr. Murdoch insisted as late as Thursday that the executives had performed “excellently” in dealing with the crisis since it erupted two weeks ago. He was said to be loath to lose either of them, and became convinced that they had to leave only over the last several days, as executives and outside advisers flew in to help manage the crisis from the company’s gleaming granite and glass offices in the Wapping district of east London. In arriving at the final decision, Mr. Murdoch was joined by his two sons, James and Lachlan, and Joel I. Klein, a senior News Corporation executive and former New York City Schools chancellor. The resignations came on a day when Mr. Murdoch made a series of public mea culpas. He wrote a letter to be published in all British newspapers over the weekend acknowledging that the company did not address its problems soon enough. “We are sorry,” it begins. He also visited the family of a murdered 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, whose voice mail was hacked by reporters at The News of the World while she was still listed as missing. According to the Dowler family’s lawyer, Mark Lewis, Mr. Murdoch held his head in his hands and apologized for the actions of his employees, who deleted phone messages after the girl’s mailbox had been filled so they could collect more new messages. Mr. Lewis said that Mr. Murdoch apologized “many times,” and that he was “very humbled, he was very shaken and he was very sincere.” Whether these actions will do anything to quiet the backlash against the News Corporation is unclear. Mr. Murdoch, Ms. Brooks and James Murdoch, the company’s deputy chief operating officer and Rupert’s younger son, are set to testify next week before Parliament, where they will face questions from politicians who have become suddenly unafraid to publicly condemn the man whose favor they once saw as a key to political success. Mr. Murdoch has become an increasingly isolated figure, not only in Britain but within his own company. The departure in recent years of top executives who often provided a counterweight to his famous irascibility and stubbornness has left him surrounded by fewer people who can effectively question his decisions. He initially rejected Ms. Brooks’s offer to resign from News International, his British subsidiary, despite advice to accept it from senior News Corporation executives, said people briefed on the company’s discussions. Ms. Brooks, who was editor of The News of the World when the abuses began in 2002, repeatedly told the Murdochs that she knew nothing of the hacking and that she would be exonerated when all the facts came out. In her farewell message, Ms. Brooks acknowledged that she had become a distraction. “The reputation of the company we love so much, as well as the press freedoms we value so highly, are all at risk,” she wrote. “As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place.” On Friday, former staff members at The News of the World questioned why Ms. Brooks did not resign earlier. “Our paper was sacrificed to save her career, and now she’s gone as well,” one former employee said, requesting anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his position in severance negotiations. “Who knows why they’ve chosen to do it now, as she’ll have to appear before the select committee anyway.” Until Friday, Mr. Hinton had been largely an offstage figure in the scandal. But questions grew about what he knew about the improper practices going on at the newspapers under his watch, even though he has testified twice before Parliament saying that he believed the hacking was limited to one rogue journalist and a private investigator employed by The News of the World. 1 2 Next Page » John F.

In Europe, Italy’s cost of borrowing rose to the highest level in many months, as traders worried that Greece’s financial problems might not be contained. In the new Weekend Business podcast, Floyd Norris, chief financial correspondent for The Times, says that while the problems in Europe have roiled the markets, a major financial issue in the United States so far has not. That is the inability of Congress and the White House to agree on an increase in the debt ceiling of the United States. If such an agreement is not in place by Aug. 2, the Treasury secretary has warned that the government could default on its debt, with catastrophic consequences. So far at least, Treasury yields remain extremely low and prices, which move in the opposite direction, are quite high, a sign that the markets are convinced that this crisis is a nonevent. We shall soon see whether this is true, Mr. Norris says. Other problems — the weakness of the United States economy, high unemployment, and a large and growing debt load — are also looming. For the moment, though, a benign summertime mood has prevailed, and domestic stock and bond markets have remained relatively calm. In another portion of the podcast, I chat with Mr. Norris about the phone-hacking and bribery scandal that has shaken the Murdoch media empire. It has already led to the shuttering of one newspaper, numerous arrests, top-level executive changes and investigations in London and in New York. The business of legal education in the United States is the focus of a cover article by David Segal in Sunday Business. In a podcast conversation with David Gillen, Mr. Segal says many law schools have sharply increased their fees, enrollment and capital spending, even as the job market for law school graduates has shrunk. And in the Economic View column, the economist Richard Thaler revisits the annuity puzzle — the unpopularity of annuities despite their economic advantages. Traditional pensions are a form of annuities, but as working people shift to defined-benefit plans like 401(k)’s, they are faced with a bewildering set of options upon retirement. Yet few of them choose to buy annuities. As he says in a podcast conversation, Social Security is a form of annuity — and he suggests that by delaying the receipt of benefit checks, people can greatly increase their monthly payouts. This may simplify financial planning. It’s advantageous, of course, only if you live long enough for your increased monthly benefits to offset the loss of the checks you are voluntarily giving up. Social Security could also be modified to allow recipients to “top off” their benefits by purchasing larger annuities, Mr. Thaler suggests. I also discuss a contest between vice and virtue in mutual fund performance, the subject of my Strategies column in Sunday Business. The second-best performer among all general domestic mutual funds in the second quarter was the Vice fund, which focuses on tobacco, alcohol, gambling and military companies. The best performer, though, was the Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth fund. Virtus is a Latin word for virtue. How virtuous is the Virtus fund? There are some answers in the podcast and in the column.

Ms. Brooks had agreed from the outset to testify. Word that the Murdochs had shifted course came as one of several other moves by the News Corporation on Thursday that signaled the company was adopting a more assertive strategy to deflect the condemnation being hurled its way. It brought on outside public relations help for the crisis, hired a prominent white-collar defense lawyer and was said to be planning to run full-page apology advertisements in newspapers across Britain. The elder Mr. Murdoch made his first extended comments on the matter, phoning a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, which he owns, to defend his company’s handling of the crisis. He said the matter had been handled “extremely well in every way possible,” and rejected claims that his son James had moved too slowly to address concerns about the hacking. He added that he was eager “to address some of the things that have been said in Parliament, some of which are total lies,” and said reports that the News Corporation was contemplating spinning off its newspapers into a separate entity were “pure rubbish.” Meanwhile, the company’s woes increased on Thursday when yet another former senior editor of its tabloid The News of the World, now defunct, Neil Wallis, became the ninth person since January to be arrested in the phone-hacking scandal. Mr. Wallis also appears to have unusually close ties to top officers at the Metropolitan Police Service, and worked for them as a public relations consultant last year. Next Tuesday’s meeting will be the first time the Murdochs and Ms. Brooks will have to publicly answer questions about the affair. With evidence mounting by the day of criminality and dubious journalistic practices at The News of the World and other News Corporation newspapers here, the company not only has summarily closed the paper, but also has withdrawn its $12 billion bid for British Sky Broadcasting. In response to earlier letters from the culture committee, Rupert Murdoch at first announced he was “not available” to attend the hearing, while James Murdoch said that next week would not work for him, either, but that he would be available sometime in August, if that was convenient for everyone else. Not convenient, the angry committee retorted. Using only rarely invoked powers, the committee’s chairman, John Whittingdale, responded by ordering that the Murdochs be presented with formal summonses to appear. Mr. Whittingdale, a Conservative member of Parliament, also declared that he was fully prepared to “empty-chair” the Murdochs by holding their portion of the hearing without them, using two chairs as stand-ins. After waiting a while for them to turn up, he said, he then planned to ask that they be declared in contempt of Parliament. Rupert Murdoch’s hasty U-turn reflects the company’s confusion in handling the crisis and a sense that its chairman has been unable to properly judge the public mood. By cooperating with the committee, people close to Mr. Murdoch believe, he can demonstrate that he is taking the scandal seriously. The public relations firm Edelman confirmed on Thursday that it had been hired here by News International to provide “communications and public affairs support and counsel,” another sign that the company was trying to develop a better strategy to help it navigate the crisis. News International also flew staff members from Rubenstein Associates, the powerful New York public relations firm that already advises Mr. Murdoch, to London to help out. The criminal lawyer they hired, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. of Williams &amp; Connolly in Washington, has defended Richard A. Grasso, the former chief of the New York Stock Exchange, and Oliver North. Mr. Wallis’s arrest, while bad news for the company, is also doubly worrying for the Metropolitan Police Service. The police are already under attack for failing to adequately pursue the phone-hacking inquiry in 2006, and again for failing to reopen the investigation in light of new evidence in 2009. While Mr. Wallis is not the most important figure yet to be arrested — that would be Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World who until January was Prime Minister David Cameron’s chief spokesman — he is close to Scotland Yard. After leaving The News of the World in 2009, Mr. Wallis became a media consultant, whereupon he was immediately hired to “provide strategic communication advice” to Scotland Yard officials from October 2009 to September 2010, according to a police spokesman. His firm offered the lowest rate, the spokesman said, explaining how he got the job. But his ties to the police went back longer. In September 2006, one month after The News of the World’s royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, was arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and the paper Mr. Wallis worked for was supposedly under investigation, Mr. Wallis had dinner with Sir Paul Stephenson, then Scotland Yard’s deputy commissioner, and Dick Fedorcio, its chief spokesman. Sir Paul, now the police commissioner, said on Thursday that he was “very satisfied with my own integrity.” More recently, Assistant Commissioner John Yates, another top police official, told a parliamentary committee in March that he could not remember exactly when he last had lunch with Mr. Wallis, but that it “may well” have been in February. A police spokesman said he did not know the precise date of this engagement. But if it was indeed in February, that meant that it took place after the police had already opened Operation Weeting, the investigation into phone hacking under which Mr. Wallis has now been arrested. Late Thursday, London’s mayor, Boris Johnson, summoned Sir Paul to City Hall for a stern lecture about his decision to hire Mr. Wallis in 2009, local news outlets reported, and Mr. Johnson said he would press for a full investigation. Meanwhile, the House of Commons’ culture committee is gearing up for its confrontation with the Murdochs and Ms. Brooks at next week’s hearing. Judging from the outraged remarks lawmakers have been making about the News Corporation and its officers in raucous, angry sessions in Parliament the last few days, it is not likely to be a friendly discussion. But it is unclear how much the trio will say, in the end. In a letter to Mr. Whittingdale in which she agreed to testify, Ms. Brooks declared that it “might not be appropriate” to answer questions about the police investigation for fear of prejudicing it. “As a result this may prevent me from discussing these matters in detail,” she said. Mr. Whittingdale said in response: “We’ll see.” Reporting was contributed by Don Van Natta Jr., Ravi Somaiya and Jo Becker from London, and Jeremy W. Peters from New York.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/business/murdochs-woes-could-include-bancrofts.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch’s Woes Could Include Bancrofts<date>Published: July 14, 2011</date><text>Add to Rupert Murdoch’s list of potential headaches a blast from the past: the Bancroft family. The media mogul’s British newspaper scandal has upset some members of the family who gave in to News Corporation’s $5 billion offer to buy Dow Jones in 2007.It’s hard to feel much sympathy for the Bancrofts. But the pact they forged to ensure The Wall Street Journal’s integrity gave a special committee powers that could embarrass Mr. Murdoch beyond what has happened already. As it is, the News Corporation potentially faces bigger legal problems in the United States. Lawmakers called on Wednesday for bribery investigations. And a finding that The News of the World illegally paid Scotland Yard for information could mean fines under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Under some circumstances, these fines can be huge: TKSJ, a multinational energy venture in Nigeria, settled for more than $1.2 billion last year. If recent allegations of voice mail break-ins are proved to be true, American antihacking laws could also spell trouble. The laws can cover servers in foreign countries, so a defense that the break-ins occurred only in Britain would not necessarily work. And worst-case penalties stretch to 20 years in prison. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into phone hacking allegations, too. The special committee at Dow Jones does not have that kind of clout, but could still matter. To date, the committee has been toothless. It expressed mere dismay when Marcus Brauchli was ushered out as The Wall Street Journal managing editor shortly after News Corporation’s takeover. (Mr. Brauchli resigned voluntarily, so the editorial agreement was not explicitly breached.) This time could be different. To the Bancrofts’ credit, the agreement requires News Corporation to preserve the integrity not just of Dow Jones, but of all the company’s “publications and newsgathering services.” Arguably, those principles have been violated at its British outlets. And if the committee of five chooses, it can hire investigators, lawyers and accountants to conduct their own investigation, with full access to News Corporation’s books, records and people. What is not clear from the agreement are the remedies the committee could potentially extract. But it could enlist big-name outside help and make its findings public. That might inflict damage on News Corporation’s reputation that shows up as big dollars as well as red faces. Decoupling in Big Oil ConocoPhillips has broken the mold. The company, which is America’s third-largest energy group after Exxon Mobil and Chevron, is splitting exploration from production and downstream operations. With investors quickly adding as much as $5 billion to Conoco’s value, the message to other integrated companies like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell is getting louder. The current model is an article of faith. For decades, oil companies have claimed it provides a hedge against fluctuating oil prices, offers operational benefits and helps pry open foreign energy reserves. Yet in a one-hour phone presentation Thursday, Conoco’s chief executive, James J. Mulva , renounced one of the guiding principles of his career. He was right to recant his faith. Combining racy exploration operations with more sedate refining and marketing businesses no longer makes sense. Mr. Mulva conceded there were no meaningful operational synergies. And since oil-rich nations can build their own refineries, offering downstream expertise gives Big Oil little leverage in accessing new reserves. Judging from recent history, the initial burst of enthusiasm from Conoco shareholders should be sustainable. Marathon, a smaller rival, built on its early gains after it announced a similar split in January, outperforming Conoco by over 20 percent. It would be no surprise to see Conoco catch up now. As Mr. Mulva pointed out, the breakup will give investors a clearer choice and enable management to focus more clearly. The valuation gulf is pronounced. Integrated firms trade on a multiple of about nine times 2011 earnings. Independent American refinery companies fetch valuations closer to 13 times while exploration and production firms command a punchier multiple of 20. Big players cannot hope to match the growth of smaller explorers. But getting even part of the way to these multiples, according to a sum-of-the-parts analysis by Breakingviews, could ultimately be worth an extra 20 percent — in Conoco’s case, an extra $20 billion of value. Conoco is not the first to split, but is by far the largest to do so. Having a true peer break with the integrated model may finally encourage the likes of Chevron and Exxon to find some religion, too, and unlock similar storehouses of value for their shareholders.

On Friday, the official Formula 1 Web site published an interview with Martin Whitmarsh, the director of the McLaren Mercedes team, in which he discusses some of the same issues. It is interesting to compare the point of view of the promoter with that of a team director — to see the future of Formula One through the eyes of two of the signatories to the Concorde Agreement, the commercial agreement that governs the series. Ecclestone and the teams are sometimes at odds about the sports’ future, so take a look at both interviews for a balanced look at the current thinking. Ecclestone spoke about how he has been told that F1 should chase down and develop ideas for new media, but that no one seems to have any idea what direction that should take. Whitmarsh, too, said F1 should develop the new media, but he seemed a little behind the times in saying that TV will soon come to telephones — it already has, including F1 races. He also said that perhaps no one within Formula One really understands the new media. “You can’t hold new developments back, so we need to bring in expertise that probably doesn’t exist in Formula One today,” Whitmarsh said. As for the prospects  for a change in ownership, and the recent talk of News Corp. taking over F1, I suspect that the scandal surrounding News Corp. now will make it unlikely that the company would make a bid for the series in the immediate future.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/law-surprise-news-corp-s-hiring-of-williams-connolly/?ref=newscorporation">Law Surprise: News Corp.'s Hiring of Williams &amp; Connolly<date>July 15, 2011, 5:13 pm</date><text>Scott Olson/Getty ImagesJoel I.

Klein is playing in managing the company’s mounting legal problems, and also highlights the void in legal leadership that currently exists at the News Corporation. Mr. Klein, a longtime Washington lawyer, has close ties to Williams &amp; Connolly. His wife, Nicole Seligman, is a former prominent partner at the firm who worked closely with Mr. Sullivan on numerous cases. She now serves as general counsel of the Sony Corporation. Mr. Murdoch announced last week that Mr. Klein was taking charge of the News Corporation’s internal investigation of phone hacking. It was a surprising turn in the career of Mr. Klein, the former top antitrust lawyer in President Bill Clinton’s Justice Department who left his job as chancellor of the New York City public schools to join the News Corporation. But his role at the media empire was a decidedly nonlegal one: Mr. Klein was charged with pursuing “entrepreneurial ventures” focused on education. But when the phone-hacking scandal erupted early last week, Mr. Murdoch found himself without a general counsel. Last month Lawrence A. Jacobs, the company’s highest-ranking in-house lawyer, left “to pursue new opportunities.” That led Mr. Murdoch to put Mr. Klein, who had also joined the company’s board of directors, in charge of the phone-hacking investigation. Mr. Klein and Williams &amp; Connolly have their hands full, as the company’s legal problems have spilled over into the United States with criminal investigations, civil lawsuits and other government probes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry on Thursday into allegations that News Corporation journalists sought to gain access to the phone records of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. On Wednesday, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, suggested that government authorities should examine the case and consider starting a formal investigation, invoking potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act statute as a potential line of inquiry. It is a plum assignment for Williams &amp; Connolly, the prominent Washington law firm known for its high-stakes litigation practice. Mr. Sullivan is no stranger to big cases, having represented, among others, the late former Senator Ted Stevens in a political corruption trial, Richard Grasso of the New York Stock Exchange in an executive compensation case and Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair. Lawyers within Hogan Lovells and Skadden are disappointed over not getting the phone-hacking assignment from the News Corporation, according to people within both firms who declined to speak publicly about the matter. Internal corporate investigations, especially large ones like this with international and criminal components, are among the more lucrative jobs for a company’s outside law firm. A News Corporation spokeswoman declined to comment. Spokesmen for Hogan and Skadden declined to comment. Skadden has done much of the News Corporation’s mergers and acquisitions work over the last several years, including its 2007 purchase of Dow Jones. The firm also represented the company in its bid for the British Sky Broadcasting Group, which the News Corporation dropped on Wednesday under pressure from the British government. Perhaps the bigger blow is to Hogan Lovells, which recently represented the News Corporation in its $500 million settlement with Valassis Communications. The company had accused a News Corporation subsidiary of trying to obtain a monopoly in the in-store coupon business. Hogan became one of the News Corporation’s main outside counsels when it acquired the New York law firm Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent &amp; Sheinfeld in 2002. Its deep ties to the News Corporation date back to 1973, when Mr. Murdoch shifted his focus to the United States and hired the late Howard Squadron as his legal counsel. Mr. Murdoch has credited Mr. Squadron with helping the News Corporation become one of the largest media companies in the world. Another Squadron lawyer, Ira S. Sheinfeld, still works at Hogan and is the News Corporation’s longtime tax adviser. Mr. Murdoch has also recruited a series of Squadron lawyers in-house to play senior roles in the News Corporation’s legal department. The first was Arthur Siskind, who joined the News Corporation as its chief legal officer in 1991. He was succeeded in 2004 by Mr. Jacobs, also a Squadron partner, who left last month. Several other senior News Corporation lawyers started their careers at Squadron, including Mark Jackson, the top lawyer at Dow Jones, and Genie Gavenchak, the company’s chief compliance officer. The News Corporation’s hiring of Williams &amp; Connolly also stings the Washington-based Hogan for a historical reason. In 1967, Hogan’s star trial lawyer, Edward Bennett Williams, left the firm to start Williams &amp; Connolly.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/complete-text-rupert-murdochs-apology/?ref=newscorporation">Rupert Murdoch Apologizes to Victims of Phone Hacking<date>July 15, 2011, 12:27 pm</date><text>Updated | 1:44 p.m. Since, remarkably, Rupert Murdoch’s personal letter of apology for the phone hacking scandal will run in its pages as a full-page ad on Saturday, The Guardian has obtained the complete text and posted it online. Rupert Murdoch ‘sorry’ ad The letter, which is signed by Mr. Murdoch, will be published in all of Britain’s national newspapers this weekend. It reads: We are sorry. The News of the World was in the business of holding others to account. It failed when it came to itself. We are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred. We are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected. We regret not acting faster to sort things out. I realise that simply apologising is not enough. Our business was founded on the idea that a free and open press should be a positive force in society. We need to live up to this. In the coming days, as we take further concrete steps to resolve these issues and make amends for the damage they have caused, you will hear more from us. Sincerely, Rupert Murdoch Later on Friday, Mr. Murdoch met with the family of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in 2002, to apologize for the conduct of journalists at his newspaper, The News of the World, who broke into the girl’s voice mail account during the frantic search for her. This Sky News report includes remarks to the media from Mr. Murdoch and the family’s lawyer after the meeting: The fact that Mr. Murdoch’s letter of apology will appear in The Guardian is striking, since it was that newspaper’s July 8, 2009, report which first suggested that phone hacking had been far more widespread at The News of the World than an initial police investigation had revealed. As a Guardian interactive timeline explaining how the scandal unfolded reminds us, two days after The Guardian reported that the misconduct by News of the World journalists was apparently not limited to the actions of a single reporter, Clive Goodman, Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper division, News International, issued a statement dismissing those allegations. The full text of that statement remains on the News Corporation Web site. It began with the assertion that “News International has completed a thorough investigation into the various allegations made since the Guardian story broke on Wednesday.” After a discussion of the illegal phone-hacking carried out by Mr. Goodman — the tabloid’s former royal correspondent who was jailed, along with a private investigator, for breaking into the voice mail accounts of members of the British royal family — the statement moved on to this detailed list of denials, most of which now ring hollow in light of the revelations of the past weeks: From our own investigation, but more importantly that of the police, we can state with confidence that, apart from the matters referred to above, there is not and never has been evidence to support allegations that: • News of the World journalists have accessed the voicemails of any individual. • News of the World or its journalists have instructed private investigators or other third parties to access the voicemails of any individuals. • There was systemic corporate illegality by News International to suppress evidence. It goes without saying that had the police uncovered such evidence, charges would have been brought against other News of the World personnel. Not only have there been no such charges, but the police have not considered it necessary to arrest or question any other member of News of the World staff. Based on the above, we can state categorically in relation to the following allegations which have been made primarily by the Guardian and widely reported as fact by Sky News, BBC, ITN and others this week: • It is untrue that officers found evidence of News Group staff, either themselves or using private investigators, hacking into “thousands” of mobile phones. • It is untrue that apart from Goodman, officers found evidence that other members of News Group staff hacked into mobile phones or accessed individuals’ voicemails. • It is untrue that there is evidence that News Group reporters, or indeed anyone, hacked into the telephone voicemails of John Prescott. • It is untrue that “Murdoch journalists” used private investigators to illegally hack into the mobile phone messages of numerous public figures to gain unlawful access to confidential personal data, including: tax records, social security files, bank statements and itemised phone bills. • It is untrue that News Group reporters have hacked into telephone voicemail services of various footballers, politicians and celebrities named in reports this week. • It is untrue that News of the World executives knowingly sanctioned payment for illegal phone intercepts. All of these irresponsible and unsubstantiated allegations against News of the World and other News International titles and its journalists are false. The Guardian has been selective and misleading in its coverage of the report and investigation by the Information Commissioner.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/nyregion/fbi-opens-inquiry-into-hacking-of-911-victims.html?ref=newscorporation">F.B.I. Opens Inquiry Into Hacking of 9/11 Victims<date>Published: July 14, 2011</date><text>In response to requests from members of Congress and to at least one news report, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York opened a preliminary inquiry on Thursday into allegations that News Corporation journalists sought to gain access to the phone records of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to several people briefed on the matter.The investigation is in its earliest stages, two of the people said, and its scope is not yet clear. It also is unclear whether the F.B.I. has identified possible targets of the investigation or possible specific criminal violations. The bureau is “taking a hard look at it from a couple of angles,” one of the people said. The person said the matter was being treated as an assessment, a term the bureau uses to characterize the early stages of an investigation that precede the possible issuance of subpoenas or the use of other investigative tools like wiretaps. The inquiry was prompted in part by a letter from Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican, to Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, in which he asked that the bureau immediately open an investigation of News Corporation, citing news reports that journalists working for its subsidiary, The News of the World, had tried to obtain the phone records of 9/11 victims through bribery and unauthorized wiretapping, the people said. The decision to open a case in New York stemmed from the expanding hacking scandal that has wracked Britain for days, ever since disclosures that The News of the World had illegally intercepted the voice mail of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl abducted and murdered in 2002. It also follows a decision by the News Corporation’s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, to withdraw from the biggest media takeover bid in British history. The inquiry was expected to be handled jointly by two F.B.I. squads in the bureau’s New York office, one that investigates cybercrimes and another that focuses on public corruption and white-collar crimes, two of the people said. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case. It was not immediately clear whether federal prosecutors in Manhattan were involved in the case; they would most likely have jurisdiction over any prosecution because the 9/11 victims and their cellphones were in Manhattan when they died. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, also declined to comment. Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington, said: “The department does not comment specifically on investigations, though anytime we see evidence of wrongdoing, we take appropriate action. The department has received letters from several members of Congress regarding allegations related to News Corporation, and we’re reviewing those.” Jack Horner, a spokesman for the company, declined to comment. Mr. King said in his letter on Wednesday that he was requesting the investigation not only as the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Homeland Security, but also as a congressman whose district lost more than 150 people in the 9/11 attacks. “It is my duty to discern every fact behind these allegations,” he wrote. He cited recent news reports, apparently referring to an article first published on Monday in The Daily Mirror, a chief competitor to The News of the World, which was closed down on Sunday as a result of the scandal. The article said reporters working for the newspaper had contacted a private investigator, a former New York police officer, and offered to pay him to retrieve the phone numbers of 9/11 victims and get details of the calls they had made and received in the days leading up to the attacks. “If these allegations are proven true,” Mr. King wrote, “the conduct would merit felony charges for attempting to violate various federal statutes related to corruption of public officials and prohibitions against wiretapping. Any person found guilty of this purported conduct should receive the harshest sanctions available under law.” It is not clear whether the person referred to in the Daily Mirror article was a police officer at the time of the attacks. At least five Democratic lawmakers, who all had previously been critical of the News Corporation, spoke out about the matter this week. Mr. King was the first Republican to call for an investigation into the activities of the company, whose chief executive, Mr. Murdoch, is a longtime supporter of conservative causes and Republican politicians. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, was the first to issue a statement on the matter, saying on Tuesday that the United States government should hold investigations to “ensure that Americans have not had their privacy violated.” On Wednesday, he was joined by the two New Jersey senators, Robert Menendez and Frank R. Lautenberg. Senator Menendez asked the Justice Department to investigate the claims involving 9/11 victims, saying in his letter that the “large scope” of the hacking in Britain made it “imperative to investigate whether victims in the United States have been affected as well.” Senator Lautenberg suggested that both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission should examine the case and consider opening a formal investigation. He cited news reports that journalists had “paid London police officers for information, including private telephone information, about the British royal family and other individuals for use in newspaper articles.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/world/europe/15hinton.html?ref=newscorporation">Murdoch Loyalist in Hacking Scandal Spotlight<date>Published: July 14, 2011</date><text>In March 2003, a committee of the House of Commons summoned the executive in charge of Rupert Murdoch’s British newspapers to a hearing and put him on the spot about aggressive tabloid reporting tactics.“Is it time to clean up your act?” demanded one member of Parliament. Les Hinton, the executive chairman of News International at the time, was indignant in his reply. “Clean up our act? Are you saying we’re dirty?” With revelations that some within News International’s ranks were not only dirty but criminal, Mr. Hinton is coming under scrutiny for what he did and did not know when he ran the company from 1995 until 2007, the period when the most egregious known examples of voice mail hacking by News International employees took place. Gerald Kaufman, a member of Parliament who questioned Mr. Hinton at that 2003 hearing, recalled their frosty exchange. “Clearly it was dirty,” he said. “It’s not just I. It’s everybody in British public life who’s saying it’s dirty.” Even in a company noted for its loyalty, Mr. Hinton stands out both for his length of service — he has worked for Rupert Murdoch for more than 50 years — and for his wide experience within the News Corporation. He has worked in almost every part of the company and is chief executive of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal and the crown jewel of Mr. Murdoch’s American news media empire. It can seem difficult to square Mr. Hinton’s 12-year run at News International — a company whose papers ran pictures of nude women and paid sources for information — with his leadership of Dow Jones and The Journal, a paper that until recently preferred sketches over photographs. It is his tenure at News International that is now being re-examined. In statements to Parliament after the hacking came to light in 2006, Mr. Hinton said that it was limited to one rogue reporter. Mr. Hinton also said that he was never presented with any evidence that led him to believe the practice was widespread. No one has linked Mr. Hinton, 67, to the eavesdropping. But as evidence grows showing that intercepting private voice mail messages was common practice at Murdoch publications in Britain, his remarks would indicate at best that he unwittingly allowed a corrupt journalistic culture to flourish underneath him. “One explanation is connivance and alleged criminality,” said Claire Enders, a media analyst in Britain who has examined the potential fallout that the scandal could have on Mr. Murdoch’s businesses. “Another is a complete absence of engagement with the business — neither of which is expected of a senior officer of a major company.” One of the editors Mr. Hinton hired for The News of the World, Neil Wallis, was arrested Thursday in connection with the hacking scandal. The two served together as members of Britain’s Press Complaints Commission, with Mr. Hinton as chairman of the committee that sets journalistic standards. In an episode that gained notoriety across Britain, Mr. Wallis published nude shots of a radio personality in 2001 when he was editor of The People. The blunder cost the tabloid a settlement of £250,000, about $400,000, and produced a landmark privacy ruling. Politicians and the public were outraged, particularly because Mr. Wallis sat on the commission responsible for policing journalistic integrity. According to news media accounts at the time, Mr. Hinton told him in colorfully explicit terms that he was an “idiot” for buying the pictures. A little more than a year later, Mr. Wallis was hired as The News of the World’s deputy editor. Mr. Hinton and a Dow Jones spokeswoman declined to comment. Few people who work for Mr. Murdoch are closer to him than Mr. Hinton. At age 15, he joined the first paper that Mr. Murdoch ever owned, The News of Adelaide, a tabloid in South Australia. Two years ago, Mr. Murdoch threw a party for Mr. Hinton celebrating his 50th year with News Corporation. Delivering the toasts were Mr. Murdoch; The New York Post’s editor, Col Allan; and Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World editor at the center of the hacking fiasco. Mr. Hinton, a skilled dancer, is known for being the center of attention at Christmas parties, and he has proved popular among his employees at The Wall Street Journal. They use the phrase “Les is more” to express their affection (although Mr. Hinton is always quick to correct the Americans who pronounce his name “less,” telling them it is pronounced “lez”). As Mr. Murdoch built a news media empire from London to Los Angeles, Mr. Hinton followed, running News Corporation businesses on two continents. He got his start in the United States as a reporter, then crossed to the business operations. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article></page></root>
