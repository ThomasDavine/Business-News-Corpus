But consumers need more protection. The voluntary agreement announced last week between the main wireless industry group and the Federal Communications Commission only scratches the surface of troublesome pricing practices that have flourished in an industry that faces insufficient competition. The deal imposes no penalties on the wireless companies for violations. It might work, but the F.C.C. must convince carriers that violations will lead to real regulations with bite. Carriers often fail to respond to complaints without intervention from government regulators. For years, Verizon Wireless incorrectly billed millions of customers for data access that they did not use. Last year, the company publicly acknowledged the problem and agreed to pay $53 million in refunds and a $25 million settlement with the F.C.C. -- after the agency opened an investigation. The wireless industry argues that it should remain as unregulated as possible because it is very competitive. But this not true. Most customers, locked into their contracts by high early-termination penalties, have no easy way to switch providers. (There are some unlocked plans, but they can be more expensive and offer more limited service.) And two companies -- Verizon and AT&amp;T -- now control 60 percent of the market nationwide. Wireless pricing policies reflect this uncompetitive landscape. Take cellphone text messaging. Companies typically charge from $5 for 250 texts a month (2 cents per message) to $20 for an unlimited package. Pay-as-you-go rates can be as high as 20 cents a message. But the cost of sending a text message is about a third of a penny, according to Congressional testimony from Srinivasan Keshav, a professor at the University of Waterloo. The markup is enormous. Even the most expensive monthly wireless data plans, costing about $15 for 250 megabytes or 6 cents per megabyte, are orders of magnitude cheaper than cellphone text pricing. It is hugely profitable for companies to segregate voice, data and text into different plans and to force customers to buy a different plan for each device, like a phone or a tablet. But, on today's networks, segregating services makes little sense technologically. This expensive segregation would be more difficult to maintain if the market were truly competitive and consumers could easily switch from one company to another that offers a better deal. The regulatory outlook is not promising. The F.C.C. has shied away from asserting that voice and data moving on wireless networks are the same thing, which would allow it to apply its greater authority over phones to broadband access services. But it could curtail high early-termination fees on phone contracts, which are subject to more intense regulation. This would increase competition by making it easier for customers to change carriers. If Congress allows the F.C.C. to reallocate television broadcasters' unused spectrum and auction it for wireless broadband, the F.C.C. could set rules to ensure that the spectrum is available to more competitors. Perhaps the most effective path would be for the F.C.C. to declare broadband access to be a telecommunication service over which it has more control. Without action, consumers are stuck with a deregulated, less-than-competitive market.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/business/sprints-hand-in-antitrust-suit.html?ref=atandt">Sprint’s Hand in Antitrust Suit<date>Published: October 25, 2011</date><text> Sprint’s efforts to thwart AT&amp;T’s $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA hedge against a swing and a miss by the Justice Department. The company, the third-largest mobile operator, has said it just wants to help the government. But its separate lawsuit suggests a lack of confidence in federal arguments. Though a court hearing on Monday showed the case faces hurdles, it may give Sprint insurance in case the government stumbles. Judges generally look askance at competitors’ lawsuits to block mergers. Antitrust law doesn’t protect rivals from harmful competition, the Supreme Court has ruled, unless it’s clear their injuries would also damage consumers. Merely filing a suit can appear self-serving and undercut a company’s arguments, and legal fees are costly. That’s why most firms let the Justice Department do the heavy lifting and cheer from the sidelines. Sprint, though, says that stepping in frees it to make clearer legal points and give the government technical support about the industry. The latter may be harder to accomplish after a judge’s ruling on Monday denied the company access to AT&amp;T documents already given to the government. Sprint also notes that the more lawsuits AT&amp;T faces, the tougher a settlement — and consummation of the deal — will be. But court documents suggest another reason. The government argues that the merger would cut competition, curb innovation and raise prices. Sprint says the deal would block smaller rivals from offering cutting-edge handsets, reaching roaming agreements and gaining access to so-called backhaul services, which tie a central network to remote sites. Both sets of results could harm consumers. But the first might benefit Sprint if higher prices gave it a competitive edge. The second would limit its market. Antitrust-law experts critical of the Justice Department’s argument say Sprint’s is legally much stronger. The stock market seems to agree. When the government announced its lawsuit on Aug. 31, Sprint’s stock jumped substantially. That’s a surprising reaction to a move intended to keep the mobile industry generally from raising prices. Sprint says the government’s case is strong. That the company felt compelled to make its own arguments in a rare lawsuit may be telling nonetheless. With AT&amp;T’s play for T-Mobile threatening to create a wireless behemoth, there’s a lot at stake for Sprint. Little wonder that it wants to have its own say in court.  Netflix Woes Netflix’s story of triumph has turned quickly into something akin to “The China Syndrome.” Like the nuclear disaster depicted in that 1979 film, the company’s core, where profit is concerned, is melting down. Until Monday, Netflix had been cagey about the respective profitability of the two units it was planning to separate. New figures show Netflix makes about 10 times more from a DVD customer than from an online streaming subscriber. Trouble is, the wrong arm is shrinking — fast. The future for Netflix was always in streaming. There’s no reason to wait for a DVD in the mail when a movie can be delivered instantly. Still, many subscribers complained when Netflix outlined plans this year to split the two businesses. The company reversed itself, but related disclosure proceeded. The new numbers reveal that while money-losing international businesses are growing, far larger domestic operations have hit a wall. Netflix reckons it could lose as much as 7 percent of its streaming subscribers this quarter. Worse, up to 3.6 million of its 13.9 million DVD subscribers could flee by the end of the fourth quarter. Netflix says profit from United States DVD rentals should be $177 million to $192 million. It will make just $30 million to $42 million on streaming, even though there are twice as many buyers of the service. A recent price increase undoubtedly exacerbated the loss of these more valuable customers. Many opted for streaming only to save cash. But even Netflix acknowledges that DVDs are a dying business. The associated profit will deflate over time anyway. Profit from streaming could grow as subscribers are added, but the cost of programming is rising and competition is stiffening. It’s understandable that Netflix lost about 35 percent of its market value Tuesday, and its value has fallen about 75 percent from its high in July. The company still trades at about 17 times estimated earnings for this year. After these forecasts are slashed on the heels of the latest revelations, Netflix will still command a premium valuation. But with its biggest source of profit evaporating, the company’s shares no longer deserve one.      For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com. </text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/technology/att-profit-is-hit-by-slowing-iphone-demand.html?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Reports Sluggish Quarter, Meeting Expectations<date>Published: October 20, 2011</date><text>For the wireless industry, it’s a time of sluggish growth, as the carriers battle it out to find new subscribers, especially those who will pay for lucrative data plans on smartphones. AT&amp;T’s quarterly earnings, announced on Thursday, reflected those trends, with the company reporting results that just barely met Wall Street’s expectations. AT&amp;T activated only 2.7 million iPhones during the third quarter, which ended on Sept. 20, the lowest figure reported in 18 months. It said it also added 319,000 wireless customers, roughly in line with analysts’ expectations, but less than half the number that the company added during the same period a year ago. “This is a country that, for all purposes, is 100 percent saturated with wireless customers,” said Rick Franklin, an analyst at Edward Jones, a financial services firm. “Given that there is any growth at all with AT&amp;T is an amazing feat.” The results also show that AT&amp;T continues to rely heavily on mobile data revenue, as the company shifts away from its legacy landline business and becomes largely wireless-centric. AT&amp;T said 75 percent of the company’s total revenue was derived from wireless data and landline data revenue. Mr. Franklin, the analyst, pointed to a few encouraging signs in the earnings report. Despite the disappointing number of iPhone sales in the quarter, AT&amp;T said it sold one million units of Apple’s latest iPhone, the 4S, which was released after the end of the quarter. That number is 25 percent of the total volume sold during the first 24 hours the device was available for purchase, indicating that many customers waited for the new model before opening their wallets. The company posted a profit of $3.6 billion, or 61 cents a share, compared with a profit of $12.3 billion, or $2.07 a share, during the same quarter a year earlier, although the 2010 figures were bolstered significantly by the sale of assets. Analysts had expected AT&amp;T to earn 61 cents a share. AT&amp;T’s operating revenue slipped to $31.48 billion during the quarter, compared with $31.58 billion a year ago, a decline of less than 1 percent. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected the company to report operating revenue of $31.60 billion. AT&amp;T executives shrugged off their lackluster results. “It was slow because we didn’t have an iPhone launch like we did a year ago,” said Ralph de la Vega, the president and chief executive of AT&amp;T’s consumer and wireless businesses, during a call to investors and analysts early Thursday morning. Mr. de la Vega said he expected “unbelievable” results during the fourth quarter, bolstered by high sales from the holiday season, offers of the iPhone 3GS at a low cost for new subscribers and the introduction of new devices compatible with LTE, the next-generation wireless network that AT&amp;T is installing. “We expect blockbuster sales in the fourth quarter,” he said. “We are very confident it will pick up.” Mr. Franklin also said AT&amp;T’s churn rate, an industry measurement of the rate at which wireless customers leave their carriers, was lower than expectations for the quarter. “Customers are satisfied,” he said. That, he said, is vital for future results as competition in the industry becomes fiercer, particularly now that AT&amp;T no longer has the exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in the United States. “When you go from a monopoly position to a nonmonopoly position, you are bound to feel some pressure,” he said. “I’m sure AT&amp;T is feeling some pressure.” AT&amp;T reported that the number of Android and other non-iPhone devices it sold more than doubled year-over-year, making up half the 4.8 million devices AT&amp;T sold, indicating that the company is no longer as reliant on Apple as it once was. The true contour of how AT&amp;T is faring against its rivals will not be known until the other wireless carriers report their earnings. Although AT&amp;T reported only a 4.3 percent increase in its wireless service revenue and a 1 percent increase in the average amount of revenue generated by each wireless customer, typically one of the industry’s strongest growth indicators, it is not clear that Verizon will fare more favorably. Even so, the earnings report appeared to disappoint investors. AT&amp;T’s stock closed down by about 0.3 percent. But analysts say Wall Street may still need to catch up to the realities of the changes currently enveloping the wireless industry. “This may be the new normal,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company who follows the telecommunications industry. “It looks more and more like AT&amp;T is going to have to depend on organic growth and unfortunately, there isn’t any.

It will change not just how we drive, but the economics of the car business. “Five percent of cars are connected today,” said Glenn Lurie, president of AT&amp;T’s Emerging Devices business. He was speaking of new vehicles, not all cars on the road. “Three to five years from now, 100 percent will be connected. You’ll see diagnostics, calls when the airbag goes off, real-time traffic reports, entertainment in the back seat.” The CTIA Show Dispatches from the wireless industry’s fall event. Mr. Lurie was at CTIA, a wireless industry gathering in San Diego. On Tuesday, General Motors’s Cadillac unit showed off a luxury car platform, called Cue, which will appear in three car models in 2012. In addition to the safety monitoring features, the version shown in the Cadillac XTS featured an 8-inch touch screen that displayed maps, climate controls, weather and text messaging, among other things. It was possible to plug a smartphone in the car in order to have the messages read aloud. Ford has shown a similar entertainment system, as well as monitoring and information systems for its electric cars, so drivers can find the nearest charging station. AT&amp;T works with Ford, as well as BMW and Nissan, and talks with lots of other manufacturers. What he sees as much as anything is an explosion of business models that will go with the connected cars. Should the devices cost more up front, or be discounted in exchange for service plans, the way cellphones are? How about engine diagnostics that tell you when to bring the car in, and can even schedule a visit during a down time for the service center, fetching a better price? Should phones and cars work together, through AT&amp;T, to make real-time maps of traffic conditions? “We have 100 million probes out there” in the form of consumers using mobile phones on the network, Mr. Lurie said. “There will be all kinds of models – put it in the price, give it away for the first year, sell it by the month.” The effect on the car business, he said, will be “a watershed.” Cars are not the only vehicles getting connected. AT&amp;T’s business solutions group has worked with manufacturers of tractors to enable wireless monitoring of engine data, and with crane makers, to measure use and inform people when goods are loaded. Sometimes the company makes money by shipping the data, sometimes it works as a consultant, figuring out what part of the business should get networked. Many of these projects have been multimillion-dollar ventures, years in the planning. Mr. Lurie thinks that the next step may be more grassroots, as smaller companies figure out how to repurpose existing devices, like the iPod, to work in new environments. “What will be more innovative than people realize is the accessories business,” he said. “What kind of cradle does the device fit into in the home, or the office or the car?” The tablet may spend part of its day as a picture frame on an office desk, he said, and later be hooked into the screens of an online multiplayer game. “Apple and Samsung will do things,” he said, “but so will innovative third parties.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/the-next-boom-in-mobile-technology-happens-in-the-car/?ref=atandt">The Next Boom in Mobile Technology Happens in the Car<date>October 13, 2011, 11:16 am</date><text>Our colleagues at Bits report from CTIA, a wireless industry gathering in San Diego, where companies are eager to highlight how passenger cars are the next frontier for wired services. “Five percent of cars are connected today,” said Glenn Lurie, president of AT&amp;T’s Emerging Devices business.

The next step is choosing a carrier, and while your decision may be based on any number of factors like coverage or the compelling nature of commercials, I was trying to figure it out by looking at the best value. And I am flummoxed because — big surprise — the carriers don’t make it easy. Apple lays out the various plans for you in a very convenient fashion, but the plans (by design) are not comparable. Let’s take a stab at it anyway. First, no one talks on phones any more. So we can start with the minimum number of voice minutes for that. For AT&amp;T and Verizon that is $40 a month. For Sprint it is $80, but that includes unlimited data and text messaging. So on to the other two carriers in those categories. AT&amp;T gives you only two options for text messages: pay per use and unlimited for another $20. Unless you are a teenager, you aren’t going to send 100 text messages a month. There are loads of ways to send text messages free outside the carrier’s control (including the new iMessage feature on the iPhone), so go for pay per use and never use it. Do the same for Verizon, though I suppose you could pay $5 a month for 250 text messages a month, just as insurance. Now the hard part: data. It’s hard because you never really know how much to use. (You can check your use by looking at your account with your current carrier.) But you are going to use at least two gigabytes a month. For AT&amp;T that’s $25, and for Verizon it’s $30. So at this point, it its AT&amp;T at $65 and Verizon at $70. These two plans look cheaper than Sprint, but Sprint is letting you have more data. Should you need more data (or you still don’t believe Sprint’s marketing that it is no longer the customer-unfriendly company it once was), AT&amp;T sells four gigabytes for $45 and you can use the phone as a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot for other devices, like an iPad or a laptop. You can get the same amount from Verizon, but it will cost $50. (that’s $30 for two gigabytes of data and another $20 for two additional gigabytes with mobile hotspot service). So again, advantage AT&amp;T, by $5.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/how-to-pick-the-best-iphone-4s-carrier/?ref=atandt">How to Pick the Best iPhone 4S Carrier<date>October 12, 2011, 8:29 pm</date><text>If you’re in the market for an iPhone 4S, you may be wondering which carrier you should give your money to. After all, you now have a new choice to consider, Sprint, not to mention the ever-shifting landscape of each carrier’s plans and add-ons. Let’s try to break it down. In order to do this, however, we must start by acknowledging that different people want different things out of their phone. Some people travel internationally a great deal; some stay stateside almost all of the time. Some people are counting pennies; some people are rolling in cash. So before we go any further, let’s identify a few categories that all carriers can be judged by. Network quality – Some call this “coverage,” others “speed,” but it’s all basically the same–will your calls and texts and browsing get through? Plan costs – How much will you be paying each month? Is one carrier considerably cheaper than another? And remember–this category has more to do with data costs these days than it does with voice minutes. International roaming costs – All iPhone 4S’s are world phones, so they can function in most places on the globe. But are you locked in to your carrier’s international calling plan if you leave the country, or can you swap SIM cards and use a local provider for far less? Browsing while talking – Only AT&amp;T‘s network lets you use a Web browser and Internet-enabled apps at the same time you are talking to someone on the phone. On a Verizon or Sprint phone, you have to hang up your call to go on the Internet. Not all these factors are equal — and they’re certainly not valued the same way by every user. Network quality seems fairly important to everyone, but international costs? If you do care about that, then you care a lot. That being the case, let’s rank their importance as best we can, giving each a value from 4 points (most important) to 1 (least important). For example, here’s how my needs stack up: Ranking Values Network Quality: 4 (I want my phone to work.) Browsing while talking: 3 (It’s not huge, but I like it.) Plan costs: 2 (The difference in plan prices is between $5 and $10 for me.) International costs: 1 (I am rarely out of the country.) Your mileage may vary, but you can do the same ranking/points list. Now, let’s shift gears slightly. While everyone’s going to prioritize differently, there are some things we do know for sure: Verizon has a better network than AT&amp;T or Sprint. (You may disagree.) Sprint has the cheapest plans. Only AT&amp;T lets you browse and talk at the same time. Only Verizon lets you use local SIM cards when abroad. So, we can give points to this as well, with the higher point value going to the company with the better/most consumer-friendly attribute. There are three players, but in all cases, there’s always a tie between two of them, so I’ve limited the points field to 2 points: Attribute Values Network Quality: Verizon 2, AT&amp;T 1, Sprint 1 Plan costs: Sprint 2, Verizon 1, AT&amp;T 1 Browse and talk: AT&amp;T 2, Verizon 1, Sprint 1 International costs: Verizon 2, AT&amp;T 1, Sprint 1 Now, I’m no Nate Silver, but if you take your ranking values and multiply them by the attribute values, you get a rough idea of which carrier is better at the things which are important to you. Again, I’ll use my preferences as an example: Network quality was my most important thing, at 4 points. That means that Verizon gets 8 points (ranking value of 4 points times attribute value of 2), while AT&amp;T and Sprint each get 4 points. Browsing while talking was my second-most important thing, at 3 points. That means that AT&amp;T gets 6 points for that, while Verizon and Sprint get 3 each. Plan costs was my third-most important thing, at 2 points. That means that Sprint gets 4 points for that, while Verizon and AT&amp;T get 2 each. International costs was last, at 1 point. Verizon gets 2 points, and AT&amp;T and Sprint each get 1 point. So, add that all up and… Verizon – 15 points AT&amp;T – 13 points Sprint – 12 points Looks like I know which carrier I’m supposed to go with.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/carrier-rivalry-sharpens-as-iphone-comes-to-sprint/?ref=atandt">Carrier Rivalry Sharpens as iPhone Comes to Sprint<date>October 4, 2011, 11:54 pm</date><text>Apple’s speedier, fancier version of the iPhone 4, the 4S, will sharpen Apple’s competition with Google, whose Android operating system has been gaining market share. But Tuesday’s announcement will also probably fan the flames of a rivalry that is almost as fierce. Apple announced that in addition to AT&amp;T and Verizon, Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 4S, beginning Oct. 14. For years, AT&amp;T benefited from being the only American carrier with the iPhone. And Verizon saw an increase in sales once it added the device to its portfolio, albeit a minor one. The carriers are counting on the lucrative revenue generated by smartphone owners and the expensive data plans that those devices require to buoy their financial outlook as they move away from their legacy landline businesses. Now that most people in the country own a cellphone, one of the last remaining areas of growth is getting them to upgrade to more sophisticated smartphones. For Sprint, the stakes are even higher. The beleaguered carrier has a lot riding on the success of its ability to sell the iPhone on its network. But does Sprint have a shot at luring customers away from AT&amp;T and Verizon? Sprint may have one advantage — it still offers unlimited data plans for its line of smartphones, something that Verizon and AT&amp;T have already abandoned in favor of tiered data plans. We’ve already seen the carriers taking potshots at one another in advertising campaigns and trying to appeal to consumers by adjusting their pricing structures. AT&amp;T has announced that it will give away the iPhone 3GS free for new contract subscribers on its network — something Verizon and Sprint cannot offer, as there is no compatible version of that phone model for their respective networks. “The elbows are getting sharper,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Now that they have most of the same portfolio, we’re going to start to see the carriers hone in on their own offerings as a way to pitch themselves.” Verizon will probably promote the quality of its network, he said, while AT&amp;T will boast about its download speeds and having the broadest portfolio of iPhones, with the iPhone 3GS, 4 and 4S. Sprint’s ace will be its unlimited data plans. Expect the battleground to get bloodier in the coming weeks as the iPhone 4S goes on sale.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/att-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuits-by-sprint-and-cell-south/?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Moves to Dismiss Lawsuits by Sprint and Cell South<date>September 30, 2011, 3:57 pm</date><text>The legal fusillades have continued in the battle over AT&amp;T‘s proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA, as the company sought on Friday to take shots at competitors seeking to stop the takeover. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg NewsHu Meena, chief of Cellular South, testified at a Congressional hearing in May against AT&amp;T’s merger with T-Mobile. AT&amp;T moved to dismiss antitrust lawsuits by Sprint Nextel and Cellular South, arguing that both companies were looking to block the deal for self-interested reasons, not because the combination of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would be bad for competition. (Here is AT&amp;T’s Sprint response, and here is its Cellular South response.) The lawsuits by Sprint and Cellular South were filed in the wake of the Justice Department’s lawsuit seeking to halt the deal. That case, which has been joined by seven state attorneys general, is the biggest legal battle that AT&amp;T faces.

In the message, sent to AT&amp;T’s wireless chief, Ralph De La Vega, Mr. Meena suggested an expansive roaming agreement in which Cellular South would build out its next-generation LTE network anywhere in the South, especially in all of Mississippi. AT&amp;T would then strike roaming agreements with Cellular South for use of that network, as well as allow the company access to data and voice roaming services elsewhere. “The Sprint and Cellular South complaints should be dismissed as both are an obvious attempt to use the court to improve their own strategic interests,” Wayne Watts, AT&amp;T’s general counsel, said in a statement. Of the Cellular South proposal, he added: “Such an extraordinary and inappropriate proposal simply confirms that what Cellular South fears is competition, not an alleged lack of competition.” In a statement, Vonya B. McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president of government affairs, said, “AT&amp;T’s motion is without merit, and Sprint will respond to it next Friday and continue to cooperate with Judge Huvelle as she seeks to efficiently try both this case and the Justice Department’s case against AT&amp;T.” In the meantime, AT&amp;T is reaching out to competitors like Sprint and Cellular South to reach accords on asset sales and roaming agreements. The hope is to settle the Justice Department’s lawsuit seeking to block the T-Mobile deal.

Its nuanced etiquette is known to generations of New Yorkers: head down, body clenched, contact of eyes or limbs a no-no.But things are about to get interesting this week. Four underground stations in Manhattan will come alive on Tuesday with an amenity that has long eluded the city’s subterranean realm: cellphone service, loud and mostly clear. In a landmark trial, New York City Transit will unveil a fiber-optic network that could be expanded to every underground platform by 2016. The test amounts to a vast social experiment for millions of New Yorkers accustomed to the subway as a forced respite from the frenzy of modern life. The contemplative commute could yield to the on-the-go office. Books may be discarded for text messages and e-mails. And a convenient excuse to ignore a call may be rendered moot. Most of all, the trial could lay bare the deep ambivalence of iPhone-addicted urbanites who lament their digital tethers, and yet guzzle so much smartphone data that the city’s cell networks often slow to a crawl. For Johnny Rocco, a shoe designer commuting on the Q train last week, the idea of cellphones in the subways seemed a recipe for chaos. “Everyone will be on their phones on the platform,” he said sadly, as he watched a middling guitarist in his subway car serenade riders for money. “It’s aggravating enough having to listen to that.” But asked if he might take advantage of the new service, Mr. Rocco smiled and shrugged. In reality, he said, he plans to be one of the worst offenders. “You can’t not look into your phone,” he said. There are caveats — this is, after all, an effort to bring 1990s-era technology to a transit system that has long been a citadel against the advances of the modern world. The phones are expected to work only on platforms, not in tunnels between stops, and only AT&amp;T and T-Mobile subscribers will benefit. (Verizon has yet to agree to the trial.) Seasoned subway-goers already know to plan their trips around those brief, revelatory moments when a sliver of reception falls upon the track. Last week, as a packed Q train emerged from a Brooklyn tunnel and began its ascent over the Manhattan Bridge, a quiet frenzy began as phones emerged from pockets and purses, and fingers flew across miniature keyboards. “It’s a reflex,” said Daniel Vespa, 44, who said he rides the Q specifically for its brief moment of aboveground connectivity. “As soon as daylight comes through the windows, my arm will go in my pocket, my phone will come out, and I check my e-mail without even thinking about it.” The pilot program will introduce cellphone reception to the C-E platforms at 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue and three other stations along West 14th Street: the A, C, E and L platforms at Eighth Avenue; the F, M and L platforms at Avenue of the Americas; and the Seventh Avenue station that serves the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 lines. Cellphones, of course, have become integral to city life, be it checking directions or reporting a crime, and their appearance underground will put an end to those tense minutes when friends or children are out of reach. “If anything, people may be letting trains go past because they have to stay online for a couple more minutes to get something done,” said Anthony Townsend, a researcher in New York for the Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley think tank. “I think we’ll see some odd and unusual behaviors like that.” Gene Russianoff, head of the Straphangers’ Campaign, praised the cellphone plan as a way to integrate the subway “into the daily realities of people’s lives.” But he admitted that he would miss that immutable excuse to avoid e-mails or duck an unwanted call. “You can build airplanes, but you lose the wonder of the sky,” he said, evoking a speech from “Inherit the Wind,” another saga of society’s struggles with change. “The fact that your boss can get a hold of you even more often than he or she normally does is probably not a welcome thing.” Other cities have enjoyed underground reception for years, and chattiness can be an issue. Riders in Tokyo were asked to refrain from taking calls at peak hours. In Boston, officials posted signs encouraging riders to speak at a reasonable volume. A recent expansion of cell service on the Washington Metro led to a spate of snatch-and-grab smartphone thefts. If New York’s subway-goers get too loud, Edward I. Koch, the former mayor, suggested a simple reprimand: “Please, not so loud.” And Mr. Russianoff noted that nearly 200 stations are above ground. “I’ve been dealing with cellphones on the F train for a decade,” he said. “I don’t know how much it changes the balance of how people behave.” The Metro-North Railroad, notorious for its chatty passengers, plans to introduce cellphone-free quiet cars on some routes next month. So should we look forward to sitting in a quiet car on the A train anytime soon? A subway spokesman was blunt: “The answer is no.” Rebecca White contributed reporting.

The antitrust laws are intended to protect consumers, like wireless customers, by promoting competition. You could be forgiven for forgetting there are antitrust laws, given how feeble enforcement efforts have been over the last decade. Even Adam Smith railed against the pernicious effects of monopolies, but in recent years free market fervor and the writings of influential academics like Robert Bork have led many to wonder if the antitrust laws were just a quaint relic of a bygone era. That, or something like it, may have been the thinking of the lawyers for AT&amp;T who negotiated the terms of the T-Mobile deal. It’s hard to blame them: of the five major telecom mergers in the last decade, not one was challenged on antitrust grounds. AT&amp;T agreed to give T-Mobile a huge breakup fee of $3 billion in cash plus wireless spectrum and a roaming agreement valued at another $3 billion should the deal fall through on antitrust or other grounds. Such confidence on AT&amp;T’s part seems inexplicable otherwise. For if ever there was a merger likely to be blocked on antitrust grounds, this is it. “It’s only a slight overstatement to say that if they weren’t going to block this one, the Justice Department might as well just throw the antitrust guidelines out the window,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, professor of law at the University of Iowa, who is considered by many to be the dean of American antitrust law. “This merger clearly seems to violate them.” The antitrust division has long published explicit guidelines that tell companies which mergers it is likely to block as anticompetitive. The analysis begins with a mathematical formula for calculating the deal’s effect on competition. It’s called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or HHI, a phrase you may want to drop at your next dinner party if you want to bring conversation to a halt. Although the formula looks slightly complicated, it’s derived from the common-sense principle that the more competitors in a market, the lower the prices and the greater the innovation. In short, more competitors means more competition, which benefits consumers. The Justice Department has officially used HHI since 1982, and the guidelines were revised by the Obama administration in 2010. Mr. Hovenkamp notes that despite tougher antitrust rhetoric from President Obama, the revision actually made it easier for proposed mergers to pass muster. Without getting too deeply into the math, industries can be scored on a scale up to 10,000, with 10,000 being a perfect monopoly. During the Bush administration, an HHI score of 1,800 or higher was deemed a concentrated industry, and a merger that increased the score by more than 100 points in such an industry was presumed to raise anticompetitive concerns. The new guidelines raised those numbers to 2,500 and 200. “It was becoming legendary that the Bush administration wasn’t enforcing the old guidelines,” Mr. Hovenkamp said. “What good is a guideline that doesn’t provide any guidance? The Obama administration conceded that perhaps the old guidelines were too strict. So it made it easier, but at the same time said, ‘We’re going to enforce this.’ ” How does the proposed AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger fare under the revised guidelines? Let’s go to Exhibit B of the government’s complaint, in which the Justice Department does the math. AT&amp;T has argued strenuously that the case should be considered market-by-market, and not for the nation as a whole, where there are only four national wireless providers. So let’s look at some local markets. 1 2 Next Page »Have you looked at your cellphone bill lately?</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/att-responds-to-justice-dept-s-lawsuit-over-t-mobile-deal/?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Counters U.S. Objections Over T-Mobile Deal<date>September 9, 2011, 4:37 pm</date><text>Stephen Yang/Bloomberg NewsAn AT&amp;T store in Manhattan. 7:21 p.m. | Updated AT&amp;T on Friday filed its response to the Obama administration’s lawsuit seeking to block the telecommunications giant’s $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA. In its response, filed in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, AT&amp;T denied most of the Justice Department’s allegations, chiefly that the proposed merger would severely clamp down on cellphone service competition and harm consumers. As expected, AT&amp;T argued that combining with T-Mobile would give it the spectrum it needs to expand its next-generation wireless network. It also contended that the Justice Department overlooked other sources of competition in the cellphone service industry, including regional companies like U.S. Cellular and smaller national players like MetroPCS. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink AT&amp;T also said that T-Mobile was a fading competitor that was losing subscribers, and that its corporate parent, Deutsche Telekom, was unwilling to continue investing in the United States. “Not only will plaintiff not be able to carry its burden of proof, but the relief it seeks is itself anticompetitive, as it will severely set back growth and competition in the wireless industry,” lawyers for AT&amp;T wrote in the lawsuit. Separately on Friday, three Republican legislators asked the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission to furnish more information about their criteria for evaluating the T-Mobile deal. The three legislators — Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, Greg Walden of Oregon and Joe Barton of Texas — said that they were concerned about the impact that rejecting the deal would have on job creation in the country. All three are tied to the House Energy and Commerce committee, with Mr. Upton serving as chairman. “It is clear that this is a complex transaction and it is important that government officials reserve judgment until all of the facts have come to light,” they wrote in a letter to the Justice Department and the F.C.C.

It is also the biggest move by Mr. Obermann in his almost five years as Deutsche Telekom’s chief. “I’m sure they’ll be proactively entering into discussions with regulators on a region-by-region basis,” said Mark James, an analyst for Liberum Capital in London. “If you’re a Deutsche Telekom investor, you’re going in the face of regulatory uncertainty.” Deutsche Telekom will continue to record T-Mobile USA, which accounted for 24 percent of net revenue in the second quarter, as a “discontinued” operation in its financial reports, Mr. Kornstaedt said. Its net income dropped 55 percent in the first six months of 2011 as its base of subscribers declined by 663,000, or 2.5 percent. The purchase of T-Mobile USA would combine the second- and fourth-largest carriers in the United States, dethroning Verizon Wireless as the market leader. The combined company would dwarf the No. 3 carrier, Sprint Nextel, which has argued against the deal. Shares of Deutsche Telekom fell 4.6 percent, to close at 8.33 euros ($11.74) in Frankfurt on Monday. The shares have declined 13 percent since the Justice Department filed its lawsuit. Shares of AT&amp;T slipped 0.8 percent, to close at $28.05 on Friday.

Hesse, chief of Sprint Nextel, at a Senate hearing in May on the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T. 7:02 p.m. | Updated Only days after the Justice Department sued to block AT&amp;T’s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA, Sprint Nextel is following suit. The company said on Tuesday that it filed its own lawsuit in the United States District Court in Washington, echoing the Justice Department’s argument that allowing the deal to go through would significantly restrict the American cellphone service landscape. “AT&amp;T’s proposed takeover of T-Mobile is brazenly anticompetitive,” Sprint wrote in its complaint, adding that it would push the market “back toward a 1980s-style cellphone duopoly that would force consumers to endure higher prices and be denied the fruits of vigorous innovation.” It is the first of a potential string of lawsuits aimed at stopping the blockbuster telecommunications merger, though it would most likely be subordinate to the Obama administration’s case. AT&amp;T has said that it plans to fight the Justice Department, though it also plans to continue talks with the government in hopes of securing a settlement. And T-Mobile’s current owner, Deutsche Telekom, has also said it would take steps to ensure the merger goes through. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Sprint’s lawyers in the litigation are from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. They will be going up against Arnold &amp; Porter for AT&amp;T and Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton for T-Mobile. Sprint was one of the first and biggest opponents of the T-Mobile deal, having failed to buy the wireless carrier itself earlier this year. Its main argument is that putting the two companies together would cement AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless as the giants of cellphone service, leaving others even further behind and less equipped to compete. Sprint’s chief executive, Daniel Hesse, has been exceptionally vocal in listing reasons to oppose the deal. Should the merger go through, he said in a speech this year, “competition will be stifled, growth will be stifled, and wireless innovation will be jeopardized.” The company has also sought to combat many of AT&amp;T’s claims about the merger, including its job impact. After AT&amp;T announced that it would repatriate 5,000 call-center jobs and preserve some 25,000 existing positions if the deal goes through, Sprint commissioned its own study to rebut those assertions. Even without the deal, however, Sprint is facing its own challenges, including revamping its 4G wireless network. (A bit of trivia: Sprint’s lawsuit has been assigned to Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, the same judge overseeing the Justice Department’s action.)

But as it strives to salvage its acquisition of T-Mobile USA, AT&amp;T should not lose sight of the politics. In addition to fighting the Justice Department lawsuit that seeks to block the deal, the company must continue its public relations efforts. Regulators need to be convinced that the public will benefit. Consumer advocates may scoff, but if AT&amp;T plays its cards right, it stands a good a chance of completing the $39 billion deal. While many commentators have viewed the government’s suit as the endgame, it is really the beginning. AT&amp;T is likely to adopt a two-pronged strategy, employing an army of lawyers to fight the matter in court while redoubling its political efforts aimed at bringing the government to the negotiating table in search of a settlement. AT&amp;T — whether in court or settlement talks — must show it is not creating an anticompetitive market. And, as in most antitrust disputes, the first issue is to define the actual market. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, failed to halt the merger of Whole Foods and Wild Oats because a lower court did not believe that premium food stores constituted a market distinct from the universe of grocery stores. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Sprint Sues to Block AT&amp;T’s T-Mobile Deal The national market for wireless services is dominated by four companies, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile, and if it completes its takeover, AT&amp;T and Verizon would control about 80 percent of that market. AT&amp;T has tried to reframe the debate, arguing that 90 percent of Americans have a choice of five or more carriers in their local markets. The biggest of these local carriers, Leap Wireless and MetroPCS, focus on prepaid cellular users. Yet even viewed from a local market perspective, the national service providers dominate, and that would not change after a T-Mobile takeover. And local companies, which must still provide access to national wireless networks, complain bitterly about the fees the main carriers charge for that access. As a result, AT&amp;T, which contends the acquisition would help it accommodate the huge demand for bandwidth created by smartphones, must show that any downside of higher concentration in local markets would be outweighed by the benefits of a deal. The company can also argue that T-Mobile, whose growth has stagnated, is a weak player nationally, and that Deutsche Telekom, its owner, has increasingly been unwilling to make additional investments. The combined company would therefore be in a better position to compete with the two remaining national players, Verizon and Sprint. This argument can work. Boeing used it to obtain regulatory clearance to buy McDonnell Douglas. The resulting duopoly of Airbus and Boeing remains hypercompetitive. But AT&amp;T will have a harder time making this argument because T-Mobile is not clearly failing as McDonnell Douglas was. Still, the Justice Department has given AT&amp;T an advantage by bringing its suit so early. Under its agreement with T-Mobile, AT&amp;T has until Sept. 20, 2012, to obtain antitrust approval and any other regulatory clearances. This should give AT&amp;T ample time. And courts have a history of rejecting government efforts to block transactions on antitrust grounds. One prominent failure involved Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2004. In that case, the court found that simply because the market was shrinking to two competitors from three did not mean it was less competitive. AT&amp;T might also expect to benefit from the fact that only a few years ago, the Federal Communications Commission took a local view of the wireless market in approving AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Centennial Wireless. But in reality, AT&amp;T is likely to have a tough time persuading the court to view the wireless market as a local one, and even if it succeeds, the combination would appear to create undue concentration in some locales. AT&amp;T was aware of this when it negotiated the deal, the terms of which require it to accept up to $8 billion in concessions — including the divestment of precious wireless spectrum — to win antitrust approval. And if these concessions prove insufficient and the deal fails, AT&amp;T must pay Deutsche Telecom a breakup fee of roughly $6 billion — $3 billion in cash and the rest in the transfer of wireless spectrum. These terms provide a powerful incentive for AT&amp;T to bargain in earnest with the government. And AT&amp;T has projected cost savings of $29 billion from a combination with T-Mobile, creating even more room for negotiation. The question now is whether AT&amp;T can bring the Justice Department to the negotiating table. At a news conference last week, Sharis A. Pozen, the acting assistant attorney general, indicated that the department had been amenable to an AT&amp;T offer to settle the matter. In its lawsuit, the Justice Department cited technological innovations T-Mobile had brought to the cellphone market, including the adoption of handsets based on the Android operating system. While T-Mobile does not really look terribly innovative compared with other carriers, this claim could back the government into a corner. AT&amp;T therefore must play a strong political game, one that is likely to involve a big public relations push to convince regulators that the deal will deliver an enhanced customer experience while improving access to wireless services. And it must demonstrate that Verizon and Sprint will provide enough competition to keep prices in check. With almost a century of experience in dealing with regulators, AT&amp;T’s inability to gain sufficient support on Capitol Hill has been a major disappointment for the company. Expect it to redouble its efforts on the political front, particularly at a time when the Obama administration would like to portray a more business-friendly face. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, has already endorsed the merger. Hints of what a possible settlement might look like can be found in a filing by MetroPCS, the nation’s fifth-largest telecommunications provider. The company opposes the AT&amp;T deal in its current form, but in its filing with the Federal Communications Commission, MetroPCS said that it would support a deal if AT&amp;T agreed to divest wireless spectrum and stopped selling handsets like the iPhone on an exclusive basis. In other words, a major competitor would accept the deal provided it also strengthens smaller competitors. This could come in the form of special deals for local carriers to access AT&amp;T’s national wireless network and sales of spectrum in local markets where AT&amp;T would be particularly dominant. AT&amp;T will also continue to talk about jobs, as it did last week when it said that it would repatriate jobs at call centers if the T-Mobile acquisition were approved. By trying to win support for the merger on several fronts, AT&amp;T can create uncertainty about the Justice Department’s chances of prevailing in court, and uncertainty increases the chances of a settlement. Given what is at stake, do not count AT&amp;T out. Steven M.

Mr. King says that Sprint has arguably already lost to Verizon and AT&amp;T. Sprint itself has acknowledged the difficulties it faces when competing against companies whose scale will allow them to secure better deals on hardware. The company has also argued that the amount of spectrum that a combined AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would control would be anticompetitive. Other analysts are more optimistic about Sprint’s chances, as the company appears to be stemming the loss of subscribers after several years of serious erosion. Even so, its market share of subscribers on contracts dropped to 13 percent in 2010, down from 17 percent in 2008, according to Barclays Capital. The company reported a net loss of $847 million in the second quarter of this year. Sprint, which sells a number of smartphones using the Google Android operating system, is to a large degree pinning its hopes of attracting more customers on the phone that performed that magic for AT&amp;T and Verizon: the Apple iPhone. Analysts widely expect the two companies will reach an agreement. But the most pressing issue facing Sprint, the analysts say, is its need to build a fourth-generation, or 4G, wireless network. It would give Sprint customers a speedy wireless connection most suited to data-hungry smartphones. Because 4G offers service similar to home broadband Internet, wireless companies want to build out 4G networks as the way to provide data service to compete with established providers. And Sprint is falling behind and faces a daunting row of hurdles just to stay in the game. Data service is becoming increasingly important to a wireless industry that is experiencing declining revenue from voice traffic. Data charges will account for more than 41 percent of the revenue from contracted wireless subscribers in 2011, according to James Ratcliffe, an analyst at Barclays. That compares with less than 30 percent in 2009. Almost everyone who wants a cellphone already owns one, so the only way for wireless companies to add voice customers is to poach them from rivals. The number of people demanding data service, on the other hand, is growing as cellphone users embrace smartphones, so wireless companies can earn more from existing customers by persuading them to add larger data plans to their voice plans. Sprint has an advantage in this market because it continues to offer unlimited data plans, while AT&amp;T and Verizon have tiered plans. It could hold that advantage if it aggressively builds out a 4G network that is wider and better than its rival’s 4G networks. But it is not clear that will happen. The company is planning to set out a new strategy for its 4G network next month at its investor conference in New York, and declined to comment before then. All the options the company has at its disposal have flaws, according to experts. Sprint relies on awkward partnerships to secure the amount of spectrum it needs to build a new network. AT&amp;T and Verizon have largely been able to buy outright the spectrum they need. AT&amp;T has cited access to additional spectrum as a major reason it needs to acquire T-Mobile. For Sprint, which lacks the capital of its larger rivals, securing spectrum has been even more difficult. It has set out to patch together what it needs through collaborations. In 2008 it entered a partnership to acquire a large portion of Clearwire, a troubled wireless company that controls a large swath of spectrum. The two companies set out to build a 4G network in tandem, hoping to benefit from a significant head start. This allowed Sprint to market the country’s first 4G network, and it became the first wireless carrier to offer a 4G smartphone, the HTC Evo 4G, in June 2010. But the effort soon slowed, in no small part because of Clearwire’s tenuous financial situation. Verizon has since overtaken Sprint as the nation’s largest 4G provider. Verizon’s network is built on a technology called LTE, which is incompatible with the WiMax technology that Sprint’s network is based on. That presents Sprint with yet another problem because Verizon’s technology is becoming the industry standard. Sprint could soon have trouble persuading hardware manufacturers to build devices for its network. Sprint has said it will shift to LTE. But there will still be eight million to 10 million orphaned Sprint devices running on WiMax by the end of the year, according to Mr. Ratcliffe of Barclays. Sprint will have to support that technology for some time, which adds to its costs. Sprint’s solution is a deal it reached with LightSquared, a company that sells spectrum to niche carriers. LightSquared agreed to pay Sprint $9 billion to build a 4G network using its spectrum. But Sprint hit yet another barrier. Federal regulators are hesitant to allow the companies to use this spectrum because it interferes with GPS frequencies. Between Clearwire and LightSquared, Sprint should have the spectrum it needs to build its network, analysts say, but it is unclear how it will be able to make the investment to take advantage of this. There is speculation that Sprint will have to buy Clearwire outright, or assemble a consortium of other companies to help it do so. Another option would be a collaboration with cable companies that control spectrum and could be willing to work with Sprint. Charles S. Golvin, a telecom analyst at Forrester Research, thinks that Sprint’s best hope, whether or not the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger goes through, is to differentiate itself with unlimited data plans as it builds a reliable network. There is a certain marketing advantage to going against Goliath and saying, “We’re the little guys, we have to try harder,” Mr. Golvin said. “That sort of story could work for them.”If the Justice Department succeeds in blocking the $39 billion merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, the deepest sighs of relief may well come from the executives at Sprint Nextel, the country’s third-largest wireless carrier.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/technology/att-to-woo-and-fight-justice-department-on-antitrust-lawsuit.html?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T to Woo and Fight Justice Department on Antitrust Lawsuit<date>Published: September 2, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — AT&amp;T plans to approach the Justice Department to discuss conditions, including the sale of assets or the transfer of subscribers to other companies, that would allow its merger with T-Mobile to be completed, people close to the transaction said Friday.AT&amp;T has a strong incentive to determine how many conditions the Justice Department might impose on the proposed merger. If the costs of those conditions are “reasonably likely to be more than $7.8 billion,” according to the merger agreement, AT&amp;T can walk away from the transaction without having to pay a breakup fee to T-Mobile of $3 billion in cash plus wireless airwaves worth an estimated additional $3 billion. Those are among the many tea leaves that watchers of the telecommunications industry have been poring over in the two days since the Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to block the proposed merger on antitrust grounds. It will be a delicate balancing act for AT&amp;T to both fight the Justice Department in court, as it has vowed to do, and to try to cozy up to the antitrust officials and regulators by promising to shed assets and to agree to monitoring and regulation that the antitrust division would be likely to require for the merger to proceed. But two people close to the transaction, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, say AT&amp;T has already started traveling down those dual tracks. While no date has been set for a settlement meeting with the Justice Department, those people said, AT&amp;T intends to begin laying out its case later this month. Drafting a deal that will satisfy the Justice Department will not be easy. In the antitrust lawsuit it filed on Wednesday to block the deal, the Justice Department noted that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile competed head-to-head in 97 of the top 100 cellphone markets in the United States. Even if AT&amp;T offered to give up customers in one-third of those markets, it would still be eliminating one of its biggest competitors in a wide swath of the country. “It’s hard to imagine conditions that would accommodate Justice’s concerns that wouldn’t leave the deal unacceptable to AT&amp;T and T-Mobile,” Melissa H. Maxman, co-chairwoman of the antitrust practice group at Cozen O’Connor, a law firm in Washington, said Friday. The surprise lawsuit has also left many on Wall Street wondering what became of AT&amp;T’s vaunted lobbying operation. Already one of the top five corporate spenders in the country over the last five years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, AT&amp;T raised its spending even further in the first half of 2011. According to Senate records cited by Bloomberg news, AT&amp;T spent nearly $12 million on lobbying efforts in the first half of this year, up 30 percent from a year earlier. The Center for Responsive Politics said that AT&amp;T also gave more money to federal candidates this year than any other corporation. But relatively few members of Congress objected loudly when the government announced its lawsuit. Some of AT&amp;T’s harshest critics among consumer advocacy groups, as well as competitors like Sprint Nextel, say that there are essentially no conditions that would satisfy their concerns about the merger and its effect on competition in the wireless industry. “No, there is no way to condition this merger in a way that preserves competition and also provides the supposed benefits that AT&amp;T says the merger will provide,” Gigi B. Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, an advocacy group, said. No matter what conditions the Justice Department might agree to, she said, a merger would eliminate one of only four national wireless companies. And the top two of those — AT&amp;T and Verizon — would together control 80 percent of the market. At least one competitor is not opposed to trying to find a way for the merger to work, however. MetroPCS, which currently ranks a distant fifth among wireless companies, has laid out in filings at the Federal Communications Commission several conditions that it believes could allow smaller wireless companies to compete with a merged T-Mobile and AT&amp;T. Those include the sale of wireless spectrum — the airwaves over which cellphone signals are carried — to one of the smaller, regional carriers; roaming arrangements that allow regional providers to use the network of the combined AT&amp;T and T-Mobile at specified rates; and guarantees that the smaller companies will be able to negotiate fair deals for access to new handset technology with hardware providers. Because of the unusual breakup clause that would allow AT&amp;T to escape the deal, “It’s in AT&amp;T’s interest to negotiate heavily with both the F.C.C. and Justice” over possible conditions or divestitures that might let the merger go through, said Susan Crawford, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. There is little doubt that AT&amp;T was actively engaged in recent days in discussions with the Justice Department before the government filed its case. In the two weeks before the antitrust lawsuit was filed, AT&amp;T met at least three times with Justice Department lawyers, F.C.C. officials and representatives of state attorneys general to review aspects of the mergers, according to documents filed with the F.C.C. In those meetings, “AT&amp;T was just refusing to accept the idea that the government might say no to them,” said one person who attended several of the meetings, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meetings were confidential. But it is also almost certain that the lawsuit came as a surprise to AT&amp;T. Just hours before the Justice Department’s lawsuit was announced on Wednesday morning, the company’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, was interviewed on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” On that program, he said that he still expected the merger to close in the first quarter of next year. “We’re deep into the analysis with the Department of Justice,” Mr. Stephenson said, “and it’s all the data-gathering and analysis you might expect.”WASHINGTON — AT&amp;T plans to approach the Justice Department to discuss conditions, including the sale of assets or the transfer of subscribers to other companies, that would allow its merger with T-Mobile to be completed, people close to the transaction said Friday.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/opinion/protecting-innovation-and-competition.html?ref=atandt">Protecting Innovation and Competition<date>Published: September 1, 2011</date><text>After a decade-long merger spree in which AT&amp;T and Verizon amassed more than 60 percent of the nation’s cellphone subscribers, the Justice Department was right to call a halt to the consolidation process, filing an antitrust suit on Wednesday to block AT&amp;T’s $39 billion attempt to buy the nation’s fourth-largest carrier, T-Mobile. The merger poses a clear anticompetitive threat. Not only would it give AT&amp;T more than 40 percent of the market, it would take out a scrappy and innovative rival that competed profitably by offering cheaper service plans and took risks others would not. For instance, it introduced the first smartphone based on Google’s Android, which today is the leading mobile phone operating system. The Justice Department’s antitrust division rightly concluded that T-Mobile’s cheaper service would be one of the first victims of a merger. And allowing the number of national service providers to shrink to three posed too great a risk to development of wireless computing, slowing innovation on the frontier of information technology. AT&amp;T’s argument that a handful of small local and regional rivals amount to vibrant competition is unpersuasive: the Justice Department found that, after a merger, 96 of the nation’s top 100 markets would be “highly concentrated.” AT&amp;T’s claim that a merger would result in substantial consumer benefits is equally unconvincing. AT&amp;T’s main argument is that buying T-Mobile is essential for it to address a looming spectrum shortage and to quickly expand its 4G network to virtually all of the population. This fit the Obama administration’s desire to expand high-speed broadband access. But there are ways to make more efficient use of available spectrum. Verizon, which has less spectrum than AT&amp;T, is way ahead of AT&amp;T in building out a 4G footprint and has a plan to cover almost the entire population. What’s more, an AT&amp;T filing in the merger process revealed that the company had plans to expand the coverage to 97 percent on its own for $3.8 billion — a tenth of the merger cost. It rejected them on multiple occasions on the grounds that they were too pricey. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, presents a very serious threat to AT&amp;T’s plans. But the merger could survive. AT&amp;T is calling for an expedited trial. And it is likely to try to negotiate a settlement with the Justice Department. Some analysts say the market will consolidate to three national carriers regardless of the outcome. They reason that T-Mobile and Sprint, which is No. 3 in the industry, have been losing subscribers to the two leaders and can’t survive. That’s dubious. Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s owner, didn’t invest in the company because it had priorities in Europe. But there are other deep-pocketed companies with an interest in wireless broadband — from cable to satellite TV firms — that could be drawn to a cellular company with spectrum in major markets and 33 million subscribers. Blocking the merger entails some costs. Buying T-Mobile would allow AT&amp;T to expand more quickly. It would also reduce some costs. But the benefits to subscribers are more doubtful.

Bernstein &amp; Company who tracks T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom, its parent company. “They have to go back into the market in the meantime, and they are going to have to figure out a way to build momentum in their core business.” T-Mobile has long staked its reputation on offering low-cost service plans. But in recent months, the company has lost ground to its larger rivals, AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless and Sprint, which have lured away subscribers with popular devices like the iPhone and the promise of faster networks and services. The company’s position is especially precarious given the evolving state of the wireless industry, which is increasingly focused on customers willing to pay for expensive smartphones and the data plans that go with them. It will be harder for a company that emphasizes lower prices to stay afloat in that market, experts say. T-Mobile’s share of the United States wireless market has slipped to 10 percent from 12 percent in 2008, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. “The biggest problem has been stagnant adds,” he said, meaning new subscribers. Over the last eight quarters, the mobile industry has added a net 33 million customers; T-Mobile has added only 89,000 of those. But T-Mobile may have one ace up its sleeve, said Ms. Bienenstock: a network that is not clogged with millions of data-guzzling users. And although T-Mobile has not yet begun to roll out LTE, the fourth-generation wireless technology that its peers are already using or putting in place, it has invested large sums in upgrading its existing network, which uses a technology called HSPA+ that analysts say rivals the speeds of LTE. The company could try to appeal to people looking for a cheap way to stream movies, songs and other content on their smartphones and tablets — a tactic that could have leverage, considering that AT&amp;T and Verizon both recently put limits on how much data customers could use without paying extra. T-Mobile is more lenient with the limits on most of its plans, slowing the access speeds for its heaviest users instead of charging more. “They have a relatively empty and fast network,” said Ms. Bienenstock. “You can sell cheap data and make it pretty profitable.” But T-Mobile’s biggest challenge may be that it is no longer the only value proposition for mobile subscribers. Consumer Reports found that customers spent $20 to $50 less per month using T-Mobile than with carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon. But plenty of smaller contenders are looking to expand their share of the market, including Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile, Leap and MetroPCS. “For a long time, they were the value brand for young people and teenagers,” said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Ovum, a technology research firm. “It’s getting quite crowded in their core territory. Their only hope may be to reinvent themselves entirely.” T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment. Its parent company issued a statement on Wednesday saying that it would join AT&amp;T in defending the merger plan in court. Complicating matters for T-Mobile is that it has largely remained motionless for several months while waiting for the deal to close. It is likely, analysts say, that T-Mobile froze any negotiations with Apple and other hardware vendors over new phones to avoid competing with AT&amp;T on pricing and release dates. That could hinder the carrier’s ability to dazzle potential subscribers with new smartphones in the coming months — a severe handicap to growth if the company were not going to be folded into AT&amp;T. The plot thickens if Apple announces a deal with Sprint to distribute the iPhone, as is widely expected. That would leave T-Mobile as the nation’s only major carrier without the phone. 1 2 Next Page »When AT&amp;T agreed to buy T-Mobile USA in March, the deal looked like a happy fate for a company that had been losing customers and facing declining sales.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/business/us-moves-to-block-merger-between-att-and-t-mobile.html?ref=atandt">U.S. Moves to Block Merger Between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile<date>Published: August 31, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Wednesday sued to block the proposed $39 billion merger between the cellphone giants AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA, arguing that keeping them separate would preserve competition in the wireless industry and even help save jobs of American workers.In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court here, the Justice Department argued that the proposed deal, which would join the nation’s second- and fourth-largest wireless phone carriers, would result in higher prices and give consumers fewer innovative products. The companies disputed those assertions, and labor unions that support the deal said that the merger would add jobs, not cost them. “The view that this administration has is that through innovation and through competition, we create jobs,” said James M. Cole, the deputy attorney general, at a news conference announcing the lawsuit. Mergers usually reduce jobs through the elimination of redundancies, he said, “so we see this as a move that will help protect jobs in the economy, not a move that is going in any way to reduce them.” The lawsuit, which could take years to wind its way through the courts, sets up a prominent antitrust battle — a rarity since the election of President Obama, who campaigned with promises to revitalize the Justice Department’s policing of mergers and their effects on competition, which he said had declined significantly under the Bush administration. AT&amp;T said it would fight the lawsuit. “We plan to ask for an expedited hearing so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed,” Wayne Watts, an executive vice president and general counsel at AT&amp;T, said in a statement. “The D.O.J. has the burden of proving alleged anticompetitive effects, and we intend to vigorously contest this matter in court.” Deutsche Telekom, the German parent of T-Mobile USA, said that the Justice Department “failed to acknowledge the robust competition in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry and the tremendous efficiencies associated with the proposed transaction, which would lead to significant customer, shareholder and public benefits.” AT&amp;T has been actively involved in discussions with both the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission since the proposal was announced in March. The company has indicated that it would consider divestitures or other business actions to allow the deal to go forward. But Justice Department officials said that those discussions led it to believe that it would be difficult to arrange conditions under which the merger could proceed. “Unless this merger is blocked, competition and innovation will be reduced, and consumers will suffer,” said Sharis A. Pozen, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division. Offering AT&amp;T only a glimmer of hope, she added that the department’s “door is open” to discuss possible remedies. Both the F.C.C. and the Justice Department would need to approve the merger, and though they consider a proposed combination on different scales, they usually reach the same conclusion. The F.C.C., which has never approved a significant merger that the Justice Department is challenging in court, hinted that it was leaning in the same direction of blocking the AT&amp;T deal with T-Mobile. “Competition is an essential component of the F.C.C.’s statutory public interest analysis,” said Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman. “Although our process is not complete, the record before this agency also raises serious concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on competition.” Consumer advocacy groups cheered the administration’s move. “This announcement is something for consumers to celebrate,” said Parul P. Desai, the policy counsel for Consumers Union. “We have consistently warned that eliminating T-Mobile as a low-cost option will raise prices, lower choices and turn the cellular market into a duopoly controlled by AT&amp;T and Verizon.” Harold Feld, legal director of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group, said that “fighting this job-killing merger is the best Labor Day present anyone can give the American people.” Labor groups, however, have generally supported the merger, in part because a substantial number of AT&amp;T employees are members of the Communication Workers of America, while T-Mobile is a largely nonunion company. Mr. Cole said the department thought that an independent T-Mobile would be more likely to expand its business and add jobs, while mergers often eliminate jobs. 1 2 Next Page »WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Wednesday sued to block the proposed $39 billion merger between the cellphone giants AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA, arguing that keeping them separate would preserve competition in the wireless industry and even help save jobs of American workers.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/taking-on-a-veteran-antitrust-judge-in-the-att-fight/?ref=atandt">Taking on a Veteran Antitrust Judge in the AT&amp;T Fight<date>September 1, 2011, 8:58 am</date><text>Charles Dharapak/Associated PressJudge Ellen Segal Huvelle 8:21 p.m. | Updated As AT&amp;T prepares to defend its $39 billion deal for T-Mobile USA against a lawsuit by the Obama administration, the two sides will face a judge who has refereed many big antitrust fights. Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, in her 12 years on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, has overseen numerous antitrust cases brought by regulators, including one in which she ruled against the government. She has also presided over prominent matters like the trial of the disgraced former lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s settlement talks with Citigroup over subprime mortgages. The Justice Department’s lawsuit against AT&amp;T is one of her biggest cases to date. It is the Obama administration’s most significant effort to halt a landscape-altering transaction, one that would combine two of the nation’s biggest cellphone service providers. And the tenor of both the Justice Department’s complaint and AT&amp;T’s response suggests that a contentious brawl may be in the works, even as both sides leave open some possibility of a settlement. In a case this complex, with reams of market and technological data to consider, a jurist with experience presiding over antitrust matters may prove a boon for both parties Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links U.S. Moves to Block AT&amp;T Deal The Antitrust Battle Ahead How AT&amp;T Got to a Standoff Born in Boston in 1948, Judge Huvelle graduated from Wellesley in 1970 and Boston College Law School in 1975, and served as a clerk for the chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. (Unusually for a federal judge, she also earned a master’s degree in city planning from the Yale School of Architecture in 1972.) She then moved over to the law firm Williams &amp; Connolly, where from 1976 to 1990 she represented clients like the flamboyant boxing promoter Don King. In 1990, she was appointed a District of Columbia Superior Court judge. Nine years later, the Clinton administration nominated her to the District of Columbia federal bench. That seat has put Judge Huvelle in line to hear several major antitrust cases — at least 12 since 2004, according to Justia.com, a legal information site. Among antitrust experts, she is perhaps best known for presiding in 2001 over the Justice Department’s suit to block the $825 million SunGard Data Systems bid for Comdisco’s data recovery business. The government argued that the deal would combine two of the nation’s three biggest providers of data recovery services, creating an unacceptable level of market concentration. But lawyers for SunGard and Comdisco countered that customers had alternatives, including offsite data storage solutions, to which they had actually lost more customers than to competitors. Judge Huvelle ultimately ruled for SunGard, writing that the United States could not prove “the proposed transaction is reasonably likely to substantially lessen competition.” It was the Justice Department’s first significant antitrust loss in years. Judge Huvelle later heard a 2007 case brought by the Justice Department over AT&amp;T’s $2.8 billion purchase of Dobson Communications. To secure approval of the deal, the company agreed to sell off assets in seven markets. She also presided over the Justice Department’s lawsuit seeking to block the UnitedHealth Group’s $2.4 billion takeover of Sierra Health Services in 2008. In that case, the government argued that combining the two would give UnitedHealth 94 percent of the Medicare Advantage market in Las Vegas, a segment with $840 million in annual fees. UnitedHealth settled the case by agreeing to sell its Medicare Advantage business. AT&amp;T, which said it was caught off guard by the government’s move, may follow SunGard’s example and argue that its competitors include more than the big four national cellphone service providers. Newer companies like LightSquared could emerge as upstart national rivals, while virtual network operators like Virgin Mobile could expand in the low-price end of the market. “From AT&amp;T’s standpoint, SunGard showed that she is not just going to rubber-stamp what the government is going to do,” said David F. Smutny, a partner at Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe. Judge Huvelle also overruled government lawyers in the S.E.C.’s initial proposed settlement with Citigroup over the bank’s subprime disclosures, asking curtly, “I look at this and say, ‘Why would I find this fair and reasonable?’ ” But many experts say that the Justice Department has a strong argument in this case. Should the T-Mobile deal go through, the nation would labor under a de facto mobile duopoly of AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, according to the government’s complaint. “Justice has done a thorough job,” said Susan Crawford, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. “AT&amp;T’s surprise shows they took this as political matter and not a legal matter.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/justice-dept-s-key-officials-in-pursuing-att-suit/?ref=atandt">Justice Dept.'s Top Officials in Pursuing the AT&amp;T Lawsuit<date>September 1, 2011, 9:06 pm</date><text>Carolyn Kaster/Associated PressChristine A. Varney, above, and James M. Cole presided over the government’s decision to block the planned merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The names of 25 government lawyers are listed on the last page of the Justice Department’s lawsuit seeking to block the proposed $39 billion merger between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA. But two senior lawyers who played crucial roles in bringing the lawsuit are nowhere to be found on the complaint. Christine A. Varney, the government’s former top antitrust lawyer, oversaw the investigation into the planned merger until July, when she said she was leaving the Justice Department to join the law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. When she departed, the investigation was in its final stages, but the government had not yet decided to bring a lawsuit. And James M. Cole, the No. 2 official in the Justice Department, made the ultimate decision to bring what is the Obama administration’s most significant antitrust enforcement action to date. He announced the lawsuit at a news conference Wednesday, one of his more prominent public appearances since he assumed the post in January. “The leadership transition has been seamless, and the right decision was reached in this case,” Mr. Cole said before he introduced Sharis A. Pozen, the acting head of the antitrust unit. “We are seeking to block this deal in order to maintain a vibrant and competitive marketplace.” When Ms. Varney announced her departure, some lawmakers and consumer advocates had expressed disappointment that the Obama administration had not been tougher in antitrust. Instead of bringing legal actions, the division approved a number of large mergers, including Comcast and NBC Universal, as long as the companies made certain concessions. And the Federal Trade Commission, which also has antitrust oversight, stole some of the Justice Department’s thunder in starting an investigation into whether Google had engaged in anticompetitive practices. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The legal action against AT&amp;T appeared to ease the concerns of antitrust enforcement advocates. Ms. Varney had been skeptical of the T-Mobile acquisition since it was announced in March, said two people familiar with her thinking who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case. “Christine Varney set the table for this decision,” said Bert Foer, the president of the American Antitrust Institute. “We are delighted that the administration is committed to the vigorous use of antitrust even at a time of economic difficulties.” President Obama’s appointment of Ms. Varney in January 2009 was seen as a step toward fulfilling his vow to “reinvigorate antitrust enforcement.” He had also criticized what he said was the Bush administration’s weak record in challenging mergers and failing to bring monopolization cases. Ms. Varney was a Clinton administration antitrust veteran, having served as a former commissioner at the F.T.C. She joined the Obama White House from the Washington law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson, where she focused on antitrust work. One of Ms. Varney’s first moves was to name as her deputy Ms. Pozen, a fellow antitrust lawyer at Hogan &amp; Hartson and former colleague at the F.T.C. When Ms. Varney left the Justice Department, Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, named Ms. Pozen her temporary replacement. Ms. Pozen and another government lawyer, Joseph F. Wayland, led the decision to sue AT&amp;T. Ms. Pozen then took the case up the Justice Department’s chain of command. Mr. Holder had recused himself from the investigation for unspecified reasons, so the final decision fell to Mr. Cole. Mr. Cole, who wears a mustache like his boss, joined the Justice Department last December from the law firm Bryan Cave, where he was a white-collar defense lawyer. Jumping between government service and private practice throughout his career, Mr. Cole, 59, is a longtime friend of Mr. Holder’s. The two worked together in the Justice Department earlier in their careers. His confirmation as deputy attorney general was a bumpy one. It was delayed in the Senate in part because lawmakers expressed concern over his role as the independent monitor for the American International Group in the years leading up to the $182 billion bailout of the insurance giant. Mr. Cole’s work did not involve many of the issues at the center of A.I.G.’s collapse, including credit default swaps. As for Ms. Varney, she has moved to New York, where she starts her job at Cravath on Tuesday. She will advise the law firm’s clients on antitrust issues related to mergers. Under government ethics rules, Ms. Varney is barred for two years from appearing in any matter before the Justice Department. And she is permanently prohibited from working on anything related to the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile deal, though at the moment Cravath is not involved in the case.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/technology/can-t-mobile-carry-on-as-stand-alone-company.html?ref=atandt">Will Consumers Benefit if T-Mobile Stands Alone?<date>Published: August 31, 2011</date><text>The Justice Department, in the suit it filed Wednesday to block AT&amp;T’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, asserted that T-Mobile “places important competitive pressure” on the larger cellular carriers. Keeping T-Mobile away from AT&amp;T, the government contends, will spur innovation and give consumers lower prices and more choice.But a big question, industry analysts say, is whether the mobile industry will be genuinely more competitive and innovative with T-Mobile as a stand-alone company. The two biggest carriers, analysts note, are gaining subscribers, while their smaller national rivals, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, are losing ground. “The gap between the haves — AT&amp;T and Verizon — and the have-nots, which is essentially everybody else, is only getting wider,” said Kevin Smithen, an analyst for Macquarie Securities. Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, agreed, saying: “This market is going to consolidate one way or another.” But in taking action, the Justice Department is making a bet that this is not necessarily the case. And its analysis concluded that the anticompetitive risk of allowing AT&amp;T to reduce the ranks of the four largest carriers — which provide more than 90 percent of mobile wireless service in the country — to three was too great. Wireless looks to be the communications and computing technology of the future, as sales of smartphones and iPads surge and people increasingly use them for sending and receiving messages, reading, and playing games. Competition among mobile carriers, then, is clearly important to both consumers and the economy. But even if the deal goes through, other forces could eventually shake up the tiny club of large wireless companies. There are upstart carriers, led by MetroPCS, which offer discount service and prepaid plans, enjoy strong positions in some local markets and have national ambitions. A specialist company, LightSquared, is selling capacity on its high-speed wireless network at wholesale rates to niche carriers. The Federal Communications Commission has begun prodding broadcasters to free up wireless spectrum, opening up more potential opportunities for newcomers to the market. And powerful companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft, with deep pockets and a stake in mobile computing and communications, could also step in and change the game, analysts note. The mobile market is “a fast-shifting chessboard these days,” said Kevin Werbach, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a former counsel for new technology policy at the F.C.C. “If the AT&amp;T merger with T-Mobile fails,” Mr. Werbach added, “it will shuffle the pieces still more.” Yet the Justice Department was faced with a decision about the near-term impact of a huge merger, rather than one about the possibility of new entrants or new technology stimulating competition years down the road. AT&amp;T had argued that adding T-Mobile would give it the extra network capability it needed to fairly quickly roll out the next generation of high-speed service — so-called 4G — across the nation. The Obama administration has championed the accelerated rollout of faster wireless service as an important foundation for innovation and future growth. But the administration’s antitrust regulators decided there were other ways for AT&amp;T to do that without taking out a competitor. For one, the company could just invest in expanding its own network. Another approach, analysts say, is network-sharing arrangements with T-Mobile and other carriers. That way, rivals avoid the redundant investment of building cell towers side by side. But the companies remain separate and still compete on service in those markets. “Network-sharing arrangements are common in some European markets,” said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Ovum, a technology research firm. “You get some of the same benefits, without running into the kind of antitrust concerns AT&amp;T has with T-Mobile.” T-Mobile USA’s German corporate parent wants to get out of the United States, and concentrate its resources elsewhere. But the unit’s assets — its wireless spectrum and network of cell towers — could be sold off to others who might sustain a fourth national competitor, like cable, satellite or technology companies that want to offer wireless service, according to some analysts. The potential for bigger wireless bills for consumers if T-Mobile was acquired by AT&amp;T, legal experts say, was a crucial part of the Justice Department’s analysis. T-Mobile offers smartphone service with voice and data plans that, in some markets, are cheaper than AT&amp;T by 20 percent or more. Lower prices are the most easily measured consumer benefit of competition, and in merger cases, the government typically looks at the potential for price increases of 5 percent to 10 percent or more as significant. AT&amp;T has some sought-after offerings that T-Mobile does not, like Apple’s iPhone. But, according to the Justice Department, AT&amp;T’s prices would have been higher without the competitive pressure from T-Mobile. AT&amp;T, when advocating for the deal announced in March, repeatedly said that the merger should be judged not by the impact on market share nationally, but by the impact on local markets, where there are often smaller, regional competitors. In its complaint and supporting documents, the Justice Department said it had examined local markets carefully. In more than half of the 100 larger markets, for example, the T-Mobile-AT&amp;T combination would have more than 40 percent market share. In its way, the government complaint tells a story, portraying T-Mobile as a particularly important competitor. With its pricing plans, T-Mobile has led in making smartphone service affordable to a mass market. T-Mobile, the government states, was an early adopter of smartphones that used Google’s Android operating system. “The picture presented is that T-Mobile is not just any competitor, but a ‘maverick,’ in the term of art used in antitrust,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school. “So if it’s acquired, you remove a disruptive, innovative force from the marketplace.”The Justice Department, in the suit it filed Wednesday to block AT&amp;T’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, asserted that T-Mobile “places important competitive pressure” on the larger cellular carriers. Keeping T-Mobile away from AT&amp;T, the government contends, will spur innovation and give consumers lower prices and more choice.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/att-thwarted-despite-lobbying-push/?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Thwarted Despite Lobbying Push<date>September 1, 2011, 10:33 am</date><text>AT&amp;T increased its spending on Washington lobbying by 30 percent, to $11.7 million, in the first six months of the year from the period a year earlier, according to Senate records, Bloomberg News reports.

Now the administration faces its biggest test. On Wednesday, the Justice Department sued to block AT&amp;T’s $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, a merger that would create the nation’s largest mobile carrier. “We believe the combination of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower-quality products for their mobile wireless services,” said James M.

Amid the sluggish deal-making environment, the federal government has not had many opportunities to exert its influence. There have been few blockbuster mergers with the potential to reshape entire industries and affect large swaths of consumers. But the Justice Department has also taken flak for not pushing harder to stop deals and acquiescing to takeovers with only minor compromises from the companies. By filing suit against AT&amp;T, the government is escalating its antitrust agenda, trying it in the court of public and judicial opinion. “This administration has been more aggressive in challenging mergers than the previous one,” said Robert Bell, a partner at the law firm Kaye Scholer. “Still, there have not been as many cases as people maybe had expected, based on what the administration had said in its early days.” While the Justice Department has broad authority over deal-making, the antitrust unit has asserted its power with varying force over the last two decades, oscillating between gentle regulator and tenacious opponent. Under President Clinton and his antitrust chief, Joel Klein, the government scuttled several notable deals, including the proposed marriages of the telecommunication companies WorldCom and Sprint, and the airlines Northwest and Continental. Mr. Klein — who later served as New York City schools chancellor and is now overseeing the News Corporation’s internal investigation of phone hacking — also took on Microsoft. But President George W. Bush’s administration took a more permissive stance, promoting the value of free enterprise. Critics contend that his antitrust authorities rubber-stamped nearly every major telecommunications deal, like the controversial merger of the satellite radio companies Sirius and XM. In 2009, President Obama tapped Christine A. Varney, a former Internet lobbyist and Federal Trade Commission official, to lead the antitrust division, signaling a split from his predecessor. Shortly after her appointment, she told the Center for American Progress that the Bush administration “lost sight of an ultimate goal of antitrust laws — the protection of consumer welfare.” Ms. Varney, who left the government to join the law firm Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore this month, promised to “change course and take a new tack.” Mostly, the Justice Department has worked behind the scenes on antitrust matters. The threat of legal action has been enough in some cases to stymie a transaction. In May, Nasdaq OMX and InterContinental Exchange withdrew their joint $11 billion bid for a rival, NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the Big Board, after government lawyers threatened to sue. The government also negotiated a settlement from Comcast over its proposed merger with NBC Universal, rather than taking the matter to court. To win the government’s blessing, Comcast agreed to give up NBC’s management role in Hulu, the Internet video site, and to other measures promoting competition online. Some consumer groups complained, however, that the Justice Department should have gone farther, forcing Comcast to shed crucial assets. In 2007, during the previous administration, the Justice Department used the same approach with AT&amp;T when the company was maneuvering to acquire Dobson Communications for $2.8 billion. The government negotiated an agreement with the telecom company, extracting concessions before blessing the deal. In rare cases, the Justice Department has taken the riskier step of suing to block a deal, as it did on Wednesday with AT&amp;T. The government also moved in May to stop H&amp;R Block’s planned takeover of 2SS Holdings, the developer of TaxAct tax preparation software. The government said in a statement that the deal “would likely lead to millions of American taxpayers paying higher prices.” The case goes to trial next week. The government doesn’t always win. In 2004, a judge sided with Oracle in its purchase of software company PeopleSoft, after the Justice Department sued to stop the deal. The court said the government didn’t prove the deal would hurt competition. Here is a look at how some proposed mergers played out with the nation’s top antitrust regulator: THREATEN TO SUE Deal: Earlier this year, the Justice Department threatened to block Nasdaq’s $11 billion bid for rival NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the Big Board. Nasdaq teamed up with the Intercontinental Exchange to challenge Deutsche Börse’s proposed takeover of the Big Board. Result: After government lawyers warned of legal action, Nasdaq withdrew its bid in May. Instead, the planned merger between NYSE Euronext and the Deutsche Börse moved forward. SUE BUT SETTLE Deal: Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, announced a nearly $14 billion takeover of NBC Universal in December 2009. Result: A year later, the United States sued Comcast over the deal. In a related filing that day, the government agreed to settle the case after it persuaded Comcast to accept some concessions. The deal was finalized later that month. SUE, SUE, SUE Deal: H&amp;R Block announced in October that it had agreed to buy 2SS Holdings, the developer of TaxAct, for $287.5 million in cash. Result: In May, the government sued to block the bid. The matter is going to trial next week. KEEP QUIET Deal: In late 2009, Exxon Mobil announced a roughly $30 billion all-stock takeover of XTO Energy. Result: Nothing requires the Justice Department to take action on a deal, and many times it does not. In March of 2010, Exxon disclosed that the Justice Department declined to intervene in the matter and that the deal was ready for close.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/reacting-to-justices-suit-against-att-deal/?ref=atandt">Reacting to Justice's Suit Against AT&amp;T<date>August 31, 2011, 2:02 pm</date><text>Stephen Yang/Bloomberg NewsAn AT&amp;T store in Manhattan.

Opponents, including competitors like Sprint Nextel, consumer groups and other politicians, contend that the combination would hurt competition and lead to higher prices and fewer jobs. Now that the Justice Department has sued to block the deal, here’s what some of those parties have to say. (AT&amp;T’s biggest competitor, Verizon Communications, declined to comment.) Supporting the merger Communications Workers of America, the union that represents thousands of AT&amp;T workers: “The decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to seek to block the merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA is simply wrong. “In today’s sinking economy, where millions of Americans are looking for work, the DOJ has filed suit to block a merger that will create as many as 96,000 quality jobs. In the U.S., where too many Americans, especially in rural areas, don’t have access to the tools of Internet technology, the D.O.J. is looking to block a plan to build out high speed wireless access to 97 percent of the country. … “Instead of acting to block this merger, our government should be looking to support companies that create, keep and return good jobs to the United States.” Opposing the merger Sprint Nextel’s Vonya B. McCann, senior vice president of government affairs: “The D.O.J. today delivered a decisive victory for consumers, competition and our country. By filing suit to block AT&amp;T’s proposed takeover of T-Mobile, the D.O.J. has put consumers’ interests first. Sprint applauds the D.O.J. for conducting a careful and thorough review and for reaching a just decision – one which will ensure that consumers continue to reap the benefits of a competitive U.S. wireless industry. Contrary to AT&amp;T’s assertions, today’s action will preserve American jobs, strengthen the American economy, and encourage innovation.” Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin: “We applaud the Justice Department for their action to protect consumers in a powerful and growing industry that reaches virtually every American. Preserving choices means ensuring competition, and competition ultimately benefits consumers.” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota: “I have long believed that this merger would be a terrible deal for consumers, and I’m pleased the Department of Justice has taken the wise step of officially opposing it. I’ve heard from families across Minnesota that cell phone expenses are an ever-rising percentage of their bills each month, and this merger could make wireless bills increase by as much as 25 percent — a burden families certainly don’t need in this tough economy. This merger would also hurt competition and concentrate enormous power in the hands of just two companies-AT&amp;T and Verizon — who would control more than 80 percent of the wireless market. I’m glad the Justice Department recognizes that this merger would hurt consumers and I hope that the court will agree and block it from moving forward.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts: “The Justice Department’s decision to take action to block AT&amp;T’s purchase of T-Mobile is a victory for competition, consumers and choice. We should be protecting American consumers holding their cell phones, not just telecommunications titans holding stock in the companies. “The merger would reduce the number of national wireless companies from four down to three, sending the mobile marketplace into a telecommunications time machine back to 1993. That would be an historic mistake.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/if-deal-is-killed-wall-street-will-lose-out/?ref=atandt">If Deal Is Killed, Wall Street Will Lose Out<date>August 31, 2011, 4:39 pm</date><text>Kacper Pempel/ReutersWorkers redecorate a T-Mobile outlet in Warsaw, Poland.

Cole, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference. AT&amp;T said it would “vigorously contest this matter in court.” The Justice Department’s complaint, which was filed in United States District Court in Washington, said that T-Mobile “places important competitive pressure on its three larger rivals, particularly in terms of pricing, a critically important aspect of competition.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The complaint Reacting to the Justice's Suit Against AT&amp;T Deal Sprint Shares Surge on AT&amp;T Setback The complaint also highlighted T-Mobile’s high speed network and its innovations in technology, noting that it was the first to use Google’s Android operating system and BlackBerry wireless e-mail, among other things. “AT&amp;T’s elimination of T-Mobile as an independent, low-priced rival would remove a significant competitive force from the market,” the complaint said. “Thus, unless this acquisition is enjoined, customers of mobile wireless telecommunications services likely will face higher prices, less product variety and innovation, and poorer quality services due to reduced incentives to invest than would exist absent the merger.” Shares of AT&amp;T ended the day down 3.9 percent. In trading in Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Telekom tumbled nearly 8 percent. &lt;br /&gt; The Justice Department has broad authority to influence proposed deals. In January, the U.S. sued Comcast for its proposed merger with NBC Universal; the case was settled at the same time with Comcast agreeing to some concessions. On rare occasions, the agency takes the more aggressive step of suing to block a deal altogether, as it did with AT&amp;T and earlier this year with H&amp;R Block’s bid for the owner of TaxAct tax-preparation software. Sometimes just the threat of legal action is enough to stymie a deal, as in May when Nasdaq and a partner dropped their rival bid for the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company. In other cases, the Justice Department will remain silent, blessing a deal by default. In a statement, AT&amp;T said: “We are surprised and disappointed by today’s action, particularly since we have met repeatedly with the Department of Justice and there was no indication from the D.O.J. that this action was being contemplated. “We plan to ask for an expedited hearing so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed. The D.O.J. has the burden of proving alleged anticompetitive affects and we intend to vigorously contest this matter in court.” That could mean a potentially lengthy court fight. Companies have triumphed over the Justice Department before, such as a federal judge sided with Oracle in its purchase of PeopleSoft in 2004. Yet there is still the chance that two sides could reach a settlement on the deal. In a news conference on Wednesday, Sharis A. Pozen, the acting assistant attorney general, indicated that a compromise was still a possibility, saying: “We apprised them of our serious concerns. And as any party can do, our door is open. If they want to resolve those concerns, we can certainly do that.” AT&amp;T also expects to enter in discussions about a possible solution, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. Indeed, AT&amp;T has one powerful incentive to try to salvage the deal. Under the terms of the agreement that AT&amp;T signed with Deutsche Telekom, AT&amp;T would pay a breakup fee of $3 billion in cash, as well as a roaming agreement and spectrum rights — an estimated total value of $6 billion — if the acquisition did not go through for regulatory reasons. AT&amp;T already has three high-priced law firms advising on the deal, including Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Arnold &amp; Porter and Crowell &amp; Moring. T-Mobile is receiving legal advice on the merger from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz; Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton; and Wiley Rein. Ever since AT&amp;T announced plans to buy T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion in March, the deal has proved controversial. Lawmakers, consumer advocates and rivals have voiced opposition to the merger, saying it would significantly reduce competition. The deal would have left just three major players: AT&amp;T, Verizon and the significantly smaller Sprint Nextel. The complaint also noted that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile currently compete head to head in 97 of the 100 biggest wireless markets in the country. “Sprint urges the United States government to block this anticompetitive acquisition,” Vonya McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president for government affairs, said back in March. “This transaction will harm consumers and harm competition at a time when this country can least afford it.” Shares of Sprint Nextel ended up nearly 6 percent on the day. Citigroup analysts said Sprint was “a potential beneficiary” of the antitrust action. Still, they said that AT&amp;T’s pursuit of T-Mobile was “a catalyst for eventual wireless consolidation in some form, either through the current proposed transaction or other merger scenarios that would likely form if the pending merger is not completed.” The Justice Department’s complaint noted that while there were smaller telecommunications providers, none of their voice networks “cover even one-third of the U.S. population, and the largest of these smaller carriers has less than one-third the number of wireless connections as T-Mobile.” On Wednesday, AT&amp;T said that “we remain confident that this merger is in the best interest of consumers and our country, and the facts will prevail in court.” The company repeated its arguments that a merger would “help solve our nation’s spectrum exhaust situation and improve wireless service for millions,” would expand 4G mobile broadband and would mean billions in additional investment and tens of thousands of jobs. Deutsche Telekom said it would join with AT&amp;T to defend the deal, saying in a statement that it was “very disappointed” by the Justice Department’s action. U.S. v.

At an industry conference in March, its chief executive, Dan Hesse, criticized the merger, fearing it would hurt consumers. A week later, Sprint formally objected to the deal and called on regulators to block the acquisition. “The wireless industry has sparked unprecedented levels of competition, innovation, job creation and investment for the American economy, all of which could be undone by this transaction,” Sprint said in a statement in late March. Sprint has reason to be concerned about the potential merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. If the deal went through, the merged company would have nearly 130 million subscribers, leaving Spring a distant No. 3 player with about 50 million customers. It has been a tough position for Sprint. Mr. Hesse has made some improvements during his tenure. He has invested in customer service and bolstered the product lineup, including signing an agreement to sell the iPhone 5, the next version of Apple‘s popular smartphone. Such moves have helped keep customers from switching to other carriers. But the company continues to struggle.

The Justice Department’s lawsuit to block AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA took the company by surprise. But depending on whom you ask, it shouldn’t have. Since AT&amp;T announced the blockbuster deal in March, it faced pressure on a variety of fronts, including competitors like Sprint Nextel, consumer groups and lawmakers. Such widespread concern only intensified the likelihood that the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission would take a long hard look at the merger. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links U.S. Sues to Block AT&amp;T Deal For months, AT&amp;T had met regularly with both regulators, furnishing them with details about the proposed deal, from competition assessments to the effect on local markets. Since announcing the merger, the telecommunications giant had signaled that it would be willing to make divestitures — potentially billions of dollars worth — to satisfy regulators. As recently as Tuesday, AT&amp;T insisted in a meeting with Justice officials that it wanted to present remedies, according to people briefed on the matter. The department did not tip its hand that it was preparing to sue, having only run down another list of pluses and minuses of the deal, two of these people said. Charles Dharapak/Associated PressThe Justice Department’s lawsuit will be heard by Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. AT&amp;T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, spoke to this reporter on Tuesday and appeared on CNBC early on Wednesday to promote the company’s new initiative to repatriate 5,000 call-center jobs. He didn’t indicate any hint that the company had hit significant snags in the review process. “The primary remedy for any market concentration issues is going to be divestitures,” he told DealBook on Tuesday. “We will sell customers, networks and spectrum in markets where the D.O.J. believes concentration is too high.” But from the beginning, Justice Department officials expressed concern about the broader impact of removing the fourth-largest cellphone service provider from the national landscape — leaving only three big telecommunications providers. In meetings throughout the review process, antitrust lawyers signaled that they had serious issues about market concentration and taking out a significant competitor, according to another person briefed on the matter. Another of the department’s concerns was that AT&amp;T showed relatively little urgency in proposing satisfactory remedies, this person added. Justice officials were worried that, having outlined a timetable of 12 months to 18 months for regulatory review, AT&amp;T would take its time and hobble a rival in the interim. In short, AT&amp;T didn’t appear to get the hint that the Justice Department wasn’t satisfied with either the speed or the scope of potential remedies, according to this person. And as the matter moved up the hierarchy of department officials, consensus was building that AT&amp;T was increasingly hard pressed to come up with a satisfactory solution. The Justice Department gave AT&amp;T a head’s up on Wednesday morning, shortly before filing the lawsuit, these people said. AT&amp;T has said publicly that it will fight the Justice Department’s lawsuit, asking for an expedited hearing before Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. At the same time, the department’s acting antitrust chief, Sharis A. Pozen, signaled publicly that the Justice Department was open to a settlement. During a news conference on Wednesday, she said of AT&amp;T: “We apprised them of our serious concerns. And as any party can do, our door is open. If they want to resolve those concerns, we can certainly do that.” Privately, the department has also assured AT&amp;T that Ms. Pozen’s comments were accurate and that the regulator would still entertain a potential solution, according to the people briefed on the matter. But one of these people added that the company still had a tough hill to climb. AT&amp;T’s issue is that it has to effectively replace a nationwide competitor, a problem that may not be solved by giving away spectrum and cell towers and adjusting prices on a temporary basis. Indeed, as the Justice Department’s complaint contends, none of the smaller telecommunications providers is large enough to provide meaningful competition to the big four carriers.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/att-plans-to-bring-back-jobs-sent-abroad/?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Plans to Bring Back Jobs Sent Abroad<date>August 30, 2011, 11:45 pm</date><text>Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg NewsRandall Stephenson, AT&amp;T’s chief, at a House hearing in May.

AT&amp;T also plans to commit to maintaining its and T-Mobile’s more than 25,000 call-center jobs in the United States. AT&amp;T’s move — which the company describes as one of the biggest job repatriations since the financial crisis — is meant in part to assuage critical lawmakers’ fears of possible job cuts. In a letter to the two federal regulators reviewing the deal, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, wrote that “it is fair to assume that layoffs constitute a substantial portion” of the deal’s promised cost savings.

The telecommunications giant has said that it plans to create jobs by building out the combined company’s next-generation wireless network, an effort that is expected to cost more than $8 billion, though it is also expected to shutter hundreds of retail stores and other back-office positions. But Mr. Stephenson said that as AT&amp;T was reviewing its and T-Mobile’s businesses, creating jobs in the United States became a way to create good will. The company had about 265,410 employees as of Jan. 31. T-Mobile, now a unit of Deutsche Telekom, employs about 42,000 in the United States. “As I sit here and watch the news over the last month, I can’t help but ask, ‘What else can we do?’ ” he said. “This sends a good message to the U.S. and to the labor markets.” AT&amp;T currently operates about 55 call centers throughout the country, while T-Mobile runs about 24. Mr. Stephenson said that his company had yet to determine where the new call-center jobs would be located. The existing call centers are in many locations around the country, including T-Mobile’s headquarters in Washington and AT&amp;T’s home in Texas, as well as in Pennsylvania and Maine. Mr. Stephenson added that he had become comfortable that AT&amp;T would still meet its projected cost savings despite the move. Jobs are not the only concern on skeptics’ minds about AT&amp;T’s planned mega-deal. Since it was announced in March, the proposed acquisition has taken fire from competitors like Sprint, consumer groups and federal and state lawmakers worried about combining two of the nation’s biggest cellphone service providers. AT&amp;T has its supporters, including telecommunications workers’ unions, technology companies like Microsoft and Facebook and 27 governors. The company has also made a big lobbying effort to drum up additional backing. Both sides have raced to put pressure on the federal regulators scrutinizing the deal, the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department. Several state regulators, including California’s public utilities commission, are also closely examining the merger. Last month, the F.C.C. halted its review of the deal to examine AT&amp;T’s economic models supporting the deal, though it resumed the process last week. The company took additional criticism after a briefly unredacted submission to the F.C.C. showed that AT&amp;T had projected spending just $3.8 billion to expand its nascent 4G wireless network nationwide, far less than the $39 billion it is spending to buy T-Mobile. Mr. Stephenson countered that expanding its network without T-Mobile’s customer base, spectrum and cellular towers had “no business case.” He added that he still expected the deal to receive approval by the end of the first quarter next year. “Nothing has transpired to date that would make me think that will change,” he said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/will-cell-coverage-hold-up-during-hurricane-irene/?ref=atandt">Will Cell Coverage Hold Up During Hurricane Irene?<date>August 26, 2011, 3:33 pm</date><text>Will the cellular networks be able to withstand the onslaught of Hurricane Irene? As the hurricane whirls its way up the East Coast, each of the major wireless carriers in the United States is taking steps to minimize outages and damage to its network. T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint say they are placing backup power generators near cellular towers as well as putting extra generators in safe locations to deploy as needed once the storm passes. In addition, they are trucking additional radio equipment into their denser regions to help boost data networks in case the wire line services go down during the storm. Officials at the carriers are advising customers to fully charge their devices before the storm hits and to rely on text messages to communicate instead of trying to make voice calls. Even so, it is not clear whether those precautions will be enough. Earlier this week, when a 5.8-magnitude earthquake shook the East Coast, many people reported difficulty making calls and delays in sending and receiving text messages. It wasn’t clear whether the gaps in service were because of damage to network infrastructure or from the crush of people simultaneously trying to use their phones. The number of people who would be without cell service is extensive. According to the CTIA, the cell industry’s trade group, roughly 96 percent of Americans own cellphones and nearly a third of American households rely entirely on wireless communications, eschewing landlines altogether. There is a strong possibility that the high winds and rains expected to pummel the East Coast during Hurricane Irene could uproot cellular towers and damage lines. Federal officials say that the storm is likely to cause widespread power loss and flash flooding throughout North Carolina, as well as West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, western New York and the interior of New England. Representatives for the wireless companies say that it is difficult to know exactly how service will be affected until the storm is upon us. “Until the storm makes landfall, it’s hard for us to determine the definite impact,” said Crystal Davis, a spokeswoman for Sprint. “There will be power outages and flooding, and we’ve been preparing our networks, engineers and emergency response team members to handle what we believe will be the most probable scenarios.” Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, echoed her sentiments, saying that the company is doing everything possible to avoid any lingering effects for the company’s customers. “As you can imagine, there is just no good way to predict the impact,” he said. “We’re staging equipment and employees to respond as quickly as we are safely able to after Irene makes landfall.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/f-c-c-restarts-clock-on-review-of-atts-t-mobile-deal/?ref=atandt">F.C.C. Restarts Clock on Review of AT&amp;T's T-Mobile Deal<date>August 26, 2011, 12:11 pm</date><text>Alex Wong/Getty ImagesRandall L. Stephenson, left, chief of AT&amp;T, and René Obermann, chief of Deutsche Telekom, spoke at a House subcommittee in May. The Federal Communications Commission said on Friday that it had restarted its review of AT&amp;T‘s proposed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, after pausing the process to demand more information about the deal. In a letter sent on Friday to an outside AT&amp;T lawyer, Rick Kaplan, the head of the F.C.C.’s wireless division, said the agency had received AT&amp;T’s answers to specific questions about new economic models that the company had submitted for review last month. The F.C.C. had halted its 180-day review of the deal on July 20 after AT&amp;T proposed the new models, which added new arguments about how the economic benefits of the deal outweighed antitrust concerns. Many of the deal’s opponents have pointed to the move as a sign of trouble for AT&amp;T. But a “stopping of the clock” by the F.C.C. is not unusual in a review of a big merger. AT&amp;T has said that it expects the antitrust review process to extend until early next year.

Instead, the company plans to offer new subscribers only one plan: unlimited texting for $20 a month. Those who don’t want to fork over $20 can choose to pay for each text, starting at 20 cents a message. AT&amp;T said the move was an effort to streamline and simplify its offerings, promising that that existing customers would be able to keep their existing plans, even if they switch to a new phone. The shift, which was first reported by Engadget, goes into effect this Sunday. “The vast majority of our messaging customers prefer unlimited plans and with text messaging growth stronger than ever, that number continues to climb among new customers,” said Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&amp;T. Text messaging has long been a lucrative source of revenue for the wireless carriers. But the growing abundance of free messaging applications that offer alternatives to text messages, like GroupMe, Kik, WhatsUp and Pinger, may threaten the growth and use of text messaging. And larger tech companies are introducing their own messaging services. Google Voice already lets people send text messages through the Web, sidestepping SMS fees. Facebook recently unveiled Facebook Messenger, a free application that lets people easily send messages to friends in their network. And later this year, Apple is expected to introduce iMessage, a service that will let iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad owners send messages to one another over their data connections. The wireless carriers are caught in the midst of an industry-wide shift as consumers increasingly spend more time and money using mobile data and applications, rather than voice services, leaving them to figure out how to adjust their business models accordingly. This latest move from AT&amp;T might be a sign that the carriers are getting increasingly anxious about the coming wave of disruption to their industry.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/technology/as-mobile-networks-speed-up-data-gets-capped.html?ref=atandt">As Mobile Networks Speed Up, Data Gets Capped<date>Published: August 14, 2011</date><text>The newest smartphones are intended to run on speedy 4G networks that allow people to effortlessly stream music, watch Netflix movies and tune in live to a Mets game, wherever they are.But there’s a catch, of course. Cellphone plans that let people gobble up data as if they were at an all-you-can eat buffet are disappearing, just as new data-gobbling Internet services from Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Apple and the like are hitting the market or catching on with wide audiences. These services use far more data than simply checking e-mail or browsing the Web, so their heaviest users may find themselves running over their plan’s monthly allotment and paying extra. The wireless carriers say their tighter limits will affect only a small percentage of customers. And they say they are simply trying to get ahead of an exploding appetite for data and avoid problems with overburdened networks. Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, said that if current trends continued, the company’s network would carry more data in the first two months of 2015 than in all of 2010. He described the pricing issue as a “balancing act,” adding: “The tiered data plans will meet the needs of the overwhelming majority of consumers. A lot of people think they’re heavy users, but they’re not.” But analysts say that inevitably more people will find themselves in the “heavy user” category, particularly as more of them trade in their lower-end phones for smartphones and move to 4G networks. For most people who use their phones to check e-mail, surf the Web and watch an occasional video, the move toward tiered pricing will not immediately raise their phone bills. Verizon’s monthly plan offering two gigabytes of data for $30, announced last month, costs the same as its old unlimited plan, for example. But even now it doesn’t take much for a media-hungry smartphone user to chew through two gigabytes; watching Netflix video for more than roughly 20 minutes a day will do the trick. And an extra gigabyte will cost Verizon customers an additional $10. “Over time, as you give people faster devices with faster speeds, it’s going to be a lot easier to hit that two-gig mark,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase who follows the telecommunications industry. In addition to worrying about overtaxing their networks, wireless carriers are looking for new ways to make money from mobile data and applications, rather than voice minutes. Over the last three years, the amount of money consumers spent a month on mobile calling declined to $30 from $40, according to Recon Analytics. During the same period, the average amount spent on data nearly doubled, jumping to $13 from $7. “We’ve fallen in love with data and the utility that we get from it,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon. “The usage pattern has changed dramatically.” AT&amp;T and Verizon have both phased out their unlimited data plans in favor of tiered plans. Verizon offers 75-megabyte plans for basic phones, as well as two-, five- and 10-gigabyte plans for smartphones, topping out at $80 a month. Those in the more expensive plans who go over their limit are charged $10 for another gigabyte, as are AT&amp;T customers who exceed the limit on that company’s two-gigabyte plan, which costs $25. T-Mobile, which AT&amp;T is hoping to acquire, offers tiers from 200 megabytes up to 10 gigabytes. Those on the 200-megabyte plan are charged 10 cents for an extra megabyte. And if those with the upper-tier plans exceed their limits, the company slows their data connections until the next billing period. Sprint is the last carrier to hold onto its unlimited data plan, but analysts and industry experts say it is unlikely to last. All of the carriers let customers track their data use through their Web sites and on their phones, and they send alerts when customers are in danger of going over. Of course, those who want to avoid paying more can simply wait until they are connected to a Wi-Fi network to, say, download high-definition videos, since this will not count against the monthly limit. But that doesn’t help someone who wants to stream movies or music on a long evening commute. Terry Hartup, 34, who works as a technology consultant in Clearwater, Fla., said he was frustrated that his connection might be slowed if T-Mobile decided he was using too much data. “These new services are coming out that let us do more, but the pipe is getting smaller and smaller,” he said. “And costing us more.” 1 2 Next Page »The newest smartphones are intended to run on speedy 4G networks that allow people to effortlessly stream music, watch Netflix movies and tune in live to a Mets game, wherever they are.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/sports/autoracing/23iht-SRPRIX23.html?ref=atandt">A Connection Made for the Fast Lane<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>Most Formula One watchers are aware of the paradigm in which a major car manufacturer uses the sport not only to advertise its road cars with an eye to sales, but also to develop and improve their road car technology.In the same fashion, as Formula One has become increasingly dependent on computers, telecommunications and information technology, telecommunications companies have begun following that example. “Telecommunications and Formula One are made for each other,” said Mike Cansfield, a telecommunications consultant and analyst. “First off, telecoms are a global business, and Formula One is a global business. It is also a very high-performance business. Telecommunications networks are about operating in macro seconds just as a Formula One car’s performance and the superiority of the competition is measured in macro seconds. They are both high-technology sectors and both at the cutting edge of what is possible.” As the series enters the second half of the season, at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring this weekend, it is taking this development to another level, thanks not only to the competitive environment but also to the current economic and financial situation. Companies like AT&amp;T, Vodafone and Telmex are helping teams with their technology needs or acting as sponsors, and General Electric joined with Team Lotus last month as both a sponsor and technology provider. This trend has been driven by the sport’s latest cost-cutting measures, which have led to the equivalent of a mobile office at the tracks, and the introduction of cloud computing. Formula One teams used to send as many employees as they wanted to every race around the world. But regulations now limit the number of technical and other crew that they can bring to the races. AT&amp;T is therefore providing ultra-high-resolution videoconferencing systems, robust Internet-like communications networks and other telecommunications infrastructure so that the teams can leave technicians back at the home base — eight of the teams are in England, two in Italy, one in Germany and one in Switzerland — but still do the job that used to be done at the track. “We are using AT&amp;T products and services throughout our business, to help us save costs, to help us be more efficient, to help us communicate more,” said Alex Burns, chief executive of the AT&amp;T Williams team. “And because we are doing this, we are a great example of their products and services in action.” As with the car manufacturers, some technology companies are both a team sponsor — like General Electric with Team Lotus, AT&amp;T is a title sponsor of the Williams team — and a technical partner from whom the team buys services. For the teams, the close relationship pays off in personalized development of the technology, as they work closely with the company’s technicians. For the telecommunications company, providing a mobile office in the Formula One environment is a considerable challenge, although it is one that helps them prove and develop their systems. “One of the clearest ways is through what we call ‘time to market’ — how long it takes us to provision these network services,” said Andrew Edison, head of AT&amp;T’s business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “A large multinational may be able to tolerate a lead time of 60 or 90 days,” he added. “A Formula One team can’t do that. They were in Valencia, and then two weeks later in Silverstone. So we have had to develop bespoke service delivery processes and capability, which has tested our organization and tested our processes to be able to respond to the demands of a Formula One team. Secondly, we would have never thought about putting one of these high-definition AT&amp;T telepresence video devices mobile before. And we have now done that, so we have learned how to do that and to utilize productivity in a different way in order to enable that to be done.” 1 2 Next Page »Most Formula One watchers are aware of the paradigm in which a major car manufacturer uses the sport not only to advertise its road cars with an eye to sales, but also to develop and improve their road car technology.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/opinion/22fri2.html?ref=atandt">To Cap Broadband, or Not<date>Published: July 21, 2011</date><text>As people do more with their broadband connections — streaming movies, downloading music, moving files to and from the cloud — it might seem natural for Internet service providers to impose data caps on users to manage their networks and deal with congestion. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, set a cap of 250 gigabytes a month in 2008, disconnecting users who exceeded the limit twice in a six-month period. In May, AT&amp;T introduced a limit of 150 gigabytes a month for DSL customers and 250 gigabytes for those on the extra-fast U-verse network it deployed in several cities. It will charge an extra $10 for every 50 gigabytes beyond the cap. This strategy follows closely the path of wireless broadband, where both Verizon and AT&amp;T have replaced unlimited data plans with tiered offerings. But wireline data caps warrant a close look by federal regulators. They are billed as a way to manage traffic, but they could also hamstring the user’s experience, blunt competition online and stymie innovation on the Internet. This problem is of particular concern because there is hardly any competition in high-speed broadband services (speeds above 10 megabits per second). Some users have a choice between a cable company and a phone company. In many areas they have no choice. Caps should not just be a way for Internet providers to extract monopoly rents. Data caps are a blunt way of managing broadband. Moving an extra gigabyte of data at off-peak times costs virtually nothing. Peak demand is the problem. Yet caps make no allowance for this. Moreover, there is no crunch in wireline broadband capacity, as there is in wireless. Internet providers must recoup substantial investments in their networks, but adding capacity is cheaper than putting up a network, and becoming cheaper all the time. Caps can be used anticompetitively — to discourage the use of services that rival an Internet service provider’s in-house offerings. For instance, AT&amp;T points out that Netflix hogs 30 percent of peak-hour Internet traffic in North America. Netflix also competes with television offerings on AT&amp;T’s U-verse network. Watching TV on U-verse does not count against the data cap. Streaming Netflix does. Caps are not universal in wireline broadband. Verizon and Time Warner Cable do not have them yet. (Time Warner Cable tried caps in 2008, but customers rebelled.) Experts expect them to become more popular, and as they do, the Federal Communications Commission should seek to understand how effective they are at relieving congestion and what effect they have on services that rival Internet providers’ in-house offerings, like video. And it should keep an eye on whether caps respond to network efficiency gains and capacity increases.

AT&amp;T, which is seeking approval to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, added 331,000 net subscribers in the quarter, compared with the average expectation for 91,000 from analysts surveyed by Reuters. “The net additions were surprisingly strong,” Michael Nelson, an analyst at Mizuho, said. “It seems like AT&amp;T really successfully defended its turf after losing iPhone exclusivity.” Mr. Nelson said the strong results could be overshadowed by investor concern about growing opposition to AT&amp;T’s plan to buy T-Mobile USA. Senator Herb Kohl, chairman of the Senate’s Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights Subcommittee, urged regulators on Wednesday to block the deal, and other lawmakers also expressed concern. The deal would cost AT&amp;T about $6 billion in breakup fees if it were rejected. AT&amp;T said Thursday that it still expected the deal to close in the first quarter of 2012 and that federal regulators reviewing the transaction were “asking the questions you would expect.” AT&amp;T said profit fell to $3.59 billion, or 60 cents a share, from $4 billion or 67 cents a share a year earlier, and compared with analysts’ estimates of 59 cents a share. Excluding a Telmex Internacional transaction a year earlier, AT&amp;T said, earnings would have been flat. Revenue rose 2.2 percent to $31.5 billion from $30.8 billion. Stock in AT&amp;T, which is based in Dallas, rose 5 cents, to $30.28 a share. Its results came a day before its rival, Verizon Communications, is scheduled to release quarterly results. Verizon operates the market leader Verizon Wireless in partnership with the Vodafone Group. In the first quarter, Verizon Wireless started selling the iPhone, ending more than three years of AT&amp;T’s exclusive rights to sell the device in the United States. While Verizon is expected to add about three times the subscribers of AT&amp;T this quarter, AT&amp;T fared better than had been expected. AT&amp;T said that the iPhone was still its strongest-selling smartphone and that half its customers were using smartphones by the end of the quarter. Seventy percent of its phone sales were for the advanced phones, which command higher service charges.

NURBURGRING, Germany – Friday has been a cool day here in more ways than one.  Mark Webber got the better of Fernando Alonso AND his teammate Sebastian Vettel, setting the fastest time of the day in the second practice session this afternoon. And though the temperature is cool, the rain has held off so far. Both of those facts are no small feats as the German Grand Prix weather report is for rain much of the weekend, and Vettel is at his home race and not likely to be want to be overshadowed by his teammate at Red Bull. Another local favorite, Michael Schumacher, put in a slightly faster time than his teammate at the Mercedes team,  Nico Rosberg, and there is no doubt Schumacher will want to shine on the track with a corner named after him. Of course, it is  only a Friday practice session. As I walked through the vast complex recently built here as an auto racing theme park on Friday, I noticed that among the various team and manufacturer boutiques there was a Michael Schumacher memorabilia boutique. Also remarkable was the massive number of people  here for the Friday practice sessions. Or maybe they were here to wander around the theme park to soak up the atmosphere of the German Grand Prix and buy the merchandise. What a massive business. Speaking of business, Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One promoter, has been in the news because of his involvement in the bribery scandal surrounding the sale of Formula One to the CVC Capital Partners five years ago. Although much is being written about this in the F1 and auto racing media, there will no doubt be little of substance to say until Ecclestone is or is not tried in the case. An article  by a Formula One journalist on the PitPass.com site outlines much of the tale — as does a story by that same journalist (Christian Sylt) in the Daily Telegraph newspaper in England. Joe Saward, a longtime F1 journalist, also has an interesting take on the affair on his blog. While I’m putting up links  as we await Saturday’s qualifying session for Sunday’s race, I should point to my German Grand Prix preview articles, which are now online.

As we have reported over the last year, Amazon has been readying a color screen tablet that will run the Google Android operating system. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, has even acknowledged that a tablet project is in the works, saying earlier this year that the company was actively working on a “multipurpose tablet device.” According to a person who works with Amazon and asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly by the company, Amazon has struggled with a number of issues while building its upcoming tablet. The company’s choice to pick Android in the upcoming tablet, for example, was not an easy one. Internally, executives at Lab 126, the division of Amazon which makes the Kindle e-reader line, debated the pros and cons of an Amazon tablet running Android versus Amazon building its own operating system based on the existing Kindle platform. One of the goals with the Kindle tablet is to enable Amazon to deliver its own rich media services, including its cloud music and streaming video products to Kindle customers. Yet the Android platform already offers the same services through Google and other third party companies. Executives worried that putting Android on an Amazon tablet would be like opening a new music and video store on a city street already packed with dozens of other music and video stores. In the end, Amazon realized that if it created its own operating system for its upcoming tablet, it would need to entice developers to build apps on yet another platform. Developers are eager to build for Apple, as evidenced by the over 100,000 apps that are available  for the iPad, and they build for Android, which has hundreds of thousands of apps available for tablets and mobile phones. Hewlett-Packard, with its webOS, and Research in Motion, also with its own operating system, are having a harder time winning developer’s time and they have far fewer apps. If the Kindle wants to compete with Apple and its highly popular iPad, Amazon realized that it needed to offer services and products beyond just video, music and books. It also has to give customers access to games, social applications and other third party products. Amazon also ran into trouble with the touchscreen technology it planned to use in the upcoming tablet. Last year, the company purchased Touchco, a multitouch project that grew out of the Media Research Lab at New York University. Touchco uses a technology called interpolating force-sensitive resistance, which is extremely inexpensive, costing as little as $10 a square foot. But engineers have had trouble integrating the technology into the Kindle e-readers because it can reduce the intensity and crispness of the screen. Amazon has also been working hard to offer a device that is competitively priced compared to other tablets. The person who works the company said Amazon planned to offer its Kindle tablet at a lower price than the Apple iPad, which costs from $500 to $830 depending on memory size and 3G abilities. To do this, Amazon is building its tablet with the bare necessities inside. Limiting memory capacity, peripherals and choosing to skip a built-in camera in the device, the person said. According to an Amazon executive with close ties to Mr. Bezos, who could not be named because of his senior role in the company, Mr. Bezos made a decision after the iPad was introduced to try to lure customers onto the Kindle platform by offering less expensive devices. This can be seen with the company’s price reduction of the Kindle e-reader over the last year. The third-generation Kindle now starts at $140, compared to the original, which sold for $400. Amazon also hopes to entice customers to its new tablet by offering competitive wireless 3G pricing. Although Apple originally offered unlimited access to AT&amp;T’s wireless 3G on the iPad, the company discontinued this pricing option months after the iPad was introduced. Apple customers have complained that the current 3G pricing options for the iPad were too expensive.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/opinion/09sat2.html?ref=atandt">How to Promote a Merger<date>Published: July 8, 2011</date><text>It seems surprising that organizations dedicated to advocating for gays and lesbians, African-Americans or teachers could take such a burning interest in telecoms that they would endorse AT&amp;T’s $39 billion plan to buy T-Mobile, which is under review by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department. Yet since it announced the deal in March, AT&amp;T’s proposed megamerger has garnered the support of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the National Education Association, among others. It’s hard to tell how much consideration they gave to the impact the merger would have on wireless communications, eliminating the No. 4 player in the market and shackling the cellphone network to a de facto duopoly that would have enormous power. The N.A.A.C.P. highlighted that AT&amp;T hired members of minorities, contributed to minority groups and bought from minority businesses.  Glaad said AT&amp;T had a good track record on issues that matter to gays and lesbians. All three noted that AT&amp;T was a union shop and T-Mobile was not. These are all positive things, for sure, but what have they to do with the cellphone market? What makes this picture murkier is the money involved. The N.A.A.C.P. got at least $1 million from AT&amp;T in 2009. The N.E.A.’s foundation got $75,000 from AT&amp;T’s foundation last year, according to Politico.com. The Columbia Urban League in South Carolina, which supported the merger, got a $25,000 grant from the foundation. The groups said their enthusiasm for the merger was not driven by AT&amp;T’s money. AT&amp;T said, too, there was no quid pro quo. But AT&amp;T can certainly use support from left-leaning groups to influence Democrats holding the regulatory levers. And the money is causing discomfort within some of the organizations. The president of Glaad, Jarrett Barrios, resigned last month as controversy grew over the organization’s support of the merger after it received $50,000 from AT&amp;T. Mr. Barrios also disavowed a letter sent from his office to the F.C.C. last year supporting AT&amp;T’s opposition to the agency’s proposed net neutrality rules, which would bar telecom companies like AT&amp;T from blocking or discriminating against rivals’ data flowing through their wires. AT&amp;T, by the way, also is the third-biggest donor to federal elections since 1989 — donating more than $41 million. In the 2010 elections, AT&amp;T and its executives made donations of $10,000 and more to 100 candidates for Congress. It spent more than $15 million in lobbying in 2010.

You could see it as a simple supply-and-demand issue. The use of data by smartphone users has grown 89 percent, from 230 megabytes (MB) in the first quarter of 2010 to 435 MB in the first quarter of 2011, according to a Nielsen study. Data capacity — the supply — is not growing at that rate. And growth costs money. Tiers put the onus on consumers to either use less data or pay more for the data they use (or both). A study by Validas, a company that analyses its customers’ bills to match them with an efficient phone plan, said that the upcharge on Verizon smartphone users was steep. Under the current plan, Verizon’s unlimited data plan is $30. Under the new tiered service, the lowest priced plan, 2GB per month, will be $30. Other tiers will be 5GB for $50 and 10GB for $80. Overage is $10 per 1 GB. Validas said it studied 11,000 Verizon Wireless bills that had been submitted for analysis and found that 96 percent of Verizon smartphone users consumed less than the 2GB of the minimum tier each month. In fact, 36 percent used less than 75MB of data. And less than 1 percent of the Verizon Wireless users consumed more than 5GB of data. That means that most consumers won’t have to spend any more than they did for the unlimited plan. But that might be cold comfort to people who buy the unlimited plan as a kind of insurance policy — they overpay so they never have worry about going over, even if in actuality they use nowhere near the limit. I’m not sure Validas’s suggestion of more tiers of service so that people can be more closely matched to their actual usage is the answer either. For one, mobile contracts are confusing enough as it is, adding more tiers won’t make it any easier. “It is a fine line between giving the consumer too many options so it’s confusing, and too few so it doesn’t fit,” said Dylan Breslin-Barnhart, a Validas spokesperson. The second reason more tiers might not make sense is that with the rapid increase of data use, Verizon may have built in reasonable room for growth — their lowest-end users might be burning up close to 2GB of data by the time their contracts run out in two years. In the meantime, you have just a day to sign a new contract under the old unlimited plan.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/sunday-review/03phone-map.html?ref=atandt">Phone-Call Cartography<date>Published: July 2, 2011</date><text>AMERICANS are more connected now than ever. Mobile phones allow people to maintain relationships with friends, family and colleagues across long distances.If you analyze aggregated cellphone traffic — as researchers at M.I.T., AT&amp;T and I.B.M. did with United States data from July of last year — interesting patterns emerge. Cities become connective hubs as people move to them from nearby counties and from far across the country. As a result, many calls originate and end in cities, connecting urban citizens to their families back home. At the same time, communities emerge that have little to do with geographic boundaries. While some follow state lines, others split states in half or combine them. There are sister states like Georgia and Alabama, and Mississippi and Louisiana. New Jersey and California, on the other hand, split in half because of the influences of large cities. Chattanooga, Tenn., communicates more with the Georgia-Alabama community than with the rest of Tennessee, and Pittsburgh splits from Pennsylvania to align with West Virginia. Texas remains whole, because the communication among Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin is strong enough to hold it together. These patterns show that proximity is only one of many factors — both cultural and economic — that bring people together. Carlo Ratti is the director of the M.I.T.

A San Francisco man who was accused of taking information on 114,000 iPad 3G owners from AT&amp;T’s servers pleaded guilty on Thursday. According to the New Jersey attorney general’s office, Daniel Spitler, 26, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computers connected to the Internet, and one count of identity theft. Mr. Spitler is expected to be sentenced on Sept. 28. Each charge could result in up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Mr. Spitler was arrested last year along with Andrew Auernheimer, known online as Weev, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that they had collected e-mail addresses and unique identification numbers that could be tied to iPad 3G owners. The two men said they had gained access to the data through a loophole on AT&amp;T’s Web site. Mr. Auernheimer is expected to be arraigned later this year. He is currently free on $50,000 bail. The case gained national attention because the stolen e-mail addresses included those of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and employees of the Justice Department, NASA and the Department of Homeland Security. There were also a number of celebrities on the list. Mr. Auernheimer passed the information along to the gossip blog Gawker. An AT&amp;T spokesperson declined to comment about the case. The charges were filed in New Jersey because AT&amp;T’s servers are housed in the state. The attorney general’s office said the investigation was led by the F.B.I.’s Newark Cyber Crimes Task Force, which investigates computer crimes including data breaches and identity theft.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/big-names-in-tech-back-atts-bid-for-t-mobile/?ref=atandt">Big Names in Tech Back AT&amp;T's T-Mobile Bid<date>June 6, 2011, 11:00 pm</date><text>Alex Wong/Getty ImagesRandall Stephenson, the chief of AT&amp;T, during a Senate panel’s hearing in May, with Daniel Hesse, right, of Sprint Nexte. June 7, 1:07 p.m. | Updated with the letters In its quest to win approval of its $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, AT&amp;T just got a lot of help from its friends. Eight technology giants, including Facebook and Microsoft, and 10 venture capital firms, filed letters supporting the acquisition late on Monday. The letters, filed with the Federal Communications Commission, lent their support to AT&amp;T’s argument that the T-Mobile deal will help the company extend its next-generation data network across the country, helping to meet the growing need for wireless broadband services. “Many policy-related efforts will not be able to quickly address near-term capacity needs,” the Microsoft-led group wrote in its letter. “The F.C.C. must seriously weigh the benefits of this merger and approve it.” The letters are the latest salvo in the fight over AT&amp;T’s effort to become the nation’s biggest cellphone service provider. It is a fight that has pitted AT&amp;T against consumer groups and smaller rivals like Sprint Nextel. Sprint and other service providers have argued strenuously that the deal would revive the “Ma Bell” situation of old, leaving AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless in a duopoly that controls most cellphone customers. Such a combination could lead to higher prices and reduced service, they say. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The letters AT&amp;T's Deal for T-Mobile Sprint, the nation’s third-biggest carrier behind Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T, has been the most outspoken opponent of the deal. “I am here because Sprint believes in competition, which goes hand in hand with innovation,” the company’s chief executive, Daniel Hesse, testified at a Senate hearing last month. Both sides have been racing to enlist as many prominent supporters as possible. Sprint has found common cause with consumer groups, while AT&amp;T has lined up support from unions, particularly the Communications Workers of America. And both sides have sought political leaders to speak out. The outpouring of support is taking place within the confines of reviews by the F.C.C. and the Justice Department, which are aimed at determining if the deal is in the public’s interest and whether it harms competition. The process may take about a year. The deadline to file supporting comments for the deal is Friday, while the deadline to file opposing comments was last week. The letters filed Monday provide solid support for the deal from Silicon Valley. Other companies that have signed on are Yahoo, Oracle and the BlackBerry’s maker Research in Motion. The venture capital firms include Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Sequoia Partners. As smartphones and tablets proliferate, so too have apps like one by Facebook that draw in ever-rising amounts of data. Monday’s letters cite AT&amp;T’s contention that the T-Mobile deal will allow the carrier to expand its nascent 4G network to cover 97 percent of the country and an additional 55 million Americans. “The access aspect of this is so, so important,” Fred Humphries, Microsoft’s vice president for United States government affairs, said by telephone. “We quickly came to the conclusion that this is a good merger.” Promod Haque, a managing partner of Norwest Venture Partners, said in a telephone interview that constraints on network capacity were harming new mobile applications and offerings. “The lack of adequate spectrum is killing the quality of users’ experience,” he said. “Customers say, ‘I can’t even get a phone call and can’t get adequate reception. So you want me to use this new service?’ ” Allowing AT&amp;T to consolidate its network spectrum with T-Mobile’s is easier and more cost-effective than alternatives, Mr. Haque added. Microsoft approached “a select few” technology companies to support the deal, mostly those whose products would obviously also benefit from wider data pipelines, and received quick and positive replies, Mr. Humphries said. The software giant also contacted several trade associations to which it belongs, letting them know of the company’s position. While Microsoft and Research in Motion have signed the letter, other notable smartphone players whose offerings consume large amounts of data, like Apple, have not. Some of the signers said that while they had considered Sprint’s arguments that the deal would harm both competition and innovation, they disagreed. Jon Auerbach, a general partner at Charles River Ventures, pointed to smaller competitors like Leap Wireless and “virtual network operators” like Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile USA as alternatives for consumers. Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Haque also said that AT&amp;T had repeatedly shown a willingness to work with its portfolio companies. They argued that those business relationships showed a willingness by AT&amp;T to eschew existing technology in favor of new developments from unproven players. “When a large provider is willing to take a bet on something that may not have the best balance sheet in the world or a long track record, that goes a long way,” Mr. Auerbach said. “AT&amp;T really wants to know what’s next.” Update: Here are the four letters submitted to the F.C.C. One is from Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, Yahoo, Research in Motion, Qualcomm, Avaya and Brocade. The second is from Kleiner Perkins. The third is from Sequoia. And the fourth is from a group of eight venture capitalists, including Mr. Haque and Mr. Auerbach.

Mr. Dalvito will be based in New York while Mr. Hardegree will be based in Menlo Park, Calif, according to an internal memo sent on Monday by Paul Parker, the firm’s global mergers and acquisitions chief. As the head of Barclays’ media team, Mr. Dalvito managed several billion-dollar transactions, including the $6 billion sale of Vivendi’s stake in NBC Universal. Mr. Hardegree, who has spent more than a decade with the technology team, has advised several blue-chip clients, like Cisco and AMD. Additionally, the company also announced on Monday, that it has promoted Barry Boniface, to be the head of its communications and media mergers and acquisitions group. The appointments come just one month after Barclays’ former head of technology mergers and acquisitions, Drago Rajkovic, left for a rival, JPMorgan Chase. In recent months, there have been several notable shuffles, as investment banks try to attract and retain the best talent. Last week, UBS hired Yusuf Nahmiyas as a managing director for its technology, media and telecommunications mergers team. He was most recently at Deutsche Bank. In April, Citigroup tapped Ethan Topper, the founder of the boutique investment bank Union Square Advisors and a former Credit Suisse banker, to be its global head of technology banking. The announcement was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. Here is the internal memo from Mr. Parker to his staff: As part of our further expansion of the Technology franchise, we are pleased to announce the appointment of Greg Dalvito and Richard Hardegree to Co-Heads of the M&amp;A Technology vertical. Both Greg and Richard bring extensive relevant experience to their new leadership roles. Greg and Richard will be based in New York and Menlo Park, respectively, and their coverage will span the various sub-sectors within the Technology vertical. Greg has headed our Media M&amp;A vertical for nearly five years. Greg’s recent and historical experience in media, telecom and technology has allowed him to advise on many franchise-defining transactions in those sectors. He has executed over $400bn in completed advisory assignments, including most recently advising Mediacom’s Special Committee in the $3.9bn take-private transaction, Vivendi in the sale of its $6bn stake in NBC Universal and Scripps in the $1.0bn acquisition of The Travel Channel. In addition to Greg’s new responsibilities, Greg will continue to work with and advise a number of our most important media clients. Richard has focused on technology M&amp;A in Menlo Park since 1999 and has spent the last 5 years as a senior member of our technology M&amp;A team. Over this time, he has established strong relationships in the electronics and communications technology sectors and has advised on over 50 technology transactions with clients, including Cisco, AMD, Nokia Siemens Networks, Avago and KLA Tencor.

Verizon is entitled to its day in court, but this suit must not prevail. With text messages, e-mail and other forms of data overtaking voice as the main form of wireless communication, the rule issued in April will preserve competition in a vital communications network. There are more than 100 wireless providers around the country, mostly tiny carriers with a network limited to a small area. They depend on roaming agreements to stitch together a bigger footprint, which is essential to compete successfully. If Verizon were to prevail — AT&amp;T has, so far, not joined the lawsuit but has criticized the rule — the two dominant players could refuse to deal. The Federal Communications Commission says AT&amp;T signed its first 3G roaming agreement in March, six years after establishing the 3G network. In April 2010, Verizon had only nine roaming agreements, according to the F.C.C. But it hurried up after the F.C.C. started the rule-making process a year ago. Now it has 40, including 10 on its most advanced 4G network. In a letter to the F.C.C. last year, a coalition of wireless carriers complained that the big broadband carriers often refused to negotiate deals, or demanded rates of 30 cents or even $1 per megabyte, which would make watching a movie or downloading a song prohibitively expensive. The F.C.C. requires wireless carriers to offer voice roaming at reasonable rates, but data providers are not classified as common carriers, which must offer their services to everyone on standard terms. Verizon argues that the F.C.C. thus does not have the authority to impose standardized roaming rules on data. The argument is weak. The F.C.C. doesn’t impose a standard pricing structure. It expects firms to negotiate their own deals and provides an arbitration procedure in case they cannot reach an agreement. The wireless market has been growing increasingly concentrated over the last decade. If cleared by antitrust regulators, AT&amp;T plans to buy the No. 4 carrier, T-Mobile. Against this backdrop, data roaming rules are essential.

In April 2010, Verizon had only nine roaming agreements, according to the F.C.C. But it hurried up after the F.C.C. started the rule-making process a year ago. Now it has 40, including 10 on its most advanced 4G network. In a letter to the F.C.C. last year, a coalition of wireless carriers complained that the big broadband carriers often refused to negotiate deals, or demanded rates of 30 cents or even $1 per megabyte, which would make watching a movie or downloading a song prohibitively expensive. The F.C.C. requires wireless carriers to offer voice roaming at reasonable rates, but data providers are not classified as common carriers, which must offer their services to everyone on standard terms. Verizon argues that the F.C.C. thus does not have the authority to impose standardized roaming rules on data. The argument is weak. The F.C.C. doesn’t impose a standard pricing structure. It expects firms to negotiate their own deals and provides an arbitration procedure in case they cannot reach an agreement. The wireless market has been growing increasingly concentrated over the last decade. If cleared by antitrust regulators, AT&amp;T plans to buy the No. 4 carrier, T-Mobile. Against this backdrop, data roaming rules are essential. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: June 2, 2011 An editorial on Tuesday about Verizonâs data roaming agreements incorrectly stated the number of 3G agreements it had by April 2010. It was nine, not three.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/28/technology/28bizbriefs-FCCASKSATTFO_BRF.html?ref=atandt">F.C.C.

Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on intellectual property, competition and the Internet. He worried that the combination would enable AT&amp;T to charge smaller competitors more money to use the company’s mobile network, a process known as roaming. “There are legitimate questions about whether this merger could move the wireless market past the anticompetitive tipping point,” Mr. Goodlatte said on Thursday at a hearing in Washington before his subcommittee. At a hearing on May 11, senators said they had similar worries. And on Wednesday, Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, said the transaction would hurt consumers and might result in the loss of jobs. “I see no redeeming reason” for federal regulators to approve the transaction, Mr. Conyers said. “Not even one.” Executives from AT&amp;T and Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s parent company, said the deal would improve service through increased wireless capacity. The deal announced March 20 for the Deutsche Telekom unit would combine the carriers to create a new market leader, ahead of Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel.

I made a few turns of a field with him in his planter, then watched as he sold some seed, visited some lambs (“I used to do pigs but they’ve driven all the small farmers out of that business”), helped his 99-year-old father eat lunch (we ate, too: turkey, potatoes, beets, green beans), visited the local ethanol plant (another story), and drove around a five-mile radius like mad.

Concepcion is a devastating blow to consumer rights. By upholding the arbitration clause in AT&amp;T’s customer agreement requiring the signer to waive the right to take part in a class action, the court provided other corporations with a model of how they can avoid class actions. It gave companies even more power when it also ruled out class-based arbitrations.These are major setbacks for individuals who may not have the resources to challenge big companies in court or through arbitration. When Vincent and Liza Concepcion signed a two-year contract for AT&amp;T cellphone service, they received what they were told were two free phones. AT&amp;T then charged them $30.22 in sales tax for the phones. They sued the company for fraud in federal court and their case and another were consolidated as a class action. AT&amp;T argued that the contract required the Concepcions to submit their claim to individual arbitration. A federal trial court, upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, struck down the AT&amp;T arbitration clause as unconscionable under California law and allowed the plaintiffs to move forward against the company in a class action in federal court. With Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority, the Supreme Court reversed that decision and, in a dramatic example of judicial activism, ruled that class-based arbitrations also would not be permitted. Justice Scalia argued that “class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration — its informality — and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.” In his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer highlights the damage to consumers: “What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim?” And he made clear that many rational couples would not press their own case for that amount if it meant “filling out many forms that require technical legal knowledge or waiting at great length while a call is placed on hold.” In 2005, the California Supreme Court defined a rule of “unconscionability” for consumer contracts: when they “deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.” The federal trial court and the Ninth Circuit applied the rule in this case. Writing about why the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 pre-empts the California law in question, Justice Scalia demonstrates both his pro-business bias and the selective nature of his brand of originalism. Contrary to what he suggests, when the law favoring arbitration was enacted, arbitration’s purpose was to resolve disputes between businesses — not businesses and consumers. He doesn’t try to trace his view on class arbitration to the 1925 law because it is mute on the subject. Instead, he provides his own definition of what arbitration should and should not be — with “no meaningful support,” as Justice Breyer writes, in Supreme Court precedent. In a welcome effort to protect consumers, employees and others, Senators Al Franken and Richard Blumenthal and Representative Hank Johnson have just introduced the Arbitration Fairness Act. It would make required arbitration clauses unenforceable, although its chances aren’t great in the current political environment. Unless Congress fixes the problem, the Supreme Court’s decision will bar many Americans from enforcing their rights in court and, in many cases like this one, bar them from enforcing rights at all.The Supreme Court’s 5-to-4 vote in AT&amp;T Mobility v.

T-Mobile ads made merciless fun of AT&amp;T’s reputation for dropped calls and sluggish wireless data connections while celebrating T-Mobile’s fast network and low rates. AT&amp;T promoted superior nationwide service and its exclusive array of the sleekest, fastest smartphones.The two companies did not show up as rivals on Wednesday, however, at a Senate hearing on the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T. Instead, the executives of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, after standing with hands raised vowing to tell the truth, warned that without AT&amp;T buying T-Mobile, the growth potential of both companies was limited and their ability to meet customer demand for wireless Internet service was lacking. Actually, the two companies said, they are not really competitors — an assertion that one senator finally found too much to bear. “I mean, please,” said Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the judiciary subcommittee for antitrust and competition issues. “You both sell the same service, cellphone service, on a national basis,” Mr. Kohl said, looking at Randall L. Stephenson, the chairman and chief executive of AT&amp;T. “Is it really credible to come up here and sit here and tell us that you and T-Mobile are not close competitors? Mr. Stephenson replied: “They’re not our competitive focus. I can tell you that.” While forecasting their misfortune as unmerged entities, the chief executives of the both companies parried skeptical questions from other Democrats and competing telecommunications executives. The proposal, which faces a nearly yearlong review from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, would create a carrier that controls an estimated 43 percent of the cellular-phone market. Together with Verizon, the two companies would control close to 80 percent of the national market. Those who looked skeptically on that potential dominance included Daniel R. Hesse, chief executive of Sprint Nextel, a company that T-Mobile and AT&amp;T say is, in fact, a competitor. Mr. Hesse repeated the argument he has voiced almost since the day AT&amp;T announced its purchase of T-Mobile. If regulators approve the deal, he said, “the wireless industry would regress toward a 1980s style duopoly.” Mr. Hesse said he believed that the combination of the two companies would reduce to three, from four, the number of major national wireless carriers, a group that also includes Verizon. That would be only a prelude to a further consolidation to two companies, as his own company would find it difficult to compete with the reach of AT&amp;T/T-Mobile and Verizon. “I am not here to ask for a special break or to seek any conditions in connection with this takeover,” Mr. Hesse said. “I am here because Sprint believes in competition, which goes hand in hand with innovation.” Mr. Stephenson and Philipp Humm, chief executive of T-Mobile USA, said that they also believed in competition, and that the merger of their companies would do nothing to ease the battle for mobile phone subscribers. “We expect increased competition and lower prices for all customers,” Mr. Humm told the subcommittee. Republicans on the subcommittee expressed support for the deal. “I favor market approaches rather than government funding and intervention to build a national wireless network,” said Senator Michael S. Lee of Utah. Regulators, Mr. Lee added, “must be guided by what is best for consumers in prices, in service, in quality and ultimately in the range of choice” for customers. Several subcommittee members from Iowa, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin asked the executives to explain the effect of the acquisition on rural cellphone service. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, asked if it were true, as critics have said, that both companies had large blocks of unused spectrum — the airwaves on which mobile phone traffic travels — in rural areas, where there is often spotty service. Mr. Stephenson replied that without the merger, his company would not be able to expand its wireless broadband service to rural areas. Mr. Stephenson also made several references to President Obama’s goal of expanding wireless broadband service to as many Americans as possible in the next few years, saying that the combination of the two companies would allow his company to do just that. “This is a private market solution for a public policy objective,” Mr. Stephenson said. The president’s goal, he said, “could become a reality purely with private capital.” Mr. Kohl, in turn, scoffed at Mr. Stephenson’s repeated appeals to public policy goals. “You would almost argue to us today that what you are doing is in national interest,” Mr. Kohl said. “This is a business deal to make your company more successful and more profitable.” While Mr. Kohl said he did not have any problem with a profit-making company looking out for its own interest, “we should discuss it in that context, not as what is in the national interest.”WASHINGTON — A few weeks ago, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile were robust competitors.

The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that companies can use contracts that prevent consumers claiming fraud from banding together to file group arbitration claims and, possibly, class-action lawsuits. The case has broad implications for consumers because all sorts of companies, like banks, builders and even nursing homes, use contracts that require disputes to be settled through arbitration and forbid class actions. Banks and credit card companies, in particular, have come under scrutiny recently for their use of such binding arbitration clauses in customer contracts. “I think it will make it very difficult for consumers to recover for overcharges, mischarges, incorrect billings or identity confusion in disputes with credit card companies or banks,” said Michael Donovan, a lawyer in Philadelphia who co-wrote an amicus brief filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in the case. The decision, he said, will “make it difficult for consumers in resolving the typical disputes that they have with companies large and small.” Here’s some background: The decision involved a case brought against AT&amp;T Mobility by a California couple who objected to a $30 charge for what was advertised as a “free” cellphone. They filed a lawsuit seeking class-action treatment. But the couple had signed a standard contract with AT&amp;T that required them to resolve disputes through arbitration — a private legal proceeding — and barred them from banding together with other customers to seek class-action treatment, whether through arbitration or in a lawsuit brought in a traditional court. The company, relying on the contract, said the case couldn’t proceed in court, or as a class-action case in any venue. Lower federal courts refused to enforce the arbitration agreement. The case ended up at the Supreme Court, which found for AT&amp;T. The immediate impact of the decision, Mr. Donovan said, is that consumers will have a hard time finding a lawyer to represent them for claims of small dollar amounts — which means they, in effect, will just have to accept such losses. Say your bank charges you a $35 fee for a bounced check, and you dispute that you owe it but you can’t get the bank to refund it. That amount is too small to be worth a lawyer’s time — or what you’d have to pay to hire him. Sure, you could try to pursue arbitration and represent yourself. But Mr. Donovan notes that companies using contracts with such clauses typically have entire staffs devoted to such matters. “They can just crush the individual who’s not familiar with the legal arguments,” he said. There is the possibility, according to an article in American Banker, that the new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may propose regulations to limit the use of such language in contracts used by banks and other financial institutions, which have long been criticized by consumer advocates. But that’s likely to take some time, especially since the appointment of the bureau’s first director is currently caught in the midst of a political battle. Have you ever gone to arbitration to resolve a dispute with your bank, or another company? How did it turn out for you?</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/business/28bizcourt.html?ref=atandt">Supreme Court Class Ruling Is Win for Business<date>Published: April 27, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Businesses may use standard-form contracts to forbid consumers claiming fraud from banding together in a single arbitration, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday in a 5-to-4 decision that split along ideological lines.Though the decision concerned arbitrations, it appeared to provide businesses with a way to avoid class-action lawsuits in court. All they need do, the decision suggested, is use standard-form contracts that require two things: that disputes be raised only through the informal mechanism of arbitration and that claims be brought one by one. “The decision basically lets companies escape class actions, so long as they do so by means of arbitration agreements,” Brian T. Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, said. “This is a game-changer for businesses. It’s one of the most important and favorable cases for businesses in a very long time.” The decision fits in with recent rulings that have favored arbitrations and been wary of aspects of class actions. The case was brought by a California couple who objected to a $30 charge for what was said to be a free cellphone. They had signed a “take it or leave it” standard contract from AT&amp;T Mobility that required them to resolve disputes through arbitration and barred them from banding together with others to seek class-action treatment, whether in arbitration or in traditional litigation in court. The couple, Vincent and Liza Concepcion, filed a lawsuit against AT&amp;T Mobility seeking class-action treatment. The company, relying on the contract, responded that the case could neither proceed in court nor as a class action in any forum. But lower federal courts refused to enforce the arbitration agreement and allowed the case to go forward. They relied on a 2005 ruling from the California Supreme Court that barred class waivers as unconscionable. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority on Wednesday, said the lower courts had failed to properly apply the Federal Arbitration Act, which overrides some state court decisions disfavoring arbitration. The California Supreme Court decision had barred class waivers in all standard-form contracts, whether applicable to arbitrations or court proceedings, as unconscionable if they gave rise to claims that the companies issuing them had set out “to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small amounts of money.” Though neutral on its face, the ruling placed an unlawful burden on arbitration agreements and so ran afoul of the federal arbitration law, Justice Scalia wrote. “Requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration,” Justice Scalia wrote. He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Arbitrators are ill suited to handling sprawling cases, Justice Scalia said, and sensible businesses would not agree to participate in informal proceedings from which very limited appeals are possible when faced “with even a small chance of a devastating loss.” “We find it hard to believe,” Justice Scalia wrote, “that defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review, and even harder to believe that Congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision.” Justice Scalia added that the arbitration agreement at issue in the case, AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion, No. 09-893, was more than fair in the procedures it used and the payments it contemplated in individual cases. The company, in a statement on Wednesday, said the decision was “a victory for consumers.” “We value our customers,” the statement said, “and AT&amp;T’s arbitration program is free, fair, fast, easy to use and consumer friendly.” Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for himself and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said the state court decision banning class waivers did not violate the federal law favoring arbitrations. Class arbitrations, Justice Breyer wrote, are perfectly appropriate ways to resolve claims that are minor individually but significant in the aggregate. He said he was puzzled by Justice Scalia’s assertion that there was tension between the goals of arbitrations and class treatment. “Where does the majority get its contrary idea — that individual, rather than class, arbitration is a fundamental attribute of arbitration?” The apt comparison, Justice Breyer continued, is not between individual and class arbitration but between class arbitration and class actions in court. Class arbitrations, he said, are more efficient. But the most fundamental problem, he said, is that minor frauds like the one asserted here by the California couple will not be remedied. “What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim?” he asked. Quoting from a decision in another case, he answered his own question. “Only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30,” he said.WASHINGTON — Businesses may use standard-form contracts to forbid consumers claiming fraud from banding together in a single arbitration, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday in a 5-to-4 decision that split along ideological lines.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/technology/21phones.html?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T’s Quarter Matches Expectations<date>Published: April 20, 2011</date><text>AT&amp;T, the nation’s largest telecommunications company, reported a 39 percent increase in its first-quarter profit on Wednesday, despite losing the exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in the United States midway through the period. The company posted net income of $3.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, up from $2.5 billion, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed more than 2 percent, to $31.2 billion from $30.5 billion. AT&amp;T’s income met Wall Street forecasts while its revenue was slightly better than the forecast for $31.26 billion, but the company’s stock fell 18 cents, to $30.13 a share. AT&amp;T said it activated 3.6 million iPhone accounts during the period, nearly a million more than it activated a year earlier, easing concerns that Verizon, which began selling the iPhone in February, would cut into its market share immediately. Nearly a quarter of the new iPhone subscribers were new to AT&amp;T. The company also said that the number of subscribers who left the carrier stayed roughly the same as last year. In addition, AT&amp;T added two million wireless subscribers in the quarter, a slight increase from the 1.9 million that it added in the first quarter a year earlier. AT&amp;T’s overall pool of subscribers, which includes cable and land line customers, rose to 97.5 million, a 12 percent increase from a year earlier. “We entered this quarter and this year with questions and uncertainty, in part related to the end of the iPhone exclusivity and its impact,” said Richard Lindner, the chief financial officer of AT&amp;T, during a call to analysts and investors. “Hopefully we’ve answered those questions.” Ralph de la Vega, the company’s chief mobility officer, said AT&amp;T’s marketing push, which included commercials that highlighted technical limitations of Verizon’s CDMA network that do not allow smartphone owners to make voice calls and simultaneously perform data functions like browsing the Web, as being instrumental in retaining subscribers. The company also attributed the popularity of connected devices like tablet computers, Kindles and personal Wi-Fi hot spots, as lifting the company’s profits. AT&amp;T and third-party retailers sold 421,000 of those during the quarter, although the vast majority of those sales were iPad 3Gs, which made up 322,000 of those sales. But analysts said it might be too soon to determine what the overall impact of the Verizon iPhone will be on AT&amp;T. “Is this as bad as it gets or will the real impact come only later with the iPhone 5,” wrote Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein Research, in a note to investors. The fifth-generation of the iPhone, which some speculate could be introduced by Apple in the fall, might be the true litmus test for the carriers, who will have to compete for customers whose current contracts are expiring as well as those intending to upgrade. Mr. Moffett noted that while AT&amp;T did, however, beat analysts’ expectations that it would lose about 50,000 of its contract subscribers, adding instead 62,000 contract customers, the figure was down from the same period a year earlier, when AT&amp;T gained 512,000 new customers on contract. Charles S. Golvin, a wireless industry analyst at Forrester Research, said the majority of the growth in the wireless industry stemmed from people who have never had a smartphone before. “At this point, there aren’t any new contract customers in the United States,” he said. “It’s all about smartphone newcomers and stealing customers away from their competitors.” He noted that for the time being AT&amp;T was still selling an older version of the iPhone, the 3GS, for $49, which might be behind the surge in iPhone activations for AT&amp;T. “There is something really appealing to someone who has never had a smartphone before to be able to get one for $50,” he said. But once the iPhone 5 arrives, he said, “we’ll really see how much customers care about the network they are on.”AT&amp;T, the nation’s largest telecommunications company, reported a 39 percent increase in its first-quarter profit on Wednesday, despite losing the exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in the United States midway through the period.

Consumers Union, the organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, sent a letter on Tuesday to members of Congress warning of the potential impact of AT&amp;T’s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile. “It is critical to look at the effect this merger would have on consumers’ pocketbooks, choice and service,” said Parul P. Desai, policy counsel for Consumers Union, in a statement about the move. “Ultimately, it does not appear to be in their favor.” The group said its main concern is the pricing differences between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile wireless plans. The group found that T-Mobile plans were more affordable, charging from $15 to $50 less each month than comparable offerings from AT&amp;T. On average, the group found, AT&amp;T charged $200 more per year than T-Mobile for similar plans. “We are concerned that T-Mobile’s departure from the wireless market would eliminate a relatively low-cost carrier as an option that many consumers need access to in order to afford quality wireless service,” Ms. Desai said. Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, said that current T-Mobile customers would not be affected by a merger. “Current T-Mobile phones will continue to work fine once the transaction is complete and you will be able to keep your existing price plan,” said Mr. Balmoris. In addition, on average, people tended to be less satisfied with AT&amp;T’s customer service than T-Mobile’s, Consumer Reports found. AT&amp;T has also said that the deal would benefit consumers, in part by improving network quality and reach. The organization sent the letter as lawmakers begin to schedule hearings to consider whether to approve the merger, which would create the largest wireless carrier in the United States.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/battling-headwinds-in-a-shifting-m-a-marketplace/?ref=atandt">Battling Headwinds in a Shifting M.&amp;A. Marketplace<date>April 7, 2011, 12:02 am</date><text>Harry Campbell Where are all the strategic bidders? It’s true that some blockbuster strategic deals have been announced recently, including AT&amp;T’s $39 billion proposed acquisition of T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom and Nasdaq’s $11.3 billion unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext. But these deals belie a strange fact: strategic bidders, or bidders that are operating companies, appear hesitant to re-enter the takeover market. Recent transactions display this caution. In August, Dynegy agreed to sell itself for $548 million to the Blackstone Group. Shareholders protested that the price was too low and the deal was canceled. Carl C. Icahn emerged and offered $665 million for Dynegy, shareholders again protested and that deal fell apart, too. Two financial buyers had been more than willing to bid and shareholders thought another bidder could offer more, but no strategic bidder emerged. Similarly, in the Del Monte Foods buyout led by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Vestar Capital Partners, and the buyout of J. Crew by Leonard Green &amp; Partners and TPG Capital, no strategic bidders emerged. In both cases, particularly that of J. Crew, there was talk that the price was too low. And in both instances, special mechanisms were eventually put in place to entice third-party bidders, including lowering or eliminating the termination fee typically payable to the initial bidder if a third-party bid succeeded. These changes made it much easier for strategic bidders to make an offer. Video: The Dot-com Boom, Then and Now. Despite speculation that Sears and Urban Outfitters were checking the fit of J. Crew, no offer was made. And no new bidder emerged in the buyout of Del Monte, the largest private equity deal announced last year. Graphic: Click for a fuller picture of the Silicon Valley money network Private equity firms have historically been at a disadvantage on how much they can offer. Strategic bidders can often realize greater cost savings and synergies by eliminating duplicative functions and combining and operating the acquired company more efficiently within their other operations. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links  Graphic: Deal Mashup Word Cloud Special Section: Wall Street and the New Web Boom This advantage was partly eclipsed in the cheap-money years before the financial crisis. But we are supposed to be back in more normal times, so why are strategic buyers hanging back? The apparent reluctance may be the result of a fundamental reassessment of the value of takeovers, one that was occurring even before the financial crisis. Since then, chief executives and boards have been more concerned with running their businesses and surviving than with chasing expansion through takeovers. This is particularly true when the chance of success is far less certain, as in hostile takeover attempts. No chief executive envies John E. McGlade of Air Products and Chemicals, who spent more than $100 million and a year of management time fruitlessly pursuing a hostile bid for Airgas. And BHP Billiton’s chief, Marius Kloppers, made two unsuccessful runs — one at Rio Tinto and the other at the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan — at a cost of about $800 million. The last 15 years have produced mergers that proved to be spectacular failures. AOL’s merger with Time Warner and Daimler’s acquisition of Chrysler are among the most notable. Together, these deals destroyed more than $150 billion in shareholder value. During this time, studies have shown that while there are gains to be made, many M.&amp;A. deals prove unsatisfactory for buyers. McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that only a third of merger deals create value. In a separate study, Prof. Robert F. Bruner, dean of the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, found that almost half of deals failed, although these results were skewed by some spectacular miscues. These studies illustrate that achieving a successful merger is hard work, requiring strategic vision and a focus on integrating the acquired company. Let’s face it, buying companies is fun — the rush of adrenaline, the challenge of negotiations, money getting thrown around and an elegant closing dinner when the deal is done. But then the real work begins: merging differing business cultures and integrating company operations. Experts increasingly believe that the outcome of a merger depends in large part on the success of these efforts at integration. Deal-making is also being hampered by a shift in market sentiment away from the conglomerate and toward acquisitions that allow a company to focus on expanding its current lines of business. Few companies today can feasibly buy an orange juice company while owning a rental car company, as Beatrice Foods did in the 1980s. The numbers appear to bear this out. According to Dealogic, strategic mergers in the United States totaled about $682 billion last year, roughly the same as in 2009 and way down from the $1 trillion in such deals made in 2007. This is partly a result of the transformation of private equity firms, which increasingly are buying companies in the same lines of business, allowing them to combine functions and wring out additional cost savings once achievable only through strategic acquisitions. K.K.R.’s acquisition of Del Monte, the owner of the Kibbles ’n Bits, Meow Mix and Milk-Bone brands, was the firm’s second pet food acquisition in a year, for example. As a result, strategic deals now tend to be driven by factors aimed at long-term survival. The T-Mobile deal, in which AT&amp;T made its bid to forestall a sale of T-Mobile to Sprint, is a case in point. AT&amp;T is betting that the operational and cost savings from the acquisition will exceed $40 billion, making it a deal that pays for itself. AT&amp;T also wants to expand its wireless spectrum to meet the explosive demands placed on its network by today’s data-hungry mobile devices — a major reason the company was willing to make a deal that poses so many antitrust risks. Of course, strategic bidders are still making megadeals, but activity has been concentrated in select industries where consolidation or acquisitions are necessary for survival. In the natural resources and pharmaceutical sectors, for example, blockbuster deals have been robust. Perceived scarcity is also contributing to deal-making. The headlong rush into so-called cloud computing — the practice of using the Internet to process, manage and store data on remote network servers — led last year to a bidding war for 3Par in which Dell lost out to Hewlett-Packard. After its disappointment, Dell quickly acquired another such company, Compellent Technologies. Nasdaq’s unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext — an effort to thwart the merger agreement between NYSE and Deutsche Börse — can also be explained by Nasdaq’s desperation not to be shut out of the accelerating consolidation among global stock exchanges. With so many factors weighing on deal-makers’ minds, investment bankers will have to work harder to coax companies to the M.&amp;A. table. But when a deal is reached, those same factors may give bidders confidence that their offers will not be trumped. Despite a rush to view any announced megadeal as a harbinger of a revived M.&amp;A. market, deal premiums may actually decline — and the heady days of merger mania may be slow to return. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the world of mergers and acquisitions.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/deals-creep-back-though-not-yet-to-the-mega-level/?ref=atandt">Deals Creep Back, Though Not Yet to the Mega Level<date>April 7, 2011, 12:01 am</date><text>Bigger deals are back. Despite a series of potential shocks to the global economy, deal makers just completed their strongest quarter since before the financial crisis. And with that robust start, capped by AT&amp;T’s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA, many bankers are hopeful that the revival will pick up speed. As if to confirm that, another batch of deals was announced just after the quarter ended on March 31, including Vivendi’s $11.3 billion buyout of Vodafone’s stake in SFR of France, an $11.3 billion rival bid for NYSE Euronext by the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange, and Texas Instruments’ $6.5 billion takeover of National Semiconductor. The dollar volume of mergers struck in the first quarter jumped 54.7 percent from the comparable period a year eariler, to $799.8 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The overall number of deals fell about 5 percent, to 9,600, Thomson Reuters said. But the real story lay in the number of deals over $5 billion, which made up a little more than 41 percent of all mergers in the quarter.

North America still has the largest slice of the deal-making pie for the quarter, accounting for $408.3 billion worth of mergers, or about 51 percent. But deals in emerging markets grew to about a quarter of the total, at $196.3 billion. Buyers from rising industrial powers, including China, India and Brazil, are likely to continue looking beyond their borders for natural resources. This week, Minmetals Resources, a publicly traded unit of a Chinese state-owned mining company, offered $6.5 billion for Equinox Minerals of Canada in an effort to buy a major producer of copper. By many measures, the ingredients for deal-making remain in place. The stock markets have largely shrugged off unforeseen events like the market flash crash of last May and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of last month, helping to establish a steady line for stock prices. Companies remain flush with cash that they began stockpiling in late 2008; some $1.9 trillion is in American corporate coffers, according to the Federal Reserve. (Most of that cash is being held abroad, however, and for tax reasons companies may choose not to spend it on deals in the United States.) The New York Times Management teams have shown more confidence in pursuing new avenues of growth that complement their existing businesses, although several conglomerates — among them Sara Lee, ITT and Fortune Brands — have chosen to break themselves into parts to focus on a few operations. “Strategic acquirers are reinforcing their core business,” Antonio Weiss, the global head of investment banking at Lazard, said at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute last week. “You don’t see a lot of diversifying transactions.” Another measure of growing corporate confidence is the unsolicited or hostile deal. Like Nasdaq and ICE in their bid for NYSE, or Valeant Pharmaceuticals International in its $5.7 billion hostile bid for Cephalon, rebuffed suitors have shown a willingness to mount a fight and press forward, hoping to find shareholders willing to sell. Cheap financing remains widely available as interest rates stay near record lows, and debt investors continue to buy up riskier loans and bonds in pursuit of better yields. Nowhere was this clearer than in JPMorgan Chase’s $20 billion loan to AT&amp;T to help it finance its T-Mobile deal. It was the largest loan ever by a single originating bank. But JPMorgan was also confident that it could quickly sell off pieces to other banks to help lower the risk on its own books, and it syndicated the loan in a matter of days. The New York Times The preponderance of cheap debt has also supported buyout firms, which struck $51.4 billion worth of deals during the first quarter. Deal makers are still breathlessly awaiting the return of megabuyouts over $10 billion — a level not attained since the Blackstone Group’s $25 billion takeover of Hilton Hotels nearly four years ago. Buyout firms have been getting closer: Blackstone spent $9.4 billion to acquire the American assets of Centro Properties in February. This week, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed to buy Pfizer’s capsule-making business for $2.4 billion, while Apax Partners agreed to buy two software companies for about $2 billion. More private equity deals are likely to be in the offing. K.K.R. executives told public investors last month that the firm had more than $11 billion in untapped capital to spend on buyouts. “That is incredible capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see in private equity around the globe,” Alexander Navab, the firm’s co-head of North American private equity, said at a meeting with investors last month. But the pace of their deals may be slowed if strategic buyers fully re-emerge as competitors. During the buyout boom, private equity firms were often the only bidders in big auctions. The uptick in announced deals has also benefited the bankers who put them together. Fees from mergers and acquisitions grew 3.3 percent in the first quarter from the same time last year, to $7.1 billion. That accounted for about a third of all investment banking fees for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. But the sunny outlook is not without some clouds. While continued unrest in the Middle East has not yet dented the pace of deal-making, advisers caution that the uprisings may spread. Rising prices of commodities like oil and cotton could also weigh on corporate profits, making companies more hesitant to spend. And the European sovereign debt crisis, which has hung over the Continent for more than a year, may again resurface as a serious threat to corporate confidence. Deal makers almost universally profess to seeing a continued increase in deal-making, but a gradual one, with no sharp jumps in volume and numbers. So far, they say, their backlogs of pending transactions appear to bear that out. “People are upbeat, and while it gets sometimes overused, ‘cautiously optimistic’ is a great description,” said Robert E. Spatt, a partner at the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.

With this as the new benchmark for credit-hungry corporate executives, the worry is that banks wind up competing in a game of one-upmanship that leads some to fly solo on riskier deals.Working with just one lender has many merits for borrowers. It has a greater capacity to minimize leaks — an enormous perk when navigating regulatory briar patches like the one AT&amp;T must to win approval for buying T-Mobile. For banks, it means juicy fees and huge bragging rights. It’s going to be difficult for rival banks to meet JPMorgan’s ante. They must have a balance sheet big enough to accommodate so large a single credit without worrying regulators. That probably leaves only Bank of America and Citigroup, both still weak from their excesses in the last boom, given the legal limits on lending. So stepping up on riskier deals would be another way to make a mark. The AT&amp;T loan is about as safe as they come. It’s an investment grade company flush with assets that will generate an estimated $7 billion in cash flow in 2011 after dividends, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Moreover, JPMorgan will soon be joined by a number of other banks interested in taking a slice of the T-Mobile financing. This will create the impression that going it alone isn’t that big a deal. And while joining the syndicate should give banks the first chance on the lucrative refinancing AT&amp;T is sure to start in the bond market, JPMorgan gets the largest share. Moody’s calls the deal a negative since it raises the stakes in an industry that thrives on cutthroat competition. Loans to highly rated companies aren’t too worrisome. That is until bankers, driven by envy and fees, head downscale. Regulators may want to revisit old rules on single-loan limits to nip that possibility in the bud. An Awkward Spot Citigroup is in an uncomfortable spot. Its bankers may have information needed to determine whether the onetime successor to Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman and chief executive, had violated securities laws when personally trading in shares of Lubrizol, which Berkshire just acquired for $9 billion. While uncomfortable, this doesn’t have to be damaging territory for Citi. Merger documents detailing events that led to the Lubrizol deal on March 14 show Citi doing what banks are supposed to do: matching hungry buyers with willing sellers. David Sokol, long considered a leading candidate to take over from Mr. Buffett, asked Citi bankers last fall to come up with good ideas for “possible transactions” in a variety of industries, including chemicals. Citi delivered: on Dec. 13, its bankers went over a list of 18 companies, including Lubrizol, which Citi had already been advising on “a range of strategic alternatives.” Mr. Sokol found Lubrizol attractive and asked Citi to let the company’s chief executive, James L. Hambrick, know he would be interested in having a discussion. So far, so good for Citi. It got the talks started. On Jan. 6 Lubrizol’s board had an “extensive and thorough discussion” about Berkshire’s interest and hired advisers. Shortly after, Mr. Sokol and Mr. Hambrick spoke, and agreed to meet on Jan. 25, where Mr. Sokol made clear that he would need to hand off discussions to Mr. Buffett, who closed the deal. All this is M.&amp; A. 101. And, arguably, the Citi bankers who advised Lubrizol earned their fees for solving the needs of a client that felt its shares were underappreciated. Trouble is that Mr. Sokol, who says he did nothing wrong, bought shares in Lubrizol the day after the Dec. 13 meeting with Citi at which he effectively kicked things off. He did so again on Jan. 5, Jan. 6 and Jan. 7 —before, during and after Lubrizol’s board meeting. Apart from deciding whether the conversations with Citi made Mr. Sokol an insider, the Securities and Exchange Commission must answer a basic question. Did he know the board was meeting on Jan. 6 when he placed his $10 million trade? Going back to the M.&amp; A. textbook, it wouldn’t have been out of the ordinary for Citi to have mentioned that Lubrizol’s board was meeting. If Citi’s bankers haven’t heard from the S.E.C. yet on this question, they’d better prepare.  For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.JPMorgan Chase’s record $20 billion financing for AT&amp;T is turning bankers green the world over.

Two days after Mr. Obama set a national goal of cutting oil imports by one-third by 2025, in a speech at Georgetown University, he was scheduled to travel on Friday to a shipping center in Landover, Md., just outside Washington, to view new “clean fleets” belonging to the two delivery giants and to AT&amp;T, PepsiCo and Verizon. The president’s focus on clean energy this week comes at a time when Americans are paying gasoline prices that now average about $4 a gallon, close to the high levels just before he won election in 2008. According to the White House, the five corporations have commercial fleets that are among the 10 largest in the country; together they own more than 275,000 cars and trucks. They have joined the administration’s new public-private partnership to encourage a switch to vehicles that are more fuel-efficient or run on electric power or alternative fuels. In the near term, the five companies will deploy more than 20,000 advanced-technology vehicles, saving more than 7 million gallons of oil, the administration estimated. The National Clean Fleets Partnership would be open to companies of all sizes, according to the White House. Through the Department of Energy, which already has a Clean Cities vehicle technology program, participants would get up-to-date technical information and purchasing assistance. For example, smaller companies could piggy-back on larger corporations’ bulk purchases, enjoying the same cost savings on advanced vehicles that use electric batteries, natural gas, biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen or propane.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/jpmorgan-syndicates-20-billion-att-loan/?ref=atandt">JPMorgan Syndicates $20 Billion AT&amp;T Loan<date>March 31, 2011, 5:51 pm</date><text>JPMorgan Chase has fully syndicated its $20 billion loan to AT&amp;T for the cellphone carrier’s bid to buy T-Mobile USA, spreading it out across 11 other banks, according to a regulatory filing.

The firm began contacting potential syndication partners this week, these people said. DealBook previously reported that JPMorgan was able to make the loan very quickly in part because of its strong balance sheet and because AT&amp;T is a longstanding client with good credit ratings. According to the loan agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, JPMorgan syndicated the loan to the following banks: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Barclays Capital Citigroup BNP Paribas Credit Suisse Deutsche Bank Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley the Royal Bank of Scotland UBS Wells Fargo AT&amp;T will likely pay an interest rate of about 0.75 percent above the one-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, if it draws down the loan. That could change slightly if the carrier’s credit rating falls.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/technology/30phone.html?ref=atandt">As Regulators Weigh AT&amp;T Deal, a Look Abroad<date>Published: March 29, 2011</date><text>For Americans, complaining about big cellphone bills that seem to only get bigger is standard practice. But they may actually be getting a pretty good deal — globally speaking.While cellphone customers in the United States tend to pay more every month than consumers in other developed countries, they get more for their money in terms of voice and data use. For example, Americans pay an average of 4 cents for a minute of talk time, while Canadians and the British pay more than twice that, according to recent data from Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. In Japan, where the top three wireless carriers control 97 percent of the market, locals pay 22 cents a minute. “Pricing is what sets the U.S. apart from the rest of the world,” said Sam Paltridge, an analyst at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. “Americans spend less than average on communications.” The question for regulators in Washington is how AT&amp;T’s $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile might change that. Analysts and industry experts worry that the deal could hurt consumers, in particular by eliminating T-Mobile’s low-cost phone plans. Some are urging regulators to block the acquisition, which would leave two major companies, AT&amp;T and Verizon, with nearly 80 percent of the wireless market, followed by the much smaller Sprint. AT&amp;T has said the merger will benefit consumers, in part by improving network quality and reach. As they consider the deal, regulators may look abroad to see how competition affects wireless markets. With only three major network operators, the market in the United States would function similarly to some European markets, like France, which also has three operators, said J. Scott Marcus, the former chief technology officer at the telecommunications company GTE and former Internet policy adviser at the Federal Communications Commission. “It will definitely become an oligopoly market,” Mr. Marcus said. “That will be less good than what one had before, but not awful.” Of course, using other countries as a guide to how consolidation may play out is tricky, because every market is shaped by local cultural and business factors. In Japan, for example, the average amount that consumers spend on data is the highest in the developed world — but not because of a lack of competition in the mobile industry. Japanese cellphone owners like to do a lot of browsing on their cellphones, and they are prepared to pay for that, said Steven Hartley, an analyst at Ovum, a research firm in London. Mr. Hartley said over 40 percent of mobile operators’ revenue in Japan comes from data services, compared with 25 percent in the United States. Americans tend to talk nearly twice as much as people in most other developed countries, which led to the popularity of bigger buckets of voice minutes. And plans that offer nationwide calling with no roaming fees have also kept prices low. In Europe, which in theory is one market but is actually divided into many smaller national markets, roaming charges are a frequent and bothersome reality. Europeans and Asians were quicker than Americans to embrace so-called prepaid phone service, in which customers do not have a contract and pay for chunks of voice minutes and data capacity as they go. This means phone owners are generally not tied to a single wireless company and have more flexibility to switch among services. Some even carry around multiple SIM cards, the fingernail-size chips that activate a cellphone for use, and decide which one to install based on which offers the cheapest rate for the country they are calling or visiting. For example, someone living in Spain who often visits family in France might purchase SIM cards for wireless services in both countries. And phone customers outside the United States tend to have more handset choices, since cellphones are less likely to be “locked” for use with one particular carrier. But they have fewer opportunities to upgrade cheaply, because carriers are less likely to offer a free or discounted phone to those who commit to a one- or two-year contract. Some of that is beginning to change, said Chris Jones, an analyst at Canalys. “Smartphones are beginning to get more popular in the U.K., so more people are buying smartphones and the contracts that come with them,” he said. Even so, those contracts can cost around £30 or £35 a month, or $48 to $56, and they do not include data, he said. In general, the breadth of options in Europe has not yet led to significantly cheaper service, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics in Dedham, Mass. “It only drives down prices if competitors are willing to compete on price,” he said. “The market is more or less equally divided up, so there isn’t the same hypercompetitiveness that we have in the U.S.” Heike Troue, the director of a public policy institute in Berlin, said that she was satisfied with the range of mobile choices available there. An iPhone 4 owner, she pays T-Mobile 90 euros a month, or $127, for her all-inclusive contract, which provides 1,000 calling minutes, three gigabytes of data transfers and 1,500 text messages. Since she signed up for the plan last November, she has never hit those limits. “One can only talk so much,” Ms. Troue said. At times, high costs abroad have prompted lawmakers and regulators to step in. European and British telecom companies are bowing to such pressure by lowering or planning to lower termination fees — the fees that the caller’s carrier must pay to the recipient’s carrier. The goal is to give carriers more flexibility to compete by selling more generous packages with larger chunks of talk time, text allotments and cheaper data services. European regulators have also ordered that limits be placed on roaming charges for calling and texting, and are working on a similar limit on data roaming charges. In South Korea, the government has put pressure on the three major carriers — SK Telecom, KT and LG Telecom — to cut rates on text messages and calls, and it also limits the amount of subsidies the companies can offer on new phones. Regulators in the United States could require AT&amp;T to make some concessions for the T-Mobile deal to be approved, like giving up wireless spectrum in some cities. The review by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. could take several months, and analysts say it could be a year before the full effect of the deal is clear. Some analysts say that the combined company might actually lower prices to better compete with Verizon. But others warn of side effects. Mr. Paltridge of the O.E.C.D said that the overall consequence of combining AT&amp;T and T-Mobile might be broader than most consumers think. For example, it would leave only one American carrier using GSM, the world’s most common cellular standard. That means AT&amp;T could raise rates for Americans using their phones overseas and for foreigners visiting the United States. “If the two merged, there would be an international angle to the competition issue,” he said.

And as many of the top legal specialists in the field head down to the annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute in New Orleans on Wednesday, it appears that their confidence is rising. Of the roughly 40 top M.&amp;A. bankers and lawyers surveyed by the Brunswick Group, a public relations firm, about 92 percent said they believed the rest of this year would bring continued strong growth in mergers and acquisitions. Much of that was driven by a strong first quarter for deal-making, capped last week by AT&amp;T’s blockbuster $39 billion deal for T-Mobile USA. M.&amp;A. volume rose 58 percent for the quarter from the period a year earlier, in the best start since 2007, according to preliminary data from Thomson Reuters. Roughly half of the deal-makers surveyed by Brunswick said they believe that the biggest contributor to rising M.&amp;A. was greater confidence among management teams and company boards. (Other factors include the improving economy and more buying firepower in the form of cash on corporate balance sheets and the availability of cheap credit.) That confidence could be seen in part through hostile deals, including an unsolicited $5.7 billion bid for Cephalon by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International announced on Tuesday. According to those surveyed, the majority of deals seen this year will continue primarily to be domestic ones by emboldened strategic buyers. Still, Asia is considered to be the most fertile source of international buyers of American assets — so long as those would-be bidders are not stymied by regulatory hurdles, which 40 percent of respondents identified as the most likely obstacles to deals. Much of the rest of this year’s survey mirrored the results of last year’s, including the most likely active sectors for deals (health care and energy) and the most likely problems for hostile bidders (overpaying and staggered boards, in which only a portion of directors are up for election in any given year). But 57 percent of respondents said that they expected more deals to be done using just cash, more than double from last year. Part of that is likely a reflection of the tremendous stores of cash companies have built up, as well as the willingness of banks to lend. Part of it may also be some lingering uncertainty over the potential vicissitudes of the markets. Yet it may also reflect even more bullishness, suggesting that the shares of potential acquirers still have some room to grow and therefore are not worth using as currency — at least not right now. In other words, the good times may continue to roll. 2011 Brunswick Group M&amp;A Survey</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/opinion/29tue2.html?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Proposes a Merger<date>Published: March 28, 2011</date><text>AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless have emerged from a 15-year consolidation spree with almost two-thirds of American cellphone subscribers.

With a deal as big as AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, a little regulatory review is to be expected.

The announcement is aimed at stirring up opposition to the merger, which would again make AT&amp;T the biggest cellphone carrier in the United States. AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have acknowledged that they expect to face tough scrutiny from federal regulators over the next 12 months as they seek to close the deal. Sprint‘s decision was wholly unsurprising, given critical comments by the company’s chief executive, Daniel Hesse, at an industry conference last week. In its announcement, Sprint warned that allowing the merger to proceed would drastically cut competition among cellphone carriers, effectively handing control of the industry to AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless. The T-Mobile deal would refashion AT&amp;T into a new giant with nearly three times Sprint’s revenue, according to the statement. “Sprint urges the United States government to block this anti-competitive acquisition,” said Vonya McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president for government affairs. “This transaction will harm consumers and harm competition at a time when this country can least afford it.” Shares in Sprint have fallen more than 5.5 percent since AT&amp;T announced its deal last week, trading at $4.77 late on Monday afternoon.

Therefore: Operation Cupcake. As the Federal Communications Commission debated final rules last December on how Internet service providers should manage their traffic,  AT&amp;T delivered 1,500 of these opulent desserts to the F.C.C.’s headquarters here. Like many other big corporations, AT&amp;T annually blankets power brokers with token holiday gifts, but the cupcake campaign was notable for its military precision. A three-page spreadsheet, stamped “AT&amp;T Proprietary (Internal Use Only),” detailed how the desserts were to be deployed to each of the 63 commission offices: four dozen were assigned to the enforcement bureau, 10 dozen to the wireless divisions, 12 cupcakes to each of four commissioners, and 18 to the chairman, and so on. As it turns out,  AT&amp;T had begun its $39 billion courting of T-Mobile about the same time. The resulting deal, announced a week ago, would transform the industry if approved. It would narrow the field of major wireless providers to three and vault AT&amp;T into the No. 1 spot, ahead of Verizon; consumer advocates say the combination will lead to higher prices. As interested parties lobby for and against the merger, one person will be pulling at the levers of power more often and with more influence than anyone else, according to both friends and foes: AT&amp;T’s chief lobbyist, James W. Cicconi. A master strategist, Mr. Cicconi (pronounced si-CONE-ee) internalizes the art of regulatory and legislative war — and Operation Cupcake is but one of the efforts to come out of his shop. Tutored by James A. Baker III in the ways of politics in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Mr. Cicconi, 58, plays hardball — literally, as a pitcher in an adult baseball league, flinging fastballs toward batters more than a decade younger. His roots are in Texas, and he never forgets the lesson of the Alamo: the Texans lost. Other battles have different lessons for him. He once took his staff on an overnight retreat to Gettysburg, Pa., where it toured Cemetery Ridge and Little Round Top and absorbed lessons on battlefield tactics. In 13 years at AT&amp;T, Mr. Cicconi has helped guide the company through roughly a dozen mergers, large and small, and he has made his share of enemies in Washington. As a testament to his power, however, few of them will criticize him on the record. “He’s smart, he’s savvy, he’s strategic,” says Gigi B. Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, a media and consumer advocacy group that has often wrestled with him. “I don’t think there’s a lobbyist in town who I disagree with more on the issues, but I have the utmost respect and admiration for the way he does his job. He’s always thinking three steps ahead of the competition.” MR. CICCONI, senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, is not alone, of course, in spreading AT&amp;T’s corporate message. Five other executives rate a similar rank, and four more are group presidents or chief executives, all under AT&amp;T’s chairman and C.E.O., Randall L. Stephenson. Nor is Mr. Cicconi’s lobbying effort a one-man show. He oversees a division that spent $115 million on lobbying over the last six years, putting it among the top five corporate spenders in the country, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying and campaign spending. AT&amp;T employs an army of outside lobbyists, including at least six prominent former members of Congress, including the former Senate majority leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, and former Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. Over the last two decades, AT&amp;T employees and its political action committees have pumped more campaign contributions into federal politics than any other American corporation, the Center for Responsive Politics reports. In the last election cycle, AT&amp;T contributions found their way to 390 representatives and 70 senators. “They are a behemoth,” says Dave Levinthal, editor of Opensecrets.org, the center’s online lobbying database. “When you have dozens of former federal officials doing your bidding in Washington with a detailed knowledge of how Washington works, it is exponentially easier to grease the skids of government.” As Congress discusses the merger, Republicans and Democrats will duel over the balance of market forces and regulatory intervention. The White House will strive to balance the president’s campaign promises to get tough on antitrust issues while trying to prove he is not anti-business. In advocating for the T-Mobile merger, AT&amp;T and Mr. Cicconi have their work cut out for them. The Justice Department’s antitrust unit will aim to determine whether the deal will substantially limit consumers’ choices. After the merger, AT&amp;T and Verizon would together control nearly 80 percent of the cellular market, with Sprint a distant third. (Verizon declined to comment on Mr. Cicconi or on AT&amp;T’s deal to acquire T-Mobile.) And the F.C.C., which along with Justice must approve the merger, wants to reapportion the scarce broadcast wavelengths on which wireless broadband operates. The T-mobile deal would result in fewer potential bidders in its airwave auctions. 1 2 Next Page »Washington</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/att-deal-shows-how-different-a-private-sale-can-be/?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Deal Shows How Different a Private Sale Can Be<date>March 25, 2011, 9:53 am</date><text>AT&amp;T’s 78-page agreement to acquire T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom shows how creative deal makers can become when the agreement is a sale of a private company, rather than the purchase of a public company. Here are the highlights from the filing: Regulatory AT&amp;T and Deutsche Telecom have negotiated an elaborate risk-sharing arrangement with respect to divestiture and other steps AT&amp;T and Deutsche Telekom must take to obtain regulatory clearance of the T-Mobile purchase. The agreement requires that AT&amp;T take “reasonable best efforts” to obtain regulatory clearance. This is the standard formulation. But as you would expect in this controversial deal, it gets much, much more complicated after that. First, the parties say specifically that negotiating divestiture sales is part of AT&amp;T’s required reasonable best efforts. Second, the agreement states specifically that AT&amp;T does not have to agree to divestitures and other regulatory conditions that would have an adverse effect greater than $7.8 billion. There is a complicated definition of an adverse effect. For these purposes, there is a formula for calculating the effect of each divestment of a subscriber and each spectrum divestment. The parties value a subscriber at $578. You may want to remember this the next time you are thinking of switching cellular networks. For wireless spectrum, the parties value it by “multiplying the number of MHz POPs (the amount of spectrum in a licensed area measured in megahertz multiplied by the population of that licensed area) by amounts ranging from $0.145 to $1.265.” The range depends on the cellular market size and the spectrum’s megahertz, but this range is not disclosed by AT&amp;T. The focus here is on subscribers and spectrum and for other any other required divestitures, only 50 percent of the adverse effect is counted for the purposes of the $7.8 billion limit. So, for example, if a building were required to be divested, the parties would only count 50 percent of the value for purposes of the limit. In addition, certain undisclosed matters are not counted toward the divestiture limit, meaning AT&amp;T must divest them per se, while others are immediately counted as reaching the limit and so cannot be required to be divested. What these items are we don’t know, because this information is set forth in a schedule to the agreement that is not disclosed. So, we’re really not sure what needs to be divested or what is excluded from the $7.8 billion figure, but the pain threshold here for AT&amp;T appears to be higher than $7.8 billion in value while the area of concern is clearly spectrum and subscribers. AT&amp;T does not have to share all of this pain. The agreement states that at the time of sale the purchase price will be reduced by an amount equal to the divested amount of subscribers and spectrum minus $3.8 billion. In other words, to the extent AT&amp;T is required to divest subscribers or spectrum in an amount that exceeds $3.8 billion, then Deutsche Telecom will bear this risk through a purchase price reduction. Of course AT&amp;T will also not have a chance to use these assets. Once this threshold of value is met, AT&amp;T does not have to close the deal if the regulators still sue and block the deal. The drop dead date on this deal is March 20, 2012, meaning AT&amp;T has to use its efforts to obtain regulatory clearances through this date, and either party can terminate the deal thereafter. If the deal terminates because of a failure to obtain regulatory clearance, A&amp;T must pay Deutsche Telecom $3 billion in cash plus “enter into a roaming agreement with Deutsche Telekom on . . . and transfer to Deutsche Telekom certain wireless AWS spectrum that [AT&amp;T] does not need for its initial LTE roll-out.” Indemnification The regulatory risk-sharing is not the only feature in this agreement that is different because it is a private deal. In a public deal, the buyer is primarily worried about whether the deal will complete. An agreement is negotiated that sets forth the consideration paid, mechanics of approval for the deal, what happens if another bidder emerges and regulatory steps required among other things. But a buyer also wants to make sure that the company it is buying is relatively unchanged when it comes time to complete the purchase a few months after the agreement is signed. The agreement will thus contain representations and warranties that describe the state of the business. When closing comes, these representations and warranties need to be true and correct for the buyer to be required to complete the transaction. Typically, there is a materiality threshold, which requires that the representations and warranties need to be untrue to a level that would be a material adverse effect for the buyer to allow the buyer to walk. Yet if the buyer closes and subsequently finds that the representations and warranties were not true, the buyer is out of luck. It is rare for an agreement to permit the buyer to sue public shareholders for subsequently discovered breaches of the representations and warranties. The reason is expediency. There can be thousands of shareholders and suing them all would be a difficult logistical task. In a private deal, however, there will be negotiated indemnification available if there is a breach of the representations and warranties. The buyer is concerned not just with closing the deal but remedies for breaches discovered after the deal completes. This is because there is an easy shareholder to sue, the selling shareholders, who typically number in the handful. Because of this, the representations and warranties are much more heavily negotiated in a private deal. In the AT&amp;T agreement there are 21 pages of representations and warranties. In this deal, Deutsche Telecom is required to indemnify AT&amp;T for breaches of the representations and warranties up until the damages reach $9.75 billion. Thereafter AT&amp;T is responsible for any additional damages. This type of cap on damages is common in private deals, and anecdotally this is a high cap for a private deal. In recent years caps have been creeping lower to about 10 percent of the deal price. And like in other private deals, there is a negotiated deductible for indemnification claims. No indemnification is required for any individual claim that does not exceed $1 million or $5 million, again depending on the type of representation or warranty breached. And no indemnification is required until all claims exceed $500 million. Other Mechanisms Other unique attributes of a private agreement are present. The AT&amp;T agreement has a purchase price adjustment based off working capital. Buyers don’t want to pay for cash in the company and so any excess cash as of the closing is allocated to Deutsche Telecom. There is a dispute mechanism to settle this amount. Ultimately, this is a very complex business arrangement negotiated by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz. Theses lawyers are pros, and if you read the agreement your head will spin. One of the reasons is because they use a common trick that lawyers do in drafting agreements: they make the definitions do the work. In every agreement there is a list of defined terms. But here, they work overtime, and there are 15 pages of defined terms alone. For example, in the section on divestitures there are defined terms, which include Divestiture Sales and Divestiture Amount. A Divestiture Sale means a Market Divestiture or Spectrum Divestiture. A Divestiture Amount means a Divested Market Amount plus the Divested Spectrum Amount. And each of these definitions is further defined. Through these definitions, the actual requirement for divestitures are in one paragraph, though that paragraph contains about 15 defined terms. And by putting things in definitions a lot of the real regulatory bargain can also be put in schedules to the purchase agreement that are not disclosed to the public. It appears that this agreement, like most private agreements, was heavily negotiated over a longer period than a public deal would take. This time was necessary to strike not just the purchase price but the other regulatory attributes of the deal as well as the other mechanics present in a private deal. The agreement is a nice piece of complex engineering. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the world of mergers and acquisitions.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EEDE113AF931A15750C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=atandt">DEALBOOK; AT&amp;T's Cost For Getting T-Mobile<date>Published: March 22, 2011</date><text>''We have never seen a deal with more regulatory risk be attempted in the U.S.'' That was the initial assessment of AT&amp;T's $39 billion agreement to acquire T-Mobile, from Jonathan Chaplin, one of the most thoughtful telecommunications analysts on Wall Street. ''It is unlikely that AT&amp;T would attempt a deal that they knew would fail,'' he said. ''However, we can't see how they would get this through without massive divestitures and concessions.'' In Washington, though, the question is whether the deal should get through at all. And if it is approved, how much will AT&amp;T ultimately have to give up? The deal is a classic duopoly case study: if AT&amp;T and T-Mobile combined, it would set up a match-up like Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi, with AT&amp;T pitted against Verizon. The other rivals become almost irrelevant. AT&amp;T and Verizon would control roughly 80 percent of the national market. The next biggest is not that big at all: Sprint is just cracking double digits, at about 12 percent. After that is the bottom tier - MetroPCS, Leap and the like - all in single digits, though their numbers have been growing. Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&amp;T, would say this is the wrong way to look at the marketplace. For the last 24 hours, he has been telling anyone who will listen that the Justice Department should and will judge the transaction on a local market-by-market basis. He says on a local level, his company is often competing against at least five players - and in some cities, like Detroit and Miami, T-Mobile is not even in the top tier. Technically, Mr. Stephenson is correct. The government will evaluate the deal on a market-by-market basis, and he does have multiple ''competitors'' in each market. But let's be honest for a moment: MetroPCS and Leap, his supposed competitors, do not offer like-for-like products that can replace AT&amp;T's offering. One of the reasons MetroPCS has been able to offer lower prices than AT&amp;T is that it does not offer true national service. (It would dispute this assessment because it uses roaming agreements and other companies' networks - namely Verizon's and Sprint's - to extend its reach.) The iPhone? Forget about it. When you think about innovation in the cellular industry - whether it be technology, price plans or service - it has not come from the third-tier companies; instead, the third-tier companies have played copycat to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. The big question is whether an AT&amp;T-Verizon duopoly will create enough competition to further drive competition and keep prices low. ''This is a significant horizontal consolidation by all the traditional measurements. This level of concentration, two-thirds of the time, has been rejected by the Department of Justice,'' Reed E. Hundt, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said on a segment with me on CNBC on Monday. Michael J. Copps, an F.C.C. commissioner, said last year that the amount of concentration in the cellular industry should be considered ''a bright caution light for this commission as we go about the business of advancing competition and consumer well-being in the broadband age.'' ''We are going to need an extra dose of vigilance going forward and use whatever policy levers we have available to ensure good outcomes for American consumers,'' he said. On that score, in the short term at least, the facts may be on AT&amp;T's side. A deal with T-Mobile should improve its service and coverage area, while allowing it to upgrade its systems with enough spectrum to keep up with the insatiable demand of consumers for more data and video over hand-held devices. Rick Kaplan, senior adviser to the F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, said on Monday that the industry was desperately in need of more spectrum. ''The spectrum crunch is real,'' he said. ''We're going to have to get more spectrum online for broadband.'' AT&amp;T hopes to leverage that sentiment by arguing that without the deal, the company will be hobbled to support its customers. The company is also playing the patriotic card by contending that the deal will ''strengthen and expand critical infrastructure for our nation's future'' and will ''help achieve the president's goals for a high-speed, wirelessly connected America.'' All of that may be true. And perhaps the government should approach deals in this context, but if so, it would be a complete shift in policy. So what will AT&amp;T have to give up to get the thumbs up? That's the $3 billion question - the amount of money it would have to pay T-Mobile's parent, Deutsche Telekom, if the deal were blocked. That huge breakup fee should provide a powerful incentive to compromise. But then the question becomes what ''remedy'' the government could come up with to ensure competitiveness and innovation. AT&amp;T would have to give up an awful lot of spectrum to ever create a true national competitor to it or Verizon. Lesser concessions could include commitments to make their networks open to competitors through roaming agreements and reseller agreements, allowing other carriers to sell service on At&amp;T's network under another brand. (That's what Verizon had to do in 2008.) Whatever the outcome, it's going to be long, drawn-out battle. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

For everyone else, it could cost a lot of money. No sooner did the two companies announce a $39 billion merger on Sunday than industry analysts began assessing the impact on the biggest potential losers in the deal: consumers.If approved by regulators, the merger would leave just three major cellular carriers in the United States, a development that consumer advocates warn could eventually lead to higher prices for a wide variety of services. For this reason the deal is likely to attract close scrutiny in Washington. It is too early to say how much — or even whether — rates might rise for consumers, who on average pay $55 a month for their wireless plans, said Roger Entner, who tracks the wireless industry for the Nielsen Company. But while consumers may see some immediate benefits — in network quality, for example — they are not likely to benefit in the long run, some analysts and industry experts said. The bottom line, they said, is that competition is likely to suffer, leading to higher prices and less innovation. That is because the deal would leave just AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless and the much smaller Sprint to divide up the voracious smartphone market — with the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile union likely to dominate the market. “Without some of the smaller competitors, you won’t have the competitive pressure that leads to lower prices and innovations and offerings among the carriers,” said Paul Reynolds, electronics editor at Consumer Reports. AT&amp;T maintains that the merger will be good for consumers. “The benefits of this transaction are possible at this scale and on this timeline only from the combination of these two companies,” Randall L. Stephenson, chairman and president of AT&amp;T, said in a call to investors and analysts on Monday. He added that the merger “will improve network quality” and “give more customers access to more services.” Other analysts also had a rosier view, suggesting that AT&amp;T may diversify its offerings if it acquires T-Mobile. T-Mobile has long built its reputation by offering affordable, low-rate cellphone plans, including ones that do not require annual contracts or a minimum voice plan. “Having 30 million new subscribers might convince them to add more attractive data pricing,” said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst, referring to T-Mobile’s customer base. “Things like data family plans could become a reality.” Whatever happens to prices, the availability of cellphone coverage in the United States is likely to expand, analysts said. AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have invested in different parts of the country, and customers of the two companies would have access to a larger, combined network. Potentially, the acquisition of T-Mobile, with its additional wireless spectrum, could also help AT&amp;T with the rollout of its next-generation wireless network, known as 4G. Improved service and network quality could be another boon. T-Mobile and AT&amp;T use the same underlying GSM cellphone technology, which should reduce any friction of blending the two networks. AT&amp;T could take advantage of T-Mobile’s latest high-speed network, in which the company has invested millions to upgrade and bring online. By adding T-Mobile, AT&amp;T will gain cell sites equivalent to the number it would have taken five years to build, experts say. All this means, in theory at least, that service should improve. But the cost to buy that coverage is likely to go up. “Typically, the more competition there is, the faster prices drop,” Mr. Sharma said. “In a situation where there are two main carriers, pricing is not likely to move as much.” One burning question raised by the potential of a merger with AT&amp;T is what will happen to the wide range of inventive T-Mobile data plans, which are some of the lowest in the country, and have helped keep pressure on competitors. The company also offers a wider choice of smartphones for younger users, like the popular Sidekick line, which T-Mobile recently said it would revive. AT&amp;T is expected to honor contracts through their expirations, but it is unclear what will happen once those contracts expire. “The prospect of having those kinds of options go away is a real concern,” said Mr. Reynolds of Consumer Reports. “It’s a welcome offering for people in this market that can be quite unaffordable otherwise.” If approved, the merger is expected to save both companies $3 billion annually. That saving, Mr. Sharma said, along with the influx of millions of new consumers, might persuade the company to be more competitive in family data plans as a way to draw in new subscribers and increase competition with Verizon, the new company’s chief rival. If the merger is approved, AT&amp;T would have about 129 million wireless customers and Verizon about 101 million. Sprint has about 50 million customers. Another potential byproduct could be a drop in pricing for sleek, high-end smartphones. Hardware makers, for example, might offer AT&amp;T a lower rate for bulk purchases of new smartphones and tablet computers. “AT&amp;T’s new scale would give them pricing advantage,” Mr. Sharma said. “You could end up seeing $100 or $150 smartphones for consumers in the future.” A typical smartphone can cost $200 with a contract. One constant in a consumer’s life could remain: frustrating experiences with customer service. “In terms of customer satisfaction, AT&amp;T was clearly in last place, below average in comparison to other carriers, including T-Mobile,” he said. Although T-Mobile has historically performed well in the annual surveys conducted by Consumer Reports that rate satisfaction, in big takeovers the larger company typically tends to swallow the smaller one, he said. “The overall consumer experience might become more like AT&amp;T than T-Mobile,” Mr. Sharma said.The $39 billion proposed merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile could save the companies a lot of money. For everyone else, it could cost a lot of money.

Mead, chief executive officer of Verizon Wireless. 7:39 p.m. | Updated As AT&amp;T seeks to become the nation’s biggest cellphone service provider by buying T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, many eyes are now turned to the company that currently holds that title, Verizon Wireless. For now, it appears that Verizon’s strategy is simple: Do nothing drastic. With 101.1 million customers, Verizon Wireless already holds considerable market share, and its network is regularly praised by subscribers and analysts alike for its strength and broad reach. Even if the T-Mobile deal is approved sometime in the next 12 months, vaulting AT&amp;T to the top of the industry, analysts say that Verizon is well-positioned for at least the short term. “I don’t think they need to do anything right now except stay focused on their core message and superior experience,” Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research, said in a telephone interview. While rivals — specifically Sprint Wireless, already in third place and facing the prospect of falling further behind — plan to lobby against the merger, Verizon has so far adopted a nonchalant attitude. Its chief executive, Daniel S. Mead, has signaled that he will not oppose the AT&amp;T merger as it begins a yearlong process of tough antitrust approval. When asked at a wireless industry conference if the company would be interested in a potential deal for Sprint as a counter to AT&amp;T’s deal, Mr. Mead was terse in his dismissal. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “We’re not interested in Sprint,” he said on Monday evening, according to Reuters. “We don’t need them.” While Verizon would most likely be unable to pursue a deal for Sprint in any case, and especially not if AT&amp;T’s T-Mobile deal is approved, Mr. Golvin of Forrester said that Verizon could still look at smaller acquisitions to buy additional wireless bandwidth, known as spectrum. Among the potential candidates are smaller carriers like MetroPCS or Leap Wireless, though any deal for either would probably be far off in the future. Unlike AT&amp;T, which has said that its deal for T-Mobile was in large part an effort to gain extra bandwidth for next-generation data services, Verizon already has plenty of spectrum. The carrier recently introduced its newest mobile broadband network, based on a standard called LTE, while AT&amp;T will not have until this summer. Verizon could also benefit from its biggest competitor being distracted by the huge effort needed to win approval for its deal, let alone the even more intensive effort of meshing AT&amp;T’s operations with T-Mobile’s. AT&amp;T will also most likely be forced to divest parts of its business to satisfy government regulators. Verizon’s business is also among the healthiest among the major carriers, having generated $16.1 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $63.4 billion for all of last year. The company also lays claim to the lowest rate of customer defections, or churn, among the big four carriers at 1.34 percent. By contrast, Sprint has 49.9 million subscribers and lost $3.5 billion last year. Verizon also has other strong advantages over its rivals. It has a robust selection of attractive smartphones, including those using Google’s Android system, and most recently, the Apple iPhone.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/ad-spending-could-change-with-att-deal/?ref=atandt">Ad Spending Could Change With AT&amp;T Deal<date>March 22, 2011, 1:25 pm</date><text>The advertising implications for the acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T will take some time to unfold. Advertising for T-Mobile is created by the Seattle office of Publicis Worldwide, an agency that is owned by the Publicis Groupe of France. The current campaign for T-Mobile mocks the quality of the service that AT&amp;T provides its iPhone customers, borrowing the format of the recent campaign for Apple that made fun of Microsoft. Advertising for AT&amp;T is created by the Atlanta and New York offices of BBDO North America, part of the BBDO Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group. The current AT&amp;T campaign carries the theme “Rethink possible.” When companies combine, one area they often look at to save money and become more efficient is in ad spending. But it is unclear at this point how much an AT&amp;T that includes T-Mobile would reduce its spending on advertising, given that there would still be two other wireless carriers running ads to compete against AT&amp;T: Verizon and Sprint Nextel. Last year, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile spent a total of $2.67 billion on advertising, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, with AT&amp;T spending $2.09 billion and T-Mobile spending $573.4 million. AT&amp;T was among the top 10 advertisers in 2010, coming in at No. 3 behind only Procter &amp; Gamble and General Motors. Verizon spent $1.82 billion on ads last year, Kantar Media reported, which landed Verizon in fourth place on the list of top 10 advertisers in 2010. Sprint Nextel did not make that list, but did not miss in by much, spending $1.06 billion on ads last year. The company that finished 10th on the list, L’Oreal, spent $1.11 billion in 2010. It may be instructive to examine what happened to ad spending the last time AT&amp;T made a major wireless acquisition. That was at the end of 2006, when AT&amp;T acquired BellSouth, with which it had shared ownership of Cingular Wireless; AT&amp;T took full control of Cingular, which it eventually re-branded as AT&amp;T. In 2006, according to Kantar Media, AT&amp;T spent $2.36 billion on advertising and Cingular spent $1.26 billion, for a total of $3.62 billion. In 2007, AT&amp;T spent $2.2 billion and Cingular, on its way to being renamed, spent $222.3 million, for a total of $2.42 billion. In 2008, the first full year of Cingular fully owned by AT&amp;T, and now called AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T spent $1.98 billion on advertising. That fell to $1.87 billion in 2009, a year in which many advertisers cut spending because of the economy. Then, last year, as noted above, AT&amp;T’s spending rebounded, to $2.09 billion. As for the effects of the deal on the agency rosters of the two companies, that, too, is not known at this time. Typically when a deal of this kind is announced, the agencies involved continue to work for their respective clients. After a transaction is completed, there are several possible paths. The most common is that the acquiring company continues to use its agencies and dismisses the agencies that worked for the company it bought. In some cases, however, the acquiring company keeps some or all of the agencies it inherits from the company it is taking over. And in some instances, the acquiring company will switch agencies and move to the agencies that worked for the company it acquired. That is what happened when AT&amp;T bought BellSouth and took control of Cingular. Cingular’s creative agency was BBDO and AT&amp;T’s was an agency in Austin, Tex., GSD&amp;M, which is also owned by Omnicom. AT&amp;T decided to keep BBDO to create ads for the AT&amp;T wireless business and soon after named BBDO as its lead agency for all consumer products, replacing GSD&amp;M.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/technology/22regulate.html?ref=atandt">Sharp Scrutiny for Merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile<date>Published: March 21, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Mega-mergers may be celebrated on Wall Street on the theory that bigger is better. But the proposed merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile is likely to face intense scrutiny by regulators, lawmakers and consumer advocates.The review of the merger, one of the largest deals since the 2008 financial crisis, will also be a test for the White House. During his campaign, President Obama criticized the Bush administration’s record on antitrust review, and promised to increase scrutiny of merger proposals. Some analysts say it is too early to see if the merger will pass muster. Part of the difficulty stems from the fact that the two primary agencies that will oversee any merger — the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department’s antitrust division — look at it with different goals in mind. The Justice Department will chiefly examine whether competition among wireless mobile phone providers would remain sufficient after a merger. The department gave some hint to its thinking when it told the F.C.C. last year that the agency needed to use its “policy levers” to encourage more competition among wireless companies, particularly in wireless broadband access. The F.C.C., on the other hand, has a goal of protecting the public interest in allocating use of the public airwaves, which it does in part by promoting competition. For example, one objective involves pushing the big wireless companies to allow smaller competitors to use their networks for data roaming services. Such policy initiatives give the F.C.C. more flexibility to consider conditions that it could apply to a merger to make it more palatable. “Normally, competition and the public interest go hand in hand,” said Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a nonprofit agency that generally argues for more competition. But federal courts have recently sided with regulatory agencies instead of antitrust enforcers when conflicts occur, something that perhaps will give the F.C.C. the advantage in setting the conditions under which to approve a merger. Congress, too, is likely to play a part in scrutinizing the proposed merger. Several Congressional committees have already announced plans to review the deal. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said it was “absolutely essential” for both the Justice Department and the F.C.C. to “leave no stone unturned in determining what the impact of this combination is on the American people.” Most recently, lawmakers and the White House faced stiff opposition from advocacy groups over the recent merger of Comcast and NBC Universal. That deal was approved by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. with several conditions that subject the expanded company to additional oversight, but many consumer groups and liberal advocacy organizations were unsatisfied with those terms. “I’m not a huge fan of weighing down a merger with a dozen or more conditions,” said Gigi B. Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group that sharply criticized the proposed merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. “As a regulator, you have to ask yourself how a merger could be in the public interest if you have to do all those things to it to get it done.” AT&amp;T is already pre-empting any concerns from lawmakers. Its publicity materials announcing the merger (including a dedicated Web site, mobilizeeverything.com), pulled language directly from the president’s State of the Union Message with references to providing wireless high-speed Internet to nearly all Americans in the next five years. And to help Senator Rockefeller with his deliberations, AT&amp;T prominently displayed in its online materials a map of how the merger would expand service in West Virginia. AT&amp;T contends that the wireless phone market is highly competitive, with 18 of the 20 largest United States markets each having five or more wireless competitors. That may help AT&amp;T, as the Justice Department has traditionally looked at local competition when considering whether a proposed merger will substantially reduce consumer options, said Michael L. Weiner, a partner and co-chairman of the antitrust practice at Dechert, an international law firm. But national competition also plays an important role in the wireless market. Many mobile phone customers base their buying decisions on whether they will have to pay expensive roaming charges when they travel out of their home area. And after the merger, AT&amp;T and Verizon will between them control nearly 80 percent of the wireless market, with the third-largest competitor, Sprint, lagging far behind. When AT&amp;T Wireless merged with Cingular in 2004, it emphasized the national benefits of the joined companies, Mr. Weiner said. Now, it is making the opposite argument. “We’re very confident that we can achieve a successful regulatory review,” Wayne Watts, a senior executive vice president and general counsel at AT&amp;T, said Monday. “The facts show significant, unique public interest benefits from this transaction.” AT&amp;T also said that it expected to discuss some divestitures with regulators to get approval for the deal. Most likely, those would take the form of the company giving up some wireless airwaves in certain cities where the merger would leave too few competitors. The F.C.C. could use its leverage over the parties in discussing those possible conditions, under the theory that a company trying to get approval for a merger is unlikely to strongly oppose its chief regulator’s policy goals. For example, the agency has been trying to get the large wireless companies to allow customers of other providers to use their networks for data roaming, much as they allow for roaming for voice services. The big providers have been reluctant to do so, because data services use much more bandwidth and, as AT&amp;T customers with iPhones know, that can greatly slow a network. The F.C.C. also has voiced its desire to expand its policy of net neutrality, which requires that Internet service providers not slow or block specific content, to apply to wireless broadband services as well as to wired services. Though the F.C.C.’s position on net neutrality for wired Internet service was opposed by many telecommunications companies, AT&amp;T supported it. This month, amid its talks with T-Mobile, AT&amp;T’s chief lobbyist, James W. Cicconi, testified to the company’s support of the F.C.C. policy before a hostile House subcommittee.WASHINGTON — Mega-mergers may be celebrated on Wall Street on the theory that bigger is better.

AT&amp;T, the great Ma Bell, was broken up in 1984, the result of a federal antitrust suit. Now, the telecommunications giant is once again inciting worry that competition and consumers will suffer from its deal to buy T-Mobile for $39 billion. Ma Bell — which presided over a nationwide network of local telephone operators — officially began its new life on January 1, 1984. AT&amp;T, at that point, included the long-distance business, equipment manufacturing and Bell Laboratories. Then there were local operators, known as the Baby Bells: Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell and U.S. West. The breakup was uncharted territory, as The New York Times reported back then. Despite great promises on the one hand and forecasts of doom on the other, the truth is that no one really knows how the divestiture will turn out in the long run. Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, was trying to help the deaf. Instead, he invented a device that shifted the world from written communications to spoken communications, shutting the deaf out even more from the events around them. The effects of the breakup of AT&amp;T might be just as unpredictable, and just as dramatic. Some thought the move could spur innovation and competition. The telephone network has served to bind the nation together. It is vital for the nation’s defense. And it is increasingly becoming vital for industry of all types as the nation enters an age when the movement of information, from person to person or computer to computer, is as crucial as the movement of goods. The telephone system is, in effect, the highway system of the Information Age, and its health affects the competitiveness of all American industry. If the telephone breakup spurs innovation, it could help all industries. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Interestingly, Southwestern Bell — later renamed SBC Communications — formed the basis for the AT&amp;T that exists today, not AT&amp;T proper. Following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, SBC moved to acquire a number of rival Baby Bells and other local operators. It bought Pacific Telesis in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications the next year and Ameritech in 1999. Six years later, SBC swallowed its former parent, AT&amp;T, which The New York Times in 2005 said had been “undone by cheaper Internet technology, growth in a cellphone industry where it has no role, and regulatory changes that squeezed it out of the local phone market. ” Out of the acquisition was born the new AT&amp;T. The AT&amp;T brand and operations are likely to survive inside SBC, which has its roots in the Southwest. But it will disappear as an independent company that for generations provided reliable phone service to the masses and steady returns to shareholders, and at its height employed more than one million workers. In expanding nationally, SBC hopes to create a company that largely resembles but does not equal the monopoly popularly known as Ma Bell that was broken up in 1984. The acquisition would vault SBC past Verizon Communications, which itself became the nation’s biggest telecommunications company when Bell Atlantic bought GTE in 2000. Just a year later, AT&amp;T scooped up another former Baby Bell, BellSouth, for around $83 billion — a deal that gave it full control of Cingular Wireless. The combined company, according to The New York Times, had roughly 58 million cellphone customers, raising concerns once again about AT&amp;T’s dominance. Many advocates and policy makers have worried that with the dominance that cable and phone companies exercise over the broadband business, they could control, restrict or impede what customers can do with their connections. That fear has been stoked by telecommunications executives who have said they would like to charge content providers like Google extra for the smooth and speedy delivery of services like TV shows over broadband connections. After the merger with BellSouth, Cingular — which had acquired AT&amp;T’s wireless unit a few years before — was eventually renamed AT&amp;T, in what The New York Times labeled “one of the biggest rebranding campaigns in marketing history.” AT&amp;T executives are hoping a single brand name will help persuade customers that the company is a one-stop shop for all kinds of communications and entertainment services, including long-distance and local phone service, wireless, television and high-speed Internet. Now, it’s back to the future, as AT&amp;T moves to acquire T-Mobile. AT&amp;T is poised to become the largest cellular carrier in the country. Politicians and consumer advocates fear a more powerful AT&amp;T will lead to higher pricing and fewer choices. And federal antitrust officials are readying themselves for a fierce battle.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/the-regulatory-risk-in-the-att-deal/?ref=atandt">The Regulatory Risk in the AT&amp;T Deal<date>March 21, 2011, 12:22 pm</date><text>DealBook’s Coverage of AT&amp;T-T-Mobile Deal Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T’s chief executive. AT&amp;T’s purchase of T-Mobile from Deutsche Telecom is risky business. AT&amp;T is buying T-Mobile for $39 billion. The deal will allow AT&amp;T to expand its spectrum. AT&amp;T is also contending that the synergies and cost savings on the deal will be about $40 billion. This is a huge figure; an amount is greater than the deal price itself, and is no doubt why AT&amp;T is undertaking this venture. This is a risky deal because of the regulatory risk. AT&amp;T will need to obtain clearance from the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department to acquire T-Mobile. The Justice Department needs to provide its blessing from an antitrust perspective, and this will likely be the crucial area of contention over the deal. If you go to AT&amp;T’s Web site you can see that AT&amp;T is well prepared for this fight. There is a detailed presentation on why the market will stay competitive, with self-serving title: “The U.S, wireless market is fiercely competitive and will remain so.’” AT&amp;T is arguing that the market should be assessed on a locality basis. In this light, 18 of 20 markets have at least five wireless carriers right now. This is helpful to AT&amp;T, but the Justice Department may assess the market on a more national basis. If it does so, then it would be concerned that this deal would bring the number of national wireless carriers to three from four. The success of this deal lies in how successful AT&amp;T is in persuading antitrust regulators to adopt its view of the world. Part of this game is for AT&amp;T to show that the deal is a net gain for consumers. And AT&amp;T is arguing that the deal will produce efficiency gains – providing AT&amp;T’s 4G LTE spectrum network to a wider array of customers. Again AT&amp;T is well prepared and has a presentation on why this deal is a solution to the coming spectrum exhaustion. The deal is expected to take at least 12 months to obtain regulatory approval. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook's Coverage of AT&amp;T-T-Mobile Deal DealBook: Big Mergers and Antitrust Concerns The risk of antitrust clearance was no doubt the most heated topic in the parties’ negotiations. The risk I refer to here is the question of who will bear the risk of antitrust failure. In the case of antitrust risk, deal makers allocate this risk in two ways. First, there is often a reverse termination fee that is payable by the buyer to the seller if the deal does not close because of regulatory reasons. If there is a failure to obtain antitrust clearance, AT&amp;T will be required to pay Deutsche Telekom a hefty $3 billion. According to AT&amp;T, in such a circumstance AT&amp;T must also “transfer to T-Mobile certain AWS spectrum that is not needed by AT&amp;T for its initial LTE roll out, and provide a roaming agreement to T-Mobile on terms favorable to both parties.” The agreement for the deal has not been filed so we don’t know the exact circumstances of when the fee is payable, but the term sheet released by AT&amp;T says that the fee is payable if there is not regulatory clearance “satisfactory to AT&amp;T.” So this fee and the related transactions can be viewed as the price at which AT&amp;T is willing to complete the transaction. If the Justice Department demands that AT&amp;T take divestitures and other actions that would cost AT&amp;T more than $3 billion plus the value of these other transactions AT&amp;T may have the option, and decide to, walk. The size of this fee is a vote of confidence by AT&amp;T in the value of the deal. In cases with antitrust risk deal makers also often pre-specify in the acquisition agreement the amount of divestitures a buyer will be required to make to please the antitrust and other regulatory authorities. In some cases, this clause will take the form of a “hell or high water clause” requiring a bidder to make any divestitures and take all other steps necessary to satisfy the regulatory authorities and close the deal. According to people close to AT&amp;T, there is a rather complicated mechanism for required divestitures in the agreement limited to a specific dollar amounts. So AT&amp;T will be required to offer up certain amounts and kinds of divestitures to get the deal through. The amount of these divestitures will also be added to the price at which AT&amp;T is willing to walk. In addition to antitrust risk there is also general deal risk that the parties allocated. AT&amp;T is borrowing $20 billion from JPMorgan Chase to finance this deal in a one-year bridge loan. JPMorgan has provided a commitment letter for this financing that expires in 18 months. And again, according to the people close to AT&amp;T, there is no financing out in the agreement. So if this deal clears its regulatory hurdles AT&amp;T will be required to complete the transaction whether or not JPMorgan lives up to its commitment letter. In other words, the financing risk on this transaction is on AT&amp;T and JPMorgan. This is yet another sign that the credit markets have recovered from the financial crisis and that buyers and banks are more confident. JPMorgan is extending a loan and taking the risk that thing go bad in the next year. AT&amp;T, meanwhile, is betting that JPMorgan will stand by this commitment a year from now. Back in the financial crisis this type of stance got everyone into trouble, but with the passage of time people are growing more comfortable with this risk. The T-Mobile sale is a private transaction, and so in one area the risk is lower. In the public company context, there would be a fiduciary out in the agreement, which would allow T-Mobile to accept a higher bid. However, because this is a private deal there will not be any such out. In fact, because this is a private deal, the agreement will look much different than one you see for public deals. There will likely be indemnification given by Deutsche Telecom to AT&amp;T for issues related to the deal and a purchase price adjustment. Up to $14 billion of the purchase price is payable in shares. During this period the share price of AT&amp;T will fluctuate. To deal with this share price risk, the parties have negotiated a symmetrical collar of 7.5 percent of the deal value on both sides. In other words, AT&amp;T will issue up to $14 billion worth of shares, with the number of shares issued fluctuating within the collar depending upon the value of AT&amp;T stock. For example, if the stock goes down a $1 a share AT&amp;T will issue more shares to make up the difference up until the value of the collar. At that point AT&amp;T will issue no more shares and Deutsche Telekom will bear the risk of a continuing downturn in AT&amp;T stock. On the upside, the risk is reversed and above the collar Deutsche Telekom will capture this value. But AT&amp;T can limit this upside by deciding to pay up to an additional $4.2 billion in cash in substitute for stock. At the end, this gigantic deal is a nice illustration of how deal-making is often just an allocation of risk. Steven M.

On Monday afternoon, shares of Sprint — the nation’s third-largest cellular carrier — were down 16.5 percent, to $4.22. Their concerns are understandable. If the AT&amp;T deal is successful, the combined company would have 129.2 million customers. Verizon has 95.5 million. And Sprint trails significantly, with 49.9 million. Meanwhile, its financial situation looks precarious. The company’s loss increased to $3.5 billion last year, with revenue falling modestly. The AT&amp;T has deal has only made Sprint’s future more uncertain. Sprint itself had been pursuing T-Mobile. But the talks got bogged down over issues of price and technology. T-Mobile and Sprint operate on different standards. Sprint uses CDMA, while T-Mobile operates on GSM — the same as AT&amp;T. With speculation of such a tie-up heating up, AT&amp;T moved quickly to hash out a deal with Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s parent.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/jpmorgan-the-lender-behind-the-t-mobile-deal/?ref=atandt">JPMorgan, the Lender Behind the T-Mobile Deal<date>March 21, 2011, 3:15 pm</date><text>J.B. Reed/Bloomberg News Behind the scenes of AT&amp;T’s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile, a Wall Street giant left its mark on one of the biggest deals to emerge since the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase not only advised AT&amp;T on the deal, alongside Evercore Partners and Greenhill &amp; Company — it also agreed to finance part of the $25 billion cash portion of the offer. The bank offered a $20 billion one-year bridge loan in support of AT&amp;T’s effort to acquire T-Mobile, thus creating the largest wireless carrier in the nation, according to a regulatory filing. JPMorgan gave the telecom giant an 18-month commitment on the unsecured loan. Although the companies did not disclose the costs of the loan, people briefed on the matter said the terms were in line with other investment-grade financings. The loan, a giant commitment by any standard, has already wiggled its way into the financing record books. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The $20 billion commitment ranks as the No. 2 bridge loan offered worldwide since 2000, second only to Pfizer’s $22.5 billion financing obtained through the bond market in 2009, according to Thomson Reuters. It is also believed to be the biggest merger-related loan since the $45 billion that JPMorgan helped arrange in 2010 for BHP Billiton’s failed takeover of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The loan broke records at JPMorgan, too. It is the largest single loan ever originated by the bank, the latest sign that the banking industry is regaining its swagger in the aftermath of the crisis. “It’s a good sign for the entire industry,” said Erik Oja, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor’s, adding that such an enormous loan would not have been possible until recently. It comes as no surprise that AT&amp;T would turn to JPMorgan for the loan. The firm is AT&amp;T’s longtime lender. Mr. Oja also noted that JPMorgan has been recently aiming to step up its lending. “They are looking to get more aggressive,” he said. The loan is a “huge move” to show competitors “that they mean business.” AT&amp;T quietly approached JPMorgan for the financing this year and locked down the bridge loan within days, according to people briefed on the matter. Andy O’Brien, JPMorgan’s co-head of syndicated leveraged finance, and Tom Cassin, a managing director at the firm, helped arrange the financing arrangement. While JPMorgan is the sole originator for the loan, it plans to syndicate the debt out in due course, according to the people familiar with the loan. AT&amp;T’s bid for T-Mobile also cements JPMorgan’s standing as the top-ranked adviser on deals worldwide. Even before the AT&amp;T deal was announced on Sunday, JPMorgan had advised on $170.1 billion worth of transactions in 2011, according to Dealogic. “JPMorgan has emerged as a definite winner in a number of situations, and it sort of builds on itself,” said Jim Sinegal, an analyst with the research firm Morningstar. “Reputation matters a lot,” he said, adding, “It’s a good position for JPMorgan to be in.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4D6123AF932A15750C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Makes Deal To Buy T-Mobile For $39 Billion<date>Published: March 21, 2011</date><text>12:16 a.m. | Updated AT&amp;T announced on Sunday that it had agreed to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion, in a deal that would create the largest carrier in the nation and promised to reshape the industry. The transaction - one of the largest since the onset of the financial crisis - is expected to start a fierce battle in Washington as regulators scrutinize the impact of the deal on competition and consumers. The deal would leave just three major cellular companies in the country: AT&amp;T, Verizon and the much smaller Sprint Nextel. Some critics denounced the merger within hours of its announcement, saying it would most likely lead to higher prices. T-Mobile had offered some of the lowest rates in the country, keeping pressure on competitors. While AT&amp;T is expected to honor current contracts, T-Mobile customers may have to pay higher rates once those contracts expire. Still, AT&amp;T pointed on Sunday to a recent report from the federal Government Accountability Office that said cellular subscription costs fell 50 percent from 1999 and 2009, a period in which the industry has consolidated. ''Consumers have borne the brunt of the increasingly concentrated market for mobile phone service,'' Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumers rights, said in a statement. ''The explosion of cellphone usage - especially smartphones - makes competition in this market more important than ever as a check on prices, consumer choice and service.'' AT&amp;T customers, though, could benefit in one notable area: service. Both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile operate on the same technology, known as GSM, so the combination should provide better coverage. That has been a sore point for AT&amp;T, which has been ridiculed over dropped calls and slow data services, especially on Apple's iPhone. ''The carriers' network technology fits nicely together so AT&amp;T could redeploy some of T-Mobile's spectrum in short order, helping relieve some of the pressures on its network,'' said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. The acquisition would give AT&amp;T additional leverage against its main rival, Verizon. The newly combined company - bringing together AT&amp;T's 95.5 million wireless subscribers with T-Mobile's 33.7 million customers - would account for roughly 42 percent of all wireless subscribers in the United States. Verizon has around 31 percent, said Charles Golvin, a telecom analyst at Forrester Research. T-Mobile customers would have the option to buy an iPhone, helping AT&amp;T combat the migration of the popular device to Verizon. The deal would also provide significant cost savings, roughly $3 billion a year for the new company. Those savings, however, could have a huge effect on both the local and national economy, from real estate to media. The combined company is expected to close hundreds of retail outlets in areas where they overlap, as well as eliminate overlapping back office, technical and call center staff. It may also slash advertising spending. Last year, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile spent $2.7 billion combined on advertising, according to Kantar Media. ''From AT&amp;T's perspective, this is a huge win,'' said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. ''It's about being No. 1 and having economy of scale.'' Scale will be critical as AT&amp;T continues its aggressive rollout of the next generation wireless network, known as 4G. The carrier has been slower than rivals to deploy the 4G technology, LTE, than competitors. T-Mobile does not have a 4G technology in place. Meanwhile, Verizon has already started to sell LTE-enabled devices. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Verizon announced at least a dozen new smartphones and tablet computers that will be compatible with the technology. Deutsche Telekom had been weighing options for T-Mobile for more than a year. It had considered an initial public offering for the company, but shelved the plans. More recently, Deutsche Telekom had held talks about selling the unit to Sprint.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/t-mobile-sale-may-close-tough-chapter-for-deutsche-telekom/?ref=atandt">T-Mobile Sale May Close Tough Chapter for Deutsche Telekom<date>March 21, 2011, 8:21 am</date><text>Deutsche Telekom, via Associated Press John Stanton, left, the chairman of VoiceStream Wireless, and Ron Sommer, then the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, in 2001 after federal authorities approved a merger of the two carriers. In agreeing to sell its T-Mobile USA unit to AT&amp;T for $39 billion, Deutsche Telekom will finally shed a subsidiary that has caused the German telecommunications giant considerable difficulty. Investors cheered the news, sending shares of Deutsche Telekom up more than 13 percent on Monday. The rise benefits the Blackstone Group and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Fund, which are among the largest owners of Deutsche Telekom. Once known as VoiceStream Wireless, T-Mobile has proved to be a drag on its parent. The company cost Deutsche Telekom billions of dollars shortly after its acquisition, and it proved unable to grow its way out of a distant fourth place in America’s cellphone service rankings. But more than a decade ago, VoiceStream symbolized Deutsche Telekom’s hope of cracking the burgeoning American cellphone market. Befitting a deal of the dot-com era, Deutsche Telekom paid an enormous amount, $50.7 billion, in stock and cash for a business that as of July 2000 hadn’t generated a profit. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: AT&amp;T to Buy T-Mobile USA for $39 Billion DealBook: Live from the AT&amp;T news conference In some ways, the deal was a consolation prize for Deutsche Telekom, which had also considered buying the likes of Qwest Communications International to serve as its American beachhead. When the deal was made, VoiceStream had about 2.3 million subscribers compared with 25.9 million for Verizon Wireless, the market leader at the time. (That August, VoiceStream agreed to buy a Southeast-focused carrier, Powertel, for about $7.2 billion in stock.) Congress was uneasy with the prospects of a German company taking over an American counterpart, and legislators at one point sought to block the deal. In hindsight, perhaps that would have been a good thing. By 2002, Deutsche Telekom, based in Bonn, had written some $18 billion off the value of VoiceStream. The accounting charge contributed heavily to a $24.7 billion loss at the German company for the first nine months of 2002. By then, Deutsche Telekom held the division on its books at about $16 billion. Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive at the time, Kai-Uwe Ricke, acknowledged that the parent company was weighing combining the subsidiary with another American carrier to bolster its market share. Renamed T-Mobile USA, Deutsche Telekom’s American arm eventually provided mostly acceptable, though not stellar, earnings. Amid the frenzy of mergers that again gripped the wireless industry in the middle of the decade — think Sprint-Nextel and the serial pile-up of deals that gave rise to the modern AT&amp;T — Deutsche Telekom again considered putting the unit on the block. Though once more, it passed on potential sales opportunities. T-Mobile USA made occasional acquisitions of its own, notably the $1.6 billion purchase of the Southern carrier Suncom in 2007. Over all, however, the unit’s main problem was an inability to compete against more aggressive competitors like AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless. T-Mobile eventually sought to distinguish itself as a lower-cost alternative to the major players, and built a successful prepaid business. It also introduced a few important products like the Sidekick phone and the G1, the first Android smartphone. But not even its reputation for sterling customer service could compensate for its much smaller coverage area and less robust phone lineup. Of the four major American carriers, T-Mobile often suffered the highest rate of customer defections, known within the industry as churn. For the fourth quarter last year, the unit reported a 3.6 percent churn, up both from the previous quarter and from the same period a year earlier. Most analysts have since valued T-Mobile at a range between $17 billion and $25 billion. Ultimately, T-Mobile was “not a good investment,” one fund manager told Bloomberg News earlier this month, adding: “Deutsche Telekom had been a tepid player at best, and their dedication to the market was never all that strong.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/big-mergers-often-pose-antitrust-concerns/?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T Deal Joins a History of Antitrust Fights<date>March 21, 2011, 12:37 pm</date><text>6:38 p.m. | Updated AT&amp;T’s deal to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion is shaping up to be a heated regulatory battle. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Federal trade and communications regulators, along with the Justice Department, must bless the deal, which would create the nation’s largest cellular carrier. Lawmakers are already denouncing the deal, saying it will reduce competition in an already consolidated industry. The deal is the latest in a long line of mega-mergers to raise antitrust concerns. Here’s a look at other prominent transactions that set off controversy in Washington. Comcast-NBC Universal DEAL: Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, agreed to acquire 51 percent of NBC Universal for about $13.75 billion from General Electric in December 2009, capping nearly nine months of negotiations. OBSTACLES: Democrats on Capitol Hill initially objected, contending the deal would constrain programming choices for consumers and result in higher cable-TV subscription prices. OUTCOME: It took more than a year, but the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department finally agreed to the merger in January. The approval came with several conditions, including measures to curb Comcast’s control of the online video marketplace. AOL-Time Warner DEAL: America Online agreed in January 2000 to buy Time Warner for $165 billion, the biggest merger in history. OBSTACLES: The merger involved an area largely unfamiliar to regulators, the Internet. OUTCOME: The deal closed in January 2001, with the F.C.C. requiring AOL to open up its instant messaging services to make them more compatible with rivals’. The deal proved to be ill-fated. The combined company faced turf battles, an accounting scandal, plummeting stock price and shareholder lawsuits, ultimately forcing the businesses into a bitter divorce. WorldCom-MCI DEAL: MCI Communications, at the time the nation’s second-largest long-distance telephone company, agreed in November 1997 to sell itself to WorldCom for about $36.5 billion in cash and stock. OBSTACLES: Consumer groups rallied against the deal, complaining it would send phone service prices through the roof. OUTCOME: In the summer of 1998, the Justice Department and European regulators signed off on the deal, after MCI agreed to sell its Internet business. Following an accounting scandal, WorldCom filed what was then the largest bankruptcy in United States history. The company’s chief executive was later convicted of fraud. WorldCom-Sprint DEAL: Following the acquisition of MCI, WorldCom set it sights on the Sprint Corporation in 1999, offering more than $100 billion for the long-distance company. OBSTACLES: Regulators were skeptical of the deal from the start, worried it would further stifle competition on the heels of the MCI takeover. OUTCOME: WorldCom and Sprint abandoned their merger in July 2000. AT&amp;T-BellSouth DEAL: AT&amp;T’s bid for T-Mobile is hardly its first major move. In March 2006, the telecom giant agreed to buy the BellSouth Corporation for around $83 billion. OBSTACLES: While the Justice Department cleared the way for the merger to advance, the F.C.C. was caught up in an internal debate over whether one of its members was allowed to vote on the deal. Robert M. McDowell, an F.C.C. commissioner — a former lobbyist for the telecommunications industry — abstained, leaving the commission deadlocked. OUTCOME: The agency approved the deal in late 2006 without Mr. McDowell’s vote, after the companies agreed to several concessions over network neutrality.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/how-the-iphone-led-to-the-sale-of-t-mobile-usa/?ref=atandt">How the iPhone Led to the Sale of T-Mobile USA<date>March 21, 2011, 1:29 pm</date><text>Ramin Talaie/Bloomberg News After the iPhone went on sale, T-Mobile USA began to lose customers. BERLIN — Deutsche Telekom’s announcement over the weekend to sell its American wireless unit, T-Mobile USA, to AT&amp;T for $39 billion ended a decade-long foray into the American market that was undermined, in part, by one big event: the advent of the iPhone. Until Apple introduced its highly popular touchscreen device in 2007, which went on to become the world’s leading smartphone, Deutsche Telekom had been generating decent sales from its American operation, with growth in some years surpassing that achieved in Germany. But after the iPhone went on sale, sold exclusively at first by AT&amp;T in the United States, T-Mobile USA began to lose its most lucrative customers, those on fixed monthly plans, who defected to its larger American rivals — AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, which began selling the iPhone in February. The percentage of T-Mobile USA’s contract customers fell to 78.3 percent in 2010 from 85 percent in 2006, according to the company’s annual reports. During 2010 alone, T-Mobile USA said it lost 390,000 contract customers to rivals. “The iPhone effect cannot be underestimated in this decision,” said Theo Kitz, an analyst at Merck Finck, a private bank in Munich. “Without being able to sell the iPhone, T-Mobile was in an unsustainable position and T-Mobile USA became a problem child.” The sale of the American unit by Deutsche Telekom, which is based in Bonn, was welcomed by investors, and the company’s stock was up more than 12 percent in late trading Monday in Frankfurt. Under terms of the deal, Deutsche Telekom will receive $25 billion in cash from AT&amp;T and $14 billion in stock, representing an 8 percent stake in the AT&amp;T. If the deal clears an antitrust review, AT&amp;T would become the top wireless carrier in the United States. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The Deutsche Telekom chief executive, René Obermann, said the sale of T-Mobile USA was the best outcome for the company, which last year began looking for a partner for the unit, ranked No.4, behind Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T and Sprint. Mr. Obermann said Deutsche Telekom would use proceeds from the sale to modernize its European networks, which extend from Germany to Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, the Balkan peninsula and Greece. “We found the best solution for our company, our customers and our shareholders,” Mr. Obermann said in a statement. “Our position in Europe will be strengthened.” The sale of the unit would reduce Deutsche Telekom to a purely European operator. Its largest competitors on the Continent, Vodafone, France Télécom and Telefónica, all have extensive wireless businesses outside of Europe. “T-Mobile USA has always been a challenging business for Deutsche Telekom, but at the same time one that has offered growth potential to offset a stagnating western European business,” said Thomas Wehmeier, an analyst at Informa in London. “Without T-Mobile USA, Deutsche Telekom becomes a pure European play.” The American market has always been challenging for European operators. Vodafone, the British mobile operator that has a 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, has not received a dividend from its venture in the United States since 2005. Telefónica, the Spanish operator that is the largest in Latin America, has never made a bid for the American market, despite its growing Spanish-speaking population. Through its stake in AT&amp;T, which would make Deutsche Telekom the largest single shareholder in the operator, the German company will “continue to share in the fast-growing U.S. mobile business,” Mr. Obermann said. Deutsche Telekom entered the American mobile market in May 2001, when it completed its $50.7 billion acquisition of VoiceStream, a wireless operator in Seattle whose network ran on the global system for mobile communications, or GSM, the same technology as used by Deutsche Telekom and most other European operators. For most of the past decade, the market in the United States grew faster than Deutsche Telekom’s own home market in Germany, where three aggressive competitors — Vodafone; O2, a unit of Telefónica; and E-Plus, a unit of the Dutch operator KPN — compete for mobile customers. In some years, the unit was Deutsche Telekom’s star performer. In 2006, revenue at T-Mobile USA rose 15.5 percent from 2005, helping offset a 5 percent decline in the German market. The business helped finance Deutsche Telekom’s extensive severance costs to streamline German payrolls and adapt to the company’s eroding domestic landline business. But the positive effect from T-Mobile USA began to diminish as the subsidiary started losing contract customers after the iPhone’s introduction, which came at a time when the German company had to consider spending billions of euros to upgrade its American network grid to the latest standard, Long Term Evolution, or LTE. At the end of 2010, T-Mobile USA had the highest monthly “churn” rate of departing customers, 3.2 percent, more than double the 1.3 percent rate of Verizon and AT&amp;T, according to figures from Merrill Lynch. The German company was earning 21 percent of its revenue in the United States from data services, compared with 30 percent at Verizon. Until recently, the German operator resisted selling bulk access to its American network to virtual mobile network operators, which limited its ability to generate additional revenue. “Deutsche Telekom had the wrong strategy in the U.S. market,” said John Strand, an analyst in Copenhagen who tracks virtual network operators. “It acted like it was a copy of T-Mobile Germany, the market leader, but that wasn’t the case. I know of at least 30 virtual network operators which were rebuffed by T-Mobile USA. It was a mistake.” In the end, Deutsche Telekom decided the looming costs of its network upgrades in the United States and additional purchases of broadcast spectrum were too risky given the decline in contract customers, Mr. Kitz, the Merck Finck analyst, said. After factoring in all of the costs and profit generated by T-Mobile USA over the course of its engagement, Deutsche Telekom will be left with a profit of about €500 million, or $710 million, from its unit, Mr. Kitz estimated. He said he expected the German operator to inject part of the money into its Greek operator, OTE, which is struggling amid the country’s economic crisis. “The Greek business is not going well,” Mr. Kitz said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/atts-full-cost-for-getting-t-mobile/?ref=atandt">AT&amp;T's Full Cost for Getting T-Mobile<date>March 21, 2011, 9:04 pm</date><text>Mark Dye/Newscast, via Associated PressRené Obermann, left, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, which has agreed to sell T-Mobile, and Randall L. Stephenson, chief executive of AT&amp;T, which has agreed to buy the company. “We have never seen a deal with more regulatory risk be attempted in the U.S.” That was the initial assessment of AT&amp;T’s $39 billion agreement to acquire T-Mobile, from Jonathan Chaplin, one of the most thoughtful telecommunications analysts on Wall Street. “It is unlikely that AT&amp;T would attempt a deal that they knew would fail,” he said. “However, we can’t see how they would get this through without massive divestitures and concessions.” In Washington, though, the question is whether the deal should get through at all. And if it is approved, how much will AT&amp;T ultimately have to give up? The deal is a classic duopoly case study: if AT&amp;T and T-Mobile combined, it would set up a match-up like Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi, with AT&amp;T pitted against Verizon. The other rivals become almost irrelevant. AT&amp;T and Verizon would control roughly 80 percent of the national market. The next biggest is not that big at all: Sprint is just cracking double digits, at about 12 percent. After that is the bottom tier — MetroPCS, Leap and the like — all in single digits, though their numbers have been growing. Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&amp;T, would say this is the wrong way to look at the marketplace. For the last 24 hours, he has been telling anyone who will listen that the Justice Department should and will judge the transaction on a local market-by-market basis. He says on a local level, his company is often competing against at least five players — and in some cities, like Detroit and Miami, T-Mobile is not even in the top tier. DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Technically, Mr. Stephenson is correct. The government will evaluate the deal on a market-by-market basis, and he does have multiple “competitors” in each market. But let’s be honest for a moment: MetroPCS and Leap, his supposed competitors, do not offer like-for-like products that can replace AT&amp;T’s offering. One of the reasons MetroPCS has been able to offer lower prices than AT&amp;T is that it does not offer true national service. (It would dispute this assessment because it uses roaming agreements and other companies’ networks — namely Verizon’s and Sprint’s — to extend its reach.) The iPhone? Forget about it. When you think about innovation in the cellular industry, whether it be technology, price plans or service, it has not come from the third-tier companies; instead, the third-tier companies have played copycat to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. The big question is whether an AT&amp;T-Verizon duopoly will create enough competition to further drive competition and keep prices low. “This is a significant horizontal consolidation by all the traditional measurements. This level of concentration, two-thirds of the time, has been rejected by the Department of Justice,” Reed E. Hundt, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said on a segment with me on CNBC on Monday. Michael J. Copps, an F.C.C. commissioner, said last year that the amount of concentration in the cellular industry should be considered “a bright caution light for this commission as we go about the business of advancing competition and consumer well-being in the broadband age.” “We are going to need an extra dose of vigilance going forward and use whatever policy levers we have available to ensure good outcomes for American consumers,” he said. On that score, in the short term at least, the facts may be on AT&amp;T’s side. A deal with T-Mobile should improve its service and coverage area, while allowing it to upgrade its systems with enough spectrum to keep up with the insatiable demand of consumers for more data and video over hand-held devices. Rick Kaplan, senior adviser to the F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, said on Monday that the industry was desperately in need of more spectrum. “The spectrum crunch is real,” he said. “We’re going to have to get more spectrum online for broadband.” AT&amp;T hopes to leverage that sentiment by arguing that without the deal, the company customer support efforts will be hobbled. The company is also playing the patriotic card by contending that the deal will “strengthen and expand critical infrastructure for our nation’s future” and will “help achieve the president’s goals for a high-speed, wirelessly connected America.” All of that may be true. And perhaps the government should approach deals in this context, but if so, it would be a complete shift in policy. So what will AT&amp;T have to give up to get the thumbs up? That’s the $3 billion question — the amount of money it would have to pay T-Mobile’s parent, Deutsche Telekom, if the deal were blocked. That huge breakup fee should provide a powerful incentive to compromise. But then the question becomes what “remedy” the government could come up with to ensure competitiveness and innovation. AT&amp;T would have to give up an awful lot of spectrum to ever create a true national competitor to it or Verizon. Lesser concessions could include commitments to make their networks open to competitors through roaming agreements and reseller agreements, allowing other carriers to sell service on AT&amp;T’s network under another brand. (That is what Verizon had to do in 2008.) Whatever the outcome, it is going to be a long, drawn-out battle.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/the-advisers-behind-the-att-deal/?ref=atandt">The Advisers Behind the AT&amp;T Deal<date>March 20, 2011, 5:07 pm</date><text>More than a few banks and law firms will be ringing up handsome fees for putting together AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA. Proceeds from the acquisition — the largest announced so far this year and one of the biggest since the end of the financial crisis — will be divvied up among a dozen financial and legal advisers. Particularly striking is the presence of two major boutique firms, Greenhill &amp; Company and Evercore Partners, as advisers to AT&amp;T. Then again, Evercore has long served as an adviser on the roughly $200 billion in mergers that led to the modern-day AT&amp;T. Others will benefit as well. JPMorgan Chase, an adviser to AT&amp;T, will cement its standing as the top-ranked adviser on deals worldwide as counted by Dealogic, with $170.1 billion worth of transactions as of Saturday. Morgan Stanley, the principal adviser to Deutsche Telekom, the owner of T-Mobile USA, is ranked third worldwide with $110.9 billion worth of deals, drawing closer to longtime rival Goldman Sachs. Credit Suisse, another Deutsche Telekom banker, will probably displace Bank of America Merrill Lynch as the fourth-ranked deal adviser globally, having racked up $101 billion worth of assignments to Merrill’s $108.5 billion as of Saturday. The AT&amp;T deal is also notable for who is missing: Goldman, which had been advising Sprint Nextel in its talks with Deutsche Telekom, people briefed on the matter previously told DealBook. Here’s the breakdown of the advisers: AT&amp;T: Banks Greenhill &amp; Company JPMorgan Chase Evercore Partners Law firms Sullivan &amp; Cromwell Arnold &amp; Porter Crowell &amp; Moring Deutsche Telekom: Banks Morgan Stanley Deutsche Bank Credit Suisse Law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton Wiley Rein</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/telecoms-active-deal-machine/?ref=atandt">Telecom's Active Deal Machine<date>March 20, 2011, 4:56 pm</date><text>With AT&amp;T moving to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, telecom companies are now the second most active deal-makers in the world. Counting AT&amp;T’s proposed bid, the industry’s merger and acquisition volume now tops $172 billion over the past year, surpassing the electric companies for the No. 2 spot. Oil and gas remains the most active industry for M.&amp;A., with nearly $266 billion of deals, according to Bloomberg data. Despite the strong industry M.&amp;A., AT&amp;T’s announcement represents the biggest telecom deal, by far. The next largest was in April 2010, when CenturyLink agreed to buy Qwest Communications for roughly $22 billion. The T-Mobile acquisition also represents AT&amp;T’s most ambitious move in awhile. In late December AT&amp;T agreed to buy some spectrum licenses from Qualcomm for roughly $1.9 billion. AT&amp;T’s last megamerger was back in 2006 when the company bought BellSouth for $83 billion. The T-Mobile transaction would be the second largest deal for AT&amp;T in the last decade. That assumes, of course, the deal gets the O.K. from regulators, who are likely to scrutinize it carefully. AT&amp;T expects this transaction to take a year to go through the approval process. On March 18, the Federal Communications Commission approved CenturyLink-Qwest tie-up, which was announced in April 2010.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/t-mobile-deal-leaves-sprints-future-unclear/?ref=atandt">T-Mobile Deal Leaves Sprint's Future Unclear<date>March 20, 2011, 10:09 pm</date><text>With AT&amp;T agreeing to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, the future of Sprint Nextel just got fuzzier. Over the past several months, Sprint had held its own talks with Deutsche Telekom, the owner of T-Mobile, over a potential deal, as part of an effort to gain sorely needed scale and wireless spectrum, according to people with knowledge of the talks, which were intended to be private. But Deutsche Telekom’s discussions with AT&amp;T moved more quickly this month, and the two reached a preliminary agreement last week, one of these people said. If the deal is approved, AT&amp;T would again leapfrog Verizon Wireless to become the country’s biggest cellphone service provider, and Sprint’s strategic options would become more limited. Sprint Nextel, the product of an ill-fated merger in 2005, risks being further eclipsed by Verizon and the new AT&amp;T, which together would boast 230.3 million customers in the United States. By contrast, Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kan., has just under 50 million customers. “That means three out of every four wireless subscriptions belongs to those two companies,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “That is going to be very challenging for Sprint.” Under its current chief executive, Dan Hesse, Sprint has managed to lower its customer defection rate, in large part through improving its customer service and its product lineup. But the company has struggled to translate that into a healthier financial picture: Its annual loss widened to about $3.5 billion last year, as revenue declined slightly. The idea behind combining Sprint and T-Mobile was to add much-needed scale. Both have competed against their larger rivals on price, cutting into revenue. Underpinning the interest for T-Mobile is concern by the major service providers about limited wireless spectrum. As more and more Americans adopt devices like the iPhone, Android smartphones and tablets like the iPad, cellphone carriers are urgently seeking to add more and more capacity to handle customers’ data use. But the talks were weighed down by several major issues, including Sprint’s and Deutsche Telekom’s differing valuations of T-Mobile. Another, more technical issue revolved around the two companies’ use of different cellphone technologies. Sprint currently uses a standard known as CDMA, which is limited mainly to the United States and a handful of other countries. T-Mobile relied on the more common GSM technology. In the race to set up the next generation of wireless networks, Sprint is also increasingly alone in its reliance on the WiMax standard. AT&amp;T and Verizon have both chosen an alternative called LTE. For its part, T-Mobile lacked the spectrum necessary to develop its own next-generation network, a major driver behind its search for a merger partner. With AT&amp;T now adding T-Mobile’s 33.7 million subscribers to its fold, hardware makers could lose interest in creating products for companies other than the biggest players. Sprint may find it difficult to add cutting-edge new handsets. A larger AT&amp;T could also strike better prices for the handsets it sells, which would allow it to expand its profit margins or reduce the prices on its products. Sprint is likely to be forced to compete more aggressively on price to differentiate itself and attract new subscribers. “This puts them into a much weaker No. 3 position,” Mr. Golvin said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/telecom-union-backs-t-mobile-deal/?ref=atandt">Telecom Union Backs T-Mobile Deal<date>March 20, 2011, 8:35 pm</date><text>8:53 p.m. | Updated Combining two companies with significant overlap usually leads to howls of protest by employees facing potential job cuts. But in the case of AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile, the two cellphone service providers have a somewhat unusual supporter: the Communications Workers of America. By securing the backing of a prominent union, one with more than 700,000 members, AT&amp;T appears to be shoring up important political backing as it prepares for tough regulatory scrutiny. In a press release issued on Sunday, the C.W.A. talked up the benefits of the merger, primarily its aim to expand next-generation wireless service to 95 percent of the country. The union has already focused on building out the nation’s broadband wireless network as an important driver of job growth, having rolled out an initiative called Speed Matters. “For more than a decade, the United States has continued to drop behind nearly every other developed economy on broadband speed and build out,” Larry Cohen, the C.W.A.’s president, said in a statement. “Today’s announcement of the acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&amp;T is a victory for broadband proponents in both the U.S. and Germany.” The C.W.A. will also have the chance to expand an ongoing effort to unionize T-Mobile USA workers. The group has already partnered with Germany’s ver.di union to create a new group, TU, to represent T-Mobile employees on both sides of the Atlantic. “Hundreds of TU members in the U.S. will welcome this news since of all the possible partners, AT&amp;T will mean better employment security and a management record of full neutrality toward union membership and a bargaining voice,” Mr. Cohen said in his statement. “For T-Mobile USA workers who want a voice in their workplace, this acquisition can provide a fresh start with T-Mobile management.” In some ways, the C.W.A.’s support of the deal comes as no surprise. The union generally enjoys a good working relationship with AT&amp;T, representing some 42,000 of the company’s wireless service employees. It also represents a fraction of Verizon Wireless workers. Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the C.W.A., told DealBook that AT&amp;T had already completed about 20 smaller deals, which led to the creation of jobs. Those transactions also offered workers the choice of union representation and collective bargaining rights. By contrast, C.W.A. has clashed with other wireless companies, arguing that they contract out much of their work. Among these is Sprint Nextel, which also sought a deal with T-Mobile. Still, there’s at least one prominent group that has come out against the deal: Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. “From a consumer’s perspective, it’s difficult to come up with any justification or benefits from letting AT&amp;T swallow up one of its few major competitors,” the group’s policy counsel, Parul P. Desai, said in a statement. She added, “We plan to work very closely with regulators and lawmakers to carefully scrutinize this deal and what it would mean to people’s pocketbooks.” Here’s the full statement from the C.W.A.’s Mr. Cohen: For more than a decade, the United States has continued to drop behind nearly every other developed economy on broadband speed and build out. The Federal Communications Commission sounded the alarm more than a year ago with its broadband report, and President Obama in his State of the Union address called for increased efforts to bring the U.S. back to global parity as a key stimulus for economic development. Today’s announcement of the acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&amp;T is a victory for broadband proponents in both the U.S. and Germany. For the U.S., it means that T-Mobile customers will get quick access to the AT&amp;T network, soon to include LTE or data speeds of at least 10 megabits down stream. More important, as part of the deal, AT&amp;T is committing to build out to nearly every part of the U.S. within six years. Both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile use GSM technology so there will be the immediate benefit of shared spectrum. Other reported deals involving T-Mobile would have joined incompatible networks; not only would that have forced a rebuild but would have required new phones for T- Mobile customers. In Germany, the cash deal will provide investment in parent Deutsche Telekom’s own fiber network, particularly important for D.T.’s principal owner, the German government. CWA and ver.di, the largest union in Germany, have partnered to support T-Mobile workers in the U.S., and the global union movement has been a strong supporter of this effort. CWA and ver.di formed a joint union – TU – that represents T-Mobile workers on both sides of the Atlantic. Hundreds of TU members in the U.S. will welcome this news since of all the possible partners, AT&amp;T will mean better employment security and a management record of full neutrality toward union membership and a bargaining voice. For T-Mobile USA workers who want a voice in their workplace, this acquisition can provide a fresh start with T-Mobile management. Some 42,000 ATT mobility employees are union represented. As with any merger or acquisition involving large entities, oversight issues will be raised. We ask all those involved to balance the inquiry with adequate weight for broadband speed and build out, and employment and workers rights.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/technology/personaltech/10askk.html?ref=atandt">Counting Monthly Text Messages<date>Published: March 9, 2011</date><text>  Q.

It argued that the documents should be withheld under an exemption to the law that applied to records that “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” The company’s strongest argument was that the statutory definition of the noun “person” specifically included corporations and other entities. It followed, the company said, that the adjective “personal” must also apply to corporations. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the court, was having none of that. “Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns,” he wrote, “but not always.” He gave examples. “The noun ‘crab’ refers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while the related adjective ‘crabbed’ can refer to handwriting that is ‘difficult to read,’ ” he wrote, quoting a dictionary. “ ‘Corny,’” he went on, “has little to do with ‘corn.’ ” Chief Justice Roberts had used similar examples at the argument of the case in January. “You have ‘craft’ and ‘crafty’,” he said. “Totally different. ‘Crafty’ doesn’t have much to do with ‘craft.’ ‘Squirrel,’ ‘squirrelly.’ Right?” “ ‘Pastor’ and ‘pastoral’,” he continued. “Same root, totally different.” Common usage cut against AT&amp;T’s argument as well, the chief justice wrote in Tuesday’s decision. “We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondence, personal influence or personal tragedy as referring to corporations and other artificial entities,” he wrote. “Responding to a request for information, an individual might say, ‘that’s personal’,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “A company spokeswoman, when asked for information about the company, would not. “In fact, we often use the word ‘personal’ to mean precisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a company’s view.” In addition to considering dictionary definitions for and the common usage of the word “personal” standing alone, Chief Justice Roberts said the word should also be considered in the context of the phrase “personal privacy.” Here, too, he said, “AT&amp;T’s effort to attribute a special legal meaning to the word ‘personal’ in this particular context is wholly unpersuasive.” “Two words together may assume a more particular meaning than those words in isolation,” he wrote, adding that “personal privacy” suggests “a kind of privacy evocative of human concerns.” The chief justice had examples here, too. “We understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resembling gold,” he wrote. “A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who is charming, lucky and talented. A golden opportunity is one not to be missed.” In January 2010, the court ruled in the Citizens United decision that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend money in candidate elections. But that decision involved a question of constitutional law, while Tuesday’s decision in AT&amp;T v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 09-1279, considered only the meaning of a statute. AT&amp;T had provided documents to the F.C.C. in connection with its investigation into claims of overcharges by the company in a program to provide equipment and services to schools. The documents were then sought by a trade association representing some of the company’s competitors. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, had ruled for the company, saying that “corporations, like human beings, face public embarrassment, harassment and stigma” because of their involvement in law enforcement investigations. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in Tuesday’s Supreme Court decision, having worked on it as United States solicitor general. The decision was otherwise comprehensively dismissive of AT&amp;T’s arguments, and Chief Justice Roberts could not resist a parting shot in ruling against the company “We trust that AT&amp;T will not take it personally,” he wrote. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: March 1, 2011 An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the title of John Roberts.

The messages may also contain information on weather and traffic in the selected area. The service, Ms. Lee said, ''allows brands to reach consumers when they are most receptive to the message and when they are in close proximity to take advantage of the offer.'' For one promotion beginning in mid-March, JetBlue will put a geo-fence around certain airports so that when members of their TrueBlue rewards program check in there using the JetBlue Go Places mobile application, they can earn points toward the program. S. C. Johnson will put a geo-fence around Target stores to promote and offer discounts on its brands. For H.P., the partnership offers an opportunity to understand what messages are most effective in leading the consumer to make a purchase, said Tariq Hassan, a marketing official at H.P. ''That's a pretty powerful opportunity,'' Mr. Hassan said. The cost for brands to use the service will depend on either the number of messages sent or whether the promotion was a one-time occurrence, like an event sponsorship, Ms. Lee said. AT&amp;T is in talks with other retailer outlets, movie theaters and restaurants to offer the service.

For Hewlett-Packard, the partnership offers an opportunity to understand what messages are most effective in leading the consumer to make a purchase, said Tariq Hassan, a marketing official at H.P. “That’s a pretty powerful opportunity,” Mr. Hassan said. The cost for brands to use the service will depend on either the number of messages sent or whether the promotion was a one-time occurrence, like an event sponsorship, Ms. Lee said. AT&amp;T is in talks with other retailer outlets, movie theaters and restaurants to offer the service. Last year, the North Face began using Placecast’s geo-fencing technology to reach shoppers in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston and send them promotions about things like the arrival of new products.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/technology/personaltech/17pogue.html?ref=atandt">Atrix 4G From Motorola, Uniting Phone and Laptop - David Pogue<date>Published: February 16, 2011</date><text>Does the redundancy of your gadgets ever bother you?You have a phone. A laptop. A desktop PC. A GPS thing. A TV. Maybe a tablet. Each contains the same stuff: a screen, a processor chip and some memory. You’re buying the same components over and over again — in duplicate, triplicate, quadruplicate — just so each device can perform identical functions in different situations. Well, that does bother Motorola. For several years now, it’s been hammering away at a central idea: since the modern app phone is essentially a computer, why can’t it become a brain that you slip into different docks? That was the idea behind the Bedside Dock (phone becomes touch-screen alarm clock) and the GPS Dock (attaches to your windshield) for certain Motorola phones. Now comes Motorola’s most compelling, ambitious and exciting idea of all: a phone that can become the brain for a full-blown laptop. The Motorola Atrix 4G ($200 with a two-year AT&amp;T contract) is a beautiful, loaded, screamingly fast Android phone. The companion laptop — sleek, light, superthin, black aluminum — has no processor, memory or storage of its own. Instead, you insert the phone into a slot behind the screen hinge. The phone becomes the laptop’s brains. That’s a powerful idea. It means, first of all, that you don’t have to sync anything. Everything lives on the phone; the laptop is simply a more convenient viewer. It also means that when you’re sitting on a plane or at your desk, you can work with a trackpad, full screen and traditional keyboard. And it means that your laptop is always online, thanks to the phone’s Internet connection. Finally, it means that you have to reverse your usual thinking about battery life. The laptop is basically a giant battery. With the phone inserted, you can happily work away for eight or 10 hours on a single charge. In fact, the laptop actually charges the phone while you work. Yes, that’s correct: you’ll get off the plane with a more fully charged phone than when you got on. Both the phone and the laptop are gorgeous. The phone has the usual Android goodies, like front and back cameras and hi-def video recording, and it uses Motorola’s MotoBlur software, which can unify the address books and messages from your various online accounts (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and e-mail). But to make it powerful enough to drive a laptop, Motorola had to give it far more oomph than a typical phone. It has a dual-core processor, which, in English, means “faster than any phone you’ve ever used.” We are talking slick, responsive, satisfying. The phone also has a fingerprint sensor built into the power button on the top back of the phone. That is, you can unlock and turn on the phone with a single finger. It’s better in theory than in execution, alas: it often takes several finger-swipes before the phone recognizes you. (You can also set up a regular typed-in password, or none.) This phone doesn’t do much to address America’s cellphone obesity epidemic; you could probably fit an iPhone inside its body cavity and still have room for a pencil. On the other hand, the screen is gigantic — 960 x 540 pixels — which is great when you’re viewing GPS maps, documents and photos. The laptop looks and feels like a black MacBook Air: 2.4 pounds, all cool brushed aluminum. The flat-topped keys poke up through the aluminum — again, very MacBook Airish. They’re slightly smaller than standard size, but still fine for rapid touch-typing. The best thing about the whole phone-laptop concept is that you don’t have to think. You can pop the phone into the laptop, or yank it out, without shutting it down or entering any kind of special mode. After about 10 seconds, whatever was on the phone’s screen appears on the laptop’s screen. It’s wild: you actually see your phone in a window. All of the buttons and icons are clickable with the trackpad clicker. You can even make phone calls in this setup — the laptop becomes a speakerphone. It’s a crazy, mind-blowing experience. You can even run all your Android apps on the laptop’s 11.6-inch screen. Sadly, the apps don’t actually exploit the much larger laptop screen real estate. If you click the Full Screen button on the phone window, the software magnifies beautifully; if you’re over 40, you’ll have no problem reading “small” type, which is now bumper-sticker size. But you’re not seeing any additional area — only an enlarged version of what was on the phone screen. Good thing the phone’s screen has such high resolution to begin with. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.comDoes the redundancy of your gadgets ever bother you?</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/us/10iphone.html?ref=atandt">Dead Zone for iPhones No More<date>Published: February 9, 2011</date><text>Four years and a few upgrades ago, the first iPhones were sold in the United States.Well, not all the states. The people of North and South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming — as if they needed a reminder that they live off the beaten path — had to watch the rest of the nation fawn over their must-have gadgets. Those states are not served by AT&amp;T, which was the exclusive carrier, making the sparsely populated region essentially one big iPhone dead zone. But on Thursday, Verizon Wireless starts selling the iPhone in the region. And despite some lingering resentment about being left behind, stores have stocked up on hand warmers and hot drinks for the crowds expected to line up for their chance to buy into the hype. “I remember vividly the first time I saw one at an airport,” said Greg LaFollette, 64, an accountant and technology consultant from Sioux Falls, S.D., who plans to buy the phone. “My heart was bleeding because I knew I wouldn’t be able to get one.” In an era of instant access to seemingly everything — thanks in no small part to the proliferation of smart phones — it has been hard for many to believe that entire states could be walled off for years from such a mainstream product. “Why do I live in South Dakota?” was the hopeless response in an online forum from a would-be customer after being advised of the geographical restrictions of the AT&amp;T iPhone. AT&amp;T, which is expanding its network to include the upper Midwest after buying a smaller carrier, did not respond to a message seeking comment. Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, dished some mild corporate trash talk. “We value our customers regardless of where they live,” she said. “We think North Dakota is just as important as New York.” Tony Clark, chairman of the North Dakota Public Service Commission, said he expected sales of the iPhone to be significant, but not as high as they would have been a few years back. “While it’s a pretty big deal, the emergence of Android phones has mitigated some of that demand because they do a lot of the same things,” he said. Remarkably, for a place with no iPhones, there are already a large number of Dakotas-related iPhone apps, including maps of major cities, local weather, public records and local noxious weeds of the region. The Bismarck Tribune is one of several local newspapers with an app. “Downloads have been pretty slow up until now,” Terry Alveshere, the paper’s online manager, said in an e-mail. That is because few people went as far as Joel Broveleit, 37, of Sioux Falls, who drove to Nebraska and lied about his address to get an iPhone. “So I’ve had one probably longer than anyone in South Dakota,” he said. He also discovered the downside of being the first on the block with the new toy: everyone wanted to play with it (he eventually disguised it in a special case to avoid attention). But now, at least, the griping can end. David Miller, 20, who is studying computer network security at Dakota State University in Madison, S.D., said he had heard the occasional person threatening to move to a place where iPhones were not such foreign objects. But, he added, “I don’t think anyone I knew followed through.”Four years and a few upgrades ago, the first iPhones were sold in the United States.</text></article></page></root>
