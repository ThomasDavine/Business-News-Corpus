A news release Wednesday from H.P. Labs discussed a project where data from social media is merged with corporate information, like sales transactions and customer demographics, to predict customer behavior. The study claimed 90 percent accuracy. “The system used can correlate social media conversations about specific product features to actual customer transactions in real time,’ the release said. “HP is expanding the scope of the project internally as the underlying technology is being piloted by HP customers in the media and entertainment industries.” What is interesting about that gobbledygook is that the project made use of so-called unstructured data, like Amazon.com reviews or customer surveys, that convey information through normal language, along with structured data, like spending information that fits neatly into the rows and columns of traditional corporate databases. This merger of the structured and the unstructured, in a systemic way, would be a suitable product inside an H.P. appliance. Earlier this year, H.P. bought one software company, called Vertica, which specializes in the analysis of structured data, and in August it announced the purchase of Autonomy, maker of software to analyze unstructured data. Vertica’s price was not disclosed, but was believed to be something above $200 million. The Autonomy deal, at about $11.7 billion, contributed to Leo Apotheker’s ouster as chief executive in September. Ms. Whitman put integrating Autonomy among her chief priorities when she took over. She closed the Autonomy deal in early October, leaving H.P. free to start integrating the approaches two software companies into a single service. Given her “hardware first” approach, that likely means a special-purpose data analysis computer server, with the software ready loaded. This report from Labs indicates that H.P. was already thinking about how to do that. The vice president of customer intelligence at H.P. is quoted as saying that “the results are significant enough to act on” and that “his methodology can improve both the customer experience and the bottom line,” particularly in customer service, defect spotting and online marketing campaigns. When we spoke on Thursday, I asked Ms. Whitman if H.P. was still trying to get into the high-value consulting and services businesses that I.B.M. dominates. “We’re a very different company than I.B.M.,” she said. “They have got very real strengths, but we got strengths too.” In particular she mentioned H.P.’s huge global supply chain and its capability to manufacture so many products. For a long time, however, I.B.M. has sold hardware, even giant mainframe computers, as the wrapping that makes its software work best. Ms. Whitman may be angling for an opposite play to the same end, selling hardware with so many software extras that it comes with a premium price. If so, look for a structured/unstructured analysis server from H.P. sometime soon. (By the way, Ms. Whitman also went out of her way to compliment the job Mark Hurd did in making areas like human resources, information technology and real estate inside H.P. more efficient. Considering where those functions stand in the world of chief executive esteem, that was not exactly high praise, but it was still the warmest anyone at H.P. has been about Mr. Hurd, the former H.P. chief executive who is now co-president of Oracle.)</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/technology/hp-chief-says-pc-division-will-remain.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">H.P. Chief Says PC Division Will Remain<date>Published: October 27, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Meg Whitman is moving as fast as she can to figure out a strategy for Hewlett-Packard. For starters, she wants to keep selling personal computers.On Thursday, Ms. Whitman, H.P.’s chief executive, announced that the company would retain its PC division. The division, called the personal systems group, was responsible for almost one third, or $40 billion, of H.P.’s $126 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year. “First and foremost, H.P. is a hardware company,” she said in an interview. “We want to build out our software, but I don’t think we are done yet on hardware. There is a lot of opportunity.”   The company’s former chief executive, Léo Apotheker, announced in August that the company was considering selling or spinning off the unit. He was forced out of the company a month later and succeeded by Ms. Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay. Ms. Whitman said there were concerns that an independent PC division would lose brand value and face higher overhead costs like real estate and operations. H.P., in turn, would lose the contribution the unit makes in delivering low-price components, like semiconductors, to other parts of the company. Besides personal computers, H.P. has sizable businesses in computer servers and data storage devices, printers and printer supplies, and related services.  H.P.’s personal systems group is one of the world’s biggest buyers of semiconductors, which gives H.P. negotiating power for the chips it uses in other parts of the company, like computer servers and data storage devices, or printers. The unit’s products often figure in the sale of services like call centers, another big business for H.P.   While H.P.’s PC division has revenue large enough to make it one of America’s 70 largest companies on its own, it is in a competitive business with narrow profit margins. This fit poorly into the strategy of focusing on higher-margin software and services developed by Mr. Apotheker. Keeping PCs still leaves the company with significant challenges, including low-price suppliers from Asia, competition in value-added products and services from large technology companies like I.B.M., and an industry trend towards cloud computing and mobile computing, where most computers are in large data centers with access over the Internet rather than on desktops. Much of the business, including PCs and notebooks, is under pressure from tablets, like the Apple iPad. H.P.’s own foray into tablets, using a proprietary operating system called webOS, ended abruptly after a few months of poor sales. Ms. Whitman is expected to announce her strategy sometime after H.P. announces its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Nov. 21. For now, she said, her final plans are still under review.  “The question I get most often is, ‘What is H.P.?’ ” she said in the interview. “It is a communications problem, but we have to know what we are internally first.” She indicated, for instance, that webOS, which H.P. was incorporating into servers as well as tablets, will continue to play a role. “We’re still working through webOS, still haven’t gotten to ground,” Ms. Whitman said. “It is part of our cloud strategy. Stay tuned.” Todd Bradley, the head of the PC unit, did not say whether H.P. would re-enter the tablet market with webOS. The company currently sells a tablet that uses Microsoft software. He said the “effective price” for the tablet is $300, adding that “the challenge is building that out.”  H.P. has advantages in reach and manpower that it would use to compete. “It’s not about software, it’s about solving customer problems,” he said. “No one can compete with us in so many countries, with as big a sales force.”  Despite the turmoil over the PCs, H.P. actually increased its share of the worldwide PC market, to 18.1 percent from 17.8 percent a year earlier, according to the research firm IDC.SAN FRANCISCO — Meg Whitman is moving as fast as she can to figure out a strategy for Hewlett-Packard.

H.P. paid a 64 percent premium for the British software maker. In a note on Wednesday, analysts with JPMorgan Chase, said the deal “sets an unfavorable precedent for future acquisitions to come.” The price for Autonomy, the analysts estimate, is equivalent to 10 times the company’s trailing 12-month revenue and 20 times its trailing 12-month maintenance revenue. Previous software deals were clinched at multiples of 4 to 6 times revenue and 7 to 10 times maintenance revenue. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Those kinds of multiples, the analysts say, favor target companies, not H.P.’s shareholders. That is particularly worrisome because H.P., under its new chief executive, Meg Whitman, is expected “to make a series of acquisitions over the next five to 10 years to become a full-fledged, one-stop I.T. shop.” And last year’s deals for ArcSight ($1.5 billion) and 3Par ($2.3 billion) were also “expensive,” according to JPMorgan. Over all, the analysts gave H.P.’s stock an underweight rating, saying that “unfortunately, we think that the rodeo ride at H.P. is not over.”</text></article>

And Larry Ellison’s acquisitive Oracle is a credible potential suitor. A Breakingviews analysis suggests that even while paying a big premium, Oracle could reap a hefty return.Despite H.P.’s expensive deal to buy Autonomy, a British rival, H.P.’s stock is cheap. It trades at less than five times estimated earnings for the company’s next fiscal year. If Oracle paid a 40 percent premium to gain control, the total outlay, including assumed debt, would be a bit over $80 billion. That’s more than half of Oracle’s enterprise value. But Oracle has $32 billion of cash and short-term investments. For a compelling deal, the company could always issue stock as well. And the numbers are persuasive. Analysts reckon H.P. will pull in $13 billion of operating profit in the 2012 fiscal year. Add in a fraction more from Autonomy, and that would bring Oracle a 16 percent annual return on its total investment off the bat. Oracle might be able to squeeze out some costs. If it cut 10 percent of H.P.’s selling, general and administrative expenses and its research and development costs, that would bring $1.6 billion in annual savings. Throw those in, and pro forma for the 2012 fiscal year Oracle’s return on investment would be 18 percent. Along the way, it is possible that H.P. could slightly ease the burden for an acquirer by selling businesses it bought last year in its $1.2 billion purchase of Palm. The mobile operating system may be in limbo, but the related patents are a hot commodity. There are potential snags, however. The presence at Oracle of Mark Hurd, chief executive of H.P. until just over a year ago, may delay any possible move. Moreover, Mr. Hurd might not be the ideal boss for an Oracle-owned H.P. As chief executive, he cut costs too deeply. There’s also the important broader strategic question of whether Oracle should increase its commitment to hardware. Purely on the figures, though, H.P. would make a lucrative target. Fear Factor Morgan Stanley’s October woes feel like a drama lacking a crisis. The company, which three years ago suffered a bank run, was already facing skepticism about its turnaround before the third quarter turned crummy. But that’s not behind its latest misery. Morgan Stanley’s stock has dropped more than 17 percent since Thursday after the cost of insuring its debt against default rose as investors again became anxious over the bank’s exposure to Europe. But the substance to the worries looks thin. A Zero Hedge blog post two weeks ago snowballed. It asserted that Morgan Stanley had $39 billion of French bank risk on its balance sheet, or more than half its assets minus liabilities, known as book value. But these numbers dated to 2010. The bank, led by James Gorman, has almost halved that figure. What’s more, the blog picked only the gross exposure, which included client assets, and those of the bank, held at French institutions. It ignored cash, hedges and collateral. Factor those in and the net exposure is zilch. Of course, 2008 taught investors not to take banks at their word about exposures — or the quality of their hedges. Morgan Stanley itself had almost a $10 billion loss in 2007 from disastrously hedging an otherwise-smart mortgage bet. So investors are skittish. But even after the bank’s recent rout, Morgan Stanley shares are hardly out of whack with rivals’. Like Citigroup, it trades at just about two-fifths of book value, but that is far better than Bank of America’s 27 percent. Even JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which navigated the last crisis deftly, are trading at only two-thirds of book value. Under pressure to show that its turnaround in fixed-income trading and wealth management is working, Morgan Stanley ought to trade at a discount anyway. That doesn’t mean Mr. Gorman should hold his breath and wish for the latest ruckus to pass. Providing more information on the way the company hedges its exposures, and with whom, would help — and he is likely to do that later this month. Of course, as the autumn of 2008 taught investors, once a panic over financing and capital hits a bank, all bets are off. Mr. Gorman may need to get out even further in front of this one.

    <article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/michael-dell-advises-hewlett-packard/?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Michael Dell Advises Hewlett-Packard<date>October 4, 2011, 5:49 pm</date><text>Attention Hewlett-Packard: Michael Dell thinks that you should stay in the personal computer business. Speaking at the Oracle OpenWorld convention on Tuesday, Mr. Dell laid out why his company, Dell Inc., the world’s second-largest maker of PCs, likes what many consider a low-margin business with poor growth prospects. In August H.P., the biggest PC company, announced it was thinking about what to do with its business, including a spinoff or sale. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. “There are many reasons to stay committed,” said Mr. Dell, who did not need to mention H.P. to make the distinction to the tech-savvy crowd. He said that 5 percent of the world’s microprocessors go into servers and storage and 95 percent go into PCs. The same is true for disk drives and other components, he said. The indication was that the PC business, in itself a low margin affair, gives a big hardware maker steady supply and pricing power for other products. “Give up that scale and you need to raise your prices.” Besides, Mr. Dell said, “Dell is an end-to-end solutions company,” offering hardware that ranges from the biggest computer servers to low-priced PCs for business and consumers. It was a reasonably cogent argument for the PC, but it did ignore a critical fact: The H.P. chief executive who made the announcement about possibly getting out of PCs, Léo Apotheker, lost his job in late September, in part for the bad way he handled its announcement. The new chief executive, Meg Whitman, has said she will look at the business afresh. Apparently Mr. Dell thinks she should keep competing with him. Mr. Dell was introduced by Oracle’s president, Mark Hurd, who used to compete against Mr. Dell as H.P.’s C.E.O. Mr. Hurd had made similar points about the PC business’s enabling supply and pricing power when he ran H.P. On Tuesday morning, however, he was all about Dell, calling it “a great company to work with,” and adding, “we value their access to emerging markets.” That may not be all Mr. Hurd values. Oracle is going to great lengths at this conference to portray itself as a comprehensive company something like an enterprise computing version of Apple, designing hardware and software to work together from the start. The most notable gap in Oracle’s own end-to-end proposition is any kind of personal device. In addition, the kind of high-end data center networking that Dell picked up with last year’s acquisition of a company called Force 10 is a critical part of Oracle’s boast that its servers and storage systems are multiples faster than the competition. Is this something Oracle needs as it continues its seemingly relentless growth? With $62 billion in revenue, Dell seems like a company too big to acquire. But those PCs are so low margin that Dell’s market cap is just $26 billion, including $15 billion in cash on its balance sheet. The net price, though, is still about twice the $5.6 billion that Oracle paid for Sun in 2009.</text></article>

The board demanded his resignation, and if ever there was a case for firing someone for cause, this would seem to be it.So why is H.P. paying Mr. Apotheker more than $13 million in termination benefits? Just three years after the financial crisis generated widespread public outrage that Wall Street chief executives walked away with hundreds of millions in bonuses and other compensation after driving their companies into insolvency and plunging the nation’s economy into crisis, multimillion-dollar pay for failure is flourishing like never before. H.P. is simply the latest example, albeit an especially egregious one. It’s hard to fault Mr. Apotheker for taking what H.P. offered. But among the many questions shareholders should be asking the board is why it approved an employment agreement for Mr. Apotheker that arguably made it more lucrative for him to fail — and the sooner the better — than to succeed. “It’s a great irony that spectacular failure is rewarded lavishly,” John J. Donohue, a professor at Stanford law school and the president of the American Law and Economics Association, told me. “It is a terrible mistake to set up a structure where the top person walks away with millions even if the company is laid waste by their poor decision-making, yet this is what’s happening. It’s a shocking departure from capitalist incentives if you lavish riches on the losers.” He added that it’s especially shocking at H.P., which fired its previous two chief executives before Mr. Apotheker and had to make multimillion-dollar payments as a consequence. “After what H.P. had gone through, you’d think the board would have been on their toes rather than asleep at the switch again,” he said. Experts said Mr. Apotheker had what amounts these days to a fairly standard termination agreement for a chief executive. In the event he was terminated for “cause,” his contract, a summary of which H.P. filed as an exhibit to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, provided a cash payment of twice his base pay (of $1.2 million, or $2.4 million); his earned but unpaid bonus (his “target” bonus was $2.4 million a year); any accrued but unused vacation — and “no further compensation.” That would add up to a maximum of about $4.8 million. But he wasn’t fired for cause. In the rarefied world of high-level executive compensation, “cause” is a term of art that long ago parted company with standard usage. “Cause is a foreign concept to the general public, at least when it appears in executive employment contracts,” observed Mike Delikat, head of the global employment practice at Orrick Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, who said he’d litigated many such provisions on behalf of major companies. “Most people are employed at will, which means they can be fired any time and for any reason unless the reason is an unlawful one like discrimination. But ‘cause’ is a negotiated term. It is often very narrow, limited to things like conviction of a felony or a complete failure to perform material duties under the contract.” Mr. Apotheker’s contract wasn’t quite so narrow (“I’ve seen worse,” said Mr. Delikat). But it did narrowly construe “cause” to mean only “material neglect” of his duties or “conduct” that he “knew or should have known is materially inconsistent with the best interest of, or is materially injurious to, H.P.” While such clauses may be open to interpretation, the board appears to have given no consideration to firing Mr. Apotheker for cause, which might be difficult to establish considering the board backed his various strategic initiatives, however ill-fated they proved to be. Once Mr. Apotheker was being terminated “without cause,” a clause in his agreement kicked in that accelerated the grant of 200,000 shares of “sign-on equity grants” and another 76,000 restricted shares and 608,000 “performance-based restricted units” as “long term incentives.” You’d think that long-term incentives would no longer be necessary or appropriate for someone who’d just been fired, and that anything “performance based” would be rendered moot by the plunge in H.P.’s stock price during Mr. Apotheker’s tenure. On the contrary. Thanks to his termination, “all restrictions shall be released” on the grants of restricted stocks, and the supposedly performance-based awards would assume that he was employed “through the end of the performance period,” according to his contract summary. 1 2 Next Page »Léo Apotheker’s short, turbulent reign as the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard was by nearly all accounts a disaster.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/business/outsize-severance-continues-for-executives-even-after-failed-tenures.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Outsize Severance Continues for Executives, Even After Failed Tenures<date>Published: September 29, 2011</date><text>The golden goodbye has not gone away.Just last week, Léo Apotheker was shown the door after a tumultuous 11-month run atop Hewlett-Packard. His reward? $13.2 million in cash and stock severance, in addition to a sign-on package worth about $10 million, according to a corporate filing on Thursday. At the end of August, Robert P. Kelly was handed severance worth $17.2 million in cash and stock when he was ousted as chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon after clashing with board members and senior managers. A few days later, Carol A. Bartz took home nearly $10 million from Yahoo after being fired from the troubled search giant. A hallmark of the gilded era of just a few short years ago, the eye-popping severance package continues to thrive in spite of the measures put in place in the wake of the financial crisis to crack down on excessive pay. Critics have long complained about outsize compensation packages that dwarf ordinary workers’ paychecks, but they voice particular ire over pay-for-failure. Much of Wall Street and corporate America has shifted a bigger portion of pay into longer-term stock awards and established policies to claw back bonuses. And while fuller disclosure of exit packages several years ago has helped ratchet down the size of the biggest severance deals, efforts by shareholders and regulators to further restrict payouts have had less success. “We repeatedly see companies’ assets go out the door to reward failure,” said Scott Zdrazil, the director of corporate governance for Amalgamated Bank’s $11 billion Longview Fund, a labor-affiliated investment fund that sought to tighten the restrictions on severance plans at three oil companies last year. “Investors are frustrated that boards haven’t prevented such windfalls.” Several years ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission turned a brighter spotlight on severance deals by requiring companies to disclose the values of the contracts in regulatory filings. More recently, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms required that public companies include “say on pay” votes for shareholders to express opinions about compensation — including a separate vote for golden parachutes initiated by a merger or sale. Yet so far, few investors have gone to battle. Only 38 of the largest 3,000 companies had their executive pay plans voted down, according to Institutional Shareholder Services. Even then, the votes are nonbinding. Severance policies typically call for a lump-sum cash payment, the ability to cash out stock awards and options immediately instead of having to potentially wait for years, and sometimes even bonuses. And that’s not counting the retirement benefits and additional company stock that executives accumulate, which can increase the total value of their exit package by millions of dollars. Some critics believe investors have become inured to the hefty payouts. In addition, the continuing financial crises in Europe and the United States have pushed compensation into the backseat on the shareholder agenda. “People are preoccupied with the bigger issues,” said Frederick Rowe Jr., a hedge fund manager and president of Investors for Director Accountability which has sought to curb excessive pay. The Obama administration, meanwhile, seemed to lose its bully pulpit for compensation reform after most of the nation’s biggest financial companies repaid their government loans — and Kenneth R. Feinberg, its tough-talking pay overseer, moved on to tackle other issues. Federal Reserve officials flagged golden parachutes as a concern when they began a compensation review almost two years ago, but their inquiry was limited to large banks — not all large companies. The findings of the review are expected to be made public in the next few weeks. Over the last year, regulators have been pressing corporate boards to draft policies denying huge severance payouts to senior executives if the firm teeters on collapse. That still leaves wiggle room for managers to score big if they merely perform poorly. Practices such as large cash payouts and having shareholders pay the tax bill for departing executives are on the decline, especially after the uproar over the $200 million-plus exit packages of Hank McKinnell of Pfizer and Robert Nardelli of Home Depot in the last decade. 1 2 Next Page »The golden goodbye has not gone away.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/will-amazon-buy-palm-for-its-patents/?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Will Amazon Buy Palm for Its Patents?<date>September 30, 2011, 12:27 pm</date><text>Paul Sakuma/Associated Press and Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesLéo Apotheker, left, Hewlet-Packard’s former chief, with the Palm Pre, and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, with the Kindle Fire. To protect Fire, will Amazon buy Palm? Shares of Amazon fell about 2 percent in the first hour of trading on Friday, amid speculation that the online retailer might be angling to buy Palm, the fallen mobile device business that Hewlett-Packard bought last year for $1.2 billion. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink According to technology site Venturebeat, which earlier reported on Amazon’s interest, the companies are engaged in “serious negotiations,” though there are other suitors. Palm, purchased last April, was supposed to form the foundation of H.P.’s mobile business. The company, which invented the first personal digital assistant, offered H.P. a line of smartphones and the webOS platform, a mobile operating system that competes with Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS systems. At the time, Todd Bradley, an executive vice president at H.P., said it would provide the “ideal platform to expand H.P.’s mobility strategy and create a unique H.P. experience spanning multiple mobile connected devices.” But the honeymoon didn’t last long. One year later, the unit was bleeding cash and H.P. was cooling on its personal computing business. As part of a larger overhaul, H.P. announced that it was abruptly shutting down its webOS device business “and exploring strategic alternatives for webOS software.” That business, which made up the bulk of H.P.’s “corporate investment” segment made $266 million in revenue in the third quarter, but reported an operating loss of $332 million. H.P. also notified analysts that fourth quarter financials will reflect about $1 billion in charges related to its webOS write-down. Though the rapid fall of Palm, seems to be yet another red mark on the technology giant’s scorecard, H.P. may wring some value out of Palm, if Amazon, or another mobile device maker, makes a bid. After this week’s splashy debut of Kindle Fire — Amazon’s highly anticipated touch tablet — there’s little doubt that the online retailer is getting serious about its mobile devices. While the Fire’s price point of $199 and its limited features, seems to position it as a non-direct competitor to Apple’s popular iPad, analysts say, Amazon may be looking to acquire patents as a defensive maneuver. And Palm, with its trove of patents related to mobile software and devices, could help Amazon stave off future litigation, from competitors like Apple, or Microsoft. “I don’t think anyone believes that Apple and Amazon will not have significant competitive skirmishes in the future,” said Jordan Rohan, a Stifel Nicolaus analyst told DealBook on Friday. “The value of I.P. related to mobile has gone up—even if there was no palm devices in the future, it would still be valuable.” Though its unclear just how valuable Palm’s trove of patents is, Mr. Bradley of H.P. noted last year, that it “possesses significant I.P. assets.” Intellectual property has been a key driver of several multi-billion dollar deals this year. With many technology giants jockeying for a larger piece of the mobile market, patents have been critical, to ward off litigation, or to push rivals to sign expensive licensing agreements. In July,  Apple and Microsoft led a group of technology companies in a $4.5 billion purchase of patents from Nortel Networks. Google, which lost in the bidding, went on a patent spree in the following weeks, buying a trove from I.B.M. and then later, paying $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, a holder of more than 17,000 patents. “There’s a war of intergalactic proportions brewing, and instead of an army, they’re coming armed with patents,” said Mr. Rohan. Still, from a strategic standpoint, the purchase of a company like Palm would be somewhat of a departure for Amazon, which has not historically been focused on buying companies to build out its consumer technology products. Though its moving towards building better mobile devices, its focus, unlike its competitors, seems to be on selling content, said Scott Tilghman, a Caris &amp; Company analyst. “Amazon is focused on driving consumption of its own media offerings and getting into other forms of mobility, specifically the smartphone space, doesn’t seem to be part of their core competency or their core business strategy.”</text></article>

Rivalry, PowerPoint Version<date>September 29, 2011, 8:30 pm</date><text>A slide about Autonomy posted by Oracle. 9:21 a.m. | Updated Corrected reference to an advanced chip H.P. was helping to develop. Did information technology just run afoul of disinformation technology? The computing giants Oracle and Hewlett-Packard, known for trash talking each other and for fighting in court, took their sniping to the Internet on Wednesday when Oracle charged that the British software company Autonomy, which H.P. is buying for $10.2 billion, tried to sell itself to Oracle last April. Oracle said it was not interested, since the $6 billion market value Autonomy had at the time was still far more than Autonomy was worth. The implication was that H.P. came in second, and is foolish, in buying Autonomy. Oracle even posted a series of slides on its Web site that it said showed that Mike Lynch, Autonomy’s chief executive, intended to sell his company. The slides, Oracle said, were “all about Autonomy’s financial results, Autonomy’s stock price history, Autonomy’s Price/Earnings history and Autonomy’s stock market valuation.” Oracle also said Mr. Lynch showed up at the meeting with “Silicon Valley’s most famous shopper/seller of companies, the investment banker Frank Quattrone.” Mysteriously, those slides, which were widely commented on in the industry press Thursday, were posted for only about 12 hours. Then they disappeared. A few hours later they were back. It seems there is less there than Oracle intended. Here’s what I learned. Oracle continued to publish a page that said Mr. Lynch came by for talks with Mark Hurd, Oracle’s co-president, and Doug Kehring, who is in charge of mergers and acquisitions at Oracle. For his part, Mr. Lynch acknowledged the meeting, but said it was just a customer visit that Mr. Quattrone organized. Why he was meeting the head of mergers was not explained. Upon request, Oracle sent The New York Times the slides, which it said were sent from Qatalyst Partners, the investment bank headed by Mr. Quattrone, not Autonomy, in January. That backs up Autonomy’s assertion that Oracle had lifted an older slide deck from Mr. Quattrone to make Mr. Lynch look bad — Mr. Quattrone wasn’t even working for Autonomy then. So what is going on here? Did Mr. Lynch try to sell Autonomy to Oracle, or did Oracle post the story and slides to make H.P. look bad? This may be a little bit of both. Mr. Lynch did talk to Oracle’s head of M.&amp;A. before he took the H.P. deal, and Oracle’s cleverly worded description of the meeting makes it look as if he went into a lot more detail than he would like to admit. The deck looks like a bit of extra “evidence” that Oracle later withdrew. Mr. Lynch probably set off Oracle’s outburst with his recent statements that Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, was lying about whether Oracle’s software could do the same kinds of things Autonomy’s software. Not that it took a lot to get Oracle started: in the last year, Mr. Ellison has publicly criticized H.P.’s board for firing Mr. Hurd, his friend and tennis partner, and then hired Mr. Hurd himself. The hiring provoked H.P. to file a lawsuit against Mr. Hurd, which was quickly settled. Another lawsuit between H.P. and Oracle, over Oracle’s decision to discontinue software development on advanced chips H.P. was helping to develop, is still going on. In between the lawsuits, Mr. Ellison said Léo Apotheker, Mr. Hurd’s replacement, conducted industrial espionage against Oracle when he was running SAP. (Though SAP settled that suit and admitted wrongdoing, it said Mr. Apotheker was not involved in the incidents.) Only one thing is nearly certain in this name-calling mess: Meg Whitman, who took over at H.P. when Mr. Apotheker was fired last week, will not be on stage for hugs and camaraderie when Mr. Ellison kicks off Oracle’s big trade show in San Francisco on Sunday evening. Or, as one observer involved in the cross-company slinging put it: “Oracle used Autonomy to give H.P. a poke in the eye. It just got ridiculous.”</text></article>

Hires Goldman to Defend Against Activists<date>September 28, 2011, 7:22 pm</date><text>Mario Anzuoni/ReutersMeg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Hewlett-Packard has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser to help defend against potential activist investors or hostile bidders seeking a break-up of the troubled technology giant, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Wednesday. The hiring of Goldman is not surprising. Analysts and investors have mused for months that H.P. is ripe for an activist investor to arise, demanding even bolder steps to try to bolster shareholder value. Shares of H.P. have fallen more than 44 percent over the last 12 months, closing on Wednesday at $23.19. With the company’s stock price hovering near 52-week lows, H.P.’s management and directors have become concerned that agitators may begin amassing sizable holdings, these people said. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink H.P.’s board has also continued to draw criticism for failing to bring stability to the company, including the dismissal of Léo Apotheker as chief executive after just 11 months. Still, the hiring of Goldman was not prompted by any specific threat, one of the people briefed on the matter added. H.P.’s new chief executive, Meg Whitman, said in a call with analysts last week that the company remained committed to its current plan to refocus on enterprise software and services. Its $11.7 billion takeover of Autonomy is expected to close before the end of the year, and the company is still studying whether it should spin off its personal computer business or hold onto it. Neither Ms. Whitman nor H.P.’s executive chairman, Ray Lane, has expressed any interest in exploring a further breakup or a sale of the company, either of which is likely to be part of any activist investor’s demands. While H.P. has long worked with many investment banks — it is working with Perella Weinberg Partners and Barclays Capital on the Autonomy deal and the possible P.C. unit spin-off — Goldman has a reputation for helping companies rebuff activist investors and unsolicited buyers. In recent years, Goldman has advised the Yahoo, Airgas and the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan in fending off hostile bidders and activist investors. One possible defense that H.P. could install is a so-called “shareholder rights plan.” Popularly known as a poison pill, it limits the amount of shares an individual investor can buy. Though most of H.P.’s top holders are institutional investors that generally refrain from shareholder activism, one of its biggest shareholders is the hedge fund Paulson &amp; Company. The firm is not known for feuding against companies in public, however. A representative for H.P. was not immediately available for comment. A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment. News of Goldman’s hiring was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online.</text></article>

Ellison, chief executive of Oracle. Few executives in the technology world love a good fight more than Lawrence J. Ellison. And when it comes to its longtime rival, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle‘s voluble chief executive is more than happy to take his gloves off and brawl. So when Autonomy, a British software company that H.P. has agreed to buy for $11.7 billion, contended that it never seriously considered Oracle as a potential buyer, Mr. Ellison apparently could not resist taking a swing in public. In an unusual press release issued on Wednesday, Oracle took exception to comments made by Autonomy’s chief executive, Mike Lynch. Soon after the H.P. deal was announced, Oracle announced that it had turned down the chance to bid for Autonomy, citing a too-high asking price. Mr. Lynch went so far as to call Oracle’s account “inaccurate” and that he had nothing to do with an Autonomy adviser approaching Oracle about a potential deal. Oracle’s response: “Either Mr. Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Oracle press release Here is a more specific recounting of events, according to Oracle: Mr. Lynch and his main adviser, Frank P. Quattrone, co-founder of Qatalyst Advisers, visited Oracle on April 1 at 11 a.m, meeting with the technology giant’s head of mergers, Douglas Kehring, and its president, Mark V. Hurd. The two Oracle executives told Mr. Lynch that at a then-current market value of $6 billion, Autonomy was already overpriced. Oracle’s poison-penned account ended with the taunt, “We still have his PowerPoint slides.” A representative for H.P. was not immediately available for comment. For Mr. Ellison, fighting with H.P. is a bit personal. He has picked on his troubled competitor time and again, especially after the rival’s board fired Mr. Hurd as chief executive after allegations of improper conduct. From an impassioned e-mail that Mr. Ellison sent to The New York Times shortly after his friend and tennis partner’s dismissal: “The H.P. board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “That decision nearly destroyed Apple and would have if Steve hadn’t come back and saved them.”</text></article>

That seems to have happened at UBS, Yahoo and Hewlett-Packard. The prognosis for all three isn’t good.The two tech firms have an obvious similarity. In recent weeks, both chucked out relatively new chief executives without much in the way of notice or obvious rationale. They are also alike in having fallen from being clear sector leaders — H.P. in hardware and Yahoo in the Internet world — to strategic drifters. UBS isn’t so different. Its chief executive resigned over the weekend after the bank lost track of a $2 billion bet on a supposedly low-risk trading desk. UBS, like H.P. and Yahoo, is a once-confident institution still in search of a coherent strategy. At each of these companies, the earlier greatness was also a tradition. H.P. was famous for “the H.P. Way,” a Californian mix of technical excellence, trust and responsibility to the community. Yahoo, whose co-founder, Jerry Yang, has said he bleeds the corporate color purple, embodied the open spirit of the early Internet age. And UBS considered itself different from other big banks: more cautious but no less clever. Even if outsiders did not always find these images accurate, they helped keep employees loyal and motivated. The corporate myths became almost true because people believed in them. But the H.P. Way drifted as the founding ideal waned in force, and technology became a mass consumer market. Purple went out of fashion and the disruptive Yahoo was in turn disrupted. UBS lurched late and disastrously into the finance boom. All three tried the usual remedies: new bosses, strategic reviews, restructurings. They’re still trying. The efforts could yet be rewarded. I.B.M., for instance, managed to move from fading hardware monopolist to successful contender in information technology services. But the required corporate humility is in short supply. Whether because of board dysfunction, C.E.O. arrogance or complacency lower down the organizations — or a combination — a near total loss of direction is hard to recover from. Just ask the risk control staff at UBS. A Puzzler in Brazil Dilma Rousseff, Brazil’s president, is getting the first market beating of her tenure. Adventurous monetary policy, worries of weakening central bank independence, disco-era industrial policy and even scuttlebutt about insider trading have conspired to hammer the real by about 17 percent against the dollar this month, making it the biggest loser among significant emerging market currencies. Some weakness in the currency was desirable, but as Ms. Rousseff may soon learn, it’s tough to regain lost credibility. The primary catalyst for the currency slide was the central bank’s head-scratching decision on Aug. 31 to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percent, to 12 percent. Not only was the cut not telegraphed by the central bank head, its merits aren’t obvious. Inflation was 7.2 percent in the 12 months through August, above the Brazilian central bank’s own target ceiling of 6.5 percent. Credit growth is robust, even verging on bubble territory. Finally, the labor market remains tight, with unemployment at a historically low 6 percent last month. And that’s before the last-minute scramble as the 2014 soccer World Cup approaches. The central bank’s rationale, that the cloudy economic picture abroad will weaken future demand, smacks of a directional hunch. That might be fine for a hedge fund, but it’s adventurous for a central bank. The rate cut should also reduce cross-border speculation by making Brazilian assets less attractive, in that way weakening Brazil’s currency. That helps domestic manufacturers and exporters. But while this aspect might be a concern for the government, for the central bank it should come second to fighting inflation. So investors have interpreted the move as evidence of a worrying chink in the central bank’s independence. And that’s not all. São Paulo’s financial circles have been buzzing with talk that a select few made billions betting on a rate cut, even though it doesn’t seem that any economists predicted one from their study of publicly available information. Many emerging market currencies are taking a hit as investors flee risky investments. But add in inexplicable monetary policy that hews a little too closely to political whim, and a whiff — even if no evidence — of corruption, and it’s no wonder Brazil’s real is taking the most punishment.

    <article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/autonomy-ceo-we-are-still-h-p-s-future/?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Autonomy C.E.O.: We Are Still H.P.'s Future<date>September 26, 2011, 6:00 pm</date><text>If Hewlett-Packard’s ouster last week of its chief executive means software is no longer front and center in the company’s future, no one told Mike Lynch, the chief executive of Autonomy. H.P. said in August that it was buying Autonomy for about $10.3 billion. “The Autonomy deal is very significant for H.P.,” says Mr. Lynch. “It will transform the H.P. software business. That has to go hand in hand with hardware.” He met with Ray Lane, H.P.’s executive chairman, and Meg Whitman, the company’s new chief executive. “They said, ‘We’re still completely supportive of the strategy,’ ” he says. It is easy to think otherwise. During a conference call announcing that Léo Apotheker was out after less than a year and that Ms. Whitman would be taking over, Mr. Lane said that while Autonomy was a business that H.P. could expand perhaps 10 times beyond its roughly $1 billion in annual sales, that would still be a small portion of H.P.’s total sales, currently over $120 billion and consisting mostly of hardware. Mr. Apotheker, both in announcing the Autonomy deal on Aug. 18 and in previous comments, had spoken of software as transformational to H.P. It would unify the company from separate businesses in things like personal computers, servers and printers, and make H.P. a provider of products and services accessed and delivered anywhere, via the Internet, via the cloud. The way Mr. Apotheker expressed it “left 95 percent of the company” wondering about their future at H.P., Mr. Lane said in an interview after the ouster. Autonomy’s software looks for patterns in the so-called “unstructured data” of things like e-mails, documents, and customer interactions that corporations amass. Although based in London, Mr. Lynch was at H.P.’s Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters last week when word of the firing came on Wednesday. In what he called “a rather different experience,” Mr. Lynch stood by for a day during the series of meetings that culminated in Ms. Whitman’s ascension. Talking with Mr. Lane and Ms. Whitman afterward, he says, made clear where H.P. hoped to go -– the same place it was heading under Mr. Apotheker. The focus on H.P. as a hardware company, Mr. Lynch says, underplays the role Autonomy’s software has in H.P.’s future servers and storage devices, even printers. “Some of the things have not been made clear,” he said. “If you change the software architecture for the next generation of information technology, you have hardware more optimized for the software.” Some aspects of the changes, like moving the huge loads of data Autonomy now stores for its customers over to all-H.P. systems that will rapidly access the data, will take place as soon as the deal closes, probably around the end of 2011, Mr. Lynch says. Others, including building up H.P.’s services business to sell Autonomy products -– a business he says is worth up to five times as much as the software itself sells for -– will take place over the next year or two. One plan, he said, is to store a copy of everything scanned and printed by an H.P. device somewhere in the cloud. That way, for example, a phone camera could read a wall poster for a concert and be taken to a Web site to purchase tickets, bypassing the need for embedded bar codes to store information. Another is to combine Autonomy’s software with that from Vertica, a company purchased earlier this year that does analysis of more conventional structured data, like sales figures, to provide complex analysis of overall corporate performance. This would also be sold in H.P. servers optimized for the task. So if nothing is different, and Mr. Apotheker was the one to buy both Autonomy and Vertica, why was he fired? “There was not great communication” of what H.P. is trying to do, Mr. Lynch said. In Ms. Whitman, “what you’ve got is someone who can look at all the technology to do these things, and explain it internally and externally.” He did not say whether she, or someone else, would bring to bear the operational skills to make all those titanic changes work, without destroying H.P.’s existing businesses.</text></article>

Mike Nelson/European Pressphoto AgencyMeg Whitman said weaknesses in the sales of printer cartridges is a concern. “The pace of change has accelerated” around H.P., Ms. Whitman said in an interview Thursday evening. “We have to anticipate, and anticipate and anticipate the trends.” These include the shift from PCs to tablets like the Apple iPad and the rise of low-cost corporate computing through Internet-based rentals of computing power like Amazon Web Services, she said. “We have to look at our whole go-to-market approach,” she said, referring to the way products are marketed. Whatever she chooses to do, she indicated it will be led by hardware sales and not Mr. Apotheker’s software-led philosophy. During a call with Wall Street analysts, Ms. Whitman talked about the need for H.P. to temporarily slow its investments and share repurchases, to rebuild the company’s damaged balance sheet. She may need the money for more than that however. In a later conversation with The New York Times, the newly reminted chief executive identified weaknesses in the sales of its usually lucrative printer cartridges. “Printing is a 50 percent consumer business,” she said. “The consumer is pulling back, mostly in Europe, but to be honest here too.” While economic weakness in the United States isn’t news, H.P. identified weakness in Europe in the analysts’ call. While this will affect revenue in the quarter, according to the company’s chief financial officer, the company expects to deliver its projected earnings per share this quarter. The outlook from there is uncertain, indicating H.P. will deliver the earnings through cuts, more than a revival of demand elsewhere. Where will those come from? “I’ve got 43 days until the end of the quarter,” she said. “I’ve got to do some homework.”</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/technology/whitman-expected-to-be-named-at-hp.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Meg Whitman Is Named Hewlett-Packard Chief<date>Published: September 22, 2011</date><text>Hewlett-Packard replaced its embattled chief executive on Thursday with the former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman, saying that the company’s strategy to transform its business was sound, but that it needed new leadership to carry out the plan.The upheaval at H.P. came after several weeks of mounting concerns among board members, senior executives and investors about how the former chief, Léo Apotheker, had handled a major strategy shift at the company announced last month, according to interviews with several people briefed on the board’s discussions. While the board still endorses the strategy change — which includes a possible spinoff of its personal computer business, the closing of a line of mobile devices and the $11.7 billion acquisition of the software maker Autonomy — its members felt that Mr. Apotheker had bungled communicating the plans to H.P. employees and outsiders. “It’s not about the strategy, it’s about the guy,” said one of the people with knowledge of the board’s discussions, who was not authorized to speak publicly. In an interview, Ms. Whitman, who became a member of the board this year, said the process that had led to Mr. Apotheker’s ouster took place over about three months, and came to a head in late August. Once she was aware that she would be a candidate to succeed him, she said, she recused herself from the selection of a successor. Talking about why she chose to accept the role, she said, “This is a chance to help turn around an American icon,” adding that “we’ve got our hands full.” In an earlier conference call with Wall Street analysts, Ray Lane, the company’s executive chairman, was asked whether hiring Ms. Whitman had been “hasty and premature.” He replied that the board had revisited the results of the search done before hiring Mr. Apotheker, but wanted “to reach inside” H.P. Despite her brief tenure solely as a board member, he said Ms. Whitman was viewed as an insider. In one change from Mr. Apotheker’s plans, Ms. Whitman told investors in the conference call that H.P. would reach a decision about the fate of its PC business by the end of the year, rather than next year. She said in the interview that H.P. would remain committed to the sale of computer hardware, drawing a distinction between herself and Mr. Apotheker. “He was a software executive who thought there was a faster-growing, higher-margin business in software,” she said, but “it will not transform the company.” H.P. did not reveal any details about Mr. Apotheker’s exit package, though it is expected to in the coming days. After analyzing Mr. Apotheker’s contract, James F. Reda &amp; Associates, a compensation consulting firm, estimated he could get as much as $38 million in total compensation, including severance, salary and other items, from his 11 months working at H.P. A hint of trouble for Mr. Apotheker surfaced two weeks ago, when Dominique Senequier, an H.P. director and chief executive of a private equity firm, notified the company that she planned to leave the board early next year, a fact disclosed in a company filing with securities regulators. The decision by Ms. Senequier, who was known to be close to Mr. Apotheker, was prompted by a concern about Mr. Apotheker’s fate at the company, according to the person familiar with the board’s discussions. Dissatisfaction with Mr. Apotheker had been building since he was named to lead the company less than a year ago, but the concerns boiled over beginning on Aug. 18, said Mr. Lane. That was when H.P. hastily announced that it was exploring a sale or spinoff of its PC business into a separate company, after portions of the news became public earlier in the day, and disappointing quarterly earnings. The changes caught many H.P. executives off-guard; Todd Bradley, the executive in charge of its PC business, received less than 24 hours’ notice, according to a person close to Mr. Bradley. The uncertainty about the future of the PC business also created uneasiness among the company’s big corporate customers, causing concern among H.P.’s board that it could contribute to weakness in its PC sales. 1 2 Next Page » Quentin Hardy and Eric Dash contributed reporting.Hewlett-Packard replaced its embattled chief executive on Thursday with the former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman, saying that the company’s strategy to transform its business was sound, but that it needed new leadership to carry out the plan.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/technology/hewlett-packard-board-meets-on-replacing-ceo.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Hewlett-Packard Board Expected to Fire C.E.O.<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>Hewlett-Packard, the technology giant that has stumbled through repeated embarrassments, was preparing on Wednesday to fire its chief executive, less than one year after naming him to the post, according to several people with knowledge of the board’s actions.The leading candidate to replace H.P.’s chief, Léo Apotheker, was Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, who was sought for her ability to run a large technology company, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized by the board to speak publicly. With the move to fire its third chief executive in a row, Hewlett-Packard risks looking like the tech company that cannot find its way. It is one of the oldest and most successful tech companies and yet in recent years it has been surpassed by far more innovative and better-managed companies like Google, Apple and Facebook in symbolizing innovation in Silicon Valley. The question facing H.P. is whether a new chief executive can restore its leadership position. On a day last month that crystallized the company’s careening strategy, Mr. Apotheker made a series of announcements: poor quarterly earnings; an $11.7 billion purchase of Autonomy, a British software company that analysts immediately branded as overpriced; discontinuation of its TouchPad tablet and its WebOs software that had been introduced only months before; and the possible sale or spinoff of H.P.’s mainstay PC business. The stock lost about a quarter of its value on the news. The company’s stock has fallen 47 percent, a loss of over $40 billion in the company’s market value, on Mr. Apotheker’s watch. Investors liked the prospect of new leadership. Hewlett-Packard’s stock was up 6.72 percent Wednesday to close at $23.98. It was not clear, however, that Ms. Whitman could undo much of what Mr. Apotheker had done or for that matter whether H.P.’s board would want her to. Analysts say it would be difficult for the company to walk away from the Autonomy bid, though the board may be considering hanging on to the PC business. Ms. Whitman, who ran eBay as it grew from a start-up to a major online retailer, left the company just as growth began to stall. She unsuccessfully ran for governor of California and was hired in March by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, a venture capital firm, as a strategic adviser. The board conversations about Ms. Whitman are fluid, though, and might not result in her hiring, this person said. However, if Ms. Whitman were hired, she would most likely be a permanent, not an interim, replacement for Mr. Apotheker, said a person briefed on the board’s discussions who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized by the board to speak publicly. While she lacks experience running a technology company as complex and mature as H.P.,  the company’s board considers her communications skills and understanding of customers to be her strongest qualifications for the job, this person said. Ms. Whitman joined the H.P. board in January, several months after Mr. Apotheker was hired.  Although H.P.’s board is comfortable with the strategy laid out last month by Mr. Apotheker, its members have increasingly begun to raise questions about his ability to communicate that strategy effectively within the company and to outsiders, especially investors. Last week, H.P. was hit with a lawsuit claiming that its executives misled investors about the health of the company, including its PC and mobile device business, before its recently announced strategy shift. Some outside observers see the board itself as the problem. Since naming Carly Fiorina chief executive in 1999, H.P. has endured proxy wars with some of its founders’ children over the merger with Compaq; board room squabbles that culminated in Ms. Fiorina’s ouster; scandals involving spying on journalists, its own employees and board members; and the firing of Mark V. Hurd, for expense account irregularities involving a female contract employee. 1 2 Next Page »Hewlett-Packard, the technology giant that has stumbled through repeated embarrassments, was preparing on Wednesday to fire its chief executive, less than one year after naming him to the post, according to several people with knowledge of the board’s actions.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/technology/idea-of-whitman-at-hp-distresses-the-tech-world.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Idea of Whitman at H.P. Distresses the Tech World<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — As speculation swirled Wednesday that Meg Whitman might be brought in to save the troubled Hewlett-Packard, the tech world rendered a verdict: You have got to be kidding.“The notion that H.P. can be fixed by adding a celebrity chief executive is laughable,” said Roger McNamee, managing director of Elevation Partners, an investment firm. Ms. Whitman would be “an unmitigated disaster,” said Charles House, a longtime H.P. engineer who is chancellor of Cogswell Polytechnical College in Silicon Valley. “Her style is so arrogant it gags.” Against such critical backdrop, Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management ranks as a Whitman booster. “It’s not a ridiculous choice,” he said. “But they could have done better.” As the H.P. board — a group that includes Ms. Whitman — was considering firing the current chief executive, Léo Apotheker, Wednesday afternoon, the former eBay executive and unsuccessful candidate for California governor was said to be the leading candidate to succeed him. Mr. Apotheker will have lasted less than a year, apparently because the board deemed his efforts at reviving the company too radical. It was the latest bout of executive turmoil at the once-staid firm. Ms. Whitman, 55, would bring a high profile to the job as well as some baggage. She is bit of a lightning rod in Silicon Valley, where founders are allowed to have outsize personalities but mere managers are not. She turned eBay into a rousing first generation dot-com success, but her venture into politics last year proved a costly debacle. Each vote she received cost her about $45. The Democratic candidate Jerry Brown, who spent little by comparison, handily won. She is now a “strategic limited partner” at the venture firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield &amp; Byers. Her role, whatever its exact dimensions, did not prompt a lot of news. She did not return a call for comment Wednesday. After starting her career as a brand manager for Procter &amp; Gamble, Ms. Whitman became a consultant, then had executive stints at Disney, Hasbro and Stride Rite. Her arrival at eBay in March 1998 was a sign that the first generation Internet companies were growing up and needed professional managers from outside the industry to prosper. Over the next nine years, Ms. Whitman took the fledgling auction site from a few employees to 15,000. Revenue grew from less than $100 million to nearly $8 billion. She oversaw two major acquisitions — the online payment firm PayPal, which was a good idea, and the Internet telephone company Skype, which was not. But eBay, like that other sensation in the first dot-com boom, Yahoo, seemed to stall in the middle of the last decade. Grand plans to extend the site’s dominance into local commerce went nowhere. Wall Street noticed; its stock has been flat for years. How much of this is Ms. Whitman’s fault is a matter of debate. She left in 2007 with a fortune exceeding a billion dollars. She then decided to run for California governor, an unusual move for someone who was revealed during the campaign to have rarely bothered to vote. She won the Republican nomination but had a great deal of trouble articulating her vision for making the state solvent again. The campaign was marred by mishaps, including the revelation by a Whitman housekeeper that she was undocumented, and that Ms. Whitman had known it. “She was undone by her housekeeper,” said the tech analyst Rob Enderle. “H.P.’s biggest problem right now is leaks from one or more disloyal employees. If Whitman can’t contain a housekeeper, it is unlikely she’ll be able to address this problem.” Mr. Enderle and other analysts said there was a difference between creating a consumer tech company like eBay and fixing a diversified and complicated firm like H.P., whose roots stretch deep into Silicon Valley history but where the morale is low after a string of scandals and the path to recovery is murky. “Whitman took eBay and made it an intergalactic colossus, but built it rather than doing a turnaround,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “She’s untested.” On the plus side, he said she had “magnificent communication skills and a laserlike focus.” She will need all that and more if she wants to be the first H.P. chief executive in many years to survive the post.

It’s why he was hired in the first place.The answer, say many involved in the process, lies squarely with the troubled Hewlett-Packard board. “It has got to be the worst board in the history of business,” Tom Perkins, a former H.P. director and a Silicon Valley legend, told me. Interviews with several current and former directors and people close to them involved in the search that resulted in the hiring of Mr. Apotheker reveal a board that, while composed of many accomplished individuals, as a group was rife with animosities, suspicion, distrust, personal ambitions and jockeying for power that rendered it nearly dysfunctional. Among their revelations: when the search committee of four directors narrowed the candidates to three finalists, no one else on the board was willing to interview them. And when the committee finally chose Mr. Apotheker and again suggested that other directors meet him, no one did. Remarkably, when the 12-member board voted to name Mr. Apotheker as the successor to the recently ousted chief executive, Mark Hurd, most board members had never met Mr. Apotheker. “I admit it was highly unusual,” one board member who hadn’t met Mr. Apotheker told me. “But we were just too exhausted from all the infighting.” During Mr. Apotheker’s brief tenure, once-proud H.P. has become a laughingstock in Silicon Valley. Its results have weakened, its stock has plummeted and his strategy shifts have puzzled people inside and outside the company. Hewlett-Packard did not respond to an email seeking comment. The immediate cause of dissension was the board’s decision in August 2010 to demand the resignation of Mr. Hurd, who had himself assumed the top position in the midst of board leaks and a phone pretexting scandal surrounding efforts to determine the source of the leaks that had laid bare irreconcilable differences among directors. He had replaced Carly Fiorina, who was also summarily ousted by the board. Though not without detractors, Mr. Hurd pulled off one of the great rescue missions in American corporate history, refocusing the strife-ridden company and leading it to five years of revenue gains and a stock that soared 130 percent. Then came an incendiary letter from the activist lawyer Gloria Allred, charging that Mr. Hurd had sexually harassed a former soft-core pornography actress named Jodie Fisher, whom he had hired as a consultant for H.P. The accusations set off another fierce board battle. The board named a committee headed by Robert L. Ryan, a former Medtronic executive and H.P.’s lead director, and Lucille Salhany, another director who was a former chairwoman of Fox Broadcasting, to investigate the accusations. An outside law firm did not find that that Mr. Hurd was guilty of the harassment charges but had submitted false expense reports in what seemed an effort to conceal the relationship. Mr. Hurd denied having an affair with Ms. Fisher (as he has since done publicly) and said his assistant had first contacted her after seeing her on a reality television program. As one director told me, “We said, ‘Mark, just tell us the truth.’ He stuck to this story. He interviewed the woman twice, there was no search firm, no job posting, no discussion with anyone else. He met with her alone on more than one occasion. To be the hostess at a party? Give me a break.” Complicating matters was evidence H.P. obtained from Mr. Hurd’s office computer showing that he had viewed videos of Ms. Fisher. Once some board members became convinced that Mr. Hurd had not been totally truthful, they insisted he had to be fired. Mr. Ryan convened a meeting to decide Mr. Hurd’s fate by saying that he wanted to give every director an opportunity to speak, but that he would begin. “I don’t believe him,” he said bluntly, and noted that under H.P.’s employee guidelines, any other employee who lied to the board would be fired. He was strongly backed by Ms. Salhany. Two other members, Joel Z. Hyatt, a media executive and founder of Hyatt Legal Plans, and John Joyce, a former private equity partner, were adamant that Mr. Hurd should stay, at least long enough to groom a successor and arrange for an orderly transition. “They were very vocal about it,” said one director. “It’s healthy to have differing opinions, but this went too far. It became fractious. There were so many hard feelings. It became difficult to conduct business in a civil manner.” 1 2 Next Page »The mystery isn’t why Hewlett-Packard is likely to part ways with its chief executive, Léo Apotheker, after just a year in the job.

Gains a Prolific Deal Maker<date>September 22, 2011, 5:41 pm</date><text>  Now that Hewlett-Packard has confirmed that Meg Whitman is its new chief executive, it’s worth wondering what kind of leader she will be. There are plenty of clues in Ms. Whitman’s nine-year tenure as eBay‘s chief executive. During that time, she built the online market place from a 30-employee minnow of a company to a 15,000-employee whale with $8 billion in annual revenue. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links H.P. press release H.P.'s Deal Options Much of that was accomplished organically, as eBay grew into a dominant online bazaar. But much of that was also through deal-making, a skill she may be expected to bring to her new role. Under Ms. Whitman, eBay struck about 40 deals worth more than $9.6 billion, according to data from Capital IQ. H.P.’s newly promoted executive chairman, Ray Lane, noted her record in a conference call with analysts announcing her appointment on Thursday. “I was a supplier” of many of the companies that she purchased, he said, alluding to his other job as a managing partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. EBay’s first major takeover was the company’s 2002 acquisition of PayPal, a $1.5 billion transaction that eventually made eBay one of the world’s biggest online payments processors. But the company’s biggest deal, its $3.1 billion takeover of Skype, is more of a mixed bag. EBay outbid the likes of Google and Yahoo, ostensibly with the intention of folding the video-chatting service into its market services, allowing buyers and sellers to talk to each other. That never fully took off, leading eBay to write down Skype’s value by $900 million. In 2009, eBay sold 70 percent of Skype for just over $2 billion to an investor group led by Silver Lake, leaving eBay holding onto a loss and the ignominy of what Silicon Valley denizens called one of the worst deals of all time. Skype did pay off, eventually — for its new owners, who sold the service to Microsoft earlier this year for $8.5 billion. That deal instantly increased the value of eBay’s remaining stake to $2.3 billion from about $620 million. A third notable eBay deal was the company’s 2004 purchase of a 28.4 percent stake in Craigslist for $32 million. It’s unclear how much the stake is worth, given that Craiglist is privately held. Still, even then it was another headache of a deal. In 2007, the two began to fight when eBay began a new classified-ad site that Craiglist viewed as a competitor. Craigslist diluted eBay’s stake down to 24.85 percent, stripping the company of its board seat. That prompted a lawsuit by eBay, touching off one of the stranger legal battles in Silicon Valley. (EBay claimed victory last year, after a judge ruled that Craigslist had improperly shaved down its stake.) At H.P., Ms. Whitman will be confronted by a company struggling to redefine itself as a corporate software services provider. It has already agreed to buy Autonomy of Britain for $11.7 billion, a deal that would be exceptionally difficult to back out of. H.P. is also weighing a divestiture of its PC business and “strategic options” for its webOs unit. So far, H.P.’s board is relatively comfortable with that strategy; it just didn’t believe that its just-fired chief executive, Léo Apotheker, was the right person to carry that plan out. On Thursday’s call, Ms. Whitman said she was “excited” by the Autonomy acquisition. Of the potential sale or spinoff of the P.C. business, she allowed only this: “We’re committed to doing the work right now to determine the best path going forward.” She added that time was of the essence, and that H.P. would conclude its review of any possible spinoff by the end of the year. “It’s not like fine wine,” she said of the company’s pending decision. “It doesn’t get better with age.” It remains to be seen whether Ms. Whitman will reach into her deal-making arsenal will finally set H.P. on the right path.</text></article>

A few friendly upperclassmen spring into action. But wait: there is something odd, or at least oddly corporate, about this welcome wagon. These U.N.C. students are all wearing identical T-shirts from American Eagle Outfitters. Turns out three of them are working for that youth clothing chain on this late August morning, as what are known in the trade as “brand ambassadors” or “campus evangelists” — and they have recruited several dozen friends as a volunteer move-in crew. Even before Ms. Ismail can find her dorm or meet her roommate, they cheerily unload her family’s car. Then they lug her belongings to her dorm. Along the way, they dole out American Eagle coupons, American Eagle water canisters and American Eagle pens. Ms. Ismail, 18, of Charlotte, welcomes the help. “I’ll probably always remember it,” she says. American Eagle Outfitters certainly hopes so, as do a growing number of companies that are hiring college students to represent brands on campuses across the nation. This fall, an estimated 10,000 American college students will be working on hundreds of campuses — for cash, swag, job experience or all three — marketing everything from Red Bull to Hewlett-Packard PCs. For the companies hiring them, the motivation is clear: college students spent about $36 billion on things like clothing, computers and cellphones during the 2010-11 school year alone, according to projections from Re:Fuel, a media and promotions firm specializing in the youth market. And who knows the students at, say, U.N.C., better than the students at U.N.C.? Corporations have been pitching college students for decades on products from cars to credit cards. But what is happening on campuses today is without rival, in terms of commercializing everyday college life. Companies from Microsoft on down are increasingly seeking out the big men and women on campus to influence their peers. The students most in demand are those who are popular — ones involved in athletics, music, fraternities or sororities. Thousands of Facebook friends help, too. What companies want are students with inside knowledge of school traditions and campus hotspots. In short, they want students with the cred to make brands seem cool, in ways that a TV or magazine ad never could. “We are the people who understand what kinds of things the students will be open to,” says Alex Stegall, a Carolina junior who recruited about 20 members of her sorority for the American Eagle promotion. “It’s marketing for the students, by the students.” It’s a good deal for the student marketers, who can earn several hundred to several thousand dollars a semester in salary, perks, products and services, depending on the company. But the trend poses challenges for university officials, especially at a time when many schools are themselves embracing corporate sponsorships to help stage events for students. Just how far one big company — Target — has permeated this university was evident at freshmen welcome week in late August, at what students and administrators alike characterized as a touchstone party for the class of 2015. As part of the official university program, Target sponsored a welcome dinner on a Friday. Then, on Saturday, for the first real social event for freshmen, it hired buses to ferry students to a Target superstore in Durham for late-night shopping, says Winston B. Crisp, the university’s vice chancellor for student affairs. From the school’s point of view, Mr. Crisp says, the excursion is both social and practical. It’s a convenient way for freshmen to pick up last-minute items. Equally important, he says, is that shopping at midnight keeps freshmen away from alcohol-fueled parties on their first weekend. University administrators supervise the event, he says, and control the marketing messages. But Mr. Crisp says he was unaware of the American Eagle effort on his campus. He worried aloud that students and parents might mistake such promotions as having the university’s imprimatur. “They are not supposed to be using the opportunity to help people move in as a way of forwarding commercial ventures,” he said, standing near the cash registers at Target that evening, as upperclassmen handed out free VitaminWater, Combos and packages of macaroni and cheese. He added: “So it’s a bit of a dilemma.” 1 2 3 4 Next Page »CHAPEL HILL, N.C.</text></article>

Apple’s employees, customers, shareholders, board and Steve Jobs’s successor, Tim Cook, must hope the answer turns out to be a lot different than at the world’s largest computer company, neighboring Hewlett-Packard.Just a year ago, Mark Hurd, H.P.’s chief executive, was forced to resign in the midst of allegations of sexual harassment and expense account irregularities, many details of which remain shrouded in secrecy. (The board concluded the sexual harassment claim was unfounded, but that Mr. Hurd’s lack of candor had cost him its confidence.) The vote to demand his resignation was unanimous, although the board was sharply divided, especially over how to handle his departure and seek a new C.E.O. But H.P. was so big, so dominant in most of its markets, and so profitable that Mr. Hurd was dispensable, according to people familiar with the board’s reasoning. “We don’t need you,” one board member bluntly told Mr. Hurd, or words to that effect. So how has Hewlett-Packard fared under new leadership? On Aug. 18, H.P. announced simultaneously that it was exploring “strategic alternatives” and might sell its dominant personal computer business, which accounts for roughly a third of the company’s revenue; that it was scrapping its new, much ballyhooed TouchPad tablet computer; and that it was acquiring a British software concern, Autonomy, for $10.3 billion, a steep 11 times revenue. The stock plunged 20 percent to $23.60 a share. When Mr. Hurd resigned, it was just under $46, so the one-year decline amounted to 49 percent. (The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index gained about 3 percent over the same period.) “I didn’t know there was such a thing as corporate suicide, but now we know that there is,” a former H.P. director, the venture capitalist Tom Perkins, told me this week. “It’s just astonishing.” “H.P. was the epicenter of Silicon Valley, geographically, culturally and historically,” an executive at another technology concern said. “Is there any analogy for an institution so respected that has fallen so far so fast? I can’t think of one.” No one claims that Mr. Hurd, now president of Oracle, is another Steve Jobs. His critics have portrayed him as a glorified chief operating officer who ruthlessly cut costs and starved innovation. Still, there’s no denying the results during the six years he led H.P.: pro forma earnings leaped 242 percent on a 57 percent gain in revenue (to $120.4 billion); H.P.’s stock price rose 130 percent, to over $45 a share; free cash flow surged 138 percent and operating margins doubled. Forbes magazine put him on its cover in April 2010 with the headline: “He Wants It All.” To replace Mr. Hurd, H.P.’s board hired Léo Apotheker, the former chief executive of the German software giant SAP, even though SAP had declined to renew Mr. Apotheker’s contract after just seven months in the top position and he was linked to a software theft scandal that cost SAP a $1.3 billion damages award (he has denied any direct involvement). Nor, as a software executive, did he have much experience with hardware, especially the printers and servers at the core of H.P.’s franchise. On Jan. 20 this year, H.P. announced the resignations of four directors, two of whom had initially supported Mr. Hurd during board deliberations and resisted his immediate ouster, according to people with knowledge of the decision. Mr. Apotheker served on a committee that proposed the five new directors to replace them, prompting sharp criticism from the shareholder watchdog Institutional Shareholder Services, which said H.P. had violated its own rules in allowing its chief executive to play a role in choosing board members who are supposed to be independent. (H.P.’s chairman, Ray Lane, denied any violation of rules, and told Bloomberg News that the new board members “aren’t buddies of Apotheker,” adding that “because Léo and I know the industry, it would be hard to pick any name we don’t know.” An H.P. spokeswoman said that the company drew praise from many corporate governance experts for shaking up the board.) After taking time to study H.P.’s operations, Mr. Apotheker hosted a three-day conference, “HP Summit 2011,” beginning March 14 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, a venue long associated with dazzling new product announcements from Apple. His presentation emphasized cloud computing and software, including WebOS, the highly regarded operating system H.P. gained when it acquired Palm Inc. under Mr. Hurd. Mr. Apotheker revealed that WebOS would be the future operating system in all the company’s computers and said that H.P. would be shipping 100 million devices using it. He said curiously little about H.P.’s vaunted printer or server divisions, which accounted for the bulk of the company’s profits. 1 2 Next Page »How much does a chief executive really matter at a multibillion-dollar technology company?

    <article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/hewlett-packards-look-east-strategy/?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Hewlett-Packard's Look-East Strategy<date>August 25, 2011, 10:53 am</date><text>No one is giving Hewlett-Packard‘s chief executive, Léo Apotheker, high marks for the new strategy he presented last week. It seemed a flip from the corporate game plan Mr. Apotheker had championed only a few months earlier. H.P. is paying a high price for a business software company. And it may have undermined the value of its personal computer business by saying it was considering selling it off. But it’s not hard to see the trends behind the revised thinking at the Silicon Valley headquarters of H.P., as the company retreats from PCs to focus more on selling more profitable data-serving computers and specialized software to corporations and governments — the so-called enterprise business. Yet H.P.’s strategy also has a familiar look. It’s I.B.M.‘s strategy, but embarked upon years later. A fresh piece of evidence for the logic of an enterprise-first strategy came Tuesday evening. IDC reported that server computer shipments in the second quarter of 2011 increased 8.5 percent and revenue rose 17.9 percent from the year-earlier quarter. By contrast, PC shipments for the quarter inched up 2.6 percent in the quarter, while revenue rose 6 percent. Companies are investing in servers and data-analysis software to help them handle and make sense of the rising tide of data, generated inside the company and outside — customers, Web traffic, social network communications, and other sources. I.B.M., headquartered in Armonk, N.Y., sold off its PC business in 2005 to a Chinese company, Lenovo. But I.B.M. did not tip its hand well in advance of the sale, as H.P. felt compelled to do. For months, Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief, was negotiating with Lenovo and visiting senior government officials in Beijing to get their assent. Word of the deal leaked out just days before I.B.M. announced the sale to Lenovo in December 2004. The sell-off carried a lot of symbolic freight, for I.B.M. and the PC industry. When it entered the market in 1981, I.B.M. brought the personal computer into the mainstream, endorsing what many still viewed as a plaything for hobbyists. For years, I.B.M. executives had said — as H.P. executives have — that even if not a big money maker, the PC business was “strategic,” pulling along sales of other hardware, software and services. But Mr. Palmisano made the unsentimental decision to shed the business and invest money and management energy elsewhere. H.P.’s purchase of Autonomy for $10 billion looks pricey, but the British company is a leading maker of sophisticated data-analysis software. Once again, H.P. is following I.B.M.’s lead. Most of the major software companies have bought specialist makers of software that helps corporations manage information — known as “business intelligence” or “data-analytics” software. But I.B.M. has been the most aggressive over several years, spending $14 billion on 25 companies that focus on data analytics. I.B.M. has added industry experts in services and researchers to the business, which now employs 8,000 consultants and 200 mathematicians. I.B.M. said recently it expects its analytics business to grow to $16 billion by 2015. Before I.B.M. sold its PC business and invested heavily in software and services, Big Blue and H.P. were much more comparable companies than they are today. The difference can be seen in the numbers — the data, if you will. Today, I.B.M.’s profit margins are about double H.P.’s margins. And the stock market value of I.B.M., at $198 billion, is nearly four times H.P.’s $52 billion. In the last few days, there have been market speculation that H.P. is sufficiently weakened to be a takeover target itself. Oracle has been mentioned as the most likely bidder. In a research note on Wednesday, Dave Novosel, an analyst at Gimme Credit, said that the only H.P. business that would really interest Oracle would be H.P.’s server computer division. His research note was titled, “Oracle Has Better Options.” I.B.M. stands on the sidelines, enjoying its competitive advantage. Years ago, it made the difficult strategic choices H.P. is grappling with today.</text></article>

In recent years, technology companies have been cutting their losses with increasing speed. Google proudly released Wave, its platform of collaborative work tools, to the general public in May 2010. It canceled Wave 77 days later. Palm announced its first tablet, the Foleo, on May 30, 2007. By Sept. 4, the company halted development and the product was never sold. Pure Digital, maker of the Flip camcorder, had planned to release the Flip-Live on April 13, but Cisco, which had acquired Pure Digital in 2009, shut the entire division on April 12. These days, big technology companies — particularly those in the hypercompetitive smartphone and tablet industries — are starting to resemble Hollywood film studios. Every release needs to be a blockbuster, and the only measure of success is the opening-weekend gross. There is little to no room for the sleeper indie hit that builds good word of mouth to become a solid performer over time. When Microsoft released the Xbox 360 in 2005, there were widespread reliability issues and the console faced serious competition from the Nintendo Wii, yet the company stayed the course, and now the Xbox is one of the best-selling video game consoles of all time. That kind of tenacity seems to be in diminishing supply. Some analysts trace the origin of this blockbuster-or-bust mentality to Apple. Each release of the company’s popular iPads and iPhones crosses over into being a mainstream media event. Al Hilwa, an analyst at the research firm IDC, described the accelerated lifecycle of high-end hardware as “Darwinian.” “There’s a level of desperation from anyone whose name is not Apple,” said Mr. Hilwa. The crush of tech bloggers and Twitter-using early adopters who chronicle every bit of news — good and bad — about new phones and tablets also raises the stakes around how well new products perform in the marketplace. “You know pretty quickly, and in a very public way, whether a product is successful or not,” said Mr. Hilwa. Similar to opening week at the movies, early reviews on the Web panning a new tablet or phone can be disastrous for its makers. “Once you lose momentum, it's hard to regain it,” said Chris Jones, an analyst at Canalys. The rapid life cycles of products can play with the affections of consumers, who may rush out to be the first on their block with a new product, only to find that the manufacturer has canceled any future support or development weeks after it went on sale. Neal LoCurto, the owner of TeamLogic IT, an information technology consulting company in Syosset, N.Y., said he bought his TouchPad the morning it went on sale. “On release day I went to Best Buy that morning and waited at the door,” Mr. LoCurto said. “I was the first one in and the first one out.” Mr. LoCurto, who ultimately grew unhappy with the TouchPad because of the lack of apps, received a refund for his TouchPad, but he says he no longer trusts H.P. “I feel like they lied to us,” Mr. LoCurto said. “They didn’t give it a chance.” Companies kill new products more quickly now because of the higher cost of staying competitive, said Jim McGregor, research director for In-Stat, a market research firm. Quickly pulling the plug on an obvious failure makes sense, although it can be embarrassing. “The life cycles are very short because there is obviously huge competition,” Mr. McGregor said. “Even if you do have a blockbuster, you know you’re going to get leapfrogged in six months. You have to come out with something that really knocks off the pants and then follow it up. You can’t just sit there and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got a success.’ ” In the case of the TouchPad, analysts agree it failed because its operating system, webOS, had few of the apps that made Apple’s iPad a runaway hit, he said. Microsoft’s Kin had a similar problem. Mr. McGregor said that Google TV, Google’s Internet-connected television accessory, faded into obscurity because of content providers declined to make their content available. Google had lined up various manufacturers as partners, including LG, Toshiba and Sharp, only to tell many of them last December to delay the release of their Google TV products. While Google’s strategy for Google TV remains unclear, none of those partners have come out with a Google TV product. “The content is worth more than the device,” said Mr. McGregor. “If you don’t have everything — the content, the applications and the experience — you might as well drop your anchor and jump off the ship.” Even mighty Apple was not always so skilled. Like other companies today, Apple suffered a streak of bad luck with new products more than a decade ago and, like them, it cut its losses. The company killed the Power Mac G4 Cube, a desktop computer, in 2001 after only 11 months because consumers believed the price was too high and balked at having to buy a monitor separately. Two days after announcing it would kill the TouchPad, H.P. started unloading its inventory through a fire sale. The steep discount — 80 percent off the original price — succeeded in setting off a buying frenzy that H.P.’s executives had hoped for when they introduced the device. H.P.’s online store, along with Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart, quickly ran out of TouchPads after putting them on sale for $100 for the 16G version and $150 for the 32G version. When originally available in July, they were listed at $500 and $600. People strategized on online message boards about how to find a TouchPad. H.P.’s call center was overwhelmed. “All this clamoring for the TouchPad, kind of bittersweet,” H.P.’s customer service arm said in a post on Twitter.Seven weeks after it was put on sale, Hewlett-Packard killed its TouchPad tablet, the company’s competitor to Apple’s iPad.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/tablet-makers-more-fighting-please/?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Tablet Makers, More Fighting, Please<date>August 24, 2011, 8:06 am</date><text>Competition is good. Competition benefits consumers. This is not a ideological screed, just a simple observation about what happens to goods and services when there is more than one provider of that product. I’m ultimately talking about the state of the tablet industry, but let’s start by talking about cars. Let’s say you were going to buy a family sedan today. You would have several options to choose from: the Toyota Camry, the Honda Accord, the Ford Fusion and the Hyundai Sonata are just a few that leap to mind. If you were researching these cars, you would discover a couple of things: Each model has won some magazine’s multicar comparison or another, and the overall opinion would be that these cars, as a group, are all quite good. Personal preferences and the availabilities of certain pricing deals may sway your opinion one way or another, but nobody could reasonably say that the car you picked was materially worse than another. And that’s because competition breeds excellence. Ask anyone who pays attention to the car industry and they will tell you that the family-sedan segment is just brutal, with manufacturers fighting tooth and nail over every sale. In fact, that market has become more competitive in recent years. It used to just be the Camry and the Accord fighting for supremacy, but now you have new (Hyundai) and old (Ford) competitors, among others, joining the fight with interesting, well-made, compelling products. It’s a great time to be shopping for a new family sedan. Compare that with the state of the tablet market today. Hewlett-Packard is in retreat. Research in Motion is in a holding pattern. Motorola has been sold and its tablet is now an afterthought. Samsung fights the good fight, but it trails Apple’s market share by 50 percentage points. Apple is not just ahead of the pack, it almost is the pack. Now, some would say that this is also a simple result of economic laws at work: Apple makes a superior product, therefore it gets most of the sales. Great. But you know what would be really great? Apple and Google/Microsoft/H.P./Anyone locked in an epic battle for tablet supremacy, each side releasing new and better products at a furious pace, each dropping prices substantially at a steady clip. Now, some would argue that this is already happening — that Apple is driving innovation and creativity with each upgrade of the iPad it releases. But think what it would be like if you had two companies doing that — or three. This isn’t about whether you prefer Apple or Android for your tablet. This isn’t about picking sides. As a consumer, I want there to be robust competition across the board. I want Coke and Pepsi. Target and Wal-Mart. Engadget and Gizmodo. If you’re a fan of Apple, you want there to be a worthy rival to push it, to keep its feet to the fire. If you don’t like Apple, you want someone else in the game so that Apple doesn’t suck all the air out of the room. And you want Apple to do the same pushing and foot-scorching to its competitor that another company would do to it. In any market, as far as the consumer is concerned, there should be blood.</text></article>

A liquidation sale on Saturday set off demand that H.P.’s computer division only wishes it had seen in July, when the tablet first appeared in stores. It cleared the inventories at H.P.’s online store along with those of Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Target, Sam’s Club and Office Depot. The situation at bricks and mortar retailers was a bit confused, with reports of some stores offering the discount with a little prodding and others, like Best Buy, waiting until Sunday to do so in stores. H.P. cut the price of the TouchPad to as low as $100 for the 16 gigabyte version and $150 for the 32GB version. When introduced a month and a half ago, the tablets were listed at $500 for the 16GB version and $600 for the 32GB version (they were subsequently discounted by 20 percent). The fire sale is an ignominious end to the TouchPad, a would-be competitor to Apple’s iPad. Although H.P.’s executives touted the TouchPad as a credible challenger in the burgeoning tablet market, it never generated much interest with consumers. Leo Apotheker, the company’s chief executive, quickly killed it as part of a larger corporate overhaul. Hours after putting the device on sale on Saturday, H.P.’s online store put up a notice saying that it was “out of stock” and to “check back soon.” The intense traffic overwhelmed the Web site at times. H.P. is asking that people still interested in buying a TouchPad sign up for alerts about future availability. Not all retailers are participating in the price, at least as of Sunday afternoon. Amazon.com, for example, listed the TouchPad for sale without the steep discount. However, it did offer the discount briefly as part of its lightning deals.</text></article>

If H.P. goes through with the idea, it would follow I.B.M., an early PC maker, which was one of the first to recognize the long-term problems and, in 2005, sold its business to Lenovo, a Chinese company. Other American makers like Compaq (acquired by H.P.), Gateway and Packard Bell were absorbed by others or just faded away. Depending on how H.P. sheds the unit — it could sell or spin it off as a separate company — only two American PC makers would remain. One of them, Dell, struggles for every percentage point of market share. The other, Apple, prospers. And the reason it does highlights the shift from a PC-centric era to one dominated by smartphones and tablets. H.P., Dell and, indeed, every PC maker worldwide, has been unable to make a tablet consumers feel they must have. At the same time H.P. said that it might spin off PCs, it killed off its tablet, the TouchPad, after just a few weeks on store shelves. Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent. “It’s definitely weighing on the computer makers, and it is something that will weigh on them for some time,” said Louis Miscioscia, an analyst with Collins Stewart. “The tablet effect is real,” said Leo Apotheker, H.P.’s chief executive, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledging that the TouchPad had failed to live up to expectations and that it would have cost too much to compete. “It’s very different from where the business was going 10 years ago,” Mr. Apotheker said. On Friday, H.P.’s shares fell 20 percent in reaction to his plans. Michael S. Dell, Dell’s chief executive, took the opportunity to poke fun at the prospect of H.P. unloading its PC unit by saying in a message on Twitter that “they’re calling it a separation, but it feels like a divorce.” Following up with more sarcasm, he said, “If HP spins off its computer business ... maybe they will call it Compaq.” Mr. Dell was clearly enjoying the moment, but his company faces the same market forces as H.P. Its overall PC business has been flat. Recently, Dell has pared back some of its consumer products, including a 5-inch Streak tablet, while keeping a 7-inch tablet. Together, they eked out barely 1 percent of the market, according to ABI Research. Like H.P., Dell is pushing its enterprise business, which has higher margins. But David Johnson, Dell’s senior vice president of corporate strategy, said his company had no plans to follow in H.P.’s footsteps and split off its PC business. “We have no plans to change our strategy,” he said. Tablets remain the hope of other PC makers and phone makers. By next year, tablet sales in the United States will outpace those of netbooks, the mini-laptops people use to surf the Web, according to Forrester Research. Netbooks were considered a salvation for the PC industry when they were introduced a few years ago, but they have since fallen out of favor with consumers. But buyers see little need to buy any tablet other than iPad, even if it is slightly more expensive than some of its rivals, analysts said. “The performance still isn’t there for a lot of them,” said Richard Doherty, research director for the Envisioneering Group, a market research and consulting firm. “And it’s not just the product, it’s the ecosystem behind it.” For that matter, selling tablets is no easier for the smartphone makers. Motorola Mobility, which Google said this week that it would buy, got nowhere with its Xoom. Research in Motion entered the tablet market this spring with a long history of building mobile devices. Still, the company has struggled to get consumers to buy its tablet, the PlayBook, which it introduced earlier this year. RIM says it shipped 500,000 PlayBooks during its last fiscal quarter. Kevin Burden, a vice president at ABI Research, estimated that only 40 to 50 percent of those tablets found buyers. Shoppers were not charmed by the PlayBook’s inability to directly check corporate e-mail — they have to connect wirelessly to BlackBerry phones — and lack of applications. 1 2 Next Page »Although the world is dependent on personal computers, making them has not been a great business for most American companies for almost a decade.</text></article>

The British investment bank is the sole arranger of a £5 billion ($8.3 billion) one-year loan to Hewlett-Packard for the deal, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. It is meant to supplement H.P.’s own (mostly offshore) cash contribution to the deal. Precise terms of the interest rate weren’t disclosed; all that’s in the filing is this: Interest on borrowings in Sterling is payable at rates per annum equal to a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin and for borrowings in Dollars at a fluctuating base rate equal to Barclays’ adjusted base rate plus the applicable margin, or a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin. (Libor is the the London interbank offered rate, a benchmark for overnight loans between banks; the three-month British pound rate was 0.87 percent on Friday.) The move is reminiscent of JPMorgan Chase‘s blockbuster $20 billion loan to AT&amp;T for its $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA. That loan, which accounted for nearly all of the $25 billion cash portion of AT&amp;T’s offer, was one of the biggest ever made in support of a loan. And it was a public show of JPMorgan’s strength as a major corporate lender. Part of the rationale for such a big loan is speed and certainty. A buyer doesn’t need to undertake the normally time-consuming process of finding enough lenders to provide the capital. (That it also helps clamp down on leaks is an added bonus to the company as well.)

And it’s worth explaining why the loan is going toward a $12.7 billion acquisition, not just $10.25 billion, as the initial reports said. The $10.25 billion accounts for only Autonomy’s outstanding shares. The British company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it has a number of convertible bonds that can be exchanged into common shares. So on a fully diluted basis, the deal is worth $11.69 billion. Shareholders of Autonomy certainly appeared happy with the deal. Shares of the company surged 74 percent in trading on the London Stock Exchange on Friday — its biggest gain since the tech boom days of 2000.</text></article>

Plans Big Shift Toward Business Customers<date>Published: August 18, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — In a sweeping change for Hewlett-Packard, Leo Apotheker, the technology giant’s chief executive, said Thursday that he was considering spinning off the company’s personal computer business into a separate company and spending $10 billion on Autonomy, a business software maker.By acquiring Autonomy, based in Britain, Mr. Apotheker would sharply refocus the company on business services and products. He has been trying to speed the company’s growth, which has stagnated amid internal missteps, a sour economy and shifting consumer tastes. Mr. Apotheker’s plan includes killing off the TouchPad tablet, introduced into stores only weeks ago, Pre smartphones and other WebOS products it acquired last year when it bought Palm for $1.2 billion. A spinoff of the PC unit would also reverse H.P.’s $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002. “It’s Day 1 of the transformation,” Mr. Apotheker said in an interview. He spoke of the “difficult decisions” that had to be made, but said he was seeking better performance from the company. Splitting off the PC unit would eliminate the drag of a slumping, low-margin business on H.P. Instead, Mr. Apotheker, who joined H.P. last year, is trying to move toward providing corporate customers with more services and cloud computing — a term used to describe delivering products and services online — that he says is more “high value.” The strategy challenges I.B.M and Oracle, two giants in the market. By unloading its computer business, H.P.’s would follow in the footsteps of  I.B.M., which sold its computer unit to Lenovo, a Chinese company, in 2005. H.P. said it would take 12 to 18 months to decide what to do with the PC unit. Meanwhile, it will continue to run the business as usual. Mr. Apotheker said the company did not intend to dispose of its printer business. “Enterprise is where the growth is, that’s where the margins are,” said Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company. Wall Street has been concerned about H.P.’s growth ever since Mr. Apotheker joined the company, and the weakening economy has added to the uncertainty. A series of disappointing quarters and forecasts had sent the company’s shares down nearly 22 percent since the start of the year before Thursday. Shares of H.P. fell $1.88, or 6 percent, to close at $29.51. Acquiring Autonomy, which makes software that searches and keeps track of corporate and government data, would greatly enhance H.P.’s shift to software and business services. The company has become one of the biggest technology firms in Britain and counts BP, Ford Motor and the United States Defense Department among its customers. Autonomy would be H.P.’s third-largest acquisition ever, after Compaq and Electronic Data Systems. The $10 billion offer for Autonomy would represent a rich 64 percent premium over its market value. It produced almost $1 billion in revenue in the 12 months that ended June 30. Mr. Apotheker said that Autonomy would get access to H.P.’s huge customer base. Its products would be sold across H.P. business, he said. That also was H.P.’s strategy in buying Compaq. It gave the company the scale to cut costs and secure favorable prices on parts. It was also supposed to give it clout with corporations that were also seeking printers, servers, storage and data management services. As recently as February, Todd Bradley, H.P.’s executive vice president for the company’s computer division, insisted in an interview that the PC was still a valuable part of H.P.’s business. He dismissed speculation that the company would dump the unit. “The PC business has been strategically important to H.P,” he said. “The strategic importance hasn’t changed as the leadership changes.” H.P. has dominated the PC business, but in recent months the industry has gone through a downward turn with the shift from desktops and laptops to tablets.  1 2 Next Page » Contributing reporting were Evelyn Rusli, Michael J. de la Merced and Jeffrey Cane from New York, and Julia Werdigier from London.SAN FRANCISCO — In a sweeping change for Hewlett-Packard, Leo Apotheker, the technology giant’s chief executive, said Thursday that he was considering spinning off the company’s personal computer business into a separate company and spending $10 billion on Autonomy, a business software maker.</text></article>

Among the prominent names in listing are two boutique firms. One is Qatalyst Partners, the investment bank run by Frank P. Quattrone. Mr. Quattrone, the Silicon Valley veteran, who also had a hand in Motorola Mobility‘s proposed $12.5 billion sale to Google earlier this week, sold two other companies to H.P. last year: Palm for $1.2 billion and 3Par for $2 billion. And then there’s Perella Weinberg Partners, one of H.P.’s two main advisers, alongside Barclays Capital. Perella is also advising H.P. on the possible spinoff of its personal computing business. Meanwhile, Barclays is also the sole arranger of debt financing for H.P., in a role similar to JPMorgan Chase‘s blockbuster lender role in AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion deal for T-Mobile USA. (To recap: JPMorgan provided an enormous $20 billion bridge loan to AT&amp;T, a longtime client. Of course, JPMorgan later syndicated the loan.) While DealBook couldn’t learn how much Barclays is lending, the bank is expected to cover a significant amount of the purchase price. The deal could lead to relatively big paydays for the companies’ main advisers. H.P. could pay Perella and Barclays $27 million to $34 million, according to calculations by the consulting firm Freeman &amp; Company.

The short answer: It has a mixed record. In its news release on Thursday afternoon, H.P. also confirmed that it was considering “strategic alternatives” for its personal computer business. Such options could include a spinoff or a sale of the unit, which was built in large part from the company’s controversial $25 billion purchase of Compaq Computer in 2001. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links H.P. Nears $10 Billion Deal for Autonomy Full Coverage of H.P.'s Transformation And H.P. noted that it will stop making devices based on webOS, a smartphone operating system it acquired when it bought Palm for $1.2 billion last year. The company said that it would “continue to explore” options for the webOS software. H.P. has purchased 102 companies since 1989, according to data from Capital IQ. But aside from a $1.3 billion deal for Verifone in 1997, the company had not spent more than $500 million on a single deal. That is, until its blockbuster Compaq takeover. Heralded at the time as a transformational deal, Compaq turned out to be hotly contested, marred by stiff opposition from shareholders and a bitter proxy contest led by the son of an H.P. co-founder. While the deal eventually passed a shareholder vote, it is still considered one of the more questionable deals of the time. It bulked up the company’s presence in personal computers as the industry was becoming low growth and low margin. H.P. is now considering spinning off or selling the business. Then there’s Palm, the handheld computer pioneer that found itself struggling after BlackBerrys and then iPhones grew popular. The company put itself up for sale last year and drew a flurry of bids. H.P. defeated three other companies in a relatively short bidding war, ultimately agreeing to pay $5.70 a share, a 23 percent premium. H.P. planned to move into the lucrative cellphone and tablet markets with the Palm purchase. But sales of webOS phones and the TouchPad have been disappointing: H.P. cut the price of the latter by $100 recently, and All Things D reported that Best Buy was sitting on mounds of unsold tablets. To be fair, H.P. has had some successes with acquisitions as well. Its $13.9 billion purchase of Electronic Data Systems significantly bolstered the company’s software services business and even inspired a rival, Xerox, to strike a similar deal. It’s too soon to tell how some of H.P.’s other recent deals will do. They have tended to be in software services, like 3Par and ArcSight, though the company also expanded its networking hardware business with a deal for 3Com. These deals were all struck under different management teams. Carly S. Fiorina was famously responsible for the Compaq deal, while Mark V. Hurd pushed for the acquisitions of E.D.S., Palm and 3Par. (The decision to bid competitively for 3Par, however, was made under H.P.’s interim management after Mr. Hurd left the company.) It’s clear that H.P. considers itself as embarking on another transformational acquisition with Autonomy. What isn’t clear is how that story will end. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 19, 2011 An earlier version of this article misstated when the deal for Compaq Computer was announced.

But one of the less obvious ones may be a productive use of the company’s overseas cash pile. The deal is yet another instance of American companies looking for overseas acquisitions to spend money held abroad. Under current tax rules, companies can’t bring that cash home — known as repatriation — without incurring a tax charge. H.P. has confirmed that it will use “offshore cash” and debt financing to pay for the deal. A May research report by JPMorgan Chase estimated that 519 American multinational corporations had $1.375 trillion outside the United States. H.P. had about $12.7 billion in cash on hand as of March 31. A large portion of that stems from the company’s printer division, long regarded as a veritable mint of profits, much of which is held overseas. Other companies have turned to overseas acquisitions to make use of their cash hoards. Most recently, Microsoft tapped into its formidable war chest to buy Netherlands-based Skype for $8.5 billion. General Electric has also been busy with foreign acquisitions, including its $1.3 billion purchase of Britain’s Wellstream earlier this year.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/business/hp-palm-deal-looks-better-with-time.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">H.P.-Palm Deal Looks Better With Time<date>Published: August 16, 2011</date><text>Hewlett-Packard’s $1.2 billion acquisition of Palm last year suddenly looks smarter. Google’s $12.5 billion deal to buy Motorola Mobility this week, and the earlier frenzied bidding for Nortel’s patents, have revealed the riches in mobile computing intellectual property. And H.P. snatched one of the most important troves for a price that now looks cheap. Yet, it could be challenging for H.P. to cash in.A big trove of patents allows the owner to demand royalties from rivals, prevent them from incorporating particular features or at least negotiate from a position of strength. On the simplistic metric of enterprise value per patent, H.P. paid about $750,000 for each of Palm’s roughly 1,600, in line with what Apple, Microsoft and the others did for Nortel’s collection. Google, meanwhile, paid slightly more than $550,000 for each of Motorola’s 17,000-plus patents. But all patents aren’t created equal. For a time, Palm’s products dominated the market for personal digital assistants, precursors to today’s smartphones. The company also later developed an innovative operating system for handsets. So its patents sit in the mobile device sweet spot, whether related to displays, interfaces or other features. On average, those should be worth more than the wider range of Nortel’s or Motorola’s patents. Also instructive is that Palm in its heyday appeared to enjoy needling Apple, though Apple was hesitant to take Palm to court. That suggests some important intellectual property leverage compared with, say, Motorola, a company Apple has sued. It’s difficult to value patent portfolios but it seems likely the one H.P. apparently paid a full price for is now worth a good bit more. Mark V. Hurd, the H.P. chief at the time, said he was buying Palm for its intellectual property, not its smartphone business. But H.P. has yet to reap much benefit. Its underwhelming tablet device is a case in point. The operating system may yet gain traction, especially since H.P. has said it will bundle it with its computers and may license it out. But even if H.P. ends up an also-ran to Apple and Google’s Android, there’s always the option of another patent auction. High-Yield Hopes It has been a while since high-yield bonds really lived up to their name. With markets volatile, typical American junk bonds are yielding more than 8 percent. That’s tasty for investors starving on the Federal Reserve’s zero-rate diet and paranoid about getting whipsawed in volatile equities. Average risk premiums over Treasury yields for subinvestment grade credits fell as low as 4.5 percentage points in February when an economic recovery in the United States looked more assured and the European debt crisis averted. This spread is now 7.1 percentage points on average, for an American junk paper yield of more than 8.3 percent as of Aug. 15. That’s tempting when five-year Treasuries yield less than 1 percent and the overall dividend yield on stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index is around 2.2 percent. Of course, junk bond yields have risen partly because investors have been withdrawing billions of dollars from risky corporate debt markets. Euro zone debt and slowing global economic growth are legitimate concerns. But traditional signposts for high-yield bonds suggest the sell-off has gone far enough to warrant another look. The annual default rate, for one, is expected to end this year at just 1.5 percent. That’s hardly recession territory. In 2009, it surpassed 10 percent. A prolonged closing of credit markets would trip up some overleveraged companies. But the extensive amount of refinancing over the past two years means even CCC-rated companies don’t face large sums of maturing debt in the near term. Only $5.3 billion of debt from such issuers will mature by the end of 2012, according to Fitch Ratings. At the end of 2008, roughly five times more was scheduled to be repaid over a comparable period. There also isn’t a big backlog of leveraged debt deals to tax investor demand. Bankers estimate as much as $40 billion of buyout-related debt is in the pipeline. When credit markets shut down in 2007, the figure peaked at nearly $500 billion. Rising trouble in Europe could push prices still lower and yields higher. But with investors potentially stuck with the thin gruel of low official interest rates for a long time, high-yield bonds are once again looking almost nutritious.

Baird According to a report issued on Wednesday, consumers who already own or plan to buy a new tablet are only interested in one thing: the Apple iPad. The report, which was published by Robert W. Baird, a Milwaukee-based wealth management and analyst company, was conducted through a survey of 1,114 people, 98 percent of whom lived in the United States. More than 50 percent of those surveyed, who were between 22 and 60 years old, said they already owned a tablet or were interested in buying one soon, with 95 percent of these respondents choosing the Apple iPad. Although survey participants were allowed to pick multiple tablet choices, only 10 percent chose the Hewlett-Packard TouchPad as their tablet. A mere 4 percent said they would buy Research in Motion’s new BlackBerry tablet, the PlayBook. The Acer Iconia tablet, which runs Google’s Android software, barely scored 1 percent among survey participants. Jayson Noland, an analyst and an author of the report, said it was very unlikely that any iPad competitors would be able to catch Apple in the near future. “I find it hard to believe that anyone can compete with the iPad,” he said in a phone interview. “I do think there are opportunities for companies outside the personal tablet category by offering a much much lower cost product that can be used in the workplace as a productivity tool.” When asked if Google could compete with Apple by offering tablets running Android software, Mr. Noland said, “Unless a product comes out that is half the price of the iPad, and comes with good enough bells of whistles, then its highly unlikely.” The survey also found that a 83 percent of tablet owners still plan to buy a PC computer in addition to their tablet. This means that tablet cannibalization of the PC computer is taking place at a very slow pace.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/hewlett-packard-drops-price-of-touchpad-tablet/?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Hewlett-Packard Lowers Price of TouchPad Tablet<date>August 11, 2011, 5:16 pm</date><text>Noah Berger/Bloomberg News Hewlett-Packard’s TouchPad tablet runs WebOS, a version of the software that runs Palm cellphones. 2:01 p.m. | Updated Added further analyst comment. Hewlett-Packard announced Thursday that it is lowering the price of its tablet computer, the TouchPad, by 20 percent, just two months after its release. The 16-gigabyte H.P. TouchPad, which originally cost $500, will now sell for $400. The 32-gig model, which was $600, will now cost $500. Although H.P. said executives were unavailable for comment about the price change, an H.P. spokeswoman did not characterize it as a sign of slow sales of the TouchPad. She said, “H.P. continually evaluates pricing for its products and is pleased to permanently extend its back-to-school promotion on the H.P. TouchPad.” When the TouchPad was introduced in June it received lukewarm reviews. At the time, The New York Times’s reviewer,  David Pogue, said the TouchPad was a beautiful tablet, but too slow compared to other tablets. Mr. Pogue also felt that the TouchPad had made its debut a year too late, as the Apple iPad had already become the predominant tablet for consumers. A number of reviewers also said that the H.P. TouchPad was too expensive. In June, A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst at Bernstein Research, released an investor report that also said the TouchPad was overpriced compared to competitor tablets. But he said that H.P. had the potential to become a major force in the tablet marketplace. In a research report Friday, Mr. Sacconaghi said, “We worry that the price cuts signal weaker than expected sales and that strong discounting could discourage developers given that it suggests limited traction with customers.” Beyond price, H.P. has come across other hurdles while trying to entice consumers to buy the TouchPad. The company has struggled to lure large numbers of developers to build applications for the TouchPad, which uses WebOS, software that runs Palm cellphones. Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst who specializes in mobile computing, wrote in a report released earlier this year that tablet sales would continue to rise significantly for the next five years. The report predicted that 24 million people will buy e-readers in 2011, and that the number will grow to 35 million by 2012. For now, the majority of tablet sales are expected to belong to Apple, which currently dominates the tablet market by as much as 80 percent in North America.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/tablets-continue-to-dent-pc-sales/?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Tablets Continue to Dent PC Sales<date>July 13, 2011, 7:30 pm</date><text>Modest growth returned to the computer industry in the second quarter following a dip earlier this year, although consumer appetite for tablets continued to dampen demand for desktop and laptop PCs. Computer shipments grew 2.3 percent during the quarter to 85.2 million, the technology research firm Gartner said on Wednesday. Its rival, IDC, said in a similar report that shipments grew 2.6 percent to 84.4 million. Neither firm includes tablet computer shipments in their quarterly tallies. Neither breaks out tablet shipments separately. The results are a small bright spot for computer makers, which have tried to downplay the extent to which tablet computers, mostly the Apple iPad at this point, have diverted spending from the PC and laptop. But clearly the competition is affecting computer sales, the two reports concluded. “Given the hype around media tablets such as the iPad, retailers were very conservative in placing orders for PCs,” Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst, said in a statement. “Instead, they wanted to secure space for media tablets. Some PC vendors had to lower their inventory through promotions, while others slimmed their product lines at retailers.” The IDC report, meanwhile, mentioned the shifting consumer appetite for tablets, particularly in the United States, as a drag on computer sales. In addition to tablets, second quarter computer shipment totals faced a tough comparison from last year. Global shipments soared 12 percent during that quarter, according to IDC and, and such growth could not be sustained. The United States market was weak over all, with shipments declining 4.2 percent, IDC said. The biggest reason was a drop in netbook shipments, the mini-laptops that sold strongly before the rise of tablets. However, gains in computer shipments to Asia, Latin America and Japan offset those declines. Gartner said that Hewlett-Packard retained its position as the top computer maker with 14.8 million computers shipped, a 3 percent increase. Dell moved up to second position, its first time in that spot since 2008, with 10.6 million computers shipped, up 3.3 percent. Acer dropped from second to fourth in global shipments behind Lenovo. The company specializes in netbook computers, sales of which are declining rapidly. In the United States, Hewlett-Packard led with 4.5 million computers shipped, down 1.2 percent. Dell followed with 3.8 million, down 9.8 percent. Apple rose from fifth to third position, with 1.8 million, up 8.5 percent, based on strong sales of its Mac and MacBook computers. It passed Acer and Toshiba.</text></article>

It features Mr. Brand, the droll, shaggy-haired actor, multitasking with the aid of his “digital manservant,” the TouchPad. Mr. Brand, a former substance abuser known for his high jinks, wryly asks his digital helper to check the (unlikely) status of his knighthood. “Again?” asks the digital butler. “Yes again, please,” Mr. Brand repeats, in an exasperated tone. Being front and center for H.P. is a moment to savor for Mr. Brand, the star of the remake of “Arthur” and the debauched boyfriend in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” In his down-and-out earlier years in London, he was a telephone salesman for H.P. copier cartridges. He was fired after four days on the job. “I hope today goes a little better,” he joked during the TouchPad filming last month in Los Angeles. Tying its marketing to Mr. Brand and Miranda Cosgrove and Lea Michele — stars of Nickelodeon’s “iCarly” and Fox Broadcasting’s “Glee,” respectively — H.P. is underscoring its slogan that the TouchPad “Works Like Nothing Else.” And to add a little swagger, the company also hired Manny Pacquiao, the champion Filipino welterweight boxer, politician and aspiring singer, to advertise its compact Veer smartphone and its multitouch tablet.  “It’s not about what the TouchPad and Veer do, but how they do it,” said Eric Keshin, senior vice president for strategy and marketing at H.P.’s Personal Services Group. The “how” is the company’s WebOS operating system, which allows several functions to operate simultaneously. It was acquired when H.P. bought Palm last year. The operating system also features what H.P. calls Synergy — the ability to integrate online information, including calendars, e-mail and photo libraries, into one location. As part of the campaign, the company’s Web site has posted eight brief videos of Mr. Brand — separate from the television spot — to explain TouchPad’s features. In addition to having Ms. Michele and Mr. Pacquiao on board for its tablet advertising, H.P. is planning television commercials this month with the hip-hop star Jay-Z, and the Miami Heat forward LeBron James — perhaps appearing together — to use in a major back-to-school push for its new devices. The H.P. campaign includes a bundle of social media efforts, especially a Facebook application called TouchPad LaunchLine, where visitors can answer trivia questions, watch videos and involve friends, all of which enhance their ability to move ahead in contests for 100 TouchPads and other prizes like a tennis game with Serena Williams or a racecar ride with Mario Andretti. The TouchPad and Veer are the first salvos in H.P.’s longer-term plan to add the WebOS operating system to its signature product, printers, and to its personal computers, which have had a decline in sales recently, according to company financial figures. For now, H.P.’s “Touch to Share” feature allows Veer and the TouchPad to dock and transfer data. It lets, for example, the TouchPad owner transmit a downloaded recipe and its list of ingredients to a Veer. That list can be accessed while shopping at the grocery store. In seeking to trump its tablet rivals like Apple’s iPad, H.P. is appealing to teenage music fans with Ms. Michele, Glee’s comedic and singing actress. She is highlighting the TouchPad’s ability to play flash videos from the Web and the sound system, “HP Beats Audio.” In another video, Ms. Cosgrove touts WebOS features on the Veer phone, including its navigation system, Web browsing and video playing.  1 2 Next Page »HEWLETT-PACKARD, introducing its new TouchPad in the crowded touch-screen tablet pack, has enlisted the quirky British comedian Russell Brand and other youthful celebrities in an attempt to provide the pizazz younger buyers look for when they choose personal devices.</text></article>

There was a big earthquake in Haiti. Some men were rescued from a mine in Chile. Oh, and apparently there was a gigantic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.What’s that you say? This all sounds like last year’s news? Well, don’t tell that to Hewlett-Packard. This week, it introduced what it considers a groundbreaking new product: a tablet with a touch screen! It’s the H.P. TouchPad ($500 for the 16-gig model, $600 for 32 gigs): a black rectangle with a glossy 9.7-inch multitouch screen. You can zoom into maps, photos or Web pages by putting two fingers on the glass and spreading or pinching them. The screen image rotates when you turn the tablet 90 degrees. The only buttons are a Home button below the screen and volume up/down buttons on the edge. If that description sounds just like the iPad (and the 47,298 Android tablets that compete with it), you’re right. H.P. has some nerve coming out with a tablet now — especially because the biggest distinguishing component is its operating system. It’s WebOS, a variation of the software that runs the Palm cellphones (the Pre, Pixi and so on) — but it’s new to tablets. Which means, of course, that there aren’t many apps for it yet. How many is “not many”? Well, 300. (H.P. points out, however, that there are even fewer for Android tablets, even after several months: only 232.) There’s a Kindle app, Pandora and Angry Birds, thank goodness. But some pretty popular apps are among the missing. No Flixter or IMDB. No Pocket God. No Google apps like Google Mobile, Google Earth or Google Voice. No Netflix. Now, from a hardware-checklist perspective, the TouchPad doesn’t get off to a good start. It’s the same size as the iPad, but it’s 40 percent thicker (.75 inches thick) and 20 percent heavier (1.6 pounds) — a bitter spec to swallow in a gadget you hold upright all day long. It has a front camera for video chatting but, unlike its rivals, no camera on the back. It has Wi-Fi, but can’t get online over the cellphone network, too. It can sometimes pinpoint its own location on Bing Maps by referencing nearby Wi-Fi hot spots, but it doesn’t have real GPS (what were they thinking?). It supposedly has a blazing-fast chip inside, but you wouldn’t know it. When you rotate the screen, it takes the screen two seconds to match — an eternity in tablet time. Apps can take a long time to open; the built-in chat app, for example, takes seven seconds to appear. Animations are sometimes jerky, reactions to your finger swipes sometimes uncertain. And despite being thicker, the TouchPad’s battery life lasts only about eight hours on a charge (the iPad gets 10 hours). . Now, even H.P. understands that the TouchPad’s only hope is differentiating itself from the better established tablets. The only buying question you have to ask yourself, then, is: Does H.P. make a convincing enough case that you should gamble on this unknown quantity? Here’s the crux of H.P.’s argument. First of all, the TouchPad is beautiful. It’s iPad beautiful. The case is glossy black plastic — a magnet for fingerprints, unfortunately, but it looks wicked great in the first five minutes. The WebOS is beautiful, too. It’s graphically coherent, elegant, fluid and satisfying. That, apparently, is the payoff when a single company designs both the hardware and the software. (Android gadgets, by contrast, are a mishmash of different versions and looks.) The central conceits of WebOS are the same as on Palm’s phones. For example, when you press the Home button, all open apps shrink into half-size window “cards”; at this point, you can swipe with your finger to move among them, or swipe an app upward to close that app. It works beautifully, and conveys far more information than the iPad’s application switcher (which is just a row of icons). H.P. says that the TouchPad offers real multitasking: all open apps are always running. On the iPad, by contrast, only certain apps (like music playback and GPS tracking) chug away in the background; everything else is just suspended until you return. Apple argues that true multitasking runs down the battery — and the battery-life stats prove it correct. Choose the compromise you like best. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.comHave you been reading the headlines? There was a big earthquake in Haiti. Some men were rescued from a mine in Chile.

Rolls of flexible displays are etched with electronic components that are fully bendable. Hewlett-Packard researchers are hard at work on a fully flexible display screen that they say can have all sorts of consumer and retail uses. Imagine candy bar wrappers, or screens as wallpaper, all made out of a flexible material that can change images in an instant. Compared with today’s screens, which are made with glass and can easily break, these new displays could bring down the cost of consumer electronics and make gadgets more robust and bendable. The displays could also end up replacing hundreds of products that are currently made with paper and plastics. “The Army has been asking for flexible displays so soldiers can wear screens that wrap around their wrist and can transmit information about an enemy in real-time,” explained Carl Taussig, the head of H.P.’s Information Surfaces Lab, the group responsible for developing the company’s flexible displays. “You can also see a number of retail applications with these displays where stores can show prices or discounts on products that change in real-time, rather than employees having to change paper price tags.” The lab’s researchers want to make the screens easily visible in a low-light situation and outside in the bright sun. “We want to mix screens to be somewhere between a reflective surface, which is like a piece of paper, and for it to be transmissive, much like the screen on an iPhone,” Mr. Taussig said. Mr. Taussig predicted that consumers would start to see  this technology over the next two years. The displays are created using a process similar to a printing press used to print on paper. Instead of using ink in this process, the machines are etching millions of tiny transistors. The flexible displays could also be powered by solar energy using the solar panels above. A small character dances on a color e-Ink screen. H.P. researchers are trying to make flexible displays that are visible in the sun and in low light.</text></article>

The sale was to Polycom, which makes video conferencing systems. It comes after H.P. failed to make much headway in this market despite years of trying and many optimistic statements by its executives. The price was $89 million. Mr. Apotheker is working to revive H.P., the biggest technology company by revenue, after a string of lackluster quarters and disappointing financial forecasts. Slow personal computer sales and a troubled services business has put pressure on the company to make major adjustments. Mr. Apotheker’s plan is to focus more on software and “the cloud,” or products and services delivered online. He has also started a revamp of the services business, which he said was suffering from inadequate investment before his hiring last year. H.P.’s video conferencing business includes Halo, a high-end service for corporations that was created in partnership with DreamWorks Animation SKG and introduced in 2005. The technology requires companies to outfit an entire studio or conference room with multiple screens that employees can use to make presentations and collaborate with colleagues in other offices. Halo, which costs close to $500,000, never really caught on because most companies used cheaper alternatives. Polycom said it would integrate H.P.’s video conferencing services into its existing line of products. Additionally, H.P. agreed to resell Polycom’s products. Video conferencing, also referred to as telepresence, is an area of particular focus in the technology industry in recent years with Cisco closing its $3.4 billion acquisition of Tandberg last year. Last month, Microsoft said it would pay $8.5 billion for Skype, a service that is widely used by consumers, but is also being pushed as a product for corporations.</text></article>

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/technology/18compute.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">H.P. and Dell Say Slower Sales of PCs Affected Revenues<date>Published: May 17, 2011</date><text> The world’s two largest personal computer makers, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, said Tuesday that a slowdown in sales to consumers in the first months of the year damped overall revenues. “The PC market continues to be bifurcated,” Léo Apotheker, the H.P. chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. He added that “even though our consumer PC expectations had been cautious, the steepness of our Q2 decline is greater than what we had anticipated.” H.P. said that sales of personal computers in the fiscal quarter ending April 30 fell 5 percent, to $9.4 billion. A 23 percent decline in consumer computer sales far outweighed a 13 percent increase in sales to businesses. Companies that make personal computers, like H.P. and Dell, are vulnerable to changes in consumer spending because of the fragile economy. But despite the tight wallets in a slowly recovering economy, shoppers have been eager to buy tablet computers, a market that H.P. will finally enter this summer with its planned release of the TouchPad, a rival to Apple’s dominant iPad. Analysts attribute some of the weakness in consumer PC sales to the rise of tablets. Overall PC sales declined 1 percent to 3 percent during the first three months of the year, according to slightly different estimates by IDC and Gartner, two market research firms. But they also blamed the economy and a lack of innovation in PCs. H.P., based in Palo Alto, Calif., reported net income in the quarter rose 5 percent to $2.3 billion, or $1.05 a share, from $2.2 billion, or 91 cents, in the year-ago quarter. It said that overall revenue in the quarter climbed 3 percent to $31.6 billion. The adjusted income of $1.24 a share was slightly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $1.21 a share and revenue of $31.54 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. Revenue during the current quarter is expected to be $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion, slightly below analyst forecasts of $31.8 billion. Adjusted income is expected to be around $1.08 a share, which was also below the $1.24 that had been predicted. Full-year revenue is pegged at $129 billion to $130 billion with adjusted income of at least $5 a share, also below analysts’ predictions.  For Dell, sales of servers, computers and storage devices to businesses continued to help offset weaknesses that have plagued its consumer business the last few years. Brian Gladden, Dell’s chief financial officer, said that consumer sales were even weaker than the company had expected during the quarter. But he added that the consumer market accounts for only 20 percent of Dell’s total revenue, “a dynamic that is really good for us.” The company reported that in its first quarter, net income nearly tripled to $945 million, or 49 cents a share, from $341 million, or 17 cents a share. Revenue rose 1 percent to $15 billion. Analysts had forecast earnings of 43 cents a share, on average, on $15.4 billion in revenue for the first quarter. Sales to large corporations increased 5 percent to $4.5 billion, while Dell’s sales to consumers declined 7 percent. The company expects stronger growth — midsingle-digit revenue growth in its second fiscal quarter, which is slightly above its normal, sequential seasonal growth of 2 percent to 3 percent. Sales of personal computers could get a lift from a good back-to-school season, strong demand for Dell products using Intel’s new Sandy Bridge chip and end-of-year government spending, the company said. Shares of Dell rose 5.5 percent in after-hours trading to $16.78. Some analysts predict the consumers will continue to be a problem. “The consumer market is very weak and that situation is not going to improve,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw. “The bigger picture is they are transforming into a solutions company, which will mean less volatility.” H.P. was sluggish in other segments of its business. H.P.’s services business, which caters to corporate clients, gained 2 percent, to $9 billion. Mr. Apotheker said inadequate investment was to blame, a thinly veiled criticism of his predecessor, Mark V. Hurd, who was known as a cost-cutter. H.P. said that it planned to reorganize its services business to focus on more profitable and higher-growth categories. However, analysts worried about the effect on profits and the time it would take for the extra investment to pay off. “We are making tough decisions today to set us up for the future,” Mr. Apotheker said. Louis Miscioscia, an analyst for Collins Stewart, said about H.P., “The frustrating thing is that it’s been a series of issues over the past year, not just one issue here and one issue there.” A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, called the quarter disappointing. He added that “clearly, it’s an inauspicious start” for Mr. Apotheker, who has spent just over six months on the job, and raises fears that the company is not going to be as strong under him as it was under Mr. Hurd. Investors sent H.P.’s shares down 7.3 percent on Tuesday to $36.91. It was their lowest level in nearly two years. H.P. and Dell are also feeling the effect of Japan’s disasters. H.P. said it expected a $700 million hit in the second half of its fiscal year because of reduced demand for its products, higher costs for components and the need to ship its products by air rather than by sea. Dell executives have said the company has experienced relatively minor disruptions in its supply chain as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan during the quarter. But Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company, warned that Dell, along with H.P., would probably face higher component costs over the next few quarters. </text></article>

Gains in bank and utilities stocks limited the market’s overall losses.H.P. fell more than 7 percent. The company lowered its earnings outlook for the rest of the year, partly because of weaker sales of personal computers. The company’s shares fell to $36.91, near the lowest price in 12 months. Concerns about the economy’s strength helped pull down industrial companies like Caterpillar and Boeing. The Federal Reserve said the nation’s factories produced fewer goods in April for the first time in 10 months. If the decline continues, it could cut into the earnings of companies that make industrial equipment. The Commerce Department also reported that construction of new homes plunged in April. The two reports drove traders into the relative safety of government bonds, pushing yields to their lowest level this year. “There’s a high degree of caution right now,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. “People are worried about big picture issues that need to be resolved.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 68.79 points, or 0.55 percent, to 12,479.58. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index lost 0.49, or .04 percent, to 1,328.98. The Nasdaq rose .90, or 0.03 percent, to 2,783.21. Even with a majority of companies reporting stronger earnings, the stock market has lost some of its momentum in the last few weeks. Concerns are growing that high gas prices will weigh on the economy, pinch consumer spending and cut into corporate profits. Companies reported mixed results Tuesday. Wal-Mart Stores said its income rose 3 percent in the first quarter, but sales fell at stores open at least a year for the eighth quarter in a row. Wal-Mart’s stock fell nearly 1 percent. Sales also slipped in the first quarter at Home Depot, but the retailer’s income jumped 12 percent and beat analysts’ expectations. The stock rose 1.2 percent. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 8/32, to 100 2/32. The yield fell to 3.12 percent, from 3.15 percent late Monday.A lower earnings forecast by the personal computer maker Hewlett-Packard and concerns about the economy’s strength dragged the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 70 points Tuesday.

Dell’s report Tuesday report came on the heels of earnings from Hewlett-Packard, which earlier in the day lowered its forecast for the year on weak personal computer sales, trouble in its services division and the impact of the Japanese earthquake in March. For Dell, sales of servers, computers and storage devices to businesses continued to help it offset weaknesses that have plagued its consumer business the last few years.

Despite the strong quarter, Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., has much work ahead of it, even as the corporate market continues to regain momentum. The company’s future, analysts say, continues to rest on its ability to provide services and equipment for large data centers as corporations increasingly rely on cloud computing, a phrase used to describe products and services delivered online. Mr. Dell, who returned to run the company in 2006, is hoping to grab more corporate business by bringing greater efficiency to its services. Last month, Dell announced it would invest $1 billion over the next two years to build 10 new data centers and expand its service offerings for cloud computing.Strong sales to businesses continued to prop up Dell’s earnings in the first quarter despite a weak economy and still-sluggish demand from consumers. Dell’s report Tuesday report came on the heels of earnings from Hewlett-Packard, which earlier in the day lowered its forecast for the year on weak personal computer sales, trouble in its services division and the impact of the Japanese earthquake in March. For Dell, sales of servers, computers and storage devices to businesses continued to help it offset weaknesses that have plagued its consumer business the last few years. The company reported net income nearly tripled to $945 million, or 49 cents a share, from $341 million, or 17 cents a share. Revenue rose 1 percent to $15 billion. Analysts had forecast earnings of 43 cents a share, on average, on $15.4 billion in revenue for the first quarter.

Dodges a Thunderbolt<date>May 18, 2011, 6:55 am</date><text>null Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest personal computer manufacturer, announced Tuesday that it would not be installing Intel’s new Thunderbolt I/O connections on its desktop computers. The company said it would continue fitting USB 3.0 connections to its machines. Thunderbolt, which is showing up in Apple’s computers, has USB 3.0 beat on specs — it’s twice as fast — but H.P. doesn’t seem to care all that much. Rich Brown at CNet has a good analysis of this. It’s another example of Thunderbolt’s currently limited appeal. Peripherals that are compatible with the new standard remain thin, and even if that situation changes rapidly, the payoff for the average consumer is still limited. Harder-core users who work in multimedia, for example, will be dazzled. Thunderbolt’s potential has not been fully exploited by consumer-electronics companies, but USB 2 and 3.0 are widespread and popular, and good enough for many average users. Thunderbolt can move large amounts of data at fast speeds; it can support video and data connections; it is very clearly a superior technology to USB 3.0. It is the connection of the future. It just may not be the connection of the present.</text></article>

Profit Up 5%, but PC Sales Are Declining<date>Published: May 17, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Hewlett-Packard reported on Tuesday that sluggish sales of personal computers muted its second-quarter earnings, and it predicted that future growth would be dampened.The company reported the net income in the quarter rose 5 percent to $2.3 billion, or $1.05 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 91 cents, in the year-ago quarter. The company said revenue in the quarter, which ended April 30, climbed 3 percent to $31.6 billion The adjusted income of $1.24 a share was slightly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $1.21 a share and revenue of $31.54 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. But the company also revised its forecast for the current quarter, indicating worries about the impact of the Japan earthquake, continued softness in sales of personal computers and lower operating profits in its services unit from a reorganization. Revenue during the current quarter is expected to be around $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion, slightly below analyst expectations of $31.8 billion. Adjusted income is expected to be around $1.08 a share, which was also below the $1.24 that had been predicted. Full-year revenue is expected to be $129 billion to $130 billion with adjusted income of at least $5 a share, also below analyst predictions.  The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said that sales of personal computers fell 5 percent, to $9.4 billion. Revenue for the unit that includes printers rose 5 percent, to $6.7 billion. A 23 percent decline in consumer computer sales far outweighed a 13 percent increase in sales to businesses. “The PC market continues to be bifurcated,” H.P.’s chief executive, Léo Apotheker, said in a conference call with analysts. He added that “even though our consumer PC expectations had been cautious, the steepness of our Q2 decline is greater than what we had anticipated.” Meanwhile, H.P.’s services business, which caters to corporate clients, gained 2 percent, to $9 billion. Storage and servers increased 15 percent, to $5.6 billion. Mr. Apotheker attributed sluggish services sales to inadequate investment in the unit, a thinly veiled critique of his predecessor, Mark V. Hurd, who was known as a cost-cutter. H.P. said that it planned to reorganize its services business to focus on more profitable and higher-growth categories. However, analysts, in their questions, repeatedly voiced concern about the impact on profit margins and the time it will take for the extra investment to pay off. “We are making tough decisions today to set us up for the future” Mr. Apotheker said. H.P. reported earnings a day earlier than originally planned after an internal memo from Mr. Apotheker, warning of “another tough quarter” leaked to the press. His comments immediately cast doubt about the company’s growth and sent its shares spiraling. They fell 4.5 percent to $38 in after-hours trading on Monday. The memo, first reported by Bloomberg News, also alluded to potential layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. Nevertheless, Mr. Apotheker said in a news release on Tuesday that, “H.P. executed well and delivered a solid quarter.” He also said: “Our enterprise strategy, with services at its core, is focused on higher value-added solutions. Today we are accelerating our efforts to align our services business model to our long-term strategy to deliver unprecedented value to our customers and a better return for our shareholders.” Mr. Apotheker sidestepped questions in the conference call about job cuts in a call with reporters, saying only that “we will continue to manage our business prudently.” Companies like H.P. that make personal computers are vulnerable to changes in consumer spending because of the economy. Moreover, shoppers are increasingly buying tablet computers, a market in which Hewlett-Packard is bit player to Apple’s iPad. The company has said it expects to sell a tablet computer this summer. In March, Mr. Apotheker outlined a plan to expand H.P.’s tiny corporate software business and expand into the cloud — a term used to describe products and services delivered online. However, that strategy, which puts the company on a collision course with I.B.M and Oracle, will take some time to get rolling. Software sales grew 17 percent, to $764 million, in the quarter. Shares fell more than 8 percent to $36.51 in midday trading on Tuesday, to their lowest level in nearly two years. H.P.’s shares have dropped nearly 33 percent from 12 months ago while the Nasdaq composite index gained 18 percent.SAN FRANCISCO — Hewlett-Packard reported on Tuesday that sluggish sales of personal computers muted its second-quarter earnings, and it predicted that future growth would be dampened.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/business/17hp.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Hewlett-Packard to Report Earnings on Tuesday<date>Published: May 16, 2011</date><text>Hewlett-Packard is moving up its second-quarter earnings report to Tuesday rather than Wednesday, the company announced in a statement on Monday without citing a reason.Separately, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, H.P.’s chief executive, Léo Apotheker, told top executives that he was bracing for “another tough quarter” in the July period. The company’s staffing plans are “unaffordable given the pressures on our business,” Mr. Apotheker wrote in the May 4 memo to deputies including Todd Bradley, executive vice president of the personal systems business, and its chief financial officer, Cathie Lesjak. The third quarter is “going to be another tough quarter, one in which we will be driving hard for revenue and profit,” Mr. Apotheker wrote. “We have absolutely no room for profitless revenue or any discretionary expenditures.” The memo indicates that the company continues to come under pressure and suggests job cuts are possible. In February, the company reported results that disappointed investors. H.P. is expected to report profit excluding certain costs of $1.21 a share on sales of $31.5 billion, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. “This is a continuation of what we’ve seen recently from H.P. — weakness on the top line, but better cost controls,” said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher &amp; Company in San Francisco. Hewlett-Packard shares dropped as much as 5.1 percent to $37.76 in extended trading. Its stock closed down 61 cents to $39.80 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Hewlett-Packard also issued a disappointing forecast for the April period, casting a pall over Mr. Apotheker’s first quarter as chief and underscoring the challenges he faces. H.P.’s reliance on home-computer shoppers leaves the company vulnerable to a consumer slump, while its services unit is using acquisitions to take advantage of a shift to cloud computing. Mr. Apotheker is stepping up an emphasis on higher-margin businesses including servers, storage computers and software, and deceasing its dependence on PCs, Mr. Marshall said. Mr. Apotheker, who took over Nov. 1, outlined his strategy for the first time on March 14, announcing a stronger move into software and the expanding market for computing delivered via the Web. The company is starting a cloud-computing service that will let developers create applications for consumers and businesses that run on H.P. servers, Mr. Apotheker said at the time.Hewlett-Packard is moving up its second-quarter earnings report to Tuesday rather than Wednesday, the company announced in a statement on Monday without citing a reason.</text></article>

Despite an improved economy, worldwide shipments of computers fell 3.2 percent in the first quarter to 80.5 million, IDC said in its quarterly PC Tracker report. Gartner released a similar report that showed a 1.1 percent decline in worldwide computer shipments in the first quarter to 84.3 million. Japan’s natural disasters along with the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa played a key role in the decline. Computer shipments in Japan fell 15.9 percent during the first quarter compared with the comparable period a year earlier, according to IDC. Japan’s earthquake on March 11 temporarily shut down that nation’s economy because of the widespread destruction, power outages and supply shortages. IDC and Gartner had forecast small gains in the shipments for the quarter. “While the consequences of events in the Middle East and Japan remain unclear, these will surely be factors that will influence short term market performance for 2011,” Jay Chou, an analyst with IDC, said in a statement. In the United States, shipments slipped 10 percent as consumers held onto their older computers or bought tablets, IDC said. New computers offer improved performance, but not enough to give consumers a reason to upgrade. “The U.S. and worldwide PC market continues to work through a difficult era that we expect will continue into next quarter, but will start to improve in the second half of the year,” Bob O’Donnell, a vice president with IDC, said in a statement. He continued: “While it’s tempting to blame the decline completely on the growth of media tablets, we believe other factors, including extended PC lifetimes and the lack of compelling new PC experiences, played equally significant roles.” IDC said Hewlett-Packard retained its position as the world’s largest computer maker, although its sales fell 2.8 percent to 15.2 million. Dell came in second with 10.3 million shipped computers, down 1.8 percent. Acer Group’s shipments fell 15.8 percent to 9 million largely because its netbook niche has fallen out of favor with consumers. Meanwhile, Lenovo showed considerable strength with a 16.3 percent increase in shipments to 8.2 million. In the United States, H.P. led all manufacturers with 4.3 million computers shipped, down 2.4 percent, IDC said. Dell, which has been struggling with weak sales for some time, followed with 3.7 million, down 11.1 percent. Toshiba’s shipments increased 10.4 percent to 1.7 million. Apple passed Acer to fourth place with a 9.6 percent increase in shipments to 1.4 million. Acer’s shipments slipped 42.1 percent to 1.3 million. Gartner says Apple did even better than IDC says. It reported that Apple’s PC shipments in the United States rose 18.9 percent in the quarter in a market that slipped 6.1 percent.</text></article>

At least 28. That’s the number that Hewlett-Packard packed onto its first watch, the HP-01, in 1977. It was such a strange hybrid of watch and algebraic calculator that calling it a mere watch or a calculator would not do it full justice. So HP called it a “wrist instrument.”It was a commercial flop. Years later, the cellphone would become an ubiquitous, multifunctional device that, incidentally, showed the time. As a result, many people younger than a certain age have never acquired the habit of wearing a wristwatch. That’s hardly news, but here’s what does surprise: H.P. and a few other companies are talking up wristwatches again, almost as if the cellphone had never appeared. It’s an idea that strikes me as oblivious to the consumer electronics landscape. Last month at an H.P. event in Shanghai, Phil McKinney, the chief technology officer of the company’s personal systems group, displayed the MetaWatch, a prototype developed by Fossil that he described as the first generation of “the connected watch.” This version has Bluetooth, but the long-term vision is to give it the wireless capability to be the hub of every Internet-ready portable device you own — phone, laptop, tablet. The MetaWatch would be “the mobile Wi-Fi hotspot on your wrist,” Mr. McKinney said in the presentation. During an interview this month, he told me that he gave a talk in 2006 about his conception of the “connected watch” of the future. At the time, wireless carriers were saying that all kinds of digital devices, including laptops, would join cellphones in having their own built-in wireless radios for connectivity. “Why not take all the radios and aggregate them into one device?” he suggested then. That one device would be the wristwatch. It was an idea, nothing more. But last year, Mr. McKinney said, he received a call from Fossil. Executives there had heard his 2006 presentation, had been captivated by the vision, and had set about building two prototype watches — one with hands and another with digital numbers. It was the one with hands that he showed in Shanghai. In our conversation, I told him that so little information could be displayed on the watch’s face — there is a small, scrollable window at the top and another one at the bottom — that it seemed nearly useless. But he said it would be enough for alerts, able to notify the wearer, for example, “when you’ve got 4 more e-mails, 3 Facebook updates and 10 Tweets.” He said buttons on the watch could be programmed to dispatch canned responses. Mr. McKinney, who is 50, said that young consumers who are unaccustomed to wearing watches would still find the MetaWatch appealing. They’d use it, he said, for purposes other than timekeeping. “I hit a button and — boom — I’m checked in at Foursquare,” he offered as an example. Has Fossil, the watch’s developer, tested the concept on focus groups or done other market research? Does it have definite plans to bring it to market? It’s not clear. Fossil declined a request for an interview or for comment. Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst of the NPD Group, does not see the product’s appeal. The MetaWatch, he said, “was the right idea — five years ago.” “But we now have a communications hub: the smartphone,” he added. “Technology has passed the MetaWatch by.” Over all, the casual-watch market in the United States has hardly shriveled. According to NPD’s data, the industry had sales of about $2.35 billion in 2010, up 4 percent from 2008. In those two years, sales were up 33 percent within the 35-to-44 age group and 104 percent for those 65 and older. Sales to the 18-to-24 age group, however, fell 29 percent. And Mr. Cohen says he doesn’t think that many of today’s young adults will ever adopt the watch-wearing habit. Catherine Moellering, executive vice president at Tobe, a retail consulting firm, does see a new interest in watches among 11-to-17-year-olds, but she says it derives from novelty. “The watch had disappeared so completely to these young consumers that today they could discover watches as if they had never been around before,” she said. Still, she said, this inexpensive accessory has uncertain prospects of leading to a lifetime habit. Watches have always been a fashion accouterment as well as a utilitarian instrument. But Ms. Moellering sees young consumers paying less attention not only to watches, but also to the entire world of fashion. Fashion “is not as exciting as technology,” she said. “No store at the mall is as full as the Apple Store.” Apple does not sell a watch, but you can buy watchband kits from LunaTik that are designed to hold a current-generation iPod Nano on the wrist. But the Nano has no wireless capabilities. ANOTHER company, Allerta, has a Bluetooth-enabled watch that can be programmed to show alerts and brief text messages — not unlike those imagined by Mr. McKinney — that draw upon a nearby smartphone or PC. But do we need alerts? Messages of all kinds are coming into our smartphones — we know that without having to check. So wearing a second device to tell us to look at the first device seems superfluous. Such a watch will supply information about information. Meta indeed.

Soon after, Mr. Prophet had set up a virtual “situation room,” so managers in Japan, Taiwan and America could instantly share information.Mr. Prophet oversees all hardware purchasing for H.P.’s $65-billion-a-year global supply chain, which feeds its huge manufacturing engine. The company’s factories churn out two personal computers a second, two printers a second and one data-center computer every 15 seconds. While other H.P. staff members checked on the company’s workers in Japan — none of whom were injured in the disaster — Mr. Prophet and his team scrambled to define the impact on the company’s suppliers in Japan and, if necessary, to draft backup plans. “It’s too early to tell, and we’re not going to pretend to predict the outcome,” Mr. Prophet said in an interview on Thursday. “It’s like being in an emergency room, doing triage.” The emergency-room image speaks volumes. Modern global supply chains, experts say, mirror complex biological systems like the human body in many ways. They can be remarkably resilient and self-healing, yet at times quite vulnerable to some specific, seemingly small weakness — as if a tiny tear in a crucial artery were to cause someone to suffer heart failure. Day in and day out, the global flow of goods routinely adapts to all kinds of glitches and setbacks. A supply breakdown in one factory in one country, for example, is quickly replaced by added shipments from suppliers elsewhere in the network. Sometimes, the problems span whole regions and require emergency action for days or weeks. When a volcano erupted in Iceland last spring, spewing ash across northern Europe and grounding air travel, supply-chain wizards were put to a test, juggling production and shipments worldwide to keep supplies flowing. But the disaster in Japan, experts say, presents a first-of-its-kind challenge, even if much remains uncertain. Japan is the world’s third-largest economy, and a vital supplier of parts and equipment for major industries like computers, electronics and automobiles. The worst of the damage was northeast of Tokyo, near the quake’s epicenter, though Japan’s manufacturing heartland is farther south. But greater problems will emerge if rolling electrical blackouts and transportation disruptions across the country continue for long. Throughout Japan, many plants are closed at least for days, with restart dates uncertain. Already, there are some ripple effects worldwide: for example, a General Motors truck plant in Louisiana announced on Thursday that it was shutting down temporarily for lack of Japanese-made parts. More made-in-Japan supply-chain travails are expected. “This is going to be a huge test of global supply chains, but I don’t think it will be a mortal blow,” says Kevin O’Marah, an analyst at Gartner-AMR Research. “I think that over all we’ll see how resilient and quick-learning these networks have become.” THE good news for the world’s manufacturing economy is that the sectors where Japan plays a vital role are fairly mature, global industries. Consider computing and electronics. For major components, like semiconductors, production is now spread across several countries. By contrast, in the early 1990s, virtually all 486-microprocessors — the engines of the most powerful personal computers of the time — were made at a single Intel factory near Jerusalem. Japan’s importance in the semiconductor industry as a whole has receded in recent years, as more production has shifted to South Korea, Taiwan and even China. Japan accounts for less than 21 percent of total semiconductor production, down from 28 percent in 2001, according to IHS iSuppli, a research firm. Still, Japan produces a far higher share of certain important chips like the lightweight flash memory used in smartphones and tablet computers. Japan makes about 35 percent of those memory chips, IHS iSuppli estimates, and Toshiba is the major Japanese producer. But South Korean companies, led by Samsung, are also large producers of flash memory. Apple, like all major companies these days, treats its supply-chain operations as a trade secret. But industry analysts estimate that Apple buys perhaps a third of its flash memory from Toshiba, with the rest coming mainly from South Korea. The lead time between chip orders and delivery is two months or more. A leading customer like Apple will be first in line for supplies, and it has inventories for several weeks, analysts say. So there will be little immediate impact on Apple or its customers, but even Apple will likely be hit with supply shortages of crucial components in the second quarter, predicts Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. 1 2 Next Page » David Jolly contributed reporting.TONY PROPHET, a senior vice president for operations at Hewlett-Packard, was awakened at 3:30 a.m. in California and was told that an earthquake and tsunami had struck Japan.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/technology/15hewlett.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Hewlett-Packard Chief Unveils Strategy for Expansion<date>Published: March 14, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Since becoming chief executive of Hewlett-Packard four months ago, Léo Apotheker has remained mostly silent about his plans for the world’s biggest technology company.He finally unveiled his strategy to investors on Monday, saying that H.P. would build out its tiny software business and expand into the cloud — a term used to describe products and services delivered online. Mr. Apotheker’s plan is not so much to reinvent H.P., but to help it evolve. Mr. Apotheker said he planned to use the company’s relationships with corporations that already bought its hardware and services to also sell them software and host their data so they could gain access to it from anywhere. H.P.’s strategy is closely watched because of the company’s status as the largest technology company in terms of revenue. The stock market deems Apple the most valuable tech company. But recently, Wall Street analysts have raised concerns about H.P.’s direction and loss of momentum as industry growth shifted from hardware and personal computers, sectors that H.P. dominated. “Yes, H.P. is strong, but we also recognize that the world around us is changing faster than ever,” Mr. Apotheker said at an event in San Francisco. He said that although he had seen areas of “extraordinary strength” in the company, some other areas “need additional focus.” Mr. Apotheker replaced Mark V. Hurd, who was forced out last August after an inquiry by H.P.’s board into accusations, never substantiated, that he sexually harassed a former contractor. The hiring of Mr. Apotheker, who himself was forced out as a chief executive of the business software maker SAP, was widely seen as a sign that H.P. would push into software. Mr. Apotheker did announce some new twists in his plan. He wants H.P. to open an app store where H.P. and other companies can make their services available to Internet users to download. The idea follows similar successful initiatives, most notably by Apple. The strategy outlined by Mr. Apotheker is intended to lift H.P.’s profit margins. Although personal computers are a big source of revenue for the company, they are a low-margin business, about 6.4 percent in the latest quarter. Personal computers and laptops accounted for 32 percent of H.P.’s revenue in 2010. Software, which has much higher margins of 17.6 percent, accounted for only 3 percent of H.P.’s business. Two months ago, Mr. Apotheker shook up the H.P. board, including replacing four members. At the time, the company said that the new blood — which included executives with experience in global business and technology — would add breadth of talent to the company’s leadership. The challenge for H.P. will be to win customers from established rivals like I.B.M., Oracle and SAP. Persuading large companies to go with a relative newcomer, however, can be difficult, even one the size of H.P. To accelerate H.P.’s shift into software, Mr. Apotheker raised the possibility of acquisitions. However, he said the company would be “disciplined,” implying that blockbuster mergers were unlikely. Mr. Apotheker said the company’s software division would focus on security software and business analytics — the crunching of big sets of data — areas where its rivals already excel. But H.P. is hardly in the forefront in terms of business analytics or the cloud, which has been an industry buzzword for several years. Asked whether H.P. was late, Mr. Apotheker said, “We are not playing catch-up to anyone, particularly I.B.M.” He said that no company had a truly powerful offering in business analytics. Mr. Apotheker made clear that he was departing from Mr. Hurd’s legacy of cost-cutting to invest more in H.P.’s once-celebrated research and development programs. Although he did not offer specifics, he said that financing for H.P.’s lab would increase faster than the company’s overall growth in revenue this year and focus on marketable innovations.SAN FRANCISCO — Since becoming chief executive of Hewlett-Packard four months ago, Léo Apotheker has remained mostly silent about his plans for the world’s biggest technology company.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/business/media/28network.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">In Online Ads, Publishers Focus on Revenue From Remnants<date>Published: February 27, 2011</date><text>Online publishers, who have long been dismayed with the revenue from some of their advertising, are increasingly taking matters into their own hands.In the last month, CBS Interactive and Forbes.com have both created their own ad exchanges to directly sell the lower-priced ads called remnants that typically run at the bottom of their Web pages or on secondary pages. These are following similar efforts by NBC Universal, Weather.com and Turner Broadcasting Systems. For publishers, setting up exchanges has several advantages: they cut out the middlemen (those third-party ad networks that often sell cheaper remnant ads for teeth-whitening or weight-loss products across a broad range of sites) and they allow the publishers greater control over consumer data. “The publishers that are setting the ground rules right now are making higher C.P.M.’s,” said Michael Greene, an analyst at Forrester Research, referring to the cost per thousand impressions, a yardstick for the value of an ad. He estimates that publishers who switch to their own exchanges can increase the C.P.M. of such ads from around $1 to up to $5. For years, many online publishers like newspapers, magazine companies and sites affiliated with television networks have sold the premium ads — like the large banners across the top of a Web page — themselves, then used third-party networks to sell the rest at a much lower price. The switch in tactics comes at a time when online publishers are feeling a little more flush with the broad upswing in advertising and perhaps less anxious about squeezing every penny out of remnant ads. “There is significant value in branded data,” said Kevin Gentzel, the chief revenue officer at Forbes, which has not been selling through third-party networks. “A Forbes in-market car buyer has more value that just an in-market car buyer.” The shift also takes many publishers back to their advertising roots: building a particular audience to sell to a particular advertiser, not just spots on a Web page. “If advertisers want to come in, we’re selling them the network,” said Nick Johnson, the senior vice president of digital media sales at NBC Universal. “We’re not selling them placements; we’re selling them people.” These private networks are also being created at a time when the federal government is investigating the surreptitious collection of personal data by third-party networks. Ad networks collect data on the users who visit publisher Web sites and sell user profiles to other advertisers. Ad networks typically use a small piece of code called a cookie to track the users across the Web. Publishers creating their own networks now keep that data for themselves, instead of providing it to ad networks that might sell against the publisher’s target audience on another site. “We want to make sure that we’re controlling what happens with data,” said Mr. Johnson. “We want to make sure we control pricing. Control’s a very important message. We don’t want there to be a cottage industry built on our backs.” NBC announced its version of a private exchange, called the Universal Audience Platform, last July. In mid-February, CBS Interactive began its own private exchange. The platform, like most others, uses a technology called “real-time bidding” which allows advertisers to bid on specific users at specific times. The technology can tell advertisers data like what browser a person is using, the user’s I.P. address and location, the number of sites visited, and the current site the user is viewing. These facts help an advertiser place an ad in front of specific users at the optimum time. For readers, the switch could mean fewer ads for herbal remedies and teeth-whitening, at least on some Web pages. “In the private exchange model, the goal is to make sure you’re delivering high-quality inventory to high-quality advertisers,” said Mr. Greene of Forrester. Advertising agencies say they welcome publishers taking control. Brendan Moorcroft, the chief executive of Cadreon, the agency trading desk at the Interpublic Group, said that top-tier publishers could create a spot for advertising “that aligns to our needs more greatly and more efficiently.” Mike Cassidy, the chief executive and founder of Undertone, an ad network, said networks that sell low-quality advertisements will suffer the most. “Does this over all cause concern for networks? Absolutely,” Mr. Cassidy said. “Does it cause concern for every ad network? Absolutely not.” Mr. Cassidy said that 18 of the company’s top 20 advertisers were Fortune 500 companies and that business had grown 40 percent in 2010. Undertone sells advertising in areas not typically available on most exchanges, including formats like full-page ads and video ads. “If you look through the history of mankind, middlemen have existed forever,” Mr. Cassidy said. In November of last year, Weather.com announced its private exchange, called Category 5, through which it has sold ad space to premium advertisers like Sprint, Chevrolet, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft. Michael J. Kelly, the chief executive of the Weather Channel Companies, said the exchange helped the company protect sensitive consumer data from getting into the wrong hands. For instance, the company tracks users’ locations in order to provide local weather updates, Mr. Kelly said. “By putting our inventory into ad networks, we lose control over that,” Mr. Kelly said. Officials from the Federal Trade Commission declined to comment on the creation of private exchanges and publishers’ shift to data collection, but in a report issued in December the commission sought comment from the industry on how to better define the acceptable uses of marketing and data collection. All of the publishers interviewed said that the data they collected was not personally identifiable and that data collection practices were in line with industry principles of self-regulation. “I think the days of being reliant on third-party companies are numbered,” said Jason Kelly, the chief media officer for Admeld, a technology company that helps publishers manage their online advertising. “Agencies are investing in technology. Publishers are now investing in technology. Publishers are looking to own the relationship with their clients.”Online publishers, who have long been dismayed with the revenue from some of their advertising, are increasingly taking matters into their own hands.</text></article>

H.P. appeared to try to quell concerns by raising its full-year profit forecast. It expects net income in a range of $5.20 to $5.28 a share, excluding items, which is in line with analysts’ target for $5.23 a share on that basis. The forecast raised concerns because H.P. has spent heavily in recent years on acquisitions that were expected to propel substantial growth in areas that its rival I.B.M. has found highly lucrative, especially selling technical services to corporations. The latest numbers show that H.P. is benefiting from the changes in its business model — just not as much as some investors would like.

Bernardo Huberman, director of the social computing group, said in the paper, Trends in Social Media: Persistence and Decay, that most people “expect the most prolific tweeters or those with most followers would be most responsible for creating” huge trending topics on social networks. But Mr. Huberman said that the research showed that expectation was incorrect. Instead, the researchers found that the mainstream media, including organizations like The New York Times, CNN and BBC, act as “feeders” for news topics, helping to amplify and in turn make something into a trend on the social network. To prepare the report, the researchers analyzed over 16 million Twitter messages spanning 40 days last fall. The researchers also found that a number of messages from mainstream news sources became trends after they were retweeted, or sent along in messages by Twitter members to their followers. The paper noted that 31 percent of Twitter messages on trending topics were actually retweets by other users. This type of study is especially relevant on a network as large as Twitter — which is quickly becoming an online news source — as the trending topics can vary widely at any moment and often signal current news events. This past week, for example, trending topics on Twitter included Britney Spears, after an announcement was made about her new album, and the protests in Egypt, as people online shared conversations about the news of President Hosni Mubarak’s departure. But not all trends appear from the mainstream media, the study found; a large number rise from nonmainstream sources. Mr. Huberman noted in the paper that this was a change from the pre-Internet era, “when social media consisted of little more than conversations held in person and over the phone.”</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/technology/10tech.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Nokia and H.P. Play Catch-Up<date>Published: February 9, 2011</date><text>In technology markets, playing catch-up is a bruising, costly and often futile game, even for corporate giants.Nokia and Hewlett-Packard, in different ways, both provided vivid evidence of that challenge on Wednesday. In a memo to Nokia employees, Stephen Elop, the new chief executive, compared its predicament in trying to catch up to Apple and Google in smartphones to that of a man, in a story, who was standing on a burning oil rig at sea. “The man was standing upon a ‘burning platform,’ and he needed to make a choice,” Mr. Elop wrote in the memo, which was widely circulated on the Internet. “He decided to jump.” In the memo, Mr. Elop went on to say that Nokia, too, had to jump, metaphorically — take bold action to make up for lost ground. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, H.P., the largest personal computer maker, took its own leap on Wednesday. The company announced that it would introduce a new tablet, the Touchpad, in an effort to chase Apple and its iPad. H.P. also introduced two new smartphones, entering another market in which it has lagged. But Nokia and H.P. — tech giants though they are — face long odds in catching up with competitors that have a head start in a rapidly changing landscape. It’s hard to do that in any business, but especially so in technology markets. “It’s possible to catch up, but it’s very difficult,” observed Mark R. Anderson, chief executive of the Strategic News Service, a technology newsletter. “It almost never works.” History offers a handful of successful catch-up stories. For example, I.B.M., the mainframe behemoth, trailed the leaders in the new markets for minicomputers and then personal computers, but later caught up. And Microsoft was a latecomer to Internet browsing software, yet eventually became the market leader. Still, slip behind in the innovation race, and fleet-footed rivals can gain momentum that is hard to slow down. Industry partners, software developers and customers flock to the front runner, and its gains snowball. As more people use the new technology, the more valuable it becomes, unleashing the power of “network effects,” in economic terms. In Mr. Elop’s memo to employees, which first surfaced Tuesday on the blog Engadget, he noted such effects. He wrote that Nokia found itself losing in “a war of ecosystems,” including developers, software applications and games, advertising, e-commerce, search and other services. Nokia, Mr. Elop wrote, must “build, catalyze or join an ecosystem.” Mr. Elop is scheduled to address an analysts’ meeting Friday in London, and is expected to begin to outline Nokia’s new strategy. But what might that strategy include? For Nokia, which is based in Finland, joining a major technology partner, analysts say, is the most likely option in the long run. “Nokia doesn’t have the weapons to fight this fight on its own,” said George F. Colony, chairman of Forrester Research. The most attractive partners would be Google and Microsoft, analysts say. Both companies have been courting Nokia recently. Although Nokia may be losing ground in the smartphone market — with its worldwide share falling to 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, down more than 10 percent from a year earlier — it still sells more smartphones than any other company. It could be a valuable partner and marketer for Google’s Android smartphone software or Microsoft’s Windows Mobile 7. Most Nokia smartphones run on the much-criticized Symbian operating system. To get Nokia to switch, Google and Microsoft are offering hundreds of millions of dollars worth of engineering assistance and marketing support, according to a person who has done consulting for the company and was told of the talks. Mr. Elop joined Nokia last September, and was recruited from Microsoft, where he was a senior executive. “But the obvious choice for Nokia is Android,” Mr. Colony said. “Microsoft would be the higher risk path.” While Apple’s iPhone redefined the smartphone, handsets using Google’s Android software are fast attracting users and developers. In 2009, some 25 million iPhones were shipped, compared with about eight million phones running Android. Last year, Android shipments reached 61 million, compared with 48 million iPhones, estimates Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. H.P. started its drive into the tablet market on Wednesday, as well as introducing two new smartphones. No pricing was announced, nor have wireless carriers yet been signed up as partners. The products are the first based on technology from Palm, which H.P. acquired last July for $1.2 billion. “We lost a product cycle — no doubt about that,” said Jon Rubinstein, an H.P. senior vice president and Palm’s former chief executive. 1 2 Next Page » Damon Darlin contributed reporting from San Francisco.

Beck Diefenbach/Reuters The Palm TouchPad. Hewlett-Packard wants to get back into the business of selling phones. Almost a year after buying Palm and nearly two years since Palm introduced its last product, H.P. announced Wednesday in San Francisco that it would make a tablet computer, the Touchpad, running on the webOS operating system. It looks like an iPad. But it is lighter, weighing 1 1/2 pounds, and has a 9.7-inch screen. Running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, the device’s selling point will be its ability to multitask quickly. It will support virtual private networks for corporate users and enables video conferencing. The device will be available later this summer, the company said, with Wi-Fi. Devices for 3G and 4G phone networks will come later. The company also introduced the Veer, a small phone — the dimensions of a credit card — with a slide-out keyboard. It also operates as a hotspot device. It will be available in the spring. And the company introduced the Pre 3, an iPhone lookalike for the business market. It also has a slide-out keyboard, and will be available in the summer. H.P. has created an updated operating system for mobile devices, webOS 2.1. The software is currently available on five devices,  including the Pre 2 for Verizon, which is going on sale on Thursday. That’s the same day Verizon will begin selling the long-awaited Apple iPhone, so the Pre is not going to get a lot of attention. No exact dates of release for most of the products. And no prices were mentioned. Jon Rubinstein, H.P.’s senior vice president and the former chief executive of Palm, spent a lot of time at the two-hour product introduction talking about the software. As the devices become similar — a big screen in a small frame — the companies have to differentiate on the software and how well it is integrated. It also has to get developers to build apps and games for it. With a tiny installed base of Pre phones, H.P. devices aren’t very appealing. But the company said it would also place webOS on PCs, which because H.P. sells 120 PCs a minute, suddenly the installed base of webOS devices is immense. In a demonstration, H.P. showed how the OS is a gaming platform, integrates social media alerts and messaging throughout the platform’s apps. It will have a Kindle app, but the company only showed magazines from Time Inc.</text></article>

Dell and Hewlett-Packard have both stopped producing several models of personal computers to await a modified version of the chipset. Intel disclosed the problem in its Series 6 chipset, known as Cougar Point, on Monday after discovering that around 5 percent of the chips may fail over the typical three-to-five-year lifespan of a computer. The defect has caused a cavalcade of problems for computer makers, which have had to stop shipping several models already in production and to delay introducing some new models.Dell has four computers affected: the XPS 8300 desktop, the Vostro 460 desktop for business customers and two models of the Alienware desktop computer for gamers. H.P. said that several consumer desktop and laptop models along with a desktop computer marketed to small-business customers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East were affected. However, H.P. has also delayed introducing two other computers - the HP Compaq 8200 and the HP Compaq 6200 - that it showed off last month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. ''The issue relates to only a small fraction of H.P. PCs sold or ordered,'' Marlene Somsak, an H.P. spokeswoman, said in a statement. The impact on other computer makers is unclear. N.E.C. said that 21 out of 51 new models may be affected and they may have to adjust the release date of those machines. None of Apple's current models use that chipset. Any computer maker that stops production or delays new products would likely suffer financially. However, no computer maker would discuss the matter. Both H.P. and Dell said that customers who bought affected computers would be able to return them for a refund. They also said customers could instead choose to have their computers repaired. Computer makers started shipping computers with Intel's flawed chip, which controls the movement of data to hard drives and DVD drives, on Jan. 9. By the time Intel disclosed the problem, around half a million computers had already been assembled with the chipset inside, although it is unclear how many were ultimately sold. Intel promised to start shipping an updated version of the chip in mid-February and return to full production in mid-April. The lost sales and the fixing the affected computers is expected to cost Intel $1 billion, Intel said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

A lot of us, apparently. While you may no longer be printing long business reports and have found that it is cheaper to have Costco or Walgreens make your photos than to do it yourself, “the amount of printing has not changed,” said Stephen Baker, a vice president at NPD, a research firm. “Ink volume sales are stable. We’ve seen no drop-off in sales.” But what is being printed, and how consumers are using printers, is changing. Today’s printers are being used to create hard copies of theater tickets, downloaded recipes and, yes, even the occasional photograph. And as consumer behavior has changed, the printing industry is changing along with it, offering features borrowed from the Web and smartphones. The main change is the addition of wireless connectivity so that documents can be sent from your PC to a printer on your home network. Some printers can receive documents even if they are thousands of miles away from the PC that sent them. Both Canon and Kodak make models that connect to a home network wirelessly, or via Ethernet. Canon’s wireless-capable $80 Pixma MP495 also allows you to print stills from HD videos taken with certain Canon digital cameras. Kodak offers home wireless capabilities in four of its five printers, starting at $130. Today, every Hewlett-Packard printer priced at $99 and above comes with its own (nonmodifiable) e-mail address. That means you can take a picture in Paris with your smartphone, and e-mail it to your mother’s H.P. ePrint printer in Queens. Because the file goes directly to the printer, her PC doesn’t need to be on. She can then print out the image. If your hotel has an ePrint-capable printer, you can use it to create a hard copy of your boarding pass by e-mailing it from your laptop in your room to the business center in the lobby. Taking a cue from other Internet-connected devices, like the latest crop of HDTVs, some H.P. printers also come with their own apps, allowing you to directly print Internet content from, say, Nickelodeon or Disney. Rushing out of the house to a party? You can call up map directions directly from the printer using a Bing or MapQuest app that you see on the printer’s control panel, and make a copy without using a computer’s browser. Apple and Google also offer products to help consumers print wirelessly. Apple’s AirPrint allows users of most iPhones, iPod Touch and iPad models to wirelessly send print jobs to an AirPrint-compatible H.P. printer that’s connected to the same wireless network as the portable device. Currently 18 H.P. models are AirPrint-compatible. Google’s Cloud Print, which is being introduced for Mac, Linux and Windows operating systems this year, will allow users to send documents that are already stored on or sent to Google’s servers in the “cloud,” to any printer, without worrying about having the necessary print drivers. Unlike H.P.’s ePrint, Google Cloud Print files don’t need to be e-mailed. They can be accessed either directly by a Cloud Print-compatible printer from H.P., or through Google’s Chrome Web browser from your PC, once a connector plug-in is installed. Meanwhile, choosing a printer has become a lot simpler because most printers today, regardless of price, can create good-looking documents. For $100, you can get models that scan and fax as well. Speed is no longer a consideration; most models are pretty fast. H.P. leads the industry, with a 49 percent market share, selling more than double the number of printers that Canon, its nearest competitor, sells. Kodak and Epson have lesser shares. Justin Yu, an associate editor at CNet, a technology Web site, recommended a few models at varying prices: the multifunction Canon Pixma MX870 (about $150), Epson’s Workforce 520 ($90) or H.P.’s Officejet 6500A ($75). A big issue is the price of printing over the long term, especially the high cost of replacing ink cartridges. A new cartridge capable of printing in both black and white and color can easily cost more than $50, while the printer itself might have cost just $60. Also, you should consider how many documents you can print from a cartridge. Some companies have lowered the price of the cartridge but reduced the amount of ink so that you cannot print as many pages. 1 2 Next Page »Now that you can view maps on cellphones, send pictures directly from a digital camera to photo frames and use a smartphone’s screen as a virtual airline boarding pass, who needs to print any more?

PCs sold or ordered,” Marlene Somsak, an H.P. spokeswoman, said in a statement. The impact on other computer makers is unclear. N.E.C. said that 21 out of 51 new models may be affected and they may have to adjust the release date of those machines. None of Apple’s current models use that chipset. Any computer maker that stops production or delays new products would likely suffer financially. However, no computer maker would discuss the matter. Both H.P. and Dell said that customers who bought affected computers would be able to return them for a refund. They also said customers could instead choose to have their computers repaired. Computer makers started shipping computers with Intel’s flawed chip, which controls the movement of data to hard drives and DVD drives, on Jan. 9. By the time Intel disclosed the problem, around half a million computers had already been assembled with the chipset inside, although it is unclear how many were ultimately sold. Intel promised to start shipping an updated version of the chip in mid-February and return to full production in mid-April. The lost sales and the fixing the affected computers is expected to cost Intel $1 billion, Intel said.</text></article>

Next up is the administration’s courtship of the nation’s start-up economy, with a public-private sector initiative it calls “Startup America,” announced on Monday at the White House. Senior administration officials were there in force, including Gary Locke, the commerce secretary; Steven  Chu, the energy secretary; Karen Mills, director of the Small Business Administration; Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council; and Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Orchestrating private-sector efforts will be Steve Case, founder of AOL and head of the Case Foundation, and Carl Schramm, chief executive of the Kauffman Foundation. In his remarks, Mr. Case nodded toward the skepticism that will understandably greet the efforts to champion job-creating small businesses — a singularly uncontroversial initiative. “There is a mom and apple pie aspect to this,” Mr. Case noted. So strip away the political packaging and what remains? The money itself is meaningful, but not large in the context of the economy. The government funding is pulled from agency budgets and aimed at start-ups. The Small Business Administration, for example, will use $1 billion from an “impact investment fund” to provide up to $2 for every dollar of private capital for start-ups. There was a lot of talk about sweeping aside or lowering “barriers to innovation.” For example, Mr. Locke, the commerce secretary, mentioned the need to “dramatically lower” the three years, on average, that it now takes to process a patent. The United States patent office, he noted, is adapting a fast-track approach that will allow some patent applications to be processed within 12 months. Companies, including Intel, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Facebook and Google, have pledged funds and assistance for American start-ups as part of the initiative. The private-sector money comes to more than $400 million. Nonprofits like the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship will receive support to expand programs. Recent economic studies have concluded that nearly all the net new job creation in the American economy comes not really so much from small companies but from young ones. And the field of entrepreneurial economics has grown and is becoming increasingly mainstream, a trend accelerated by the Kauffman Foundation, the leading philanthropic sponsor of research on entrepreneurial activity, innovation and growth. The administration initiative, said Robert E. Litan, an economist and director of research at Kauffman, “validates this shift in emphasis from small business to new business. That’s significant. The administration is saying yes, we understand, and we’re going to try to do something about it.”</text></article>

Replaces 4 Board Members<date>Published: January 20, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Hewlett-Packard announced a major boardroom shake-up on Thursday in the aftermath of the forced resignation of Mark V. Hurd as its chief executive.The changes are intended to diversify H.P.’s board and add new experience and perspectives, according to Raymond J. Lane, H.P.’s chairman. It comes just months after the hiring of Léo Apotheker as chief executive. But the changes seemed only to refocus attention on the drama at H.P. since accusations of sexual harassment by a former contractor led to Mr. Hurd’s departure six months ago. A company investigation found no evidence of harassment, but instead uncovered irregularities in Mr. Hurd’s expense reports. He has denied any wrongdoing. Boardroom drama at H.P, in Palo Alto, Calif., is nothing new. Five years ago, a spying scandal developed in which fellow board members and journalists were targeted in an effort to uncover who was leaking company information. A few years earlier, the board fought publically over the proposed acquisition of Compaq, the computer maker, which ultimately was approved. The board has faced withering criticism for its handling of the Hurd matter, along with questions about whether he deserved to be pushed out. A shareholder lawsuit accuses the board of mismanagement for awarding Mr. Hurd a multimillion-dollar severance package. Investigations by the company and the Securities and Exchange Commission are continuing. H.P., based in Palo Alto, Calif., is trying to get a “fresh start” after months of turbulence, said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. With the new chief executive in place since November, a “changing of the guard” is only natural, he said. H.P. said four members were leaving the board: Joel Z. Hyatt, John R. Joyce, Robert L. Ryan and Lucille S. Salhany. The company said five new members will start Friday. They are Shumeet Banerji, chief executive of Booz &amp; Company; Gary M. Reiner, former chief information officer of General Electric and a current special adviser to General Atlantic, a private investment company; Patricia F. Russo, former chief executive of Alcatel-Lucent; Dominique Senequier, chief executive of AXA Private Equity; and Meg Whitman, eBay’s former chief executive. “The addition of these new directors will further diversify the outstanding talents and wide-ranging experience that our directors already bring to H.P.,” Mr. Lane, the chairman, said in a statement. “Each is a widely respected and deeply experienced business leader, and together they will provide our board and management team with new insight and perspectives relating to H.P.’s business and the rapidly changing technology industry.” The new board members have experience with international business and technology. Mr. Apotheker plans to focus on software services, and, given his experience leading the German software maker SAP, to try to expand H.P’s global business.SAN FRANCISCO — Hewlett-Packard announced a major boardroom shake-up on Thursday in the aftermath of the forced resignation of Mark V.

I.B.M. shares rose 2.8 percent in extended trading after the company reported that fourth-quarter net income rose 9 percent, to $5.3 billion. Its earnings of $4.18 a share easily exceeded its $3.59 of the year-earlier quarter and the Wall Street average forecast of $4.08, according to Thomson Reuters.

Analysts also noted $142 billion worth of backlog in the services business, up $5 billion from a year earlier — a sign of strong revenue growth ahead. I.B.M. forecast 2011 earnings of “at least $12.56” a share, up from $11.52 in 2010. It said that it was on track to hit its operating earnings goal of $20 a share by 2015. Its gross profit margin rose to 49 percent, from 48.3 percent a year earlier. “We think that the risk-reward here is pretty attractive and we see fairly limited downside to I.B.M.,” said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager at Capital Advisors.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/business/media/18adco.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">H.P.’s ePrint Printer, Live on the Web<date>Published: January 17, 2011</date><text>A mainstay of early television — live commercials demonstrating products like Polaroid cameras and Timex watches — is making a comeback, updated for a new century by migrating to new media.Hewlett-Packard is teaming up with the YouTube for a live show in the form known as branded entertainment. The program will be featured on YouTube’s home page from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time on Friday. The purpose of the show, called “H.P. ePrint Live,” will be to demonstrate a new H.P. technology, ePrint, which enables people who want to print files or photographs to send them from mobile devices to Web-connected H.P. printers, each with a unique e-mail address. The live stream of the show (youtube.com/hpeprintlive) can also be watched on Facebook (facebook.com/hphome) and on mobile devices (hpeprintlive.mobi).  To liven up product demos in the 1950s and 1960s, brands like Polaroid and Timex hired TV faces like Steve Allen, Perry Como, Jack Paar and John Cameron Swayze to take part in their commercials. H.P. is echoing that approach by hiring the comedian Rob Riggle and members of the improvisational comedy troupe known as the Upright Citizens Brigade to appear on the program. Viewers of “H.P. ePrint Live” will help decide which skits and bits the comedians perform — and here comes the branded entertainment, the integration of the product into the program — by e-mailing their suggestions to a printer, made by H.P., which will be onstage with the cast. To prime the pump for the show, the e-mail address of the onstage printer (ideas@HPePrintLive.com) is being promoted ahead of time, in video clips, banner ads and on Twitter, among other places. Best Buy, the H.P. retail partner for the show, will use Facebook, Twitter and e-mail newsletters to encourage its customers to participate. Viewers whose ideas are chosen to be performed will be e-mailed those videos clips from the show, which can be shared with friends and families via social media. The program is the brainchild of three agencies owned by the Omnicom Group: Porter Novelli, the lead agency, which is handling tasks like social media and public relations; Proximity, producing the creative content for the campaign; and the Omnicom Media Group, which is handling media planning. Although the budget for the project is not being disclosed, it is certainly a fraction of the cost for the same kind of show on television, whether a broadcast network, cable channel or maybe even a local station. “We had a conversation around” putting the show on TV, said Tariq Hassan, vice president for worldwide marketing and communication at H.P., who is based in New York. But the company decided that outlets like YouTube were “more relevant to the target” for the technology, he said. The program represents a different approach “to our media buy, done in a collaborative way, with Google and YouTube,” he added, compared with “a traditional search buy” — that is, buying key words like “printer” on search engines. YouTube, a unit of Google, has presented other branded entertainment programs for marketers like American Express. “But not anything like this,” said Suzie Reider, director of display advertising in North America for YouTube and the Google display network, who is based in San Bruno, Calif. “When you launch a product, it’s hard to communicate in a banner ad what does it do,” Ms. Reider said. “When the ideas come flying into the printer onstage, consumers will see it and immediately say, ‘Oh my gosh, you can e-mail from anywhere and see it print.’ ” A risk marketers confront in sponsoring branded entertainment is that the production will seem more like a program-length commercial than a show. “Branded entertainment doesn’t work well when it feels awkward,” Ms. Reider said, “when it’s hard to make a connection between the sponsor and the content.” By contrast, she added, “it works beautifully when there’s what I call an intellectual alibi — a reason why the specific sponsor is underwriting this content.” In this instance, “it’s logical for H.P. to sponsor the live stream,” Ms. Reider said, “because the product is on stage and the ideas for the comedians are coming in through the product.”  H.P. is also promoting ePrint in other ways. For instance, printers are being given to stars of reality TV series who are sharing their experiences on blogs and Twitter. Among them are David Bromstad of “Color Splash” on HGTV. H.P. is also running a campaign for ePrint in traditional media, created by another Omnicom agency, Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco. In a television commercial, a file being e-mailed by a man on an island vacation to his printer at work is personified by a chunk of the island that suddenly breaks off and starts floating from the tropics to his office in Manhattan. “Introducing the new Web-connected printers with ePrint from H.P.,” an announcer says. “Print from any mobile device so your ideas can be there, even when you’re not.” After “H.P. ePrint Live” ends, the show will be edited into segments that will run as promoted — that is, sponsored — videos on YouTube. And the performers will continue to create clips based on ideas that consumers submit from Saturday through Jan. 26. The results will be posted on Facebook and YouTube and copies e-mailed to those who had suggested the ideas.A mainstay of early television — live commercials demonstrating products like Polaroid cameras and Timex watches — is making a comeback, updated for a new century by migrating to new media.</text></article>

Leo Apotheker, who became chief executive of H.P. in November, faces a set of challenges and choices that are highlighted -- certainly from an investment perspective -- in a report this week by Morgan Stanley. The research report, by the analysts Katy Huberty and Mathew Schneider, begins provocatively. ''We believe H.P.'s current share price attributes no value to the PC &amp; Printer franchise,'' they write. What? The personal computer business is a fast-changing and fiercely competitive business with low profit margins, even though H.P. has done a good job of managing that business in recent years. But the printer business? Years ago, the lament of Wall Street analysts was that the printer division alone was worth more than all of H.P., but the laggard businesses obscuring the lucrative crown jewel. The ink in the cartridges was called ''black gold.'' The print heads were specialized microprocessor technology -- and H.P. had, and still has, a commanding market share. And profits are high. The problem is not that the printer business is worthless, Ms. Huberty said in an interview Thursday from Las Vegas, where she was attending the Consumer Electronics Show. But a valuation of H.P.'s businesses that sell only to corporate customers -- technology services, server computers, storage and software -- adds up to $44 a share, Morgan Stanley estimates. H.P.'s stock rose 68 cents on Thursday, to close at $44.88 a share. ''Our sum of the parts analysis points to a $54 per share near-term valuation,'' the analysts write. The Morgan Stanley report also says that three corporate -- or ''enterprise'' -- computing initiatives already underway in sales, services and software could add another $16 billion in new revenue over the next three years, and lift profits considerably. Mr. Apotheker's two predecessors in the last decade, Carleton Fiorina and Mark V. Hurd, each arrived at H.P., looked things over and made big moves to make the company even bigger. Ms. Fiorina acquired Compaq in 2002, a controversial step that enlarged the PC business but started a proxy fight. Under Mr. Hurd, H.P. added to its corporate businesses, especially in services with the purchase of E.D.S. in 2008. The services business is now H.P.'s biggest profit contributor, accounting for nearly 40 percent of its operating earnings last year. Mr. Apotheker, former chief executive of the big German business software maker SAP, was clearly brought in to guide the evolution of H.P.'s corporate business. H.P., Ms. Huberty said, is ''trying to move to become a services-led business,'' more like I.B.M. And less reliant on hardware sales -- less a ''box pusher,'' as Ms. Huberty put it. And, she added, ''H.P's least strategic business is the PC business.'' All the analysts' questions about PCs these days, she noted, are about slowing growth and continued profit-margin pressure as digital tablets erode the sales of notebook computers. I.B.M. opted for focus and higher profitability when it sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2005. But Mr. Apotheker faces a different choice with H.P., since it is the current market leader. The PC business is expected to consolidate into the hands of fewer, larger producers. Does he want H.P. to lead that trend or step away from the business? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY HANNELORE FOERSTER/BLOOMBERG NEWS)</text></article>

One of the standout features of the new compact sized HP Pavilion dm1 is that it is designed not to heat up while you have it sitting on your lap. The company said it has managed that trick in a couple of ways. One is that there are no vents on the bottom of the laptop to spew heat. They have also kept hot components away from the wrists rests of the computer. Finally, it has an accelerometer which can be set to recognize if the computer is wobbling – and likely then on your lap – to run in a cooler mode. When it’s steady on a desk, it can run full bore. The computer also runs the AMD Brazos chip, which integrates a video board onto the main processor. The company said that means it will run faster on less power. With an 11.6-inch diagonal screen, the dm1 is nearly netbook size, and nearly notebook powerful. The company said that it will smoothly run 1080p video, but it isn’t up to the standard of a hardcore gaming machine. Said a spokesman, “I wouldn’t run a first person shooter on it.”</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/technology/personaltech/03tablet.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Year of the Tablet Takes Another Stab at It<date>Published: January 3, 2011</date><text>Welcome to the year of the tablet. Again.Last year was supposed to be the year manufacturers would wow consumers with offerings of all sorts of tablet computers. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, took the stage in January at the International Consumer Electronics Show, the industry’s premier trade show, and displayed three devices that he said would be on sale in the months ahead. Dozens of smaller companies laid out their own tablet plans at the show. But few of these promises came to fruition; none of Microsoft’s tablets ever showed up in stores. Instead, in April, Apple’s iPad came out. And the year became the Year of the iPad. This year, manufacturers are promising it will be different, saying that after the success of the iPad, they have learned a lot about what consumers want in a tablet. “We could have done this a year ago and rushed it out, but it wouldn’t have had the right features,” said Phil Osako, director of product marketing at Toshiba, which is introducing a new tablet at this year’s show, which begins Thursday in Las Vegas. Perhaps the most important feature is the ability to watch high-quality video, say industry analysts, pointing to market research showing that, above all, consumers want to use tablets for all kinds of media consumption — watching films, looking at and sharing photographs, playing games. “Apple competitors’ first instinct was to build a cheaper device and put a cheaper processor in it,” said Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research, a market research firm. “The problem with that is that it wouldn’t have been as good for the video screens.” At this year’s show, Research In Motion and Hewlett-Packard are expected to show off tablet computers, while scheduled appearances by executives at Motorola and Microsoft are widely thought to be coming-out parties for their company’s devices. Mr. Ballmer is to give the keynote address in Las Vegas on Wednesday, the eve of the show; some analysts and bloggers have described this as a do-over of last year. And on the show floor this year, manufacturers whose primary expertise rests in cellular phones, personal computers and even televisions are planning to display their first forays into the tablet market. At the same time, industry analysts say demand for these devices is poised to spike. More than 24 million tablet computers are projected to be sold in the United States this year, up from 10.3 million in 2010, according to Forrester. IDC, another research firm, expects to see 42 million tablet sales worldwide in 2011. As of October, Apple had sold 7.46 million iPads worldwide, according to the company’s last reported figures. It had virtually no competitors all year, until the Samsung Galaxy Tab became available in November. Samsung says it has sold 1.5 million Galaxy Tabs since then. How do the competitors catch up? Many companies are withholding the specifics of their tablets until they are formally introduced. But those who have discussed their plans say they will both offer specific features that the iPad is lacking, and undercut their competitors on price. Mr. Osako from Toshiba said Apple’s experience over the last year has helped his company by creating demand for tablets while Toshiba fine-tuned its plans. Toshiba’s tablet, which will run on Google’s Android operating system, resembles an iPad with a grippy rubberized backing. The company has incorporated features it has developed for its laptops, like stereo speakers and a screen that adjusts in contrast depending on the lighting. Both of those features will make it more comfortable for consumers to watch video. Mr. Osako also listed features unavailable on the iPad, like front- and back-facing cameras, ports for H.D.M.I. hookups and SIM cards, and the ability to run Adobe Flash. “We really view this as the next revolution,” he said. Other companies are looking to distinguish themselves by price. Enspert, a Korean manufacturer that is already selling tablets in Korea, is planning to introduce an Android tablet with a seven-inch screen for under $350 at the show, and sell it in the United States this year. By the end of the summer, the tablet, the Identity Tab, will also be available with a data plan through a major wireless carrier for about $100, Bobby Cha, the company’s chief marketing officer, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Cha said technology consumers pay a heavy premium for familiar brand names, creating opportunity for little-known companies with similar products. “The market is open to everybody, so we know where everybody stands,” he said. “Apple changed the market dynamics, but we’re going to occupy a price point that is much more appealing to the American mass-market customer.” Creating similar products for much lower prices may be difficult because the iPad has conditioned customers to expect a device that is both relatively light and powerful enough to display high-quality media, said Mark Donovan, an analyst with comScore, a market research organization. But he also said that success would be determined largely based on the software that the devices run, and not only on the number of features that manufacturers can pack into the hardware. The tablet market is shaping up to resemble the smartphone market, in which a few companies, like Apple, Research In Motion and Microsoft, design their own operating systems, while many others design hardware that runs on Google’s Android operating system. Perhaps the companies best positioned to succeed are those that make cellphones, several analysts who follow the market said. Handset makers already have relationships with wireless carriers, which can hide the full price of devices by subsidizing them when consumers also purchase data plans. Many manufacturers are focusing solely on creating hardware that will run on Google’s Android operating system. In part, companies were delayed last year because they were waiting for updated versions of Android that would be designed specifically for tablet computers. That wait seems to be over. Devices can already run Android 2.3, known as Gingerbread, and Android 3.0, known as Honeycomb, is scheduled to be available this year. Andy Rubin, vice president for engineering at Google, showed a prototype of a Motorola tablet running the operating system at a conference in December. Apple’s experience with the iPad has also shown that consumers place a high value on the number and quality of apps. And so no matter how good tablets look in Las Vegas at the electronics show, the competition will continue as developers begin to write apps for the various devices. “You can build these devices, which is great, but it’s no longer enough to say, ‘O.K., you have the Internet,’ ” said Mr. Donovan of comScore. “You need developers.”Welcome to the year of the tablet. Again.</text></article>

Previews Intel's New Chip<date>December 29, 2010, 7:41 pm</date><text>Intel’s Sandy Bridge processing chip will have its formal debut at next week’s Consumer Electronics Show when it arrives in a number of high-end, $1,000-plus, laptop computers. Of course, there had to be a leak before CES formally opens and Intel draws the curtain, and this time, Hewlett-Packard has shown its goods early. H.P. released some details about two variations of the new Pavilion dv7, which were subsequently taken off its product support pages. The chips, based on Core i7 technology and architecture, have graphics technology integrated on the same die as the main processing chip, or C.P.U. A result is a smaller chip, improved graphics performance and more efficient use of power. There is also a feature in the Core 17 chips called Turbo Boost, which bumps up the clock speeds by about a third. Advanced Micro Devices will begin offering its own integrated graphics range of chips, called Fusion, at CES as well. Official pricing and availability of the H.P.’s 4000 and 5000 series models, as well as laptops from several other companies, including Acer, Asus and Lenovo, will likely be coming next week at the show.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/technology/21hewlett.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Hurd’s Departure From H.P. Under S.E.C. Investigation<date>Published: December 20, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Federal investigators have been gathering information about Mark V. Hurd’s sudden departure from Hewlett-Packard, the latest twist in a five-month story that has put the company in the middle of Silicon Valley’s version of a soap opera.Officials with the Securities and Exchange Commission have started a preliminary investigation that centers on Mr. Hurd’s surprise resignation from H.P. in August, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The exact nature of the investigation remains unclear, this person said. An H.P. spokeswoman, Mylene Mangalindan, said, “H.P. is cooperating fully with the S.E.C. on its investigation.” John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment. The agency typically does not comment on such matters. Mr. Hurd resigned from H.P. after his personal relationship with a female marketing contractor named Jodie Fisher came to light. H.P.’s directors said that Mr. Hurd had violated the company’s code of conduct with misstatements on expense reports connected to Mr. Hurd’s meetings with Ms. Fisher. Ms. Fisher had presented the H.P. board with a complaint that included allegations of sexual harassment, although the company did not find evidence to support these claims. She also claimed that Mr. Hurd had told her about a meeting he planned to have with an executive from Electronic Data Systems before H.P. had bought the company, this person said. Ms. Fisher did not say she traded on the information. Unless she traded on it, or passed the information on to someone who did, Mr. Hurd’s disclosure, if it occurred, would not constitute insider trading. The H.P board did not disclose the insider information allegation by Ms. Fisher when it announced Mr. Hurd had resigned. An online report in The Wall Street Journal on Monday stated that the S.E.C. had requested information about the E.D.S. matter and Mr. Hurd’s expense reports. It was also examining allegations that Mr. Hurd had destroyed information on a computer. Mr. Hurd had a laptop used by various members of his family from which information had been removed by a professional computer cleaning service, said a person with knowledge of the matter. “Mark acted properly in all respects,” said David Satterfield, a spokesman for Mr. Hurd. “It is understandable that the S.E.C. is looking into the events surrounding Mark’s departure, which was followed by a precipitous drop in the value of H.P.’s stock.” H.P.’s share price plummeted 10 percent when Mr. Hurd resigned and has yet to recover. H.P. and Mr. Hurd have been sparring over the circumstances of his resignation, and Mr. Hurd’s arrival at its rival, Oracle, only increased tension between the two companies. Mr. Hurd is Oracle’s co-president. Mr. Hurd’s supporters have said that H.P.’s board acted rashly when Ms. Fisher made her initial charges. Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, went so far as to say H.P.’s board had made one of the worst management decisions in the technology industry’s history by prompting Mr. Hurd to resign. At one point, H.P. sued Mr. Hurd in a bid to disrupt his move to Oracle. The parties settled the matter a short time later. Oracle and H.P., however, have continued to spar in the marketplace, eroding one of the closest partnerships in Silicon Valley. In September, H.P. named Léo Apotheker, a former executive at Oracle’s rival SAP, as its new chief executive. In a recent lawsuit, Oracle tried to connect Mr. Apotheker to a software theft by a unit of SAP. SAP admitted wrongdoing, but it denied Mr. Apotheker had played a role. A jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion in damages.</text></article>

The browser is cool, but I made another discovery: H.P.'s Beats Audio system is the best sound I've ever heard coming from a laptop. H.P., the world's biggest laptop seller, is making Beats Audio standard in many of its higher-end machines, starting with the entire Envy line, plus the Pavilion dv7 and TouchSmart 600 models. Beats Audio isn't yet another cheesy bass booster or fake surround-sound processor. H.P. says its engineers worked for six months with golden-eared music producers Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre to pore over circuitboard designs and digital signal-processing software. Iovine also roped in will.i.am from Black Eyed Peas to help fine-tune the system. It sounds pretty good through H.P.'s built-in speakers, but it really rocks when you plug in a pair of high-end headphones or run a cable from the laptop to your home stereo. H.P.'s system does three things differently from most laptops. First, engineers isolated the audio components from the noise generated by all the other components packed into the laptop. When you plug into a Beats laptop and turn the volume up without playing anything, you don't hear the electronic background noise that gets in the way of the music on many computers. Second, they meticulously tweaked the digital signal processing (D.S.P.) chips to handle low, middle and high-frequency sound separately, and to go from quiet to very loud without flattening out the sound. Finally, H.P. packed the laptops with powerful headphone / line-out amplifiers. My Envy 14 can drive my fat pro DJ headphones loud enough for spontaneous apartment dancing. The sound isn't boomy. It's full-bodied. There's a bass boost button, but I don't need it. Iovine has griped that everything in today's digital music systems ''just drives me nuts,'' from compressed file formats to tinny headphones. He wants to fix everything in the audio chain. Better laptop sound is a good start. What better testimonial than this: I'm writing this post on my 24-inch iMac, but I've plugged my headphones into the H.P. Envy next to it because it sounds way better. Sorry, iMac. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO</text></article>

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/business/global/30lanka.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Sri Lankan Accountants Attract Global Outsourcers<date>Published: November 29, 2010</date><text>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Southern China has its assembly plants. India has customer support centers, research laboratories and low-cost lawyers.And Sri Lanka’s contribution to global outsourcing? Accountants — thousands of them, standing ready to crunch the world’s numbers. As this tiny island nation staggers back from a bloody, decades-long civil war, one of its brightest business prospects was born from a surprising side effect of that conflict. Many Sri Lankans, for various reasons, studied accounting in such numbers during the war that this nation of about 20 million people now has an estimated 10,000 certified accountants. An additional 30,000 students are currently enrolled in accounting programs, according to the Sri Lankan Institute of Chartered Accountants. While that ratio is lower than in developed economies like the United States, it is much greater than in Sri Lanka’s neighboring outsourcing giant, India. Offices in Sri Lanka are doing financial work for some of the world’s biggest companies, including the international bank HSBC and the insurer Aviva. And it is not simply payroll and bookkeeping. The outsourced work includes derivatives pricing and risk management for money managers and hedge funds, stock research for investment banks and underwriting for insurance companies. Many developing countries have “one particular competency that they do better than anyone else,” said Duminda Ariyasinghe, an executive director at Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment. “Financial accounting is that door opener for us.” With widespread use of English and a literacy rate of over 90 percent, along with rock-bottom wages, Sri Lanka hopes to transform its postwar economy from a sleepy tea and textiles island into a tiny, high-end outsourcing powerhouse. Already there are thousands of other Sri Lankans working in more common outsourcing fields, like information technology and software development. About 50,000 people in Sri Lanka are now employed in one form of outsourcing or another, according to Slasscom, an outsourcing trade group, and that figure is growing by 20 percent a year. But accounting is Sri Lanka’s specialty. During the war, Sri Lankan certified accountants would often use their skills as a springboard out of the country. That is why there are now Sri Lankans sprinkled among executive suites around the world, including the vice president of global business services at American Express and a financial controller at Standard Chartered Bank in the United Arab Emirates. Now, though, the government and business community hope the country’s young financial whizzes will have reason to stay home instead. Sri Lanka’s government, headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, expects revenue from so-called knowledge-based outsourcing — which includes accounting — to triple to $1 billion in revenue by 2015. The stark wage differences between Sri Lanka and America, or even Sri Lanka and India, are a big part of the country’s drawing card. In the United States, the median annual wage for accountants and auditors in May 2008 was $59,430, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sri Lankan workers in the accounting profession receive an average annual pay package of $5,900, according to a 2010 survey by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Wages in Sri Lanka for financial outsourcing are about one-third less than in neighboring India, and hiring educated employees is easier in Sri Lanka, according to executives who do business in both countries. “Skilled talent is accessible,” said Dushan Soza, managing director of the Sri Lanka office of WNS Global Services, an outsourcing company with about 350 people in the country. Because Sri Lanka’s accountants are still a relatively untapped asset on the global market, Mr. Soza said, hiring is easy and turnover is minimal. In the Indian city Mumbai, companies like his would have to go far out of the city to hire because of the level of competition, he said, but here in Colombo “two miles from my office is my hiring range.” Many international executives also quietly admit that Colombo’s colonial architecture, excellent seafood restaurants and proximity to miles of sandy beaches make it a more alluring business travel destination than India’s outsourcing centers. Sri Lanka’s accounting specialty is rooted in the country’s history of colonialism and conflict. State-financed universities here have traditionally not had enough places for qualified students, and they were often closed intermittently during the war. So students who could afford to attended private schools instead — in many cases accounting schools with British origins that date to Sri Lanka’s independence from Britain in 1948. Over time, becoming a qualified accountant has become something well-educated, business-minded people in Sri Lanka do in addition to getting a degree in, say, physics or business management.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/business/global/26tax.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">In Ireland, Low Corporate Taxes Go Untouched<date>Published: November 25, 2010</date><text>DUBLIN — Cut Ireland’s minimum wage? Check. Collect more in property taxes from beleaguered homeowners? Check. Raise the corporate tax rate, which could plug the gaping hole in Ireland’s tattered balance sheets even faster? Well, no.The austerity plan Ireland unveiled on Wednesday to secure a bailout from its international partners makes one thing clear: much of the 15 billion euros (or $20 billion) in savings the government has pledged to find over the next four years will come from the welfare state and the working class. But the measures will not touch large businesses like Microsoft, Intel and Pfizer, which have created thousands of jobs and fueled exports in Ireland for years, thanks to one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe. Germany, France and other European countries have long complained that Ireland’s tax structure has distorted competition. Some politicians have seized on the troubles by pushing for an increase in the 12.5 percent rate as part of a rescue package of about 85 billion euros (or $114 billion), the terms of which are still being negotiated. Some of that external pressure subsided this week as the political crisis in Ireland worsened. But if Ireland cannot meet its budget-cutting targets, or if its troubled banks require even more financing than expected, some countries might push the issue back into the spotlight. From Ireland’s perspective, any future effort by its European partners to revive the issue would damage the country’s prospects for recovery once the banking crisis eases. “The corporate tax is one of the pillars of Ireland’s economy, because it drives exports and jobs, and creates tax revenues for the government,” said Paul Duffy, a vice president at Pfizer in Ireland, one of the biggest multinational employers here. Raising the tax could scare away companies and “would damage a recovery and our ability to repay the massive debts we’ve taken on,” he said. Critics, however, say that in addition to siphoning business from countries with higher corporate tax rates, some multinationals operating under Ireland’s tax rules use complicated schemes to move profits in and out of subsidiaries there. In some cases, that allows them to lower their effective tax rate, they say. That has opened Ireland to criticism from countries like Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel must justify why taxpayers should help pay for another bailout package. The argument is that Ireland could be collecting more money from the companies it has lured. Tax rates have become a contentious issue in Europe, where governments are competing as never before to lure badly needed foreign investments as the economic crisis weighs on growth. Economic activity has declined sharply in the housing and banking industries. That leaves manufacturing and exports as two of the few channels to stimulate the necessary growth. Ireland’s exports grew 6 percent over the last year and manufacturing output increased by more than 10 percent. Philip R. Lane, a professor of international macroeconomics at Trinity College Dublin, said that if the tax rate were nudged a little higher it would help the country collect significant revenue. “But in the context of a devastated economy, where it’s the only thing driving the multinational sector, trying to tweak that rate is not something that any of the political parties want to do,” he said. Ireland’s has long pursued a strategy of luring business by helping major corporations from the United States and elsewhere reduce the tax they pay on profits. While the rate is well below that of Germany and France, it is higher than in Hungary and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe. Ireland’s edge, businesses and politicians say, is that it is a small, open economy with a well-educated, nimble and English-speaking work force and with a relatively stable social compact between unions and companies. That combination has attracted drug companies like Pfizer and Forest Laboratories, and technology firms like Google and, more recently, Facebook and LinkedIn. Multinational corporations employ more than a quarter of a million people in Ireland. Google, for instance, established its European beachhead in Ireland in 2003 and has been reinvesting and expanding operations. This summer, the company announced it would hire 200 people to run a new operations center on top of the 1,500 staff members already there.. About 70 percent of the nation’s exports, and 70 percent of business spending on research and development here, comes from foreign direct investment, according to the country’s Industrial Development Agency, or I.D.A. Ireland, the body responsible for luring foreign investment to Ireland. Foreign-owned firms that are members of I.D.A. Ireland pay workers about $7.1 billion each year and provide one in seven of the country’s jobs, either directly or indirectly. All told, multinationals paid about 5 billion euros in corporate tax to Ireland last year, more than 50 percent of all corporate tax receipts, according to the group’s figures. Pfizer, which has been in Ireland for decades, is among the many multinationals monitoring the tax debate. “When you’re a company like Pfizer, you make billions of dollars of investments for the long term because Ireland has provided certainty” about the tax rate, said Mr. Duffy, the vice president. “When you start to mess with that, you raise issues of trust” that could cause some companies to reconsider the wisdom of investing in Ireland, he said. Microsoft, Intel and Hewlett-Packard recently indicated that they would reconsider whether Ireland was the best base for their main European operations if the corporate tax were to rise. Companies could find it more attractive to relocate outside of the European Union to countries whose low tax rates are not menaced by political haggling in the European Union. “The difficult calculus the Irish government has to make is if they raise the rate to siphon in more money, will that be a deterrent to future generations of foreign investors,” said Iain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics. Mr. Begg said other countries had quickly recognized that pressing the issue further with Ireland now would be counterproductive. Some officials are instead mulling the idea of a levy on Ireland’s banks, which would theoretically raise money once they returned to profitability. Tax policy is a matter of state autonomy, Mr. Begg added, and any future effort to persuade Ireland to revisit the matter would probably raise hackles in Britain and in Central and Eastern Europe, which have insisted that sovereign matters like these cannot be dictated by other countries. Irish voters have mixed feelings about the government’s decision to keep the corporate tax rate steady, even as many fret that income and property tax increases will affect their personal finances, said Paul Sweeney, economic advisor at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. “People feel that on the one hand, corporations, including Irish banks, caused the crisis, and therefore the whole corporate sector should pay,” said Mr. Sweeney. “On the other hand, because people are so nervous about the future, they know that the corporate tax is one of the factors that attracts foreign direct investment, and therefore it would be a delicate time to touch it.”</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/technology/23hewlett.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Hewlett-Packard Reports 5% Increase in Net Income<date>Published: November 22, 2010</date><text>For Léo Apotheker, his debut public appearance as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard could not have gone much better had he scripted it.Three weeks into his tenure, Mr. Apotheker reported that the technology company beat Wall Street’s quarterly estimates on strong corporate sales despite softness in sales to consumers. “We have remained intensely focused on building our strong position, and I think our results today are further proof of it,” Mr. Apotheker told reporters in a conference call. The company reported net income in its fourth quarter, which ended Oct. 31, rose 5 percent, to $2.54 billion, or $1.10 a share, compared with $2.41 billion, or 99 cents a share, in the period in 2009. The company said revenue rose 8 percent, to $33.28 billion from $30.78 billion. The adjusted net income of $1.33 a share was higher than analysts’ expectations of $1.27 a share for the quarter, according to a First Call survey of securities analysts. Analysts expected revenue of $32.75 billion. Over all, the company’s operating profit margin expanded to 12 percent, from 11.8 percent a year earlier. Investors had been eager for news from H.P. as much for what it might say about the company’s future as what it said about its specific performance in the last quarter. “I think on balance it was strong and reassuring for investors,” said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Bernstein Research. “Collectively, it was confidence-inspiring. But was it unique or particularly revealing? No.” The announcement marked an inauguration for Mr. Apotheker, a former SAP chief executive who became H.P.’s chief on Nov. 1, after the resignation of Mark V. Hurd. The company’s new chief executive had been largely missing from the public eye since he joined the company, leading some people to speculate that Mr. Apotheker was trying to avoid involvement in a legal battle with Oracle. Mr. Apotheker did not appear in a Federal District Court in Oakland, Calif., where Oracle accused SAP of stealing its intellectual property. SAP accepted responsibility for wrongdoing in that case, but Oracle used the forum as an opportunity to needle Mr. Apotheker, a longtime rival in the market for business software. Oracle tried to serve Mr. Apotheker with a subpoena to appear in court, but the company’s lawyers said they were unable to find him. Mr. Apotheker told reporters that he has spent the last three weeks visiting customers and employees in the United States, Europe and Asia, but that he was now in the company’s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. “I have been from California to Massachusetts and Germany to Singapore, with many stops in between,” Mr. Apotheker said. In a thinly veiled reference to Oracle, Mr. Apotheker told analysts and reporters the company had managed to stay focused on its business through a challenging quarter. “A competitor has tried to distract us — and you — from the good work being done across H.P.’s business,” he said. Revenue growth was strong in the Americas, H.P.’s largest market, improving 9 percent, to $15.1 billion. Profit in H.P.’s core PC business rose 23 percent, while unit shipments were up 2 percent. Catherine A. Lesjak, H.P.’s chief financial officer, said the company’s consumer business, which accounts for 25 percent of revenue, continued to be soft. “We did see uneven consumer performance across our geographies,” she said. News of Mr. Apotheker’s appointment as chief executive, which took most people by surprise, was received coolly on Wall Street in September, sending shares of H.P. down about 3 percent in after-hours trading. The stock has yet to recover fully since Mr. Hurd’s departure. While Mr. Apotheker’s 20 years at SAP have left him with a deep understanding of the business software market, investors are eager to better understand his vision for leading H.P.’s core hardware business. H.P.’s report appeared to soothe investors concerned about demand after Cisco said two weeks ago that spending by government agencies and cable operators had dropped. “It doesn’t seem like the overall demand environment is so bad,” said Kaushik Roy, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “The commercial segment is spending quite well, and businesses have money to spend.” H.P., he said, is increasing its higher-margin businesses, while its lower-margin consumer business is sluggish. Shares of H.P. rose almost 3 percent in after-hours trading. In regular trading, shares rose 76 cents, to $43.25. Earnings were announced after the market closed. H.P. told analysts to expect stronger earnings in the current quarter of $1.28 to $1.30 a share, excluding charges, on revenue of $32.8 billion to $33 billion. Analysts were forecasting earnings of $1.22 a share and revenue of $32.7 billion. “We feel good about our broad-based performance in the fourth quarter,” Ms. Lesjak said. “As a company, we are executing on the plans we have laid out.”</text></article>

The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission announced the civil settlement on Wednesday in their investigation of fraud involving the E-Rate program, which pays for Internet connections in schools and libraries with money collected from telephone users. The investigation centered on tips that contractors working with Hewlett-Packard and other companies gave the gifts to employees of the Dallas and Houston independent school districts, hoping to get inside information and win contracts that were supposed to be awarded through competitive bidding, federal authorities said. Most of the settlement money will go to the E-Rate fund. The whistle-blowers who filed the lawsuits under the False Claims Act will receive payments of $1.4 million in the Dallas case and $796,000 in the Houston case. In a statement, Hewlett-Packard said: “H.P. requires that all employees and partners adhere to lawful and ethical business practices. The activities at the center of this investigation occurred more than five years ago, the partner relationships have been terminated and the employees involved are no longer with the company. H.P. fully cooperated with the authorities and the matter is now resolved.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/opinion/07pubed.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Compounding a Conflict of Interest<date>Published: November 6, 2010</date><text>AS hard as it sometimes is to write a story, it can be much harder to un-write one that should never have been published.Joe Nocera’s column Oct. 9 on the new Hewlett-Packard chief executive, Léo Apotheker, was such a story, and The Times’s subsequent efforts to fix it and stand accountable fell short. The situation was doubly difficult for The Times because the Nocera piece so effectively delivered on the twin aims of such columns in the news pages: delivering news and amping it up with a distinctive point of view. The column contended that the H.P. board’s decision to name Mr. Apotheker, the former C.E.O. of the German software giant SAP, was a major mistake because he had been somehow involved in the “wholesale theft” of proprietary software code from Oracle while at SAP. This misappropriation became the subject of a lawsuit brought by Oracle against SAP, a three-year-old case that has already established SAP’s liability and is now in the damages stage at trial. Mr. Nocera detailed how a unit of SAP, TomorrowNow, systematically downloaded Oracle’s software and then sought to lure Oracle customers to SAP. Mr. Apotheker wasn’t yet C.E.O. but headed its sales and marketing arm. Noting that Mr. Apotheker’s job description did not include overseeing TomorrowNow, Mr. Nocera wrote, “He may not have been involved in this brazen theft of intellectual property, but it defies belief to say he didn’t know about it.” And the column argued that Mr. Apotheker did not act swiftly enough to end TomorrowNow’s practice when he became C.E.O., making him a poor choice to head H.P., whose chief executive, Mark Hurd, had just left in the wake of alleged ethical lapses. Nocera wrote, “for a company that professes to be concerned with ethics — so concerned that it had to get rid of Mr. Hurd, with his piddling expense account problems — it is astonishing that it would find Mr. Apotheker’s lapses acceptable.” In short, the column was a hard-hitting blend of reporting and opinion that left H.P. bleeding on the mat. Here’s the flaw: It turns out Mr. Nocera’s fiancée is the director of communications for the law firm representing Oracle in the damages phase of the case, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner. Oracle’s case is well-served by casting Mr. Apotheker’s actions at SAP in a bad light. H.P. notified The Times three days after the column ran that it had learned there might be a “close personal relationship,” and that if so, “this would present a serious conflict of interest.” Times editors were learning this for the first time from H.P., but Mr. Nocera said he learned it on the day of publication, right after his fiancée read the column and told him that her law firm was in the middle of the SAP-Oracle suit. He had not realized the firm was involved, he said. In an e-mail message, Mr. Nocera told me his fiancée had only recently returned to work after a leave from the law firm and had not mentioned the firm’s role in the Oracle suit to him: “the only thing she knew about my column was that I was going back at the H.P. board again.” When Times editors learned of the conflict, they quickly and appropriately posted an Editors’ Note disclosing this unfortunate sequence and concluding, “To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Mr. Nocera would not have written about the case if he had known of the law firm’s involvement.” Publishing an Editors’ Note is probably the closest The Times could come to un-writing the Nocera column. But around 2:30 on the afternoon of Oct. 12 — before his editors knew about the problem and before the note went online later that day — Mr. Nocera raised the column’s profile even higher by discussing it on CNBC’s “Street Signs” program hosted by Erin Burnett. After CNBC saw the Editors’ Note in The Times, it too followed with an on-air notice of the problem the next day. Looking back, Mr. Nocera expressed chagrin, saying the CNBC appearance was “stupid.” “If you look at the tape of my appearance, you’ll see how uncomfortable I was,” he said. “Almost from the moment Erin opened her mouth I knew I had made a mistake.” What he should have done, Mr. Nocera said, was alert his editors right away on Oct. 9 when he learned of the conflict, “instead of wishing it away.” The sequence of events doesn’t end there. On Oct. 23, The Times’s Ashlee Vance wrote a Bits blog post on the SAP-Oracle case, noting that SAP had asked the judge to restrain the parties’ comments to the media. The blog post said, “A recent column in The New York Times figured heavily in SAP’s request.” The blog post went on to say that SAP’s attorneys “suggest that Oracle representatives may have influenced this column, since Mr. Nocera’s fiancée works as a publicist for the law firm representing Oracle.” Nowhere in the post did it mention the Editors’ Note in which The Times acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest. Damon Darlin, editor of the blog post, said the post contained a link to the Nocera column. “The column wasn’t what the post was about,” he said. “But anyone who wanted to take a side trip and read the column would immediately see the note on the top and the bottom of the column. We weren’t hiding anything.” I believe Joe Nocera when he says he didn’t know his fiancée was working for Oracle’s lawyer. But his decision to go on CNBC was a mistake, and as a result, the story took on another life. Then a week and a half later, The Times missed a chance in the Bits blog to cite the Editors’ Note. There is a significant difference, in my mind, between saying The Times acknowledges the conflict and saying, as the blog post did, that SAP’s lawyers cited the conflict. The Times not only needs to be aboveboard, it needs to appear aboveboard when problems of this magnitude emerge. So, yes, it is very hard to un-write a story. But, in this case, The Times and its columnist could have done more to be accountable for the problem and, if not un-write the story, stop it in its tracks. A reasonable approach now would be to re-report the story — as a straight news account, not as a news-page column — and let the new story stand as a foundation for future Times coverage of the Oracle suit and Mr. Apotheker’s role in it.  My column last Sunday on The Times’s “War Logs” coverage misstated A. M. Rosenthal’s title. At the time of the Pentagon Papers case, he was managing editor of The Times, not executive editor.</text></article>

Dell did not disclose terms of the deal for Boomi, which counts Salesforce.com among its clients and helps integrate so-called cloud-based applications and smooth data transfers between programs, The Associated Press said. Boomi raised $4 million in 2008 in an initial round of institutional funding led by the venture capital firm FirstMark Capital. The company is based in Berwyn, Pa., and was founded in 2000. Privately held Boomi was mentioned as a potential buyout target after I.B.M. bought Cast Iron Systems earlier this year. Dell has been on the acquisition trail, but lost out recently in a bidding battle with its larger rival Hewlett-Packard for the high-end data-storage maker 3PAR. Michael Dell, the chief executive, had said at an industry event in Hong Kong that the company would announce a cloud-computing acquisition on Tuesday, spurring a round of market speculation about potential targets.

A case in point is Hewlett-Packard's Slate 500 Tablet PC. Update 8:26 a.m., October 26: The iPad does have an onboard microphone. An earlier version of this post indicated erroneously that it did not. While it resembles an iPad, there are some real differences. It functions more like a MacBook Air, in that it runs full-fledged desktop software, not a smartphone version of an operating system. That means there will be overlapping windows - which you don't get on the iPad - and it will run all of the programs that you would have on your regular Windows computer at home and office. That it runs full-fledged programs also means there are none of the iPad-like apps for it. The Slate also incorporates some tabletlike features, such as a three megapixel camera, which is more useful on the go than it would be on a home computer. A gander at the spec sheet highlights some of the other differences and similarities. The new Slate has a 1.86 GHz Intel Atom processor, which technically is faster than Apple's A4 1 GHz processor. But the Slate has a heavier load to pull with desktop applications. Slate comes with 2 gigabytes of SDRAM memory. Apple doesn't give a figure for its SDRAM memory, but a tear down by ifixit found 256 megabytes of memory. Both devices can carry solid-state storage of up to 64 gigabytes. The iPad's 9.7-inch diagonal LED screen is larger than the Slate's 8.9-inch diagonal. (I can't speak to the qualitative differences. I haven't handled a Slate yet.) Both tablets have 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth, but some iPad models can also connect to the Web on the 3G mobile phone network. Of course, using a 3G U.S.B. attachment would add that capability to the Slate. The Slate is promising about five hours of battery life to the iPad's 10. The Slate is priced at $800, $100 more than the top-of-the-line Wi-Fi iPad. If that leaves you wondering who the Slate is for, H.P. said it is primarily for business. If you are a retailer who keeps inventory on a Windows program, you would be able to walk around your store and check what's in the back from your tablet. But I would also say it's probably for people who don't want to leave any of the functionality of their Windows desktops behind when they are on the go. And it's for lovers of all things Windows. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO</text></article>

Hurd, for playing footsie with a consultant and fudging his expense accounts -- the board of directors at Hewlett-Packard proudly announced it had found a new man to lead the company out of the wilderness. His name is Léo Apotheker, a suave European -- how many American C.E.O.'s have an accent aigu in their name? -- who had spent most of his career at SAP, the giant German maker of business software. SAP has one primary competitor: Oracle, the very same company that hired Mr. Hurd barely a month after H.P. let him go, in a move clearly intended not only to bolster Oracle but to humiliate H.P. Oracle and H.P. had once been the closest of partners, with the latter selling the industrial-strength hardware that ran Oracle's industrial-strength software. But that partnership appears to be dissolving. Earlier this year, Oracle completed its purchase of Sun Microsystems, a move that meant that it would now be trying to sell its own hardware, instead of encouraging customers to buy H.P. computers. What's more, Larry Ellison, Oracle's flamboyant founder, had taken to sending e-mail to reporters mocking the ineptitude of the H.P. board. Is it possible that the hiring of Mr. Apotheker was motivated by the board's desire to strike back at Oracle? And that, with Mr. Apotheker on board, H.P. would try to encroach on Oracle's software stronghold just as Oracle was moving into H.P.'s hardware arena? There are analysts who are convinced that was the case. H.P., of course, was adamant that nothing could be further from the truth. ''Hiring him had nothing to do with fighting Oracle,'' said Ray Lane, the former Oracle (!) president who is set to become H.P.'s chairman next month. ''The board chose Léo because he was the best available athlete.'' There were other things about the appointment that seemed a bit odd. For instance, at the point at which the H.P. board hired him, Mr. Apotheker was unemployed. You see, his tenure at SAP had ended abruptly in February, when the company's executive board (as boards are called in Germany) declined to renew his contract. After being named co-C.E.O. in April 2008, he had just become sole C.E.O. in 2009 -- meaning that he had been flying solo for just seven months when he was shown the door. Maybe, as his defenders insisted, he was simply an unfortunate victim of the global recession. ''He got a raw deal,'' said Mr. Lane. But maybe, as I heard from others, his own missteps had contributed to his downfall. He had tried to raise prices aggressively for servicing SAP's complex software, which had resulted in a customer revolt. A critical new initiative, called Business ByDesign, had flopped. And he had managed to alienate the SAP work force. ''My communication towards you was not always optimal,'' he was quoted as saying in a memo SAP issued to its employees when he left. While I found some people who defended Mr. Apotheker's management style --''He's a tireless worker who gives everyone a second chance,'' said Andre Boisvert, a former top software executive -- I found just as many people who thought that Mr. Apotheker was likely to further traumatize the already demoralized H.P. staff. ''If you wanted to find someone who represented the diametrical opposite of the H.P. way, it is Léo,'' said Jason Maynard, a veteran technology analyst with Wells Fargo Securities. ''He is tough as nails and chews glass for breakfast.'' Still, having written two unflattering columns recently about the H.P. board, I was inclined to take a pass on Mr. Apotheker's hiring. But then I learned something about him that caused me to shake my head in disbelief. Next month, Oracle and SAP are scheduled to go to trial in a case involving the wholesale theft of Oracle's intellectual property by an SAP division. SAP has acknowledged its guilt; the only issue being litigated is the size of the damages. (Oracle is asking for $2 billion; SAP says it should have to pay only ''tens of millions'' of dollars.) As a member of SAP's executive board, Mr. Apotheker clearly knew about the theft.</text></article>

It takes your breath away, really: the same board that viewed Mr. Hurd’s minor expense account shenanigans as intolerable has chosen as its new C.E.O. someone involved — however tangentially — with the most serious business crime you can commit. If it were anybody besides the H.P. directors, the situation would be unbelievable. With these guys, though, it’s all too believable. • No company, not even H.P., is as obsessed with Oracle as SAP. And with good reason. Over the last half-dozen years, Oracle has made serious inroads into the German company’s core business of enterprise software, primarily by acquiring other software companies. In the mid-2000s, for instance, Oracle bought PeopleSoft, J. D. Edwards and Retek, all companies that compete with SAP in one niche or another. In fact, SAP had tried to buy Retek itself but had been outbid by Oracle. It wanted revenge.</text></article>

They didn’t. Amid the global financial panic of 2008, investors were supposed to regain their appetite for blue chips because, in uncertain times, these industry-dominating companies could offer steadier growth. Yet, that year, large-cap stocks fell even harder than small-company stocks. And to add insult to injury, small stocks went on to outpace large ones in 2009 and so far this year. Today, some market watchers are armed with a kitchen sink full of arguments that the stage is set for a blue-chip revival. Not only are the large caps cheaper than small caps by historical standards, but some of these big companies, like Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, are trading at price-to-earnings ratios of nine or less, based on projected earnings. Large stocks also have greater exposure to foreign markets, including emerging markets like China. “I actually think large-cap stocks have more growth potential because they can go outside the United States,” said Thomas H. Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, who has been bullish about this group since 2008. Large stocks are also sitting on a mountain of cash. “At some point, these companies will start using that money to raise dividends, buy back their stock, or start buying each other,” said Robert E. Turner, chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners, a money management firm in Berwyn, Pa. He says that cash has been especially important since the disruptions of the financial crisis. All of these trends could benefit large-cap stocks, which have had a miserable decade. While small caps were up nearly 4 percent, annualized, from 2000 to the end of 2009, and mid-caps rose more than 6 percent, annualized, the large-cap Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 lost about 1 percent. But before investors get too worked up about a pending blue-chip boom, it’s important to note that it could take months, if not years, before large stocks stage a real comeback. FOR starters, the bull market that began in March 2009 is only 18 months old. Historically, shares of small-but-nimble companies have outpaced the blue chips through the first two years of a rally, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.&amp; P. In fact, in the second years of bull markets since 1950, the S.&amp; P. 600 index of small stocks has gained 22 percent, on average, versus 18 percent for the S.&amp; P. 500 index of blue-chip shares. So “there’s absolutely no reason why small caps can’t keep outperforming large caps,” Mr. Stovall said. James B. Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter based in Whitefish, Mont., noted that the so-called Nifty Fifty era — when the market’s biggest growth stocks dominated — came to an end in the 1973-74 bear market. After that, small stocks trounced blue chips until the early 1980s. That’s not the only example of a slow recovery. After the 1929 crash, it wasn’t until 1945 that large stocks made it back to even. And blue-chip stock prices appreciated at a relatively modest rate in succeeding years: 4.6 percent, annualized, from 1945 to 1953. Finally, there’s this: Large stocks continue to be the darlings of professional investors. A recent survey of money managers by Russell Investments found that two-thirds described themselves as bullish on large growth stocks, versus only around half who are similarly optimistic about small-cap shares. That may not be a good sign. “If the consensus says small caps will underperform large caps, you know there’s a good chance they won’t,” Mr. Stovall said. At the very least, says Robert Sharps, who manages assets for T. Rowe Price institutional clients, even if blue chips don’t return to their late-1990s glory anytime soon, it’s still “highly probable that returns in the next decade will be markedly better than the last one.”</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/technology/01hewlett.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Apotheker, Former SAP Chief, to Lead Hewlett-Packard<date>Published: September 30, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Hewlett-Packard’s board chose equal parts pragmatism, aggressiveness and surprise with its hiring of Léo Apotheker as the company’s new chief executive. H.P. revealed Mr. Apotheker’s appointment on Thursday, filling a void left when Mark V. Hurd was ousted in August. Mr. Apotheker, a German, spent 20 years at the business software maker SAP, including a recent, abbreviated stint as its chief executive. His experience meshes with H.P.’s current strategy of dominating the business computing market and could help revitalize the company’s lackluster software business. “It is a huge privilege to be here today,” Mr. Apotheker said in an interview. “H.P. is the iconic company of this industry, and it is a dream job that anyone would want to have.” Investors hoped that H.P. would tap someone capable of maintaining the company’s efficient structure while also adding a fresh, innovative spark that some found lacking under Mr. Hurd. In particular, investors had talked about finding an executive who could run the business computing side while also revitalizing consumer product initiatives like H.P.’s smartphone strategy, following its acquisition of Palm. There was rampant speculation about who would fill the role, and Mr. Apotheker’s name did not appear on most short lists. Wall Street gave the news a lukewarm reception, sending H.P.’s shares down about 3 percent to $40.82 in after-hours trading. H.P. ended regular trading down 1 percent at $42.07. The stock has yet to recover from a sharp slide following Mr. Hurd’s exit, and the company has lost $12.6 billion in market value since then. Ray Lane, a managing partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and a former Oracle executive, was named to H.P.’s board and will serve as nonexecutive chairman. Taken together, the recruitment of Mr. Apotheker and Mr. Lane would seem to signal that H.P. planned a more forceful march into the business software market, where it would butt up against Oracle, I.B.M., Microsoft and SAP. “I think you have to take it that way,” said China Martens, a software analyst for the 451 Group. “To bring in people with software stamped all over them is very intriguing.” While it is the largest seller of printers, PCs and computer servers, H.P. has struggled to expand its software business at comparable rates. It bought a number of companies that make software for helping manage data centers, but it is less involved in the traditional business software markets with products that track data, inventory, employees and sales leads. Any shift toward the business software realm would lead it to tread on Oracle’s toes, and tensions between the two companies already run high. In August, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, publicly ridiculed H.P.’s board for the way it had handled Mr. Hurd’s exit. H.P.’s board concluded that Mr. Hurd had violated company policies in the way he conducted a personal relationship with a marketing contractor. In particular, the board said that Mr. Hurd had left the contractor’s name off of expense reports when he should have included it. In September, Oracle hired Mr. Hurd as a co-president, and H.P. responded with a lawsuit. The parties have since resolved their legal dispute, but they remain fierce competitors. Oracle has started selling computer servers, encroaching on H.P.’s turf, and H.P. has now tapped a couple of executives with deep knowledge of Oracle’s practices. Mr. Apotheker moved through the ranks of SAP, including stints as the head of sales, co-chief executive and chief executive. He resigned as chief executive in February, just seven months after earning the job outright. During his tenure as chief, SAP suffered through a large round of layoffs, major product delays and a customer revolt against the company’s decision to raise software support prices. “I think it would be fair to say he left SAP under a cloud, but it would also be fair to say it wasn’t all his fault,” Ms. Martens said, adding that Mr. Apotheker can come off as both polished and abrasive. For his part, Mr. Apotheker said: “My claim to fame is that I made SAP into the largest business software company on the planet.” Mr. Apotheker’s hiring marks the third time in a row that H.P. has passed over internal executives when it came to filling a vacant chief executive spot. Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said Mr. Apotheker was hardly considered a front runner for the job, particularly given his lack of expertise in hardware. “It’s an interesting choice, and it’s not something I would have expected,” Mr. Barnicle said. He added that the culture at H.P., where the traditional emphasis has been on the customer, was very different from at SAP, which prizes its engineering culture. Ross S. MacMillan, an analyst with Jefferies &amp; Company, said Mr. Apotheker’s lack of hardware experience was not necessarily a shortcoming. He pointed to Mr. Apotheker’s sales background and said he could take advantage of his existing relationships with big customers. “Those individual decision makers are going to be the same for SAP as H.P.,” Mr. MacMillan said. “He may not be the expert on hardware, but he has the buyer relationships.” Mr. MacMillan also pointed to Mr. Apotheker’s German background as a potential plus for H.P. when it came to adding business in Europe. Of particular note, he said, was that Mr. Apotheker spoke six languages. As for H.P.’s shares falling on news of Mr. Apotheker’s hiring, Mr. MacMillan pointed to the surprise factor. “This wasn’t deemed to be a candidate that was on people’s minds,” he said.</text></article>

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/business/26ping.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Meet the Defenders of Open-Source Software<date>Published: September 25, 2010</date><text>ARMIJN HEMEL, 32, lives with his parents in Tiel, a town smack-dab in the middle of the Netherlands. He works as a technology consultant, but spends several hours a week on his avocation: pestering some of the world’s most powerful consumer electronics and technology companies.Mr. Hemel serves as a volunteer watchman for free, open-source software like the Linux operating system, which competes with Microsoft’s Windows. The use of free software has exploded, particularly in gadgets as varied as exercise bikes, energy meters and smartphones. Companies like Google, TiVo and Sony often opt to piggyback on the work of others rather than going through the ordeal of building all of the software for their products from scratch. The problem that Mr. Hemel and others have stumbled upon is that some companies, even some technology savvy ones, may be violating the rather easy-to-follow requirements associated with free software licenses. Typically, these include making tweaked versions of a free software product available to the public, or simply giving credit to the original developers. Last month, for example, Dell received a public tongue-lashing from the geek kingdom and a cease-and-desist letter courtesy of Mr. Hemel for shipping its new Streak tablet without providing the underlying open-source software code. Dell representatives acknowledged the issue and later put the code on a Web site. “We are committed to fulfilling all of our obligations when using open-source code in our product,” said a Dell spokesman in a company blog. Mr. Hemel says companies should make sure they know the ins and outs of everything they sell. “If we all play by the rules, we can make some really good stuff,” he says. Quite often, companies that fail to live up to these requirements do so out of ignorance about the rules of engagement. Nonetheless, they become exposed to potentially expensive lawsuits. For the moment, companies with open-source compliance issues are in luck. Most of the people, like Mr. Hemel, who prowl about for violations seek neither fortune nor painful retribution. The creators of open-source software tend to just want a modicum of recognition and for companies to do the right thing. “Going to court is not the nice thing to do,” Mr. Hemel says. Typically, Mr. Hemel, who volunteers for gpl-violations.org, an organization named after a popular open-source license, receives an e-mail complaint from someone who suspects that a product may use open-source software without adhering to the rules. Mr. Hemel will sometimes then hop on his bike, ride to a local retailer, conduct a test purchase and then analyze the product to see whether it uses free software and whether the company selling the product has lived up to its end of the bargain. “We’re amazed by what people send in,” Mr. Hemel says. “There are wireless routers, PC cameras, phones and even an exercise bike that had a small computer so people could race against it.” The problem may become only worse as the use of open-source software spreads to industries far afield of the somewhat clued-in technology sector. Carmakers, for example, often use open-source software in their entertainment consoles, while energy companies have started to offer smart meters to their customers. “We are being flooded with more reports than ever before,” Mr. Hemel says. In the past, he called companies’ customer support lines to tell them about open-source compliance issues. But few call-center operators acted on his concerns, he says. These days, Mr. Hemel tries to find a contact in the legal department at the companies to discuss the issues. If no response or action follows, a cease-and-desist letter arrives. When the problem lingers, a lawsuit follows. Gpl-violations.org and similar organizations have pointed a finger at some high-profile companies. In recent years, Cisco Systems, Samsung, Best Buy, Verizon Communications, and many others have been sued by the Software Freedom Law Center. Lawsuits are typically settled out of court. For example, after Cisco was sued over the software included in its home routers; it agreed to make the software code available, tapped a point person to be responsible for open-source issues and paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case. Representatives of companies dealing with these complaints say it’s a far more amicable engagement than one would find in the proprietary software world, where hard-charging lawyers come seeking serious payback for what they view as violations of intellectual property rules. The nonprofit Linux Foundation has started a program meant to teach companies how to comply with open-source licenses. Cisco, Google, Intel, I.B.M., Sony and a host of other companies have backed the effort. “One of the things that makes this tough is that you have increasingly complicated supply chains,” says Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation. “These devices are made up of different components made all over the place.” Hewlett-Packard, in particular, has helped develop a standardized inventory list for software so that companies can keep track of their code and licenses. It has also built a tool that lets companies analyze their software. “These days a developer will do a Google search, find five open-source products that fit his need and the next thing you know one of them is in a product,” says Phil Robb, director of H.P.’s open-source program office. “The same questions should be asked about open-source software that have been asked for commercial software.” Many companies using free software fear that open-source supporters will become more aggressive and pursue large payments over possible violations. “The thing that terrifies companies is the thought of shipping millions of TVs or phones and then having someone figure out that you didn’t follow the licensing requirements,” says Mark F. Radcliffe, a lawyer at DLA Piper, who handles a variety of cases tied to open-source software. “It could be very costly.” Mr. Hemel, for his part, says he thinks the situation will improve with these new programs in place. “Over the last five years,” he says, “I have gone from rage and anger to understanding what the problem is and trying to fix it.”</text></article>

Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Ford Motor led $124.3 billion of U.S. issuance this month, on pace to beat the high of $125.1 billion in September 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales by banks and financial companies account for 16 percent of the total, the lowest proportion since April and down from 30 percent a year ago. Go to Article from Bloomberg News »</text></article>

I don't normally find printers totally mesmerizing-and I hope you don't either-but two were definitely worthy of a little rubbernecking. For starters, I've never seen a printer like the $249 H.P. Envy 100 e-All-in-One. It looks nothing like a printer: There's no unsightly paper trays or feeders, no awkward pop-up LCDs or even the slightest glimpse of a drive roller. Instead, the Envy 100 looks like a handsomely designed stereo component; all its printer-like mechanisms are tucked inside until you need them. That's a remarkable feat, considering that the printer is only 4 inches tall. The Envy 100 has a 3.5-inch touchscreen display on its front for navigation of menus and H.P. apps for printing of childrens' coloring papers, coupons, recipes, tickets and the like. The company says the Envy 100 will print 27 pages per minute (black) and 22 pages per minute (color). Using an H.P. 60XL ink cartridge, the printer delivers text pages at about 5.3 cents per page-a bit pricy. The printer also has a duplexer for double-sided printing, which will save some trees and restore some green in your wallet. The Envy 100 scans and copies, but doesn't have fax capabilities. Its paper tray holds a measly 80 sheets, but the printer's good looks makes it a bit easier to forgive this shortcoming. The second printer, the $400 H.P. Photosmart eStation All-in-One, is the company's flagship all-in-one, this year with a 7-inch detachable color touchscreen. As with last year's Photosmart Premium TouchSmart Web, the touch screen enables you to access H.P. print apps and widgets. The difference, however, is that this year's touch screen can be removed from the printer and used as a stand-alone (albeit small) connected tablet. To make the Android-based touch screen more useful, H.P. has partnered with Yahoo and Barnes &amp; Noble. You can use the touch screen as an e-book reader to access and read books from Barnes &amp; Noble's electronic bookstore. And because of the partnership with Yahoo, all the company's pages, mail, and instant message services can be accessed from the screen. Beyond that, you can link any e-mail account to the removable screen and also use it as a Web browser. H.P. had previously promoted its touch screens as a way to browse news and search for recipes and other printable files while hanging out at the printer. I just couldn't see myself doing that. But the detachable screen makes the browsing scenario much more plausible. My only issue with the removable screen is that it seemed a bit dim for use at long stretches of time. H.P. says its batteries will last up to six hours. The eStation All-in-One adds faxing to its list of capabilities. As for printing, it's rated at 33 pages per minute (black) and 32 pages per minute (color). If you buy XL replacement cartridges, you can print text (black) documents at 4 cents per page, which is pretty reasonable (but not the cheapest you can find). Both new models incude H.P.'s ePrint technology, which provides a unique IP address that enables you to e-mail documents to the printer for output, no matter where you are. They also are compatible with printing apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. The printers will be available next month. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/nyregion/21computer.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Dionne Warwick Obtains Computer Lab for School<date>Published: September 20, 2010</date><text>EAST ORANGE, N.J. — Here is what a bridge over the digital divide looks like.On Thursday morning, 30 fifth graders in yellow-and-green uniforms tapped on keyboards in their gleaming new technology lab, careful not to pound the keys or touch the shiny screens. The first lesson was about how to take care of the computers. Jalen Thompson, 10, said he had never seen a computer so fancy or so expensive. He typed on his screen: “Do not bang on the computer, or keyboard, or mouse.” “When the students came, they were like ‘wow,’ ” said Sharon Giles, the economics and entrepreneurship teacher at the Dionne Warwick Institute of Economics and Entrepreneurship. “It’s going to open up a whole new world for them.” While schools across the New York region rolled out iPods, smartphones, video editing labs and even Skype connections to schools overseas, the students at Warwick, a public elementary school here, had been taught about business much the way their parents had learned it: with paper, pen and calculator. The school, in a district that is more than 95 percent black and is one of the state’s poorest, has struggled to give its students modern business skills, largely lacking the hardware and software that would allow them to create the spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations and multimedia displays that have become routine in the business world. Warwick had a working technology lab cobbled together with secondhand Apple computers from other classrooms that received a handful of newer models every few years. With its outdated equipment, students could not learn the digital skills taught in better-endowed schools, illustrating what some educators have called the newest incarnation of the digital divide, a lack of digital literacy. But this year, thanks to the singer Dionne Warwick, the school narrowed the digital divide with a state-of-the-art technology lab equipped with 31 new Hewlett-Packard computers with oversize screens, 6 digital camcorders and a printer. The new lab sits on the second floor of a century-old building that houses 425 students in preschool through fifth grade, nearly all of whom are black or Hispanic. About 90 percent are poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. Once a neighborhood school called Lincoln, it was renamed for Ms. Warwick, a winner of five Grammy awards, in 1996 after becoming a theme school for business. Ms. Warwick attended the school, which now draws students from across the district, in the late 1940s. For the technology lab, she arranged for Hewlett-Packard to provide about $30,000 worth of equipment, software and online training resources at no cost. Ms. Warwick, 69, had struck up a relationship with the company after using an HP laptop to write a memoir, “My Life, as I See It,” with her business partner, David Freeman Wooley; it is to be published in November. The new lab has become the showpiece for the school, which will hold an open house on Tuesday to unveil it to the community. Surrounded by the sleek machines last week, Ms. Giles directed her fifth-grade students to go online to a virtual bank and calculate the interest on a $600 deposit. Unlike the old computers, the new ones did not freeze. They did not mysteriously shut down. They so captivated the students that no other sound could be heard beside click-click-clicking. Research has shown that giving students technology can improve their motivation and computer skills, though there have been mixed results as to whether it leads to higher test scores. Ms. Giles is already planning how students can use the computers for their major projects later in the year: creating and selling their own business products. They will be able to design logos and graphics. They will also have digital camcorders to make commercials about their products; in the past, ads were limited to printed fliers and announcements over the school’s intercom system. When asked how much she liked her new computer, Angielene Allen, 9, rated it 10 out of 10. “I didn’t think anything was wrong with the old computers, but then I saw these,” Angielene said. “I like them much better.” Cherokee Coleman, also 10, said the old computer screens were so dark they were hard to read, and the keyboards, which were set on top of desks, were so high that she strained her wrists. The new computers come with adjustable keyboard holders. “I think they’re kind of great,” said Cherokee, who at home uses a Dell computer that is older than she is. “I’m going to ask my grandmother for one of these.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/technology/21hewlett.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">H.P. and Hurd, Its Former Chief, Settle Lawsuit<date>Published: September 20, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — A fierce and public feud between Oracle and Hewlett-Packard, two of the world’s largest technology companies, has ended after all of two weeks.On Monday, the companies announced a settlement to a dispute that centered on Oracle’s hiring of Mark V. Hurd, the former chief executive of H.P., as a president. H.P. sued Mr. Hurd this month, claiming he would violate agreements to protect H.P.’s secrets by taking on such a high-level role at Oracle. The parties declined to reveal details about the settlement but said Mr. Hurd would protect H.P.’s confidential information. However, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, H.P. said it had modified its separation agreement with Mr. Hurd. He effectively waived about half the compensation owed him. Mr. Hurd agreed to give up his rights to the 330,177 performance-based restricted stock units granted to him on Jan. 17, 2008, and to the 15,853 time-based restricted stock units granted on Dec. 11, 2009. Although most legal analysts said H.P. had had little chance of winning its case, the lawsuit immediately strained the business relationship between the two companies. Oracle and H.P. have a long history of selling technology together. About 40 percent of Oracle’s business software runs on computing systems sold by H.P., and the companies have 140,000 customers in common. After the lawsuit was filed — 19 hours after Oracle hired Mr. Hurd — Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, warned that H.P.’s actions threatened to derail the companies’ longstanding partnership. The companies took pains on Monday to say that the business relationship was again on firm footing. “H.P. and Oracle have been important partners for more than 20 years and are committed to working together to provide exceptional products and service to our customers,” Cathie A. Lesjak, the chief financial officer and interim chief executive at H.P., said in a statement. “We look forward to collaborating with Oracle in the future.” Mr. Ellison said in his statement, “Oracle and H.P. will continue to build and expand a partnership that has already lasted for over 25 years.” “The partnership is clearly very important here,” said David M. Hilal, senior managing director at FBR Capital Markets. “It’s undoubtedly an effort to kiss and make up.” Mr. Hilal said Mr. Hurd would probably be prohibited from making decisions at Oracle that would allow him to use confidential information from H.P., like its acquisition plans. The relationship between the two companies began to fray after Mr. Hurd resigned from H.P. last month. In an e-mail to The New York Times, Mr. Ellison, a close friend of Mr. Hurd’s, lambasted H.P.’s board for the way it had handled the departure. Mr. Hurd left H.P. after the board investigated his relationship with a marketing contractor and found that her name had been left off expense report items and that Mr. Hurd had violated the company’s code of conduct. “In losing Mark Hurd, the H.P. board failed to act in the best interest of H.P.’s employees, shareholders, customers and partners,” Mr. Ellison wrote. This month, Oracle hired Mr. Hurd to succeed Charles E. Phillips Jr. as a president at the company. While the legal matter has been resolved, Oracle and H.P. will continue to have a more tense business relationship than in the past. Oracle’s acquisition this year of Sun Microsystems thrust it into the computer hardware business, one of H.P.’s strong suits. At the Oracle Open World customer event here this week, Oracle executives talked at length about their plans to conquer the hardware market. Mr. Ellison, in particular, made an impassioned pitch on Sunday evening, just minutes after Ann M. Livermore, an H.P. executive vice president in charge of enterprise computing, delivered a similar message to the audience. Oracle executives have voiced their interest in acquiring more hardware companies, and H.P. remains on the prowl, making some recent big-ticket purchases. H.P. has made three major acquisitions since Mr. Hurd left the company: 3Par, a computer storage company, for $2.35 billion; ArcSight, a computer security company, for $1.5 billion; and Stratavia, a privately held database and application automation company, for an undisclosed amount. H.P. also remains in the hunt for a new chief executive.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/technology/20cloud.html?ref=hewlettpackardcorporation">Cloud Computing Hits Snag in Europe<date>Published: September 19, 2010</date><text>BERLIN — In the world of ideas, cloud computing has the potential to revolutionize the way people work.By bundling the processing power of thousands of computer servers, a company, for example, could allow two employees from different countries who speak different languages to communicate directly by phone, using voice recognition software to process what is being said and translation programs to interpret it into another language. The result, ideally, would be a seamless conversation, without struggle and without the limitations of speaking a foreign language. “We’re not quite there yet, but it’s coming,” Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, a promoter of the technology, said at a gathering of cellphone industry executives after evoking the image at a convention in Barcelona in February. Such cloud-based breakthroughs face a formidable obstacle in Europe, however: strict privacy laws that place rigid limits on the movement of information beyond the borders of the 27-country European Union. European governments fear that personal information could fall prey to aggressive marketers and cybercriminals once it leaves the jurisdictions of individual members, a concern that may protect consumers but one that hinders the free flow of data essential to cloud computing “There are restrictions on cloud computing in Europe,” said Bob Lindsay, privacy director in Europe for Hewlett-Packard, which makes servers and other equipment for cloud data centers. “This isn’t killing the business, but it is slowing its evolution, compared with what is taking place in the United States.” Cloud computing, which allows companies to tap enormous computing power via the Internet without having to invest in the infrastructure themselves, has grown rapidly in the United States under a legal system that permits the sale and transfer of many forms of private data. For its clients, the lure of cloud computing is the savings made possible by cutting in-house corporate information technology departments and hardware and software purchases. According to the research firm Gartner, global sales of cloud services will rise 17 percent this year, to $68.3 billion from $58.6 billion in 2009. About half of what Gartner defines to be cloud services are, in fact, the computing power involved in the display and tracking of Internet ads. The rest is sales of computing services, mostly to large businesses. Global sales of cloud services are poised nearly to double by 2012, to $102.1 billion, Gartner estimates. But Europe is expected to remain a relatively modest user of cloud services, accounting for only $18 billion this year, or about 26 percent of the global total. By 2012, Gartner estimates, Europe’s proportion of global cloud sales will rise to 29 percent, even though the bloc’s economy is larger than that of the United States. Facing legal obstacles in Europe, the U.S. businesses with the greatest stake in cloud computing — primarily Microsoft, Google, H.P. and Oracle — are lobbying lawmakers to loosen restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Alternatively, some are developing new methods to make cloud computing work within Europe’s complicated legal landscape. At the H.P. Labs in Bristol, England, researchers are devising ways to encrypt data before it is sent into a cloud computing center and then decrypt it after it leaves the cloud, thus addressing the privacy concerns of many European governments. Another solution being studied is to give individuals the ability in advance to set the degree of privacy control on each part of their personal information in the cloud by digitally tagging bits of the data. Under this model, a person could make an e-mail address available to marketers, while shielding a phone number and street address from unwanted solicitations. In that aim, H.P. plans to begin testing new software that complies with European privacy laws this year. Called H.P. Privacy Advisor, the software will handle the transfer of data between H.P. offices within Europe as well as to those outside of the Union. “The benefits and impact of the cloud are so great, and the legislative and technical issues are what they are at the moment,” said Siani Pearson, one of H.P.’s lead researchers on cloud computing technologies at its laboratory in Bristol. “But we can make sure that the benefits of the cloud come even within the existing framework.” In Europe, the legal definition of what constitutes personal data is much broader than it is in the United States, extending to information like names, addresses and phone numbers in phone books. Another obstacle is the European Data Privacy Directive, the main body of European law governing international data transfers, which generally prohibits the movement of E.U. data outside the external borders of the European Union. The European Commission has approved only a handful of other countries to provide cloud computing services — the United States, Argentina and Canada. Israel and Andorra have applied for approval to be designated as computing centers.</text></article>

Hurd, to investors on Thursday as the world’s third largest software company reports what analysts believe will be a solid increase in earnings in the face of a faltering recovery in technology spending. Mr. Ellison, who hired Mr. Hurd after Mr. Hurd left H.P. under a cloud of scandal last month, could also detail what his old friend is expected to do at Oracle, as the company integrates its acquisition of hardware-maker Sun Microsystems, Reuters reported. Mr. Hurd himself also will get the first chance to talk directly to Oracle investors, despite H.P.’s attempts to block his move on the grounds that he will spill its trade secrets. “The odds are pretty good that Hurd will make some kind of comment on the call,” Richard Williams, an analyst at New Jersey-based Cross Research, who thinks the move for Hurd was a boost for Oracle, told Reuters.

The deal is expected to close by Dec. 31, H.P. said in a joint statement with ArcSight on Monday. At $43.50 a share, the deal represents a 25 percent premium over ArcSight’s market value of $1.2 billion on Friday. The ArcSight deal was announced two weeks after H.P. defeated Dell in a bidding war for 3Par, a data storage company. Buying ArcSight will bolster H.P.’s security and network offerings. The company makes products that help governments and businesses monitor their data networks for suspicious activity. On Monday, Stock in H.P., which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., rose 8 cents, or 0.2 percent, to close at $38.28 a share. ArcSight, based in Cupertino, Calif., rose $8.81, or 25 percent, to $43.91 a share.</text></article>

Nears $1.5 Billion Deal for ArcSight<date>September 12, 2010, 10:40 pm</date><text>Hewlett-Packard is close to a deal to buy ArcSight, a maker of security software, for about $1.5 billion, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Sunday, as the computing giant continues its recent buying spree. The deal could be announced as soon as Monday, this person said, cautioning that talks are ongoing and may still fall apart. As it seeks to resume business after the contentious departure of its former chief, Mark V. Hurd, H.P. again has shown little timidity about paying up for acquisitions. At $1.5 billion, the potential deal would represent a 25 percent premium over ArcSight’s Friday market value of $1.2 billion. The company has sought to show that it is back to business as usual after the ouster of Mr. Hurd over violations of its business conduct code involving the hiring of an actress-turned-marketer. Mr. Hurd has since moved to a major rival, Oracle, as a co-president, prompting a lawsuit by H.P. alleging that the executive is breaking confidentiality clauses in his contract. A deal would come only two weeks after H.P. defeated Dell in a heated bidding war for 3Par, a data storage company. H.P. ultimately agreed to pay about $2 billion for 3Par, well above the $1.15 billion Dell initially offered for the company. H.P. and its rivals have been eager to grow beyond the low-margin business of assembling and selling computers. (While serving as H.P.’s chief executive, Mr. Hurd oversaw deals like the $13.9 billion purchase of Electronic Data Systems to help the company build up a business to compete with offerings from the likes of I.B.M.) Winning 3Par gave H.P. an expanded presence in the increasingly popular world of cloud computing, which depends on access to copious amounts of data storage. Buying ArcSight would bolster H.P.’s security and network offerings. The company makes products that help governments and businesses to monitor their data networks for suspicious activity. Based in Cupertino, Calif., ArcSight reported $181.4 million in revenue and $28.4 million in net income for its most recent fiscal year. The company, founded in 2000, has 512 employees. It claims more than 1,000 customers around the world, ranging from Verizon to the Securities and Exchange Commission. News of the potential deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal online. – Michael J. de la Merced</text></article>
