In the third quarter of the year, the company’s net income was $822 million, or 78 cents a share, a 57 percent increase over the same quarter last year, when it was $522 million, or 46 cents a share. Total revenue rose 11 percent to $7.07 billion, from $6.38 billion, which the company said represented its highest rate of growth in four years. The July release of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” the highest-grossing film of the year and one of the highest of all time, received much of the credit for the gains. The film was the last of eight in the “Harry Potter” series, which Time Warner’s chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, said had enjoyed an “unprecedented franchise run.” Warner Brothers reported a 19 percent overall rise in revenue, to $3.3 billion, over the same quarter last year. The unit also includes television production. On a conference call with investors on Wednesday, Time Warner executives singled out the sitcom “The Big Bang Theory,” produced by Warner Brothers and televised by CBS, as a profit center. In September, the show started replaying in syndication on Time Warner’s comedy-oriented cable channel TBS and performed solidly. “We expect it’ll be a strong contributor to the profitability of the division for years to come,” John Martin, the chief financial officer of Time Warner, said, referring to the Warner Brothers division. The television networks unit, normally the company’s biggest, reported a 7 percent increase in revenue, to $3.2 billion. But operating income dipped 4 percent in the quarter, in part because the company spent more on new shows like TNT’s “Falling Skies,” on sports rights and on marketing. The company’s smaller publishing unit, Time Inc., reported a 1 percent decline in revenue, to $889 million. The print ad market “appears to have stabilized,” Mr. Martin said. Underperformers in the quarter included the big cable channels TNT and TBS, which have seen some ratings erosion, and the film “Green Lantern.” Despite a dour economic backdrop, the company raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. In August, it projected that its adjusted earnings, which were $2.41 a share last year, would grow by “at least low teens;” on Wednesday it said those earnings would grow by the “high teens.” Analysts  expect 15 percent growth, to $2.78 a share. The company also said it had accelerated its share buyback program. Time Warner shares slipped about 2 percent during the day, perhaps because the success of the film and television franchises had been priced into the stock.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/business/media/internet-customers-and-advertising-sales-bolster-comcasts-profits.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Internet Customers and Advertising Sales Bolster Comcast’s Profits<date>Published: November 2, 2011</date><text>Increases in high-speed Internet customers and advertising sales at NBCUniversal’s trove of profitable cable networks helped increase third-quarter profits at the Comcast Corporation, the company said Wednesday.Comcast, the country’s largest cable operator, reported $14.3 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, a 51 percent increase over the same period last year. Net income rose 4.7 percent to $908 million and operating income rose 35 percent to $2.6 billion, driven by 261,000 new high-speed Internet subscribers. The company reported earnings of 33 cents a share. The company said 165,000 customers cut their pay television service, a 40 percent improvement from the 275,000 customers Comcast lost in the third quarter of 2010. Comcast executives said the numbers were proof that viewers were not “cord cutting” and watching television entirely online. Nine months after Comcast took over majority ownership in NBC Universal from General Electric, renaming it NBCUniversal, the acquisition appears to have had mixed impact on earnings. Over all, the division had $5.2 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 4.6 percent increase, with cable companies like USA, Syfy, CNBC and Bravo providing profit. Revenue at NBCUniversal’s cable division rose 12 percent, to $2.1 billion, while advertising revenue at those networks grew 9.5 percent to $803 million, compared with flat advertising revenue at the broadcast network. The results were not as buoying at NBC, which despite an aggressive fall slate of new shows still ranks as the fourth-most-watched broadcast network in total prime-time viewers. Its revenue rose 2.9 percent, to $1.5 billion. But operating cash flow at NBC, which spent heavily on new shows like the 1960s period drama “The Playboy Club,” dropped 75 percent to $17 million. A Comcast spokeswoman said the drop was because of a bigger investment in prime-time shows, news and local television stations. Comcast’s film unit, Universal Studios, also suffered in the third quarter. Weak box-office sales led to a 7.8 percent decrease in revenue and a 17 percent drop in operating cash flow. Time Warner, which also posted earnings on Wednesday, had better news to report on the film front. The final installment of “Harry Potter” helped the company report a sharp rise in quarterly earnings. In the third quarter of the year, Time Warner’s net income was $822 million, or 78 cents a share, a 57 percent increase over the same quarter last year, when it was $522 million, or 46 cents a share. Total revenue rose 11 percent to $7.07 billion, from $6.38 billion, which the company said represented its highest rate of growth in four years.

Bewkes, Time Warner’s chairman and chief executive, overlook Central Park from the 11th floor of one of Manhattan’s most plum pieces of commercial real estate. Mr. Bewkes cannot wait to move out.To him, the company’s corporate headquarters in the gleaming towers of the Time Warner Center is an “indulgence,” a giant reminder of past mistakes made by one of the world’s largest media companies. “There was a burgeoning overhead reaching $500 million a year, including this edifice you’re sitting in,” Mr. Bewkes said. Time Warner, one of New York City’s largest commercial tenants, is now studying how to consolidate most of its four million square feet of office space. That probably means finding a new headquarters in a less expensive part of Manhattan and vacating the Time Warner Center, the Time &amp; Life building at Rockefeller Center and many of its remaining 13 New York-area buildings. The company estimated that cutting back on its real estate footprint could save as much as $150 million a year. The real estate moves are part of a larger effort to slim down a company that many investors say they believe became bloated during the acquisition frenzy of the last decade, when media companies raced to acquire expensive Internet companies. The failure of the 2000 AOL-Time Warner merger, widely considered one of the worst corporate marriages of all time, and other debacles like News Corporation’s $545 million loss on MySpace, have motivated companies to rebalance. “For every action there’s an equal or opposite reaction,” said Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “The conglomerate-building of the 2000s, which peaked with AOL-Time Warner, well, this is the reaction.” Barry M. Meyer, chairman and chief executive of Warner Brothers, said the trend toward major corporate expansion pushed companies “to tack on new businesses that were kind of adjacent.” That strategy, he said, “defused efforts rather than focusing them.” These lessons have taken hold under Mr. Bewkes at Time Warner, which owns Time Inc.; HBO; Turner Broadcasting stations like CNN, TNT and TBS; and the Warner Brothers studio. The company will also consolidate shared services like human resources and information technology. Some departments will be relocated to other parts of the New York area and states like Florida that offer tax incentives. The cost-reduction measures are expected to save $500 million annually starting in the next several years, and are meant to help Time Warner afford a bigger investment in content — the television shows, movies, sports and news that drive revenue. Spending on content has jumped 7 percent annually since 2008 as Time Warner has shed costs in other areas, the company said. “The idea is to take money being spent on insignificant things out and put it into significant things which are programming, journalism and digital translations of our products,” Mr. Bewkes said. On Wednesday, Time Warner will release its third-quarter profits. In the second quarter, which ended in August, the company reported its highest growth rate since 2007 and revised earnings up slightly for the year. The slimming down at big media companies is partly a matter of survival. In recent years, fast-growing Internet companies like Groupon, Facebook and Netflix, recent bumps notwithstanding, have made old media companies seem stodgy and oversize, and with sagging stock prices to prove it. Costly mistakes have compounded the problem and accelerated the desire to shed assets that are not core to their businesses. Mr. Bewkes took over Time Warner in 2008 and the next year spun off Time Warner Cable. Also in 2009, he completed the spinoff of AOL and vowed to make Time Warner a purely content-driven company. He dissolved NewLine, the 40-year-old movie production company, into Warner Brothers, which resulted in roughly 600 layoffs. In 2003, as chairman of Time Warner’s entertainment and networks group, Mr. Bewkes brokered the $2.6 billion sale of the Warner Music Group. 1 2 Next Page »The sprawling taupe-colored offices of Jeffrey L.

On Thursday, the Warner Brothers Television Group of Time Warner and the CBS Corporation announced a $1 billion deal that will give Netflix the rights to stream shows broadcast on the CW network for at least the next eight years. Eight dramas currently shown on the youth-oriented CW network, a joint venture between CBS and Warner Bros, will be available for streaming beginning as early as Oct. 15. They include “The Vampire Diaries” and “Gossip Girl.” The deal results from a yearlong evolution at Time Warner in which the chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, established a set of guidelines for monetizing content via subscription streaming services like Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime. “Our rules included bypassing the quick and easy money,” Mr. Bewkes said in an interview on Thursday. “We established a strategy to responsibly work with Netflix.” That strategy included not separating the rights to TV shows so that the same show could be sold into syndication on a traditional TV network and, then, at a diminished rate, to an online subscription service. Mr. Bewkes came under criticism last year when he argued that Netflix’s potential was overhyped. He compared the Web service to “the Albanian Army” taking over the world. The Warner Brothers-CBS deal speaks to a continuing evolution, Mr. Bewkes said, adding that the way media companies were cheaply licensing content to online video-on-demand services did not make sense. He said he envisioned Netflix and other services as a means to make money on shows like those on the CW, which are heavily serialized and would not lead to multimillion-dollar traditional syndication deals like those for CBS’s “Big Bang Theory” or “Mentalist,” both produced by Warner Brothers. At any point while the Netflix deal is in effect, Warner Brothers and CBS will have the opportunity to shop CW shows around for traditional syndication deals. The CW’s audience of viewers ages 18 to 34 prompted the companies to explore an online on-demand deal, since younger viewers often prefer to watch TV on laptops or iPads or via streaming. The concept fits what Mr. Bewkes has dubbed “TV Everywhere,” an industrywide push to make money off content while making it available on any device. In a statement, Leslie Moonves, chief executive at the CBS Corporation, said the deal opened a new revenue stream for CW shows. “It also further illustrates how new distribution systems are providing premium content suppliers with additive revenue streams while still preserving traditional monetization windows.” But don’t expect CBS or Warner Brothers to make its hit big-tent sitcoms or dramas readily available online. Syndication deals for network shows represent a huge revenue stream for Warner Brothers and bring in big dollars to networks. Last year, Warner Brothers sold “The Big Bang Theory” for a record $2 million per episode to Time Warner’s TBS and Fox. “We’re talking billions of dollars, so to go and put those shows out essentially on a table in the street is not a good idea,” Mr. Bewkes said. Between an unpopular price increase, the removal of some popular films and a botched plan to separate the DVD-by-mail arm of its business, Netflix has had an exceptionally hard few months. The price increase, which affected about half of its subscribers, was intended in part to raise more money for content licenses like the one announced on Thursday, a company spokesman said. “We’re always negotiating with networks and studios,” said the spokesman, Steve Swasey. He rebuffed a suggestion that the deal with the CW was quickly completed to counter some of the recent bad news headlines. “These deals take a long time to consummate,” he said. At midday Thursday, Netflix stock had risen about 2.2 percent, to $116.11.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/questioning-the-necessity-of-the-nfl-network/?ref=timewarnerinc">Questioning the Necessity of the NFL Network<date>October 5, 2011, 6:20 am</date><text>Richard Sandomir has an update on the continuing battle between Time Warner and the NFL Network. It’s a fight that began before the channel even started in 2003. But Sandomir is reporting that Time Warner is no longer demanding that the NFL Network be placed on a digital sports tier (for which subscribers have to pay extra). So now that this obstacle has been removed, it’s just a matter of negotiating the final dollar amounts, right? It has rarely been that simple — especially in a feud between Time Warner, which controls 14 million subscribers nationwide and about 1.3 million in the New York area, and the N.F.L., the most popular sports programming in the United States. Time Warner does not believe the league’s channel is a priority, and the league believes its channel is essential. “It’s like the lockout,” said Corey Behnke, a co-founder of Cheesehead TV, a Packers online network, who cannot get the NFL Network in Manhattan. “Who do you side with: the billionaires or the millionaires? I’m sorry. I’m a thousandaire.” Extra point An analyst is quoted as saying that carrying the NFL Network “just isn’t a big deal” to Time Warner.

Stark white, with blushed pink cheeks, a wide grin and a thin black mustache and goatee, the mask resonates with the hackers because it was worn by a rogue anarchist challenging an authoritarian government in “V for Vendetta,” the movie produced in 2006 by Warner Brothers. What few people seem to know, though, is that Time Warner, one of the largest media companies in the world and parent of Warner Brothers, owns the rights to the image and is paid a licensing fee with the sale of each mask. The hackers wear the mask when they protest outside of Scientology buildings. And they wore it during a short-lived protest this month in San Francisco of the Bay Area Rapid Transit’s decision to cut off cell service to thwart an earlier protest inside train stations. “It’s a symbol of what Anonymous stands for, of fighting evil governments,” said one of the mask-wearers at that protest. The Anonymous member declined to share his name, noting that the entire concept of the mask was to remain anonymous. “You can get a mask and join the fight, too! But I heard the costume store is sold out until Friday,” he said. Indeed, with the help of Anonymous, the mask has become one of the most popular disguises and — in a small way — has added to the $28 billion in revenue Time Warner accumulated last year. It is the top-selling mask on Amazon.com, beating out masks of Batman, Harry Potter and Darth Vader. “We sell over 100,000 of these masks a year, and it’s by far the best-selling mask that we sell,” said Howard Beige, executive vice president of Rubie’s Costume, a New York costume company that produces the mask. “In comparison, we usually only sell 5,000 or so of our other masks.” The Vendetta mask, which sells for about $6 at many retailers, is made in Mexico or China, Mr. Beige said. Mr. Beige said he did not know why the mask was so popular until recently. “We just thought people liked the ‘V for Vendetta’ movie. Then one morning I saw a picture of these protesters wearing the mask in an online news article,” he said. “I quickly showed my sales manager.” Guy Fawkes is not well known in the United States, except perhaps through the movie. But in Britain, the foiling of his antigovernment plot — he was put to death — is celebrated as a holiday, Nov. 5 or Guy Fawkes Day, and is commemorated with bonfires and fireworks. Although the Time Warner-owned image of Guy Fawkes appeared in 2006, it did not take on its new life until much later. That occurred after members of an online message board known as 4Chan showed a crudely drawn stick figure known as “Epic Fail Guy” peering into a trash can and reappearing wearing the mask. Then in 2008, Anonymous embraced it, explained Gabriella Coleman, an assistant professor at New York University’s department of media, culture and communication. “Thousands of members came out from behind their computer and went into the streets to protest the Church of Scientology,” she said. “Anonymous knew if they were going to meet in a visibly public space for the first time, they needed to conceal their identity. They inevitably chose the ‘V for Vendetta’ mask to do this.” “It had a chilling effect. There were literally thousands of people standing silently in front of the Church of Scientology wearing the same Guy Fawkes mask,” Ms. Coleman said. “The photos and videos that appeared in the news from the protests cemented the mask as the symbol of Anonymous.” Warner Brothers did not respond to a request for comment on the mask’s newfound popularity as a tool of protesters. Alan Moore, the author of the graphic novel on which the movie is based, could not be reached for comment, but in a 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, he expressed how proud he was of the mask’s role in the protests of the Church of Scientology. “That pleased me,” he said. “That gave me a warm little glow.”SAN FRANCISCO — Anonymous, the hacker group, has jostled with the Iranian government and the Church of Scientology and has briefly shut down the Web sites of Visa, MasterCard and other global corporations.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/time-ramps-up-synergy-for-911-anniversary-coverage/?ref=timewarnerinc">Time Ramps Up Synergy for 9/11 Anniversary Coverage<date>August 11, 2011, 9:51 am</date><text>Sometimes a magazine and a Web site just aren’t enough to do justice to a truly arresting story. That’s when being part of a giant media conglomerate like Time Warner — with a movie studio, television channels and cable news outlets — helps. In one of the more ambitious 9/11 tributes planned for the 10th anniversary of the attacks, Time magazine is publishing a special commemorative issue that will be accompanied by an hour-long special that will run on HBO and CNN. And there are ongoing discussions to run the program on the CW Television Network, which Time Warner co-owns with CBS. The program will contain interviews – 40 in all – with major political figures like George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and Rudolph W. Giuliani, along others who were touched by the aftermath of 9/11 in various ways. Those include two flight attendants on the plane that Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, tried to attack; and Tom Brokaw, who received an envelope containing anthrax at his NBC offices. The magazine did not initially plan on doing a television special. But as video of the interviews it conducted with 39 different people whose lives were touched by the attacks started coming back, Time editors said they realized they had something big on their hands. “At first we thought we would do this online,” said Richard Stengel, Time’s managing editor. But then after he saw the footage of the interviews, particularly the ones with four survivors who were above the point of impact in one of the World Trade Center towers when it was struck by a jet, he took the film to HBO. “We thought: Wow. We have something really special here, something that’s different than what you just have in a magazine,” he added. HBO’s co-president, Richard Plepler, also loved what he saw and ordered up a feature-length program. Kira Pollack, the magazine’s director of photography, said the interviews, which were shot in black and white, all began with the same question: Recall how you started that morning. “In many cases the still photo is an extraordinary single image,” she said, “and the video adds this dimensional storytelling that you could never do in a caption under a photograph.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/business/media/time-warner-reports-double-digit-revenue-increase-expects-more.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Time Warner Reports Double-Digit Revenue Increase, Expects More<date>Published: August 3, 2011</date><text>Time Warner, the owner of Warner Brothers, Turner Broadcasting and Time Inc., on Wednesday reported a 10 percent rise in revenue for the quarter that ended in June — its highest growth rate since 2007 — and slightly revised upward its earnings guidance for the year.The company’s total revenues were $7.03 billion, up from $6.38 billion in the same quarter last year. That beat most analysts’ expectations, as did its net income of $638 million, or 59 cents a share, up from $562 million, or 49 cents a share. The company had previously expected its adjusted earnings per share to grow by the “low teens” on a percentage basis for the full year. On Wednesday, it said it now believed earnings would grow by “at least low teens.” Jeff Bewkes, the chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, told analysts that cable advertising and subscription revenues remained strong. He said the company benefited in the second quarter from the release of the hit film “The Hangover Part II” and from sales of HBO shows like “True Blood” and video games like “Mortal Kombat 9.” Creating new franchises costs money, and Time Warner’s margins were somewhat affected by investments in content rights for the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and in start-up costs for HBO GO, a streaming library of shows. “These investments both set us up for accelerated earnings growth in the second half of this year and further strengthen our long-term growth prospects,” John Martin, the company’s chief financial officer, said during the conference call with analysts. Mr. Bewkes cited HBO GO as an example of Time Warner’s efforts to refashion itself for customers who want content digitally. Earlier this year, HBO, which has historically been a profit center for Time Warner, rolled out HBO GO as a free extension for subscribers of the premium cable channel, allowing them to watch virtually every HBO show and feature film via the Internet. Mr. Bewkes said the extension had been “an even bigger hit than we expected,” with nearly four million downloads of the HBO GO mobile app since May. “Our research shows that 85 percent of GO users are watching much more HBO than they did before,” he said. Later in the year, HBO hopes to extend the service to some Internet-connected television sets and video game consoles. The networks unit that includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting had revenues of $3.5 billion for the quarter, up 9 percent. Filmed entertainment, which includes Warner Brothers, had revenues of $2.8 billion, up 13 percent. Publishing, which includes Time Inc., had revenues of $946 million, up 3 percent. Mr. Martin noted that Time Inc.’s margins continue to improve, but cautioned that the unit is ”seeing some softness in both advertising and newsstand sales” in the third quarter. Time Inc. announced on Wednesday that all of its magazines would be available on tablets by the end of the year. It asserted in a news release that it would be “the first major U.S. magazine publisher to make all of its titles available on all leading tablet platforms, with products designed specifically for this medium.” Some of its 21 magazines, like People and Sports Illustrated, are already available as digital subscriptions or as single copies on tablets.Time Warner, the owner of Warner Brothers, Turner Broadcasting and Time Inc., on Wednesday reported a 10 percent rise in revenue for the quarter that ended in June — its highest growth rate since 2007 — and slightly revised upward its earnings guidance for the year.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/dracula-lurks-in-your-set-top-box/?ref=timewarnerinc">Dracula Lurks in Your Set-Top Box<date>June 15, 2011, 6:23 pm</date><text>Natural Resources Defense Council Imagine pulling into your parking space and just hopping out, leaving the car idling all day while you’re at the office. As ludicrous as this may sound, most Americans are guilty of a similar if less costly squandering of energy when it comes to their cable or satellite TV boxes. A new study released on Tuesday by the Natural Resources Defense Council shows that set-top boxes in the United States consume nearly as much energy when not in use as when they are on, costing a cumulative $2 billion a year. Noah Horowitz, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency at the council, said that while most Americans have been guilted into unplugging their cellphone chargers when they’re not attached to the phone itself, those energy savings pale by comparison with what would be recouped by unplugging set-top boxes. The problem is that the set-top boxes installed by Cablevision, Time Warner or Verizon when you sign up for service have no such thing as an on-off switch. Turning the power off on the remote may dim the display lights, but it makes no substantial difference in terms of the energy consumed. Unless you squeeze behind the TV to unplug everything after your show ends, the little black box will end up racking up an average two-thirds of its energy consumption when you’re not using it. With 160 million such set-top boxes in use in the country today, the power wasted is equivalent to what is produced annually by six coal burning power plants and is responsible for the release of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. Meanwhile, with more and more Americans demanding to watch what they want, when they want, DVRs, which consume 40 percent more energy than a standard cable box, are becoming increasingly prevalent. Because the cable, satellite or phone company doesn’t pay your energy bill, Mr. Horowitz said, it has little incentive to provide its customers with more energy-efficient boxes. In fact, some of the DVR devices provided by the companies could be set to a more energy-efficient mode, he said, but the TV service providers don’t take the time to do so. The good news is that solutions already exist. Europe’s Sky TV offers its customers a DVR box that uses 22.5 watts when fully on, 13.2 watts when in light sleep mode and less than one watt when in deep sleep mode, which you can set to coordinate with your own deep sleep mode. If you’re not ready to pack up for Europe, though, Mr. Horowitz said, you can still pick up your phone and tell your TV service provider that you want modern devices on this side of the Atlantic.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/agent-and-former-publisher-to-lead-new-imprint-for-amazon/?ref=timewarnerinc">Agent and Former Publisher to Lead New Imprint for Amazon<date>May 23, 2011, 8:46 am</date><text>Laurence J.

Net income declined 10 percent, to $651 million, or 59 cents a share, in the quarter, from $725 million, or 62 cents a share, from in the period a year ago. Adjusted earnings, at 58 cents a share, were slightly above expectations. Analysts said the decline was mostly because of higher costs associated with the rights to the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, which Time Warner’s cable channels shared with CBS for the first time this year. Total programming costs for the network division — which includes TNT, TBS, CNN, and HBO — jumped 37 percent from the quarter a year ago. Partly offsetting the costs, combined advertising revenue for the channels climbed 48 percent, helping the company achieve the overall 18 percent gain in revenue for the division. “Investment in must-see sports is really paying off,” Mr. Bewkes said, crediting the NCAA basketball telecasts on the TBS, TNT and truTV channels. Revenue declined 3.3 percent at the company’s motion picture arm, Warner Brothers, where net income declined almost 50 percent because its film slate was healthier in the same period last year. Michael Nathanson, an analyst for Nomura Securities, said the decline was a result of fewer home video releases in the quarter “and the lack of any major box-office hits with releases.” On Wednesday, Time Warner said it had acquired Flixster, an online community for film buffs that recommends films and has a strong presence on mobile phones. The acquisition also includes Rotten Tomatoes, a Web site that compiles film reviews. Time Warner said that Rotten Tomatoes would remain independent. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed. Time Warner is expected to leverage Flixster and its fan base as it introduces “Digital Everywhere,” a pay-once, play-anywhere approach to digital movie delivery. Time Warner’s publishing arm, Time Inc., which remains much smaller than the television or film divisions, reported revenue that was effectively flat. Asked on the conference call if he intended to sell Time Inc. — a persistent question — Mr. Bewkes said no and reiterated the opportunity that he saw for magazines on tablet computers. Time Inc. confirmed early this week that it had struck a deal with Apple to make the iPad versions of Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune available free to existing subscribers of the magazines. Previously, only People magazine was available that way for authenticated subscribers. In an outlook statement on Wednesday, Time Warner affirmed that it expected earnings growth in 2011 to be in “the low teens” in percentage growth.Time Warner, the media company, on Wednesday reported a 6 percent gain in first-quarter revenue, to $6.7 billion, driven by gains at cable channels like TNT and HBO.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/business/27steal.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Alan Horn’s String of Hits Wasn’t Enough at Warner Brothers<date>Published: March 26, 2011</date><text>FOR the last 12 years, Alan F. Horn’s movie operation has printed money for Warner Brothers, the largest of Hollywood’s studios.Sure, there have been flops and missteps. But Mr. Horn, as Warner’s president and chief operating officer, has generally kept the studio on an unusually steady course by delivering hit after hit: “The Perfect Storm,” “300,” “The Departed,” “Happy Feet,” “Ocean’s Eleven,” “Sherlock Holmes,” “Million Dollar Baby,” “The Dark Knight.” The most lucrative film franchise in Hollywood history, bigger even than “Star Wars” and James Bond, is Harry Potter. And Mr. Horn is largely the one to thank for that. But in the coming days, Mr. Horn will ride — unhappily — into the sunset after being squeezed out of the studio to make room for a new generation of managers. “The notion of my leaving, as you know, did not come from me,” Mr. Horn said in an interview. “I guess they wanted younger and better-looking management.” There is nothing unusual, in Hollywood or any industry, about a star executive wanting to remain at the controls longer than a corporate parent would like. What has raised eyebrows in movie circles is the indelicate manner in which Time Warner, which owns the studio, has pushed Mr. Horn aside. One of the longstanding codes of the movie business involves longevity and loyalty: Once you’re a made man, to use the Mafia term adopted by film folk, you’re allowed to write your own ticket for nearly as long as you want. Perhaps, eventually, you get a discreet nudge to step aside or move into a chairman emeritus-type of position. All the while, you are treated with deep respect. Yes, it’s true that Mr. Horn was not enthusiastic about making “The Hangover,” the crude comedy that racked up $468 million in global ticket sales in 2009. But he is also the guy who drafted the blueprints for what has become Warner’s primary operating strategy — focusing on effects-filled event pictures, or “tent poles,” that resonate overseas. Under his leadership, Warner has also been the No. 1 studio in market share for the last three years. (It has long been the biggest when measured by number of movies.) “You don’t get to be No. 1 because you rest on your laurels or won’t adapt to changing times,” Mr. Horn said. “You get it because you earn it year after year.” Mr. Horn’s friends say a first slight from Time Warner came in 2009, when the company allowed news to circulate in the Hollywood trade press that it planned to renew the contracts of Mr. Horn and Barry M. Meyer, Warner’s chairman, for only two years instead of the typical three to five. “Humiliating!” was how Deadline.com, the Hollywood blog, summed up the move. Then, last September, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, announced that he would keep Mr. Meyer in place for two more years — but stick to the planned parting of ways with Mr. Horn, whose consolation prize was a consulting gig. To replace Mr. Horn, the company created an “office of the president,” elevating three executives who had been angling for promotion: Jeff Robinov, Bruce Rosenblum and Kevin Tsujihara. The upshot, say longtime industry watchers, is that Hollywood’s clubby, insular business culture is fraying as studios grow ever more corporate and answer to multinational companies that either don’t know the customs of Hollywood or don’t care about them. Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures and Warner all answer to bosses in New York. Walt Disney Studios is the sole major film operation that has a local owner. “It’s hard to leave,” Mr. Horn said. “But Jeff Bewkes, you’ve heard that name, he’s the big boss.” In an e-mail statement last week, Mr. Bewkes said: “With his passion for compelling filmmaking, Alan helped lead Warner Brothers through one of the company’s most creative and successful eras in its long history. Even more importantly, Alan generously shared his knowledge of how to engage and excite audiences around the world with the Warners executives who will succeed him — a lasting contribution for which I will always be grateful.” LOOKING back, Mr. Horn, who grew up on Long Island and got his Hollywood start working in television, is proud of a range of accomplishments, starting with Warner’s No. 1 status. “I’m especially proud of the people that I’ve worked with — the most first-rate, first-class group around,” he said. Running Warner’s movie operation has been arduous, but he says he has relished the pressure. “It’s competitive and tough, and I have felt the weight of committing upwards of $3 billion of the company’s money on movie production,” he said. “But I like it.” Mr. Horn declined to single out a specific movie as a point of pride, but he did name the filmmaker with whom he was most pleased to work: Clint Eastwood. “I have tremendous affection for Mr. Eastwood,” he said, displaying the kind of public deference that has traditionally been part of the business culture in the movie capital. “ ‘Gran Torino,’ ‘Unforgiven,’ ‘Hereafter’ — all terrific,” Mr. Horn said. “Oh, and you can’t forget ‘Invictus.’ ” He added, “Leaving would be easy if there wasn’t such incredible talent here.”FOR the last 12 years, Alan F. Horn’s movie operation has printed money for Warner Brothers, the largest of Hollywood’s studios.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/big-mergers-often-pose-antitrust-concerns/?ref=timewarnerinc">AT&amp;T Deal Joins a History of Antitrust Fights<date>March 21, 2011, 12:37 pm</date><text>6:38 p.m. | Updated AT&amp;T’s deal to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion is shaping up to be a heated regulatory battle. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Federal trade and communications regulators, along with the Justice Department, must bless the deal, which would create the nation’s largest cellular carrier. Lawmakers are already denouncing the deal, saying it will reduce competition in an already consolidated industry. The deal is the latest in a long line of mega-mergers to raise antitrust concerns. Here’s a look at other prominent transactions that set off controversy in Washington. Comcast-NBC Universal DEAL: Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, agreed to acquire 51 percent of NBC Universal for about $13.75 billion from General Electric in December 2009, capping nearly nine months of negotiations. OBSTACLES: Democrats on Capitol Hill initially objected, contending the deal would constrain programming choices for consumers and result in higher cable-TV subscription prices. OUTCOME: It took more than a year, but the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department finally agreed to the merger in January. The approval came with several conditions, including measures to curb Comcast’s control of the online video marketplace. AOL-Time Warner DEAL: America Online agreed in January 2000 to buy Time Warner for $165 billion, the biggest merger in history. OBSTACLES: The merger involved an area largely unfamiliar to regulators, the Internet. OUTCOME: The deal closed in January 2001, with the F.C.C. requiring AOL to open up its instant messaging services to make them more compatible with rivals’. The deal proved to be ill-fated. The combined company faced turf battles, an accounting scandal, plummeting stock price and shareholder lawsuits, ultimately forcing the businesses into a bitter divorce. WorldCom-MCI DEAL: MCI Communications, at the time the nation’s second-largest long-distance telephone company, agreed in November 1997 to sell itself to WorldCom for about $36.5 billion in cash and stock. OBSTACLES: Consumer groups rallied against the deal, complaining it would send phone service prices through the roof. OUTCOME: In the summer of 1998, the Justice Department and European regulators signed off on the deal, after MCI agreed to sell its Internet business. Following an accounting scandal, WorldCom filed what was then the largest bankruptcy in United States history. The company’s chief executive was later convicted of fraud. WorldCom-Sprint DEAL: Following the acquisition of MCI, WorldCom set it sights on the Sprint Corporation in 1999, offering more than $100 billion for the long-distance company. OBSTACLES: Regulators were skeptical of the deal from the start, worried it would further stifle competition on the heels of the MCI takeover. OUTCOME: WorldCom and Sprint abandoned their merger in July 2000. AT&amp;T-BellSouth DEAL: AT&amp;T’s bid for T-Mobile is hardly its first major move. In March 2006, the telecom giant agreed to buy the BellSouth Corporation for around $83 billion. OBSTACLES: While the Justice Department cleared the way for the merger to advance, the F.C.C. was caught up in an internal debate over whether one of its members was allowed to vote on the deal. Robert M. McDowell, an F.C.C. commissioner — a former lobbyist for the telecommunications industry — abstained, leaving the commission deadlocked. OUTCOME: The agency approved the deal in late 2006 without Mr. McDowell’s vote, after the companies agreed to several concessions over network neutrality.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/business/global/17views.html?ref=timewarnerinc">For Time Warner, a Rival to Watch<date>Published: March 22, 2011</date><text> Netflix is looking less like Web TV and more like HBO. The plans of the $11.5 billion DVD rental and online video service to branch out into original content encroach on the territory staked out by the pioneering Time Warner cable network. Given this turn of events, could Time Warner be better off acquiring its emerging rival? That is not the obvious takeaway from the high-profile trash talk dished out by Jeffrey Bewkes, the Time Warner chief executive. He has been publicly assaulting the Netflix business model. He may be right, up to a point. Mr. Bewkes wonders how Netflix can keep charging so little when he and a few other media giants control most of the programming the service needs to acquire. But Netflix, run by its co-founder, Reed Hastings, has a record of defying the skeptics. It overcame those who said it wouldn’t survive challenges from Blockbuster and Wal-Mart. Netflix powered through the recession, adding nearly eight million subscribers last year alone, taking it to 20 million. Time Warner’s HBO meanwhile lost about 1.5 million customers, dropping its total to about 28 million. Broadcasting exclusive programming is a natural next step. It is, after all, how HBO made its mark, with the likes of “Sex and the City” and “The Sopranos.” The dramatic series “House of Cards,” which Netflix is trying to buy, could be just the ticket. To Mr. Bewkes’s point, it won’t be cheap. The production from Kevin Spacey and “The Social Network” director, David Fincher, may cost Netflix $100 million, or more than one quarter’s worth of operating profit. And committing to 26 episodes of an unproven series is a big risk, though it might attract more subscribers. It may be a necessary gamble with viewing habits changing rapidly. HBO is trying to keep up by allowing paying customers to watch on any platform they choose. But if Netflix is the next HBO — and the distribution channel of the future — then Time Warner might be better off owning it, too. It’s a tall order given Mr. Bewkes’s rhetoric and Netflix’s expensive valuation of 50 times expected earnings. But it could be that Time Warner can’t afford not to buy Netflix. Junk Debt Breather It was time for a breather anyway. Volatility is to blame for subinvestment grade companies like Toys “R” Us yanking more than $7 billion of debt issuance this week. But after a buoyant spell in the debt markets, the break is no disaster. The confusion from the catastrophic events unfolding in Japan has forced investors across the globe to reassess risk. Those lending to junk-rated companies in the United States should welcome the respite from the breakneck pace experienced for most of this year. Investors already lent more than $140 billion in fresh funds to risky companies, with the once moribund leveraged loan market making up more than half the new deals. As investors searched for extra return, the standard protections already were being sacrificed. So-called covenant-lite loans, which typified easy borrowing during the boom, accounted for 16 percent of total leveraged loan issuance this year, according to Thomson Reuters. A time-out will give enthusiastic investors a chance to reassess the balance of risk and return. Borrowers, meanwhile, are in good shape to weather a temporary shutdown. Over the last two years, companies have taken advantage of easy money to refinance themselves. At the end of 2008, a wall of debt coming due cast a long shadow over the market. More than $800 billion was scheduled to be repaid through 2014, according to Bank of America. The bank reckons that will have shrunk to only a quarter as much by the end of this year. Toys “R” Us, for one, hardly looked desperate. A $500 million outstanding bond matures this year, but not until August. Moreover, the bulk of its $1.1 billion deal reprices an existing loan that doesn’t mature until 2016, according to KDP Advisors. A forced closing of any credit market will rightly unnerve participants, who won’t have forgotten the lengthy paralysis induced by the subprime financial crisis. But borrowers and lenders are both in better shape to cope with the situation now. The pause might even help cool things down and recalibrate risk expectations when activity restarts.

It’s no longer a “Mad Men” world where women are expected to fetch coffee and whiskey and service their bosses in other ways.But it may still be a “Two and a Half Men” world. For eight very successful seasons, Charlie Sheen has been the star of “Two and a Half Men” which is produced by Warner Brothers and which is owned by Time Warner, and broadcast by CBS. Let’s ignore the mountains of cocaine that Mr. Sheen has admitted doing along the way — CBS and Warner Brothers certainly did. In addition to wreaking all manner of havoc on himself with drugs and alcohol that has put him in the hospital and the show on hiatus, Mr. Sheen has done a lot of damage to the people around him, women in particular. In 2006, his wife at the time, Denise Richards, filed a restraining order, charging that Mr. Sheen had pushed her down, thrown chairs at her and threatened to kill her in person and on the phone. The couple eventually divorced. Mr. Sheen then had a series of very public relationships with sex film stars, which is certainly his prerogative — talent is as talent does — but he also continued to exhibit a pattern of violence toward women. Mr. Sheen was charged with a felony for an incident on Christmas Day in 2009 in which he threatened to kill his wife, Brooke Mueller, while holding a knife to her throat. According to the police report, Mr. Sheen “started to strangle Mueller then he pulled out a knife he always carries on his person and held the knife to Mueller’s neck and threatened, ‘You better be in fear. If you tell anybody I’ll kill you.’ ” Last fall, Mr. Sheen went on a rampage in the Plaza Hotel in New York. A hired escort who had locked herself in the bathroom claimed he had put his hands around her neck and threatened her while his former wife Ms. Richards and his children slept down the hall. Yet none of these incidents got Mr. Sheen fired from his lucrative day job as a sitcom star, not even suspended. What did? He insulted his boss. Last week, while vacationing on the Bahamas, Mr. Sheen got on the phone with a radio show host and called his boss, the executive producer Chuck Lorre, “a clown” and then went on to make what many saw as an attempt at a slur, calling Mr. Lorre “Chaim Levine.” Just in case people didn’t understand the true nature of his feelings, he told TMZ that “I violently hate Chaim Levine.” CBS and Warner Brothers immediately pulled the plug on the season and issued a joint statement: “Based on the totality of Charlie Sheen’s statements, conduct and condition, CBS and Warner Brothers Television have decided to discontinue production of ‘Two and a Half Men’ for the remainder of the season.” CBS executives said that a human calculus was underway, that both companies were concerned about Mr. Sheen’s survival, not their business interests. But the business interests — hundreds of millions in broadcast and syndication revenue will be lost if the show is gone for good — continued to prevail even as he terrorized the women in his life. CBS officials will not come near to making any statements on the record because they are convinced, given the antagonisms in the air, that the matter will end in court. They did point out that for a guy who was supposedly ready and willing to go to work in a week, Mr. Sheen has a funny way of showing it. In addition to attacking Mr. Lorre and generally acting like a megalomaniac to almost anyone with a microphone, Mr. Sheen said that recovery programs are for losers and said that he had somehow managed to cure himself of the scourge of addiction “with his mind.” That usually doesn’t work out too well in my experience. “There’s lots of stars who have problems,” said Tony Angellotti, a veteran Hollywood publicist. “But when they walk back on that set, they are expected to pull it together because so much is at stake, and most of them pull it off. He said the kind of things that make it hard for him to work with the boss of the show.” And that is the real human calculus here: the companies are being forced to pick sides between Mr. Sheen and Mr. Lorre. In a town that lives for hits and can’t seem to find them, Mr. Lorre has helped create not only “Two and a Half Men,” but “Grace Under Fire,” “Cybill,” “Dharma &amp; Greg,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “Mike and Molly.” So the message from CBS and Warner Brothers seems clear: abuse yourself and the women around you to your heart’s content, but do not attack the golden goose. We can all nod and wink and say “it’s Hollywood, what do you expect?” CBS and Time Warner may be in the entertainment business, but they are both publicly traded companies with shareholders, corporate ethics policies and, one presumes, many female employees who don’t particularly care to see a highly paid employee (Mr. Sheen, between his share of syndication and a salary of $1.2 million per episode, makes enough to put him at the top of the food chain in most of corporate America) continually threaten to use women as punching bags. Last year, Mark Hurd, then chief executive Hewlett-Packard, resigned after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment made by a consultant to the company. True, Mr. Hurd received a nice fat package and became a co-president at Oracle almost immediately. But there were no allegations of assault and he was still held to account for what he described as failing to “live up to the standards and principles of trust, respect and integrity” he had set at the company. In 2007, Chris Albrecht, then chairman of HBO, which is owned by Time Warner — yes, that Time Warner — was asked to resign after he was arrested and charged with assaulting a woman in a Las Vegas parking lot. Even though Mr. Albrecht had played a large role in developing the paid cable network and hits like “Sex and the City” and “The Sopranos,” his behavior, coupled with past incidents of domestic abuse, was deemed unacceptable. Is Mr. Sheen excused because he manufactures laughs, not widgets, for a living? For years on the show, Mr. Sheen has been playing to type as a naughty boy in a man’s body: the result was often scabrous and funny and a hit in the ratings. It also fits another depressing pattern. From “Animal House” to Howard Stern, from “Pretty Woman” to “The Hangover,” Hollywood has long had a soft spot for male misbehavior and, in claiming to parody childish misogyny, it seems to provide an excuse to indulge in it further. Hollywood likes to pretend it has grown up and taken its seat in corporate America. But it hasn’t when it comes to violence toward women. Mr. Sheen may have gone off-script last week. But in his attitudes toward women both on and off screen, he’s right on message.

The regulatory filings, known as 13Fs, display position level detail of large investors at the end of the fourth quarter of the year. As always, it is a mixed bag. For example, Appaloosa Management remains bullish on financial stocks while Trian Partners is pulling back on the industry. Here is a list of some of the most closely watched money managers and their recent moves, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 13F filings on Feb. 14. SAC Capital Advisors The giant hedge fund run by the billionaire Steven A. Cohen increased holdings in a number of companies during the fourth quarter, including Apple. SAC has significantly increased holdings in the 99 Cents Only Stores, from 41,000 shares at the end of the third quarter to roughly 2.3 million by year’s end. Mr. Cohen also nearly quintupled his shares in Berkshire Hathaway, to about 201,000 shares. At the same time, the fund significantly trimmed its holdings in General Electric and Time Warner. Greenlight Capital David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager who famously shorted Lehman Brothers before the firm collapsed, opened new positions in his portfolio with shares in Sprint Nextel (60 million shares), BP (3.3 million shares) and the fertilizer company Potash (379,000). He disposed stakes in Ralcorp Holdings and Foster Wheeler. Appaloosa Management David Tepper, whose bet on financials has paid off significantly, made a modest new move into food-related companies, buying more than 10 million of shares of Dean Foods, 300,000-plus shares in Supervalu and more than a hundred thousand in both Safeway and Kroger. Trian Partners Bucking what amounted to a mini-trend in fourth-quarter hedge fund activity, Nelson Peltz shed the financial companies Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp. Mr. Peltz, who pushed the fast food chains Arby’s Restaurant Group and Wendy’s International to merge, opted to buy 1.5 million shares of Kellogg’s.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/business/media/03warner.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Time Warner Raises Dividend as Earnings Beat Forecast<date>Published: February 2, 2011</date><text>Time Warner, the media company, raised its dividend on Wednesday and reported stronger results for the quarter and the year.The company attributed the increase to higher revenue at its television networks, including Turner Broadcasting and HBO, and its filmed entertainment property, Warner Brothers. Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $769 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $631 million, or 53 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 67 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had expected 62 cents a share. The company’s board also voted to raise its dividend by 11 percent. In a statement on Wednesday, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, described the results as “outstanding” and said the company would continue an aggressive push in 2011. “We’ll increase our investments in programming, production and marketing even more than we did last year,” Mr. Bewkes said. “We’ll keep pushing to accelerate new business models. We’ll keep expanding our presence in the most attractive international territories. And we’ll do all of this while keeping a rigorous focus on our operating and capital efficiency.” On Tuesday, Time Warner and Comcast announced an unusually comprehensive pact that covers the online streaming of channels like TNT, TBS, CNN and the Cartoon Network. Time Warner announced the deal as part of its “TV Everywhere” concept, in which the company will allow cable television subscribers to watch content on multiple platforms. Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Nomura, said Wednesday’s results signaled strong growth for national cable advertising and showed how disciplined the company had been in returning money to shareholders. The company paid a total of $3 billion in dividends in last year. The TV Everywhere concept was also crucial for Time Warner, Mr. Nathanson said. “Protecting the ecosystem, making sure people still want to pay for TV is very important.” During a conference call on Wednesday Mr. Bewkes said he expected to have agreements for TV Everywhere covering 70 million homes in the United States by the middle of 2011 and cited affiliate fees as “one of the most important growth drivers in our company.” Mr. Bewkes also cited items that had been crucial to building audiences, including the recent 14-year partnership between CBS, Turner Sports and the men’s N.C.A.A. basketball tournament; cable shows like the coming “Falling Skies” on TNT and the relocation of the “Conan” show to TBS; and movies like “The Hangover 2” and “Happy Feet 2” John K. Martin, the chief financial officer, said the company expected the N.C.A.A. tournament to yield a “significant boost in advertising revenue” for the first quarter. “Both the partnership with CBS and our initial ad sales have exceeded our expectations,” Mr. Martin said. Regarding international markets, Mr. Bewkes highlighted growth opportunities in cable markets and local television and film production in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and India. Revenue for the three months that ended Dec. 31 increased 8 percent, to $7.8 billion, which beat the $7.47 billion forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. For the year, the media giant reported $26.9 billion in revenue, 6 percent higher than in 2009. The company said revenue at its film unit rose 10 percent to $3.6 billion in the quarter, mainly because of higher licensing fees. Its television unit reported a 14 percent increase in quarterly revenue, to $3.3 billion on higher income from subscriptions, advertising and content. Publishing revenue fell 4 percent in the quarter, to $1.1 billion, on lower advertising and subscription sales. For the year, revenue at the publishing unit decreased 2 percent, to $3.7 billion. Advertising revenue at the unit, however, grew 3 percent for the year.Time Warner, the media company, raised its dividend on Wednesday and reported stronger results for the quarter and the year.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/media/02cable.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Comcast Deal and Amazon Speculation Stir Talk on Online Streaming<date>Published: February 1, 2011</date><text>The increasing importance of Internet rights for television channels and shows has been vividly demonstrated twice in the last few days.Comcast and Time Warner announced an unusually comprehensive pact on Tuesday that covers the online streaming of channels like TNT, TBS, CNN and the Cartoon Network. Meanwhile, media analysts were aflutter about the possibility of Amazon’s starting an online video subscription service that could rival Netflix. Amazon has declined to comment. The blog Engadget published an Amazon.com screen capture on Saturday that suggested that Amazon was preparing an all-you-can-eat video streaming service, which like Netflix could give customers access to a variety of TV shows and films. Barclays analysts said in a note to investors on Monday that they anticipated a service “similar to Netflix’s current platform.” “While its content portfolio would initially likely be less robust than Netflix’s licensed content, we believe Amazon has the scale to become a viable over-the-top distributor over time,” the note stated, before reiterating that such services were largely supplemental to entrenched cable and satellite distributors. Deals like the one between Comcast and Time Warner are devised in part to blunt online upstarts. The companies said the contract was a step forward for their vision of “TV Everywhere,” a concept that holds that people who pay for a cable television subscription once should be able to watch television on any screen, be it a big-screen TV or an iPad. But that concept requires complicated new contracts between programmers like Time Warner and distributors like Comcast. “TV Everywhere” has been slow to materialize, so the announcement on Tuesday was a breakthrough of sorts. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said the agreement “really solidifies our partnership in this effort and really pushes forward the concept of giving consumers more access to quality on-demand content on any device they choose.” The rights for online streaming were part of a larger agreement between the companies. Details were not disclosed, but the agreement also renews Comcast’s traditional carriage of some of Time Warner’s channels. Brian L. Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, said the contract was for multiple years. On the on-demand side, the agreement covers many of Turner’s TV shows and movies in a variety of places, including Comcast’s streaming Web site, Comcast’s on-demand system on television sets, Turner’s own Web sites, and on tablets and mobile phone screens. Significantly, the contract will cover out-of-home streaming of Turner channels and TV shows by Comcast customers in the future. Comcast already has similar pacts for streaming content with HBO, another part of Time Warner. A Comcast app that allows customers to stream certain TV shows was already visible in the iPad app store on Tuesday night. What remained unknown on Tuesday was whether Comcast was paying a substantial amount for the streaming rights. “They haven’t wanted to pay substantially more for television video-on-demand rights in the past,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst for BTIG. He said of Comcast, “Have they had a change of perspective on paying for additional on-demand rights? Or is this deal about Time Warner just wanting to seed the market because it’s been 18 months and ‘TV Everywhere’ has moved more slowly than investors had hoped?”The increasing importance of Internet rights for television channels and shows has been vividly demonstrated twice in the last few days.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/comcast-and-time-warner-sign-online-streaming-deal/?ref=timewarnerinc">Comcast and Time Warner Sign Online Streaming Deal<date>February 1, 2011, 5:04 pm</date><text>In a first-of-its-kind deal, Comcast and Time Warner have signed a new contract that covers the online streaming of channels like TNT, TBS, CNN, and the Cartoon Network. The contract demonstrates that Internet rights for TV shows and channels are becoming increasingly important to distributors as they try to keep up with consumers’ changing habits. Comcast and Time Warner said the contract was a step forward for their vision of “TV Everywhere,” a concept that holds that people who pay for a television subscription once should be able to watch television on any screen, be it a big-screen TV or an iPad. But that concept requires complicated new contracts between programmers like Time Warner and distributors like Comcast. TV Everywhere has been slow to materialize, disappointing some consumers and investors. That’s why the joint announcement on Tuesday is a breakthrough of sorts. Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said in a statement Tuesday, “When we first announced the TV Everywhere initiative with Comcast and Brian Roberts 18 months ago, it was an untested idea facing technical doubts and competitive pressures — but already more than 50 million consumers can experience some form of it from a wide range of content providers and distributors. This landmark agreement between Turner and Comcast, along with our separate recent deal between Comcast and HBO, really solidifies our partnership in this effort and really pushes forward the concept of giving consumers more access to quality on-demand content on any device they choose.” The rights for online streaming were part of a larger agreement between the two companies. Details were not disclosed, but the new agreement also renews Comcast’s traditional carriage of some of Time Warner’s channels. On the on-demand side, the agreement covers many of Turner’s TV shows and movies in a variety of places. Those places include Comcast’s streaming Web site, Comcast’s on-demand system on television sets, Turner’s own Web sites, and on tablets and mobile phone screens. Significantly, the contract will cover out-of-home streaming of Turner channels and TV shows by Comcast customers sometime in the future. The companies characterized the contract as “multiyear.” Comcast already has similar pacts for streaming content with HBO, another part of Time Warner. What remained unknown Tuesday was whether Comcast was paying a substantial amount for the streaming rights. “They haven’t wanted to pay substantially more for television video-on-demand rights in the past,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst for BTIG. He asked of Comcast, “Have they had a change of perspective on paying for incremental on-demand rights?

But will it happen in concert with the major cable and satellite distributors, or in spite of them?That question loomed large at the Consumer Electronics Show last week as manufacturers promoted Internet-connected television sets and companies like Cisco and Sony talked about “redefining television.” All involved know that connecting the Internet to television and vice versa could solidify the distributors’ place in the food chain — or greatly erode it. “We want to use all this technology to make a better consumer experience,” Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, said in an interview after speaking on stage here. A better experience, it stands to reason, will help Time Warner Cable and other cable companies retain customers, protecting the lucrative subscription TV business from the prospect of cord-cutting. It will also help manufacturers sell more hardware for the living room. During the trade show, however, there was a point in every demonstration where fantasy collided with reality — and it was usually when the cable and satellite distributors came up. “The idea here is to work with cable,” said Google’s Rishi Chandra as he showed off Google TV to Julius Genachowski, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, on Friday afternoon. When working together, Google TV can seamlessly find live television channels, recorded shows, on-demand options and Web streams. So far, though, it works that way only with Dish Network. “Right now,” Mr. Chandra said, “we’re limited.” After seeing television setups at the show, Mr. Genachowski said, “They’re incentivizing the cable companies to innovate.” At the show, media and technology executives largely agreed with that sentiment. And signs of innovation were evident: Time Warner Cable, one of the biggest cable operators, announced that it would start delivering programming via its network straight into some Sony and Samsung television sets, removing the need for a set-top cable television box. The so-called smart TVs receive video via the Internet, protect the video as directed by the content owners, and display it all with a program guide that is much slicker than the ones that most people are saddled with now. Time Warner Cable customers who buy the television sets will have a cable television app on the program guide next to a YouTube app and a Facebook app, all tied together by a search bar. Many distributors “will have an app for us” over time, predicted Stuart Silloway, a training manager for Samsung Electronics America. Also last week, Comcast and Time Warner Cable announced that they would replicate their live channel lineups on tablet computers. Other distributors like Verizon and Cablevision are working on similar features. (Of course, the channels themselves are also scurrying to reach consumers on tablets, too.) The move onto tablets is part of a recognition by the Comcasts and Verizons of the world that they have to keep up with changing consumer habits. “If you buy a video subscription from us in your home, our goal is to make the video available on all your devices,” Mr. Britt of Time Warner said, echoing the goal of the “TV Everywhere” concept espoused by his and other companies. He added, “People don’t see PCs and phones and tablets and TVs as different things. They are all just video display devices.” Making a television subscription available on all those devices is wrenchingly difficult, because of a maze of copyrights and sometimes contradictory content strategies. At first, the live streams to tablets will be available only in customers’ homes, the distributors indicated last week. But that is still progress. Stand-alone boxes that bring the Internet to big-screen TVs have not caught on with the public, but including that functionality in televisions may make it more popular. It was learned last week that the remote controls for some Blu-ray players and connected televisions will come with red Netflix buttons this year, which is sure to “cause some consternation among those concerned about cable service cord-cutting,” wrote David Joyce of Miller Tabak and Company in an analyst’s note. But Mr. Joyce is optimistic that cable and satellite companies will adapt. Sensing a big business opportunity, companies are lining up to bolster “TV Everywhere” and, thus, the cable companies. John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, proclaimed at a news conference Wednesday that “video is the next voice.” He said that Cisco had a software and hardware architecture package called Videoscape to blend television and Internet video sources. In demonstrations, Cisco imagined an on-screen guide with three columns — the largest column being the television channels provided by the distributor, the second column being Web content, and the third being videos and photos from friends and family members. That guide was replicated on laptops, tablets and smartphones. Cisco and Motorola, with a prototype of something it called “MediOS,” want customers to be able to quickly shift a television show or a Web video from one screen to another, and to be able to see what friends are watching at the same time. But that will take deals with distributors — and big investments. As an example, the Google TV setup works well when it is fully tied into a distributors’ system, as it is with Dish Network. “But because there’s no integrated ability to control tuners — to stream content — it’s not standard,” Mr. Chandra told Mr. Genachowski on Friday during a tour of the trade show floor. “It’s going to take years and years and years to negotiate the integrations,” Mr. Chandra added. For content owners, it is a confusing time. At the trade show, companies like News Corporation and the CBS Corporation held court with all manner of manufacturers and in a couple of cases announced new pacts. CBS will soon start allowing users of Boxee, an Internet television software package, to buy episodes of shows like “CSI.” One senior media executive deemed the Internet TV marketplace a “jump ball,” with television makers, distributors and content owners all participating. “That’s why we have to talk to everybody,” said the executive, who insisted on anonymity because those talks are private. What is still lacking, in large part, is consumer education about Internet-connected TVs — but that will change. The Sony chief executive, Howard Stringer, announced Wednesday that Sony would start a worldwide advertising campaign called “Television Redefined” this year. “The next evolution is upon us: the marriage of the television and the Internet,” he said that day, without specifying who would officiate at the wedding.LAS VEGAS — The blending of television and the Internet is inevitable. But will it happen in concert with the major cable and satellite distributors, or in spite of them?</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/business/media/13bewkes.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Time Warner Takes a Shot at Netflix<date>Published: December 12, 2010</date><text>For the past year, executives at big media companies have watched Netflix with growing resentment — for its success in delivering movies and television shows via the Internet, for its stock price nearly quadrupling, for its chief executive being named businessperson of the year by Fortune magazine.Now many of the companies that make the shows and movies that Netflix delivers to mailboxes, computer screens and televisions — companies whose stocks have not enjoyed the same frothy rise, and whose chief executives have not won the same accolades — are pushing back, arguing that the company is overhyped, and vowing to charge much more to license their content. “It’s a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world?” said Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, in an interview last week. “I don’t think so.” Netflix has been a business partner to the movie and television studios through licensing deals, but increasingly it is seen as a partner with its hands far deeper in the pockets of the media companies than anyone thought. Through its success, the company has positioned itself at the center of the media universe — at the nexus of technology and content — and is now finding it a place increasingly under attack. The relationship between Netflix and the media companies will most likely change drastically, beginning next year when a deal between the company and Starz, the pay-TV channel, to stream movies from Sony and Disney expires. The original deal from 2008, in which Netflix paid an estimated $25 million annually — a paltry sum, executives say, compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars cable and satellite companies pay Starz for the same movies — is now seen as a major coup for Netflix, and a major mistake by Starz. Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Nomura, called it “probably one of the dumbest deals ever. Starz gave up valuable content for tens of millions of dollars.” Mr. Bewkes said that deal, which gave Netflix significant momentum into the new world of online video, potentially undermined the business model of cable television, based on the subscription fees that have steadily flowed even as other media businesses have suffered in the digital age. “Why should anyone subscribe to Starz when they can basically get the whole thing for about nothing?” he said. “That doesn’t make much sense.” Mr. Bewkes explained that in the late 1990s the media industry embraced Netflix as a new distribution outlet for renting DVDs — without foreseeing that the company would eventually accelerate the decline in the sales of DVDs, which for years had been the lifeblood of the film industry. Now, with its success online, Netflix has raised fears that consumers may stop paying for cable television — the much-debated phenomenon of cord-cutting. Mr. Nathanson agreed, saying, “The first engagement the industry had with Netflix was innocent. DVDs were selling, and it didn’t seem like much of a problem.” Now, however, Netflix is increasingly seen as potentially a very big problem. “In the past six months, and because of concerns of Wall Street and concerns of cord-cutting, it’s influencing the investor conversations about the future of media,” Mr. Nathanson said. “Now, the industry is very focused on Netflix, and what they can do.” A media conference last week in New York held by the investment bank UBS became a platform for executives to express their grievances and emphasize that they will now aggressively try to tilt the economic balance between Netflix and content creators back toward the media conglomerates. “When Netflix first came around, the dog was the discs and the baggie,” said Robert S. Wiesenthal, executive vice president and chief financial officer at the Sony Corporation of America, referring to the envelopes the discs are mailed in, “and the streaming was the tail.” But very quickly, he added, that situation was reversed. “And now the economics for the content companies are going to reflect that.” Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer for Netflix who negotiates all the deals with Hollywood, attributed the comments to the media industry’s efforts to understand the future of television and movie-watching. “I don’t think they feel threatened,” he said. “They are not very sure of the outcome of what appears to be a very major shift in consumer behavior.” He described the shift as toward “on-demand, instant gratification video.” “Netflix is the leader in that space,” he said. “So we become the center of the rhetoric.” If Netflix is to renew the Starz pact — and thus keep a steady flow of Hollywood movies — it will probably pay many times the current $25 million a year. Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG research, estimated a new deal could cost Netflix more than $250 million a year. Mr. Bewkes suggested a new deal may not be reached, because Netflix’s subscription streaming service, which costs about $8 a month, isn’t high enough for the company to pay top dollar for movies. “At $8 to $10, it doesn’t have the economics to support high-value programming,” he said. As evidence of Netflix’s growing importance, Mr. Bewkes said decisions about deals that might have been made two years ago by a junior employee in a studio’s digital division are now reaching his desk. For example, Mr. Bewkes himself approved a deal to allow Netflix to stream “Nip/Tuck,” a drama produced by Warner Brothers’ TV studio. The most contentious clash between Netflix and the media industry will probably center on Netflix’s ambition of expanding its television offerings. Netflix announced last week a new deal to stream ABC shows, like old episodes of “Lost” and “Desperate Housewives.” But cable subscriptions in the United States are down this year — a trend some attribute to Netflix — so studios will be reluctant to make any deals, like offering current episodes of shows that would upset cable TV economics. “Once you put it on Netflix, you really can’t sell it anywhere else,” said Mr. Bewkes. The media industry is also vowing to offer its own alternatives to Netflix as a way to watch shows online. Time Warner’s HBO is in the process of introducing a new online service, HBO GO, which will be available to authenticated HBO subscribers. Mr. Bewkes has also led an industry initiative he has called TV Everywhere, whose idea is to offer cable network programming online for anyone who is a verified cable subscriber. Of the many deals the industry has made with Netflix — at lower prices than companies charge other distributors, like cable companies — Mr. Bewkes said, “this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it’s coming to a close.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/technology/personaltech/03SERVICE.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Streaming Movie Services Create Niche Industry<date>Published: December 2, 2010</date><text>STREAMING movies on household TV offers vast amounts of appeal. It’s why hardware manufacturers are devoting so much energy to the proposition. They are not alone. An entire industry geared toward establishing a foothold in this nascent market has cropped up, streaming movies, TV and other content in both standard and high definition, and offering subscription models. Netflix has augmented its DVD subscription model with streaming videos, allowing users unlimited access to its online library, which, while hardly as robust as its physical counterpart, is consistently growing. The company recently announced plans for a streaming-only plan for $8 a month. Per-movie rental fees can be found from other providers. Vudu looks to differentiate itself from Netflix by the quality of its streams (many of which are available in HD) and the newness of its releases (many titles arrive at the same time they are released in video stores). Its titles are rentable on an individual basis. “If you talk to people who are getting $100,000 media rooms, those people aren’t going to be too psyched to stream Netflix movies, but they’ll be pretty happy to stream Vudu HDX movies,” said Edward Lichty, Vudu’s general manager, describing the company’s 1080p streaming format, optimized for screens 40 inches and larger. Amazon on Demand also offers individual rentals, but users download the movies instead of streaming them. (In many instances, they have a fixed amount of time to watch them after first pressing play.) In March, Wal-Mart Stores bought Vudu, spurring cross-platform promotions. Those who bought a physical copy of “Toy Story 3” at Wal-Mart, for example, have access to the movie in the so-called cloud, giving them the ability to stream it to any connected device. A number of companies have cropped up to present specialized streaming options. Comcast offers free streaming for most shows on its network to paid subscribers through its Xfinity program. Those who get HBO, for example, can stream this season’s episodes of “Boardwalk Empire” at no additional charge; some complete back episodes for series like “Dexter” are similarly available. Further offerings can be had on an à la carte basis for rental. GreenCine focuses on independent, international and documentary films. (Its sex-oriented division, AdultCine, is self-explanatory.) VOD.com sells minutes of viewing time, which can then be spent on its catalog. Crackle streams Sony movies and some TV shows free, with commercial interruption. Hulu, a joint venture of NBC, ABC and Fox, is free but also offers a subscription version, which for a monthly fee allows users to see every episode from the current season of a host of shows and offers increased access to older shows. This is just the beginning. Time Warner recently announced a plan to stream HD and 3-D movies shortly after they hit theaters. Other companies have similar plans. For consumers holding off on streaming movies because the desired selection or quality isn’t available yet, give it a minute. It’ll be here soon.

Now, the ranks of Team Coco are being swelled by major marketers like AT&amp;T, General Motors, Microsoft and the News Corporation.TBS, part of Time Warner, is reporting robust sales for commercial time during “Conan,” which will make its debut on Monday and will run from 11 p.m. to midnight, Monday through Thursday. In addition to buying spots, marketers are making deals for tailored promotions as well as customized content for television, Web sites, social media and mobile devices. Diet Coke, sold by another big advertiser, Coca-Cola, sponsored a four-minute preview of the show, which appeared online this week on Facebook, the Team Coco Web site (teamcoco.com/blog/show-zero/) and on YouTube. The 20th Century Fox unit of the News Corporation will offer previews of a film, “Unstoppable,” during the premiere week of “Conan,” which will be Mr. O’Brien’s return to late-night television. The Bing search engine, operated by Microsoft, will be included in an episode during the week of Nov. 29. And the Chevrolet division of General Motors may give away a 2011 Chevrolet Cruze to a viewer in November or December. “We know Conan has a passionate following and wanted to tap into that,” said Daryl Evans, vice president for consumer advertising and marketing communications at the AT&amp;T Atlanta office. AT&amp;T is sponsoring promotions for “Conan,” which feature an orange blimp, and will join 20th Century Fox as a sponsor of the premiere week. The AT&amp;T brand will also be integrated into an episode during the week of Dec. 6. “Conan is a proven talent and a proven brand,” Mr. Evans said. “Rubbing up the AT&amp;T brand against the Conan brand is a good thing; there’s a nice brand equity share.”  Mr. Evans said that the theme of AT&amp;T’s current ad campaign, “Rethink possible,” aligned well with “Conan,” in that Mr. O’Brien was “rethinking what you can do, being innovative” in leaving broadcast TV for cable. Brad Adgate, senior vice president for research at Horizon Media in New York, described “Conan” as “another example of the inroads cable is making” in its competition with the broadcast networks. Mr. O’Brien “is the biggest name TBS has gotten since Andy Taylor and Jethro Bodine,” he added, laughing, referring to characters on two sitcoms, “The Andy Griffith Show” and “The Beverly Hillbillies,” that TBS became notorious for running over and over. “Conan” represents another milestone for cable: TBS is charging an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 for each 30-second commercial — near or on par with what CBS charges for a spot during “Late Show With David Letterman” and what NBC charges for “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.” For years, TBS sales executives “always gnashed their teeth that they didn’t get the same pricing” as their counterparts at the broadcast networks, Mr. Adgate said, although their programming drew large, youthful audiences. TBS is now the No. 1 cable channel among viewers aged 18 to 34 — a group replete with O’Brien aficionados and prized by advertisers. “There really should be no mysterious delineation between the broadcast viewer of Conan and the cable viewer of Conan,” said Linda Yaccarino, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Turner Entertainment ad sales, marketing and acquisitions, who oversees channels that, in addition to TBS, include TNT and truTV. “It may have taken Conan O’Brien to hurdle over the line” that separated the two types of TV in the eyes of advertisers and agencies, she added, because “bringing Conan to TBS was quite a transformational deal, for the network and the industry.” TBS is “working closely with Conan’s creative team” on ideas to incorporate sponsors in the show, Ms. Yaccarino said, which may include commercials delivered by Andy Richter, the show’s announcer, or “Conan himself.” “I wish I could show you the Chevy Cruze creative,” she added. “It is so Conanesque.” The only hint she would give was that it would be “the best-smelling promo he’s ever done.”  There are risks involved with sponsoring “Conan,” among them that the show may not stand out amid the late-night clutter. Mr. O’Brien will compete against popular series like “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and “The Colbert Report,” both on Comedy Central; “Chelsea Lately,” on E!; as well as with Mr. Leno and Mr. Letterman. “The press always liked Conan more than viewers,” said Steve Sternberg, the longtime television research analyst who writes a blog, the Sternberg Report. “I don’t know why advertisers would initially pay the same rates for Conan as for Leno or Letterman until he demonstrates he can get a younger audience,” Mr. Sternberg wrote in an e-mail. “But TBS does skew young, so he does have a chance.” Mr. Adgate at Horizon Media said he believed that Mr. O’Brien “will do well” on TBS, particularly among viewers ages 18 to 49. And “it will be a hit with advertisers initially because of the familiarity they have with Conan,” he added. “But the show will also be a little bit different because it’s on cable, and he may be able to get away with a little more than he did on broadcast.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/business/media/04media.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Time Warner and News Corp. Post Higher Profit<date>Published: November 3, 2010</date><text>THE steady flow of revenue and profits from big cable channels — a spigot that could be shut off in the digital future as consumers begin to bypass their cable boxes — allowed both Time Warner and News Corporation to report quarterly profits Wednesday that surpassed the expectations of Wall Street analysts.At News Corporation, which owns Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and the 20th Century Fox film studio, among other assets, revenue in its fiscal first quarter was $7.43 billion, up from $7.2 billion in the previous year’s first quarter. Net income at News Corporation was $775 million, or 30 cents a share, up from $571 million, or 22 cents a share, last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had predicted revenue of $7.42 billion and 24 cents a share. In a statement, Rupert Murdoch, who controls News Corporation, said, “Our global cable network programming business continues to lead News Corporation’s financial and operational momentum.” Notably, Mr. Murdoch was absent from the company’s conference call because, the company said, he was tired from traveling overseas.  At Time Warner, revenue was $6.38 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago. This was slightly less than the $6.41 billion expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But the company’s earnings per share, excluding certain items, was 62 cents, compared with Wall Street projections of 53 cents, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The overall performance of the companies underlie the broader issues the media industry is facing as it tries to devise business models for the digital age. While the Internet’s erosion of profits for newspapers and magazines, music and film is well established, Time Warner’s and News Corporation’s lifeblood — big cable networks — has been more durable. “The takeaway is that advertising is strong,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura. “The video ecosystem of affiliate fees and advertising seems to be holding up well.” But executives are already imagining a future in which cable’s dual revenue model — fees from subscribers and advertising sales — could be threatened as consumers choose to watch shows online. Time Warner said it expected subscribers to HBO to fall by about 1.5 million by the end of 2010, although executives stressed that they did not believe the reason was that consumers were shutting off cable to be entertained online — a much-debated phenomenon known in the industry as cord-cutting. In a conference call, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, said, “We doubt we’re going to see it, although we’ll all watch for it.” Chase Carey, the president of News Corporation, said in a separate conference call, “I don’t see it.” While cable networks accounted for more than half of News Corporation’s operating income, judging the financial performance of the company’s many newspapers is now more difficult because of an accounting change. News Corporation will now lump its newspaper figures in with two other segments — book publishing and supermarket inserts. In the quarter, this unit saw gains in revenue and operating income. Some Wall Street analysts have pushed the company to play down the newspaper business, and reposition the perception of News Corporation as a cable-dominated company. At Time Warner, both advertising and subscription revenue grew at its cable unit, which includes TNT, TBS, HBO and CNN. Advertising was up 10 percent, and revenue from subscription fees charged by distributors like Comcast and DirecTV grew 9 percent. Total revenue from cable grew to $3 billion, from $2.76 billion in last year’s third quarter.  Time Warner’s film division, Warner Brothers, was helped by a strong performance of “Inception,” the science-fiction movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio, but overall revenue in film declined slightly, to $2.78 billion. News Corporation’s film unit, on a cold streak after the success of “Avatar,” reported declines in both revenue and operating income. Time Inc., which publishes magazines including People and Sports Illustrated, reported a small decline in revenue, to $901 million from $914 million. But there was positive news, as advertising revenue grew 5 percent, to $478 million. Subscription revenue, however, declined by 5 percent, to $318 million from $333 million. Meanwhile, MySpace, the social networking site, continues to be a drag on News Corporation’s earnings. Mr. Carey said the unit’s losses were not “sustainable” and suggested the unit’s management was under pressure to turn it around quickly. He said the progress would be measured in “quarters, not in years.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/technology/30aol.html?ref=timewarnerinc">AOL Revamps Home Page to Attract Advertisers<date>Published: October 29, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — For years, AOL has tried and largely failed to make its main Web site a bigger hit with Internet users. The number of visitors to the site has eroded, as has the company’s overall revenue.AOL is trying once again to lift its fortunes by introducing a redesigned Web portal that gives a greater emphasis to news created by AOL’s staff and original video clips. The overhaul, which it began to roll out on Friday, is aimed at making the site a more interesting destination and to increase advertising. “AOL is still a very desirable place to advertise — very high household income, and more women than men,” said Tim Armstrong, AOL’s chief executive. AOL, which was spun off from Time Warner last year to become an independent company, is in the midst of a turnaround effort led by Mr. Armstrong. He is refocusing the company on content, and news in particular, by expanding its Patch local news service and through the recent acquisition of the influential technology blog TechCrunch. The new design will add local news headlines for the first time and moves video near the top of the page. Clips will include a series called “You’ve Got” that gives anyone a platform for 45 seconds. Only one display ad will appear on the home page, which until last year featured nearly a dozen ads. Mr. Armstrong cleaned up the page shortly after joining AOL last year, saying the clutter was ineffective. The redesign, however, includes a new area for sponsored content. Hollywood studios, for instance, could pay to include a link to a celebrity interview and a movie trailer. Mr. Armstrong is trying to reverse a slide that began when Time Warner acquired AOL nearly a decade ago. The grandiose plans that Time Warner executives used to justify the marriage never materialized. Mr. Armstrong, a former Google executive, emphasized that the company’s revival would take time. So far there has been little sign of progress. Since January, the number of unique visitors to AOL’s home page has declined 27 percent, to 35.8 million, according to the market research company comScore. Revenue during the first half of this year is down 25 percent, to $1.24 billion, compared with the same period in 2009. Mr. Armstrong blamed AOL’s shrinking dial-up Internet access business, which the company is allowing to fade out, for the declines. He also said that he had eliminated a number of distribution deals that lifted AOL’s traffic but made no financial sense. Ross Sandler, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, was cautiously optimistic about the AOL redesign. But he said that while it might increase the amount of time existing users spent on the site, it would most likely fail to attract new users. “I don’t think there is much they can do to increase the audience based on redesigning their home page,” Mr. Sandler said. “Structural trends are moving against AOL.” The new AOL design is the first overhaul of the home page since 2008, and is the first in what Mr. Armstrong called a series of small changes to come. He said that the philosophy behind the page was to inform visitors while also entertaining them. The focus will shift during the day from being news-oriented in the morning to a focus on lifestyle in the afternoon. “We are basically trying to make sure that our users are prepared for the day and that they don’t get caught with their pants off,” Mr. Armstrong said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/media/23warner.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Warner Extends Meyer’s Tenure as Chairman<date>Published: September 22, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — Barry M. Meyer will remain chairman of Warner Brothers after all. Time Warner on Wednesday put off the difficult question of succession at its movie studio, by extending the contract of Mr. Meyer — who had been expected to retire at the end of next year — through 2013. The move gives Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, more time to figure out how to replace Mr. Meyer, 66, while retaining three senior studio executives, all of whom have made clear they want the top job. Alan F. Horn, the studio’s chief operating officer, will step down April 1, about eight months earlier than expected. Mr. Horn, 67, will then become a consultant with a two-year contract. He said he decided to depart early because the transfer of most of his duties to his protégé, Jeff Robinov, president of the motion picture group, was nearly complete. “If I’m not going to be very busy at the office, I’d rather be busy in Hawaii or something,” Mr. Horn said with a laugh on Wednesday. “It’s time for me to move on and discover what else is interesting out there,” said Mr. Horn, whose legacy includes shepherding the Harry Potter franchise. Mr. Bewkes announced Wednesday that the three executives eager for promotion — Mr. Robinov; Bruce Rosenblum, president of the television group; and Kevin Tsujihara, president of home entertainment — would be clustered into a new “office of the president.” Each will retain his current duties while becoming more engaged in the overall operations of the company. “What we’re trying to do here is to get each of them to think of something bigger — what’s good for all of Warner Brothers and not only for the division they are running,” Mr. Meyer said. “I think the best news here is that succession is going to be inside the company.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/relativity-to-exceed-2-billion-in-revenue-chief-says/?ref=timewarnerinc">Relativity to Exceed $2 Billion in Revenue, Chief Says<date>September 22, 2010, 5:15 am</date><text>Relativity Media, the privately held film financing company, will bring in more than $2 billion in revenue for the first time this year, its chief executive, Ryan Kavanaugh, said Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. The projection would make the company bigger by revenue than Lions Gate Entertainment, the publicly traded studio that posted $1.58 billion in revenue in the year to March, and that is often referred to as a “mini-major” studio. Major Hollywood studios are much larger, with The Walt Disney Company studio posting over $6 billion in revenue last fiscal year, while Time Warner‘s Warner Bros. unit reported more than $11 billion. Mr. Kavanaugh told a conference hosted by the media and entertainment news Web site TheWrap that the company’s adjusted earnings would be four to five times greater than in 2009, adding that the company was ”just above break even” last year. It has co-financed prominent films like Universal Picture’s ”Robin Hood,” which has grossed more than $311 million worldwide. In July, Relativity, backed by the hedge fund Elliott Management, bought the distribution and marketing arm of Overture Films from Liberty Media , taking on about 45 people. With the ability to distribute its own films, Relativity is on track to be involved in the release of around 30 movies next year. Relativity’s Overture deal came shortly after an accord to provide films to Netflix, the mail-order and online film rental service. Under the agreement, Relativity bypassed traditional pay TV networks in favor of a new online revenue source. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Kavanaugh also reiterated that the company was considering an initial public offering, saying that Relativity’s books had been audited carefully in preparation for an I.P.O. ”We’re not in any rush,” he told The A.P. ”We really want to show that we can distribute and market a film like a major studio.” Go to Article from The Associated Press via The New York Times » Go to Article from TheWrap » Go to Related Article from DealBook »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/nyregion/15cable.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Cablevision and Time Warner Agree to Fines for Late Service Calls in New York<date>Published: September 14, 2010</date><text>Besides perhaps a root canal or a tax audit, few things can be more frustrating than making an appointment to have a cable technician visit your home. You’re given a four-hour window and find yourself waiting and waiting, with no idea when the technician will arrive. Inevitably, it seems, he does not show up until just before the window expires. Or, despite the four-hour time frame, he arrives late. But now, customers may finally get a small measure of justice for what many complain is unfair and just plain rude treatment at the hands of the cable-company giants. Under the terms of a new contract negotiated with City Hall, Time Warner Cable and Cablevision will have to pay for failing to honor appointments. And they will have to do a lot more to make sure that subscribers are getting good service. The contract would make cable customers eligible for a credit equal to a full month’s bill if a technician does not arrive on time. The penalty decreases to $25 after 2012, when Verizon Fios, a competing cable provider, is expected to have built its infrastructure in much of the city, negotiators said on Tuesday. Customers could request notification by e-mail, phone or text message when a technician is heading to their home. And in most cases, after making a choice from an automated menu, a customer should have to wait no more than 30 seconds to speak to a representative. “We’re raising the bar, and I’m glad that the cable companies seem to understand that,” said City Comptroller John C. Liu, whose office was briefed on the contract on Tuesday and who is a member of the commission charged with approving it. Some people get so fed up with their cable company that they give up on customer service and complain to 311, the city’s help line. Almost 1,200 complaints have been received this year alone, most of them related to the quality of service, according to city statistics. But city officials believe that there are many more unhappy customers out there. As Robert Porto, 38, a Time Warner Cable customer in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, put it, the new contract will be “the ultimate revenge for the little guy.” Until Verizon Fios entered the picture, Time Warner Cable and Cablevision had essentially cornered the market for cable services. For the city, the competition from Fios turned into a great bargaining chip. Many of the customer service provisions contained in the contract are similar to those Verizon agreed to in the service deal it concluded with the city in 2008. “Greater competition breeds better service, which breeds better terms,” said Carole Post, commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. Under federal law, municipalities are required to renew franchise agreements with cable companies unless signal quality has been a persistent problem, response to complaints is unsatisfactory or the companies have failed to honor the terms of the previous contract, among other things. The contract with Time Warner Cable and Cablevision expired in 2008. The new contract with Time Warner Cable and Cablevision, which city officials said included about 30 pages of customer service provisions, still has to be completed and then must clear some regulatory hurdles, but most of its requirements are expected to remain in place. One is an investment of about $10 million by the cable companies to provide wireless Internet service to 32 city parks, which have yet to be selected. The service would cost users 99 cents per day, though it would be free for 10 minutes up to three times a month. Time Warner Cable and Cablevision subscribers would get it free, according to details of the contract that officials made available to The New York Times. Time Warner Cable will also work with nonprofit groups to establish free Internet access in 40 community centers across the city, at a rate of at least 4 per year, the contract says. A spokeswoman for Time Warner Cable, Harriet Novet, said the company was “excited about a lot of the new features that come with this contract,” but she added that “we’re still working through some of the details.” She did not specify what those details were. Jim Maiella, a spokesman for Cablevision, said in a statement, “We look forward to providing service in the Bronx and Brooklyn for many years to come.” Bruce Regal, a senior lawyer at the City Law Department and one of the city’s negotiators, said the city expected to complete much of the approval process by the end of the year. The contract will be valid until 2020, which is also when the city’s agreement with Verizon Fios expires. And, you might ask, when should New Yorkers expect to notice changes? Mr. Regal said most people would see much fiercer competition in the next year or two. “Our hope,” he said, “is that the level of competition will have an effect on service, programming, pricing and all aspects of cable television.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/business/media/03disney.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Disney and Time Warner Reach Deal on ESPN3.com<date>Published: September 2, 2010</date><text>Time Warner Cable customers will finally get access to the sports Web site ESPN3.com, even if they are not subscribers to the company’s Internet service. Time Warner reached the long-term deal with the Walt Disney Company.In the deal announced on Thursday, 12.7 million Time Warner video subscribers and 2.4 million Bright House Networks video subscribers will get access to ESPN3.com without an extra charge. ESPN3.com offers full game videos, and recently it carried live World Cup matches that built huge audiences via computer screens in the workplace. About 7.4 million people tuned in to ESPN3.com at one point during the tournament, on average watching two hours each. Disney also won a cash payment for granting Time Warner Cable the right to retransmit signals from four ABC stations and secured carriage of a new 24-hour channel called Disney Junior, a rebranding of its SOAPnet channel, when it starts up in 2012. Fees to carry other channels, including the Disney Channel, ABC Family, Disney XD and ESPN 3D, were included in the wide-ranging agreement. Time Warner will pay Disney around 50 cents a subscriber for ABC, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because terms were not made public. It is the first large deal to come up for renegotiation since the Disney Channel and ABC Family became juggernauts, a move that was a crucial part of an agreement by Time Warner to give Disney large flexibility when it comes to distributing its programming on other platforms. The deal came together after the companies indicated on Sunday that there would not be a damaging signal interruption of the kind that cut several minutes off of ABC’s Oscar telecast to millions of Cablevision subscribers in a fee dispute in March. Time Warner Cable and Bright House had long been holdouts on ESPN3.com, which has been around in different forms since 2001. They said Disney’s pattern of tying fees to the number of Internet subscribers was inappropriate, since not all its Internet customers wanted to pay extra for a single Web site. In conceding the deal terms on ESPN3.com, Disney cut its most extensive deal ever with the companies. They had not renegotiated since 2000, only agreeing to a three-year extension in 2007. Among the expanded offerings, Time Warner is starting a new college football channel called ESPN Goal Line that gives fans a live peek at games around the nation on Saturdays, a similar offering to the NFL Network’s NFL RedZone. The first program starts Saturday for sports-tier subscribers. A similar service called ESPN Buzzer Beater will be offered for the college basketball season in January.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/business/media/23carr.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Time Warner Puts Faith in Its Cross-Platform ‘TV Everywhere’<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>For a guy whose world is supposed to be falling apart, Jeffrey Bewkes looks awfully calm.Sitting in his grand office overlooking Central Park, Mr. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, patiently listens to the argument that the digital revolution is going to shatter the audience for mighty company brands like HBO, TBS, TNT and even CNN. After all, if wired consumers can watch whatever they want whenever they want free and if new competitors like YouTube are eating up the national mindshare, television as we know it is an empire built on sand. But he’s not playing along. Television is in “a golden age,” Mr. Bewkes replied, moving a cup of coffee he personally fetched closer to the reporter. “I think you have more original programming, new kinds of shows with fine actors, strong production values, and interesting directors who are not doing cookie-cutter work. There is more high-quality programming than has ever existed before on American television.” Mr. Bewkes is not much of a ranter, but with Time Warner coming off a good quarter in what looks to be a very profitable year, you can tell he’s just getting started. He made his bones at Time Warner at HBO, and despite the threat that digital media have posed to newspapers, magazines and music, he retains his belief in the power of television. “The most important thing is what happens right there,” he said, gesturing toward the giant television screen in the conference room that adjoins his office. “The financial support for television is higher than it’s ever been. That’s something that gets missed in some of the excitement of covering the Internet,” he said, making the word sound a little creepy. Which isn’t to say Time Warner, like every other media company in the television business, doesn’t have some significant challenges. “Television” as we know it is breaking out of the box, on iPads and other tablet devices. The hot electronic gift of the coming Christmas season will probably be Internet-connected televisions, which will have, as Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research pointed out to me, “a potentially infinite inventory, with the whole history of television and film theoretically available to be streamed on a moment’s notice.” At the same time, Netflix just cut a huge deal with Epix that will stream even more big movies to consumers on a device of their choosing. Netflix is spending some of the $600 million that it once spent on the postal service to acquire filmed entertainment (it already had a deal with Starz) that will compete with HBO and other premium channels. Add in other big players like Apple and Amazon, and the future looks both crowded and cloudy. Mr. Bewkes’s answer to all these challenges is what he calls TV Everywhere. Conceived and evangelized by Mr. Bewkes, and rolled out back in March in a joint announcement with Comcast, TV Everywhere recognizes cable, satellite and phone subscribers and allows them to watch programming anywhere they want, any time they want, on a device of their choosing. The idea broadens the definition of what it means to be a subscriber while still keeping viewers within the fold of cable providers like Time Warner and Comcast, along with satellite programmers and telephone companies that provide TV. “People want to use whatever screen they prefer,” he said. “Some people want a laptop or a tablet, some people want a television, a big TV. They want control over when they watch, what they watch; they want to be able to pull things that they want.” And, he adds, unable to resist, “you probably don’t need Netflix unless you want a way to look at a lot of old movies.” Spencer Wang, a media analyst at Credit Suisse, agrees to a point, but isn’t sure TV Everywhere is a match for an age when everything is everywhere. “Jeff Bewkes understands the opportunities and risks that a digital revolution represents better than any media executive out there, and he is not just pontificating. He has come up with a plan,” Mr. Wang said. “But you worry about whether other cable operators will move fast enough to meet a fundamentally disruptive change to the media ecosystem.” Mr. Bewkes remains confident that his channels can survive in an on-demand world. After all, as he points out, HBO already thrives there because viewers have shown a willingness to pay for subscriptions for always-on access to “True Blood” and “Entourage.” “On-demand viewership is over 30 percent of overall viewership on HBO,” he said. “Even in the rest of the industry, it’s already about 10 percent, so on-demand is far and away the most important trend.” But unlike HBO, broadcast channels and the vast majority of cable channels live at least partly on advertising. “Makes no difference,” Mr. Bewkes says, confidently. “The ad loads” — the amount of advertising — “will be the same.” Mr. Bewkes’s saying it does not make it so: more content on more platforms almost always leads to lower ad rates. Just ask newspaper owners how their online ad revenue compares with what they can still get for old-fashioned paper advertising. He also believes television has another card to play: brand recognition. YouTube and niche programming may soon be on TV screens, but they will seem like small beer next to water-cooler programs and the kind of big events that still can be pulled off only by well-financed networks. “The problem now is not a lack of choice but a surfeit of choice; there’s too much stuff,” Mr. Bewkes said. “How do you introduce people to new things? People are always looking for new things. The way that you do that is that you have an environment, a programming position that stands for something.” It’s partly why HBO came up with the money for “Boardwalk Empire,” Martin Scorsese’s new big-budget series. It’s why Conan O’Brien will now live on TBS. And it’s why Turner, along with CBS, locked up a piece of college basketball and the Final Four for the next 14 years. Mr. Bewkes thinks that big event television will be a recommendation engine for the rest of his company’s media assets. To use an example besides Time Warner, the people who are watching “Mad Men” are currently being cross-sold another AMC show, “Rubicon.” Big media likes television for the same reason bad guys like banks: it’s where all the money is. And Mr. Bewkes is clearly confident that, if enough broadcasters make their content available across platforms, consumers will be staring at something that looks like television for a long time to come (even if it’s not on a television). He’s making a bigger bet: that the subscription and advertising dollars are going to remain strong enough to allow broadcasters to succeed where other media have struggled.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/business/media/05warner.html?ref=timewarnerinc">With Profit Up 7% in Quarter, Time Warner Raises Forecast<date>Published: August 4, 2010</date><text>A pair of the world’s largest media companies reported strong earnings on Wednesday and expressed confidence that the industry might be settling into a groove after a turbulent couple of years.Time Warner said early in the day that earnings rose to $562 million in its second quarter, which ended June 30, from $524 million in the same period a year earlier. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive, said in a conference call that it was a “very strong quarter, capping off a great first half of the year.” Later in the day, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, said in a conference call that the company had “almost inexplicably good advertising” after reporting earnings of $875 million in the latest quarter, up from a loss of $203 million a year earlier. The large swing was in part the result of the recent sale of a European television station and restructuring charges that the company paid last year. “I’m very, very confident of the next six months,” Mr. Murdoch said. But he also cautioned that there was “sufficient fragility” in the world economy that it should prevent overconfidence. Much of the growth at the News Corporation came from the company’s television and cable units. At the television unit, which includes the Fox broadcast stations, had operating income of $113 million, up from $100 million, helped by a 29 percent increase in local advertising revenue. The cable division, meanwhile, continued to be a profit center, as Fox News, National Geographic and other channels generated operating income of $563 million in the quarter, up from $429 million last year. At the company’s domestic channels, advertising revenue increased 11 percent in the quarter, and advertising on the international channels grew 35 percent. The News Corporation reported overall revenue of $8.1 billion, and its earnings of 33 cents a share beat the expectations of analysts, who had predicted 20 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The most recent quarter was the end of the News Corporation’s 2010 fiscal year, and the company said profit in the year was $2.5 billion, or 97 cents a share, on $32.8 billion in revenue. Like the News Corporation, Time Warner saw significant gains in its television division. At its cable networks, like HBO and the Turner Broadcasting channels TNT and TBS, revenue increased 11 percent. Mr. Bewkes said he expected the cable channels to continue performing well in the next couple of quarters, helped by the “The Closer” on TNT, which continues to be a ratings success, and the introduction this fall of Conan O’Brien’s new show on TBS. In the second quarter, advertising revenue for the Time Warner networks grew 14 percent, to $126 million. Another $153 million of revenue came in from subscriptions, a 9 percent increase, in part because of higher rates. Revenue at Warner Brothers, Time Warner’s film studio, increased 8 percent. The News Corporation’s film division was one of the softer spots, as operating income declined to $137 million, from $203 million in the year-earlier period. The News Corporation also reported strong returns on its newspaper unit, which includes The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and many papers in Europe. The company said the ad revenue at Dow Jones, the group that runs The Journal, rose 14 percent. Revenue at Time Warner’s publishing unit, which puts out the magazines People and Time, remained flat despite a 4 percent increase in advertising. Mr. Bewkes said the company hoped to give subscribers to its print magazines access to versions of the publications to read on tablets like the iPad. That kind of pay-once, get-it-anywhere subscription is not yet offered by magazines. Mr. Murdoch said he expected tablets to be “a real game-changer in the presentation of news,” and expected “hundreds and hundreds of millions” of iPads and other devices to be sold around the world in the coming years. Time Warner’s stock rose slightly on Wednesday, closing up less than 1 percent, at $32.47. The News Corporation released its report after the market had closed. Its shares gained 3.5 percent, to $14.34, in late trading. According a regulatory filing released Tuesday, the News Corporation will begin tying its executives’ pay more closely to the company’s financial performance. On Wednesday, Chase Carey, the company president, said that move was “the right thing to do.” Mr. Murdoch even weighed in on Fox’s “American Idol,” saying the network was “very close” to making an announcement about new judges for the show. When asked how “Idol” would change next season, he said, “The music will certainly be better.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/business/media/05time.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Jack Griffin to Replace Ann Moore at Time Inc.<date>Published: August 4, 2010</date><text>The shake-up of the magazine industry’s corner offices will continue next week as Time Warner is expected to announce that Jack Griffin, the former Meredith Corporation executive, will become chief executive at Time Inc., succeeding Ann S. Moore.Although Ms. Moore’s contract runs until December 2012, she has said that she was open to leaving earlier if the right person came along to take over. Ms. Moore, who was appointed chairwoman and chief executive in 2002, becoming Time Inc.’s first female chief executive, was said to be happy with the choice, although others at the company were surprised by the timing of the move. Ms. Moore is expected to remain as chairwoman. Rumors began circulating on Monday when Mr. Griffin, who served two successful stints at Meredith, whose magazines include Better Homes and Gardens and Family Circle, announced that he was leaving the company. Mr. Griffin did not announce his plans then, and the company would say only that he was “leaving to pursue another opportunity.” Measured by circulation, Meredith is the second-largest publisher of consumer magazines in the United States. Time Inc., with behemoths like People and InStyle, along with a cohort of domestic and international publications, is the largest magazine publisher in the world. Neither company would speak for the record because employees had not been notified and the announcement was scheduled for Monday, but executives at both companies confirmed the move was imminent. The change at the top of Time Inc. caps a fairly busy summer season of changes. Last month, David Carey, who was a group president at Condé Nast, left to lead the magazine division of Condé Nast’s rival, Hearst. And Robert A. Sauerberg, who was president for consumer marketing at Condé Nast, assumed the role of company president. In many ways, Mr. Griffin’s move is not much of a surprise. As the leader of a group of magazines with hefty brand names but little new-media cachet, he has managed to make sure that old-line titles like Family Circle were not left behind in a changing advertising landscape. He has broadened the reach of the company to get into consumer marketing services, and the success of those so-called below-the-line initiatives gave the magazine company, based in Iowa, a steady stream of marketing dollars, while the advertising dollars shrank under recessionary pressure. In the last fiscal year, which ended June 30, Meredith generated $192 million in cash flow, up from $181 million the previous year. Last month, the company acquired the Hyperfactory, a mobile marketing company, and since 2006, Meredith Integrated Marketing, a unit Mr. Griffin created and then headed from 1994 to 1999, added the interactive marketing services firm O’Grady Meyers and Genex; a viral marketing company called New Media Strategies; and the health care communications specialists Big Communications. In 2005, Mr. Griffin was part of the acquisition of Gruner and Jahr USA, which doubled the size of the company’s magazine business. “Everyone has watched closely Meredith’s strategy of capturing marketing services revenues, money that would have otherwise gone to ad agencies or a social media company,” said Reed Phillips, managing partner at DeSilva &amp; Phillips, a media banking firm. “It has been a very big success story, and it’s a strategy that is being emulated across the industry.” Given the declining revenues throughout the magazine industry, it fell to Ms. Moore in 2008 to work on costs, and some 600 people were laid off. Like many publishers, Time Inc. has been punished by the flight of advertising to the Web, but in earnings results announced Wednesday, the magazine division, which also publishes Sports Illustrated and People, announced a 4 percent increase in ad sales over the same quarter last year. At the same time, the division’s operating income jumped 50 percent because of cost savings from job cuts and other measures. Even though the company has made serious efforts in coming up with initiatives for the iPad and similar mobile devices, subscription revenue continues to be soft. A senior executive at Meredith who did not speak on the record because Mr. Griffin’s new job had not been announced, said, “Jack has got all the skills of a magazine executive, and he has accomplished a lot, but he’s not really stuck in the present moment. He has a traditional background, but he is not a traditional thinker.” Both Meredith and Time Inc. have brands with enormous mass appeal, but most are viewed as legacy assets at a time when consumers are increasingly turning to the Web for information. Mr. Griffin’s job at Time Inc. will be much the same, only on a much larger scale. By deepening the digital footprint at Meredith, Mr. Griffin seemed to suggest that old dogs, under significant duress, can learn new tricks.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/business/media/02cnn.html?ref=timewarnerinc">CNN Plan for Morgan Leaves Questions About Couric<date>Published: August 1, 2010</date><text>For years, whenever television fortune-tellers forecast Larry King’s eventual replacement, Katie Couric’s name was the first to be mentioned: one of the best interviewing jobs on television, and one of the best-known interviewers on television. It seemed a perfect match.Now, Piers Morgan, a judge on “America’s Got Talent,” is on the verge of obtaining the job, which comes with a mandate to revive CNN’s fortunes in prime time. So what happened? For Ms. Couric, the timing wasn’t right. For Mr. Morgan, the timing was made right. Earlier this year, through a quiet but persistent campaign, Mr. Morgan made himself a viable candidate. His job application was his British interview show, “Life Stories.” He presented himself as a solution to a problem — the problem being CNN’s dreadful 9 p.m. ratings, which counted 674,000 viewers in the spring versus 995,000 for MSNBC and 2.63 million for Fox News. Separately, last spring, executives at CNN, a unit of Time Warner, were gradually coming to the conclusion that they could not maintain the status quo at 9 p.m. At the end of June, Mr. King announced that he had decided on his own to end “Larry King Live” this fall. Ms. Couric and Mr. Morgan were the two people considered for the coveted slot. Succeeding Mr. King once looked like a perfect exit strategy for Ms. Couric, as their contracts were due to expire a month apart, in May 2011 for Mr. King and in June 2011 for Ms. Couric. But when the timetable for a change was suddenly compressed, it was apparent that unwinding Ms. Couric from her CBS deal this year would be severely complicated. In June a person close to Ms. Couric said there was “virtually no scenario” that could place her on CNN — or anywhere else — before 2011. Mr. Morgan and his longtime agent and friend, John Ferriter, first met with CNN executives in late April. CNN says it was a routine talent meeting that was not related to any potential opening. After the meeting, the executives viewed some episodes of “Life Stories” and their interest was piqued. But they could not formally negotiate. At the time, Mr. Morgan was bound to NBC and “America’s Got Talent.” So Mr. Morgan set out to renegotiate with NBC and obtain permission to work for both NBC and CNN, a process that was completed last week. Mr. Morgan and CNN are now haggling over the terms of CNN’s offer, and his hiring could be announced as early as this week. This account is based on interviews with almost a dozen executives and associates of the people involved. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because confidential negotiations were continuing. NBC confirmed on Friday that Mr. Morgan was now allowed to talk to CNN, but CNN said it would not comment on any negotiations. Mr. Morgan has been making the rounds lately, appearing on red carpets and on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” last week, where he said his dream interview guest would be Nelson Mandela. He has been careful not to comment on the CNN talks while still encouraging the buzz about his potential hiring. For CNN, which has determined that it needs to be entertaining in prime time while maintaining its image as a nonpartisan news source, Mr. Morgan would be a pivotal building block in a lineup that would include Eliot Spitzer, the disgraced former New York governor. Mr. Morgan is known to American viewers mainly as a lightweight talent show judge. But he does have a journalistic record, albeit a controversial one, as the editor of The Daily Mirror newspaper. In 2004, he was fired after the newspaper printed photos of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners that turned out to be fraudulent. After that embarrassment, he turned to television full time, both in Britain and in the United States, joining the talent show and winning the first season of “Celebrity Apprentice.” CNN probably will not play up those credentials. But the network will highlight Mr. Morgan’s ability to be both informative and entertaining in his British interviews. His 18-month-old “Life Stories” series on ITV, taped before a studio audience, regularly draws four million viewers, and the most popular episode this year earned 6.1 million viewers, 25 percent of the television-watching audience in Britain. His biggest claim to fame was moving Gordon Brown, then the prime minister, to tears during an interview last February. But most of his guests have been of the tabloid variety. He has received high praise for the interviews; Victor Lewis-Smith, a British television critic turned producer, said via e-mail that “the interviews he’s done for ITV have been about the best I’ve seen in years.” “He actually listens to his interviewees — and thinks on his feet,” he added. The CNN deal-making is laced with intrigue because Mr. Ferriter represented Mr. King until last year. He was once the worldwide head of nonscripted television for the William Morris Agency. After William Morris merged with Endeavor, he was pushed out. Mr. King stayed with the merged agency while Mr. Morgan stayed with Mr. Ferriter, who is now the managing director of Octagon Entertainment. Once Mr. King’s seat is filled, the fortune-telling about Ms. Couric’s future will resume in full. When her contract is up next spring, she could remain as the anchor of the “CBS Evening News,” which is the third-place news show, though not at her current salary of $15 million a year; most likely she will have to package several jobs together to come close to matching it. She is said to have discussed a number of ideas, including a production company affiliated with CBS and a daytime talk show on CBS stations, with the chief executive of CBS, Leslie Moonves. But a decision to stay at CBS might be hard to believe for anyone who has heard Ms. Couric’s list of grievances against the network. After she arrived in 2006 from NBC, she was frustrated by what she perceived to be a barebones staff and a lack of marketing and public relations support. CNN executives want it known that they still see room for her at the cable news network. Last Tuesday she was seen at the Central Park South restaurant Marea having lunch with Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner. It is possible that CNN and CBS — always rumored to be weighing a news-sharing pact — could share Ms. Couric; already the CNN stars Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta contribute to the CBS program “60 Minutes.” The two companies continue to talk about a broader merger or content-sharing arrangement. Her hiring would reinforce CNN’s hard news brand. Some people at CNN think Ms. Couric would work well at 7 p.m., a spot now taken up by “John King, USA,” an underperforming show that is starting to come under scrutiny. And then there’s NBC, the network Ms. Couric left four years ago. Jeffrey Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal, has indicated that he would welcome her back. Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesman for Ms. Couric, brushed aside the rumors. “Katie is having fun, working hard and is proud of her team’s ongoing success at CBS,” he said. “We’ll leave everyone else to enjoy their own summer of speculation.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/aol-said-to-be-close-to-selling-bebo/?ref=timewarnerinc">AOL to Sell Bebo to Criterion<date>June 17, 2010, 4:43 am</date><text>8:35 a.m. | Updated AOL said Thursday it will sell its Bebo social network to Criterion Capital Partners for an undisclosed sum, Reuters reported. AOL is close to selling social network site Bebo to a private investment firm, Criterion Capital Partners, Reuters said, citing a report in The Wall Street Journal. AOL bought the site more than two years ago for $850 million, but is now aiming to streamline its business since Time Warner spun it off last year. In April, AOL said it planned to either sell or close down Bebo. A representative for AOL declined to comment. Criterion was not immediately available for comment. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the situation, said the Bebo sale would be done at a price that “is a small fraction” of what AOL originally paid. Exact terms could not be learned, it said. Shares of AOL traded up 2.2 percent to $22.13 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Icahn, who has made a hostile $7-a-share offer for the movie studio, Reuters reports. Lions Gate repeated its assertion that Mr. Icahn’s bid was “financially inadequate, opportunistic and coercive,” but the company nonetheless opened the door to possible talks in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There were reports last week that Lions Gate and Mr. Icahn had previously held talks about a deal to end his hostile bid. More from Reuters: Lions Gate said in the filing that its board believed “it would now be appropriate to respond to the Icahn Group’s recent communications to determine whether there may be a basis on which to engage in negotiations and will do so today.” Mr. Icahn could not immediately be reached for comment. David Joyce, an analyst with Miller, Tabak, said Lions Gate’s management and board needed to have a constructive dialogue with Mr. Icahn to address their fiduciary duty to shareholders. “It seems like they’re kind of burying the hatchet in order to have perhaps productive discussions,” Mr. Joyce said. Mr. Icahn, who owns interests in a swathe of companies and is known for past moves to influence the direction of such companies as Time Warner, has been frustrated with Lions Gate’s management and the stock’s lackluster performance. The billionaire investor has also said in the past that he would like to see his son, Brett Icahn, gain a seat on the Lions Gate board. Lions Gate disclosed in the S.E.C. filing on Monday that it had created a $16 million trust for any potential cash severance to senior executives, if their employment is terminated without cause in connection with a change in control of the company. Last week, about 56 percent of Lions Gate shareholders voted to approve a shareholder rights plan, otherwise known as a poison pill, that theoretically would make it more difficult for Mr. Icahn to take over the company. But the action was largely toothless, because Canadian regulators had already invalidated the poison pill in a decision upheld by a British Columbia appeals court.

The company, which owns Turner Broadcasting, HBO, Warner Brothers and Time Inc., reported earnings of $725 million, or 62 cents a share, for the first quarter, up from $660 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. For the quarter, which ended March 31, Time Warner had revenue of $6.3 billion, a 5 percent increase from a year earlier and the company's largest gain in about two years. Once the world's largest media company, Time Warner has changed its strategy in recent years, spinning off some operations, including AOL, and increasing its focus on more traditional media, like movies and cable networks. The strategy paid off in the latest quarter, with significant gains in television and film -- and even operating income in its magazine division. ''It was a great quarter for us and a great start to the year,'' Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner's chief executive, said in a telephone conference call with analysts. The company's stock price fell 2.4 percent on Wednesday, to $31.88. Its stock has increased more than 40 percent in the last year. Operating income improved at the company's TV networks, which include Turner Broadcasting and HBO, because of increases in subscription and advertising revenue. Turner Broadcasting operates several channels, including TNT, TBS and CNN. Mr. Bewkes said ratings at some of the networks' channels were lower than he wanted. He cited CNN and said Time Warner was ''working to fix'' it. Operating income at the networks increased to $1.2 billion from $936 million. Revenue in the division rose 9 percent, to $3 billion, including a 9 percent increase in advertising revenue. Last month, Time Warner signed a deal with CBS for the rights to carry more than half of the games in the annual N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. The 14-year deal, which starts in 2011 and cost $10.8 billion, is a ''game changer for Turner,'' Mr. Bewkes said. Also last month, TBS signed a deal with Conan O'Brien for a program set to begin in the fall. The company's film studio, Warner Brothers, had a significant increase in operating income, helped by the success of films like ''Sherlock Holmes'' and ''The Blind Side,'' at the box office and in home video. The film division had operating income of $307 million, a 43 percent jump from a year earlier, on total revenue of $2.7 billion, a 2 percent increase. Advertising revenue at Time Inc., the country's largest magazine publisher, grew 5 percent. The company's titles include Time, People and Fortune. Magazines, like newspapers, have struggled to maintain ad revenue as readers have migrated online, in part because online ads generally cost less than those in print. Helped by cost cutting and the small growth in advertising, the magazines had an operating income of $50 million, an improvement from a loss of $32 million a year earlier. Overall revenue from the company's magazines declined slightly, largely because of the sale of Southern Living at Home last year. Mr. Bewkes said that he was ''increasingly confident'' about the company's fortunes for the rest of this year and beyond. His tone was resembled that of executives of other media conglomerates, including Rupert Murdoch at the News Corporation and Philippe Dauman at Viacom, whose companies in the last week have also reported growth in the most recent quarter.

Top executives at the country's largest media companies continued to reel in multimillion-dollar pay packages in 2009, a year of widespread cost-cutting throughout the industry. In several cases, the packages even increased from the year before. At the top of the list is Leslie Moonves, chief executive of the CBS Corporation, whose pay package in 2009 totaled almost $43 million, more than twice what he made in 2008, according to an analysis by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm. Not far behind was Viacom's chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, who was paid nearly $34 million, a 22 percent increase over 2008. Sumner M. Redstone, who controls CBS and Viacom, was paid more than $33 million from the two companies combined. ''Anybody who reads the business section knows the margins are being squeezed at media companies, so the fact that there are these huge packages makes no sense,'' said James F. Reda, the founder of James F. Reda &amp; Associates, a compensation consulting firm with offices in New York and Atlanta. At Comcast, the two highest-paid executives, Brian L. Roberts and Stephen B. Burke, were paid $25 million and $31 million. Mr. Roberts's pay was essentially the same as the year before, while Mr. Burke's increased about $12 million, much of it because of one-time bonuses related to the company's purchase of NBC Universal. For several executives, it was more lucrative to be running a media company in 2009, however wobbly it might be, than a large financial firm, where many boards cut executive pay after the federal financial bailout. John G. Stumpf, the head of Wells Fargo, was the highest-paid financial executive, earning an $18.8 million package, according to an analysis by Equilar. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, made $41 million in 2008 and less than $1 million in 2009, Equilar said, not including a $9 million payout he received this year that was deemed to be for work done the year before but is not included in Equilar's calculations. The bankers' pay will most likely return to past levels if financial reform passes, Mr. Reda said, as Washington's spotlight will shift elsewhere and the banks will have less incentive to stay in the public's good graces. Mr. Reda said, ''What is the government going to do after financial reform? Take away their birthday?'' Despite the hard times at many media companies and the uncertainty of maintaining revenue in the digital future, investors did not shy away last year. The stock of CBS jumped 74 percent in 2009, and Viacom's stock rose 56 percent. In the case of many of the media executives, including Mr. Dauman at Viacom, most of the compensation is based on the company's performance. Mr. Dauman's base salary in 2009, $2.5 million, was unchanged from the year before. The media industry did rebound in 2009 after a particularly tough 2008, but for many companies that largely meant cutting expenses, including labor costs. Overall revenue declines remained commonplace, but in many cases profits rose. At Viacom, revenue in 2009 declined 7 percent compared with the year before but the company's profit rose to $1.6 billion, a 29 percent increase, not far off from Mr. Dauman's 22 percent pay raise. CBS returned to profitability in 2009 -- $227 million -- after a huge write-down in 2008. ''Right now, the executive compensation is not what's driving people to invest or not invest in these stocks,'' said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG in New York. ''Shareholders are more focused on the underlying growth prospects of the companies than executive compensation.'' The pay packages for executives at public companies are made available in corporate filings. Equilar's calculation includes base salary, discretionary and performance-based cash bonuses, the grant-date value of stock and option awards and other compensation. Pay increases extended beyond the handful of large media conglomerates to some of the largest newspaper companies as well. Craig A. Dubow, the head of Gannett, the country's largest newspaper publisher, was paid $4.4 million in 2009, up 17 percent from the year before. At The New York Times, Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive, was paid $4.9 million in 2009, 26 percent more than the year before, and Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman, made $4.8 million, an 171 percent increase. Gary B. Pruitt, the chief executive of McClatchy, was paid $2.6 million last year, up 61 percent. But pay did not increase across the board. Both Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes at the News Corporation had declines in pay, 40 percent for Mr. Murdoch -- to about $18 million -- and 21 percent for Mr. Ailes, the head of Fox News, who was paid $14.6 million. Other top executives' pay fell, too. Robert A. Iger, head of Disney, was paid $21.6 million in 2009, 58 percent less than the year before, and his counterpart at Time Warner, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, earned $19.4 million, a 10 percent drop. Several analysts said the shifting marketplace and uncertainty surrounding the media business could actually contribute to the large payouts, making companies even more determined to hold on to people they see as gifted executives. ''When you have an industry going through so much tumult, it puts upward pressure on pay because so many people are moving around,'' said Don Delves, the president of the Delves Group, a compensation consulting firm in Chicago. ''People are looking around a lot, people are moving around and there's a concern about losing talent.'' He added that big compensation figures were ''one of the difficulties in the whole business model.'' PHOTOS: Leslie Moonves (B1); Viacom's chief, Philippe P. Dauman, left; at center, Brian L.

The film studio said on Monday that it had received its bids and planned to ask lenders for forbearances on two upcoming debt deadlines. Those three bids include offers from Time Warner, Lions Gate Entertainment and Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, none of which was much higher than $1.5 billion, according to people briefed on the matter. Creditors are unlikely to be happy with any proposal under $2 billion, these people said. MGM has been weighing other options, including a potential prearranged bankruptcy in which creditors would exchange some of their claims for equity, these people said. One person briefed on the matter told DealBook that a decision was unlikely anytime soon. A complicating factor is the sheer size of MGM’s bank group, led by JPMorgan Chase: the company has some 140 creditors. In the meantime, MGM is asking for breathing room on two impending debt payments: an interest payment due Wednesday and a $250 million principal payment due April 8. Bloomberg News reported that the film studio was asking for an extension of at least the former to May 14.

For years the superheroes of DC Comics have provided the foundation for the blockbuster movies of Warner Brothers, its corporate sibling. And Spider-Man will soon be sharing a commissary with Mickey Mouse as Marvel Comics becomes part of the Walt Disney Company. Beneath their tights and spandex, these valiant characters are entertainment franchises managed by teams of executives for whom creativity and chance-taking are their own personal form of Kryptonite. All of which makes it that much more remarkable that DC Comics, which publishes the adventures of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, has just handed the Batcave keys to a team of its best-known creative talents. On Thursday the DC Entertainment division of Time Warner named Jim Lee, a popular illustrator at DC Comics, and Dan DiDio, a veteran editor there, to serve as co-publishers of that imprint. Additionally, Geoff Johns, a fan-favorite comics writer, was appointed the chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, to help guide its pantheon of characters into more film and television projects for Warner Brothers Entertainment, which includes both the movie studio and the television production division. The moves are not only a sign of the crucial role that super-powered types will continue to play in the media landscape but also an indication that their long-term fortunes will be managed more and more by the people who conceive and draw their comic-book adventures. “We want to send a message that DC, going forward, is going to be a company that understands and is driven by talent,” said Jeff Robinov, the president of the Warner Brothers Pictures Group. “Although it’s not a traditional management structure, it’s a really interesting approach.” Differing paths brought these new executives to the DC boardroom: Mr. Lee, 45, drew the misfit mutants of the X-Men for Marvel Comics before starting his own studio, WildStorm Productions, which DC Comics acquired in 1998. Mr. Johns, 37, a one-time assistant to the “Superman” movie director Richard Donner, also worked briefly for Marvel before becoming the writer of DC series like “The Flash” and “Teen Titans.” And since 2002 Mr. DiDio, 50, a former writer for television animation, has served as DC’s executive editor, overseeing the publication of some 90 titles a month. Their aim in their new positions, Mr. DiDio said, is to create work so that “the nonfan can become the fan as easily as the fan can become the superfan.” That’s a tougher feat than it may appear: though “The Dark Knight,” the 2008 Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan, was a monster hit that grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, other recent DC film adaptations like “Superman Returns” and “Watchmen” have underperformed and were missed opportunities to introduce their comics to a new audience. Readers who have recently come to the DC universe may find it a mystifying place, with characters like Superman and Batman largely away from center stage, and other heroes embroiled in a company-wide series called “Blackest Night” (written by Mr. Johns) in which they are tormented by the zombified remains of dead allies and enemies. Meanwhile, DC Comics underwent a corporate restructuring in September, in which its former president and publisher, Paul Levitz, was made an editorial consultant, and Diane Nelson, a Warner Brothers executive who handled its “Harry Potter” franchise, was made the president of the newly established DC Entertainment division. Having spent a few months in this role, Ms. Nelson said, “Historically, there hasn’t been as much collaboration or connection between DC’s editorial and the other parts of the business as there might be.” Going forward, she said, “Not only do we want to make the characters and stories more accessible, we also want to create a greater connection between what happens in the books and what happens in these other mediums.” Over the past two years, Warner Brothers Pictures has employed DC writers like Mr. Johns, Grant Morrison and Marv Wolfman as consultants on movie projects. For “Green Lantern,” a 2011 film that will star Ryan Reynolds (of “The Proposal”) and be directed by Martin Campbell (“Casino Royale”), Mr. Johns has given his input on everything from costumes to special effects to fight scenes. In the months ahead Mr. DiDio will focus on print projects like a new line of graphic novels that will feature the company’s most recognizable characters. (Mr. Johns is writing one of those, too.) Mr. Lee will handle digital media, which includes everything from Web sites to social networks to the DC Universe Online role-playing game. In particular, the advent of the Apple iPad is “going to be very important for the future of digital publishing,” Mr. Lee said. “We’re going to be in that space.” In the all-important arena of feature films, DC faces strong competition from Marvel, whose motion-picture studio is readying movies based on its well-known heroes Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. In the near term, DC’s movie slate is heavy on adaptations of less familiar series like “Jonah Hex” and “The Losers,” with no new Batman or Superman films in the pipeline. (The DC executives declined to comment on Marvel’s operations, and representatives for Marvel likewise declined to speak about their competitors.) But Mr. Johns pointed to DC’s strategy for Green Lantern, in which the character has played an increasingly prominent role in the company’s comic-book world in recent years, as an illustration of how its print titles can help spur interest in films and other projects. “It’s not a coincidence,” he said. “It’s an example of where we’re going.” Even before that movie reaches theaters, Mr. Johns is planning a 26-part sequel to “Blackest Night,” called “Brightest Day,” that he will write with Peter J. Tomasi, followed by another ambitious series in 2011 that he’s keeping mum about for now. While Mr. Lee and Mr. DiDio traded some of their creative duties for more managerial responsibility, Mr. Johns said he did not strike the same bargain. “That was part of the job and part of the deal,” he said. “I love writing comics, and there’s no way I’m going to stop that.” More Articles in Movies » A version of this article appeared in print on February 20, 2010, on page C1 of the New York edition.You don’t have to possess the cold, calculating heart of Lex Luthor to appreciate the valuable place that comic-book companies occupy in the master plans of media companies.

Having spent a few months in this role, Ms. Nelson said, “Historically, there hasn’t been as much collaboration or connection between DC’s editorial and the other parts of the business as there might be.” Going forward, she said, “Not only do we want to make the characters and stories more accessible, we also want to create a greater connection between what happens in the books and what happens in these other mediums.” Over the past two years, Warner Brothers Pictures has employed DC writers like Mr. Johns, Grant Morrison and Marv Wolfman as consultants on movie projects. For “Green Lantern,” a 2011 film that will star Ryan Reynolds (of “The Proposal”) and be directed by Martin Campbell (“Casino Royale”), Mr. Johns has given his input on everything from costumes to special effects to fight scenes. In the months ahead Mr. DiDio will focus on print projects like a new line of graphic novels that will feature the company’s most recognizable characters. (Mr. Johns is writing one of those, too.) Mr. Lee will handle digital media, which includes everything from Web sites to social networks to the DC Universe Online role-playing game. In particular, the advent of the Apple iPad is “going to be very important for the future of digital publishing,” Mr. Lee said. “We’re going to be in that space.” In the all-important arena of feature films, DC faces strong competition from Marvel, whose motion-picture studio is readying movies based on its well-known heroes Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. In the near term, DC’s movie slate is heavy on adaptations of less familiar series like “Jonah Hex” and “The Losers,” with no new Batman or Superman films in the pipeline. (The DC executives declined to comment on Marvel’s operations, and representatives for Marvel likewise declined to speak about their competitors.) But Mr. Johns pointed to DC’s strategy for Green Lantern, in which the character has played an increasingly prominent role in the company’s comic-book world in recent years, as an illustration of how its print titles can help spur interest in films and other projects. “It’s not a coincidence,” he said. “It’s an example of where we’re going.” Even before that movie reaches theaters, Mr. Johns is planning a 26-part sequel to “Blackest Night,” called “Brightest Day,” that he will write with Peter J. Tomasi, followed by another ambitious series in 2011 that he’s keeping mum about for now. While Mr. Lee and Mr. DiDio traded some of their creative duties for more managerial responsibility, Mr. Johns said he did not strike the same bargain. “That was part of the job and part of the deal,” he said. “I love writing comics, and there’s no way I’m going to stop that.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/technology/companies/04aol.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Parted From Time Warner, AOL Posts a Small Profit<date>Published: February 3, 2010</date><text>AOL, newly released from its merger with Time Warner, reported a modest profit for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, even as revenue from online advertising continued to fall. The chief executive, Tim Armstrong, said AOL had become a “leaner and more nimble organization,” having cut costs sharply by laying off more than a third of its staff as it separated from Time Warner on Dec. 10. Mr. Armstrong told analysts during a conference call that AOL might “experience a dampening of momentum” over the short term. But he said the company was focused on how it would become a “valuable property on the Internet” rather than on quarterly results. Plans for 2010 include increasing advertising and the number of local communities served by AOL properties like the Patch Media Corporation, which runs local news and general information sites. AOL said it earned $1.4 million, or a penny a share, in the last three months of 2009. That contrasts with a loss of almost $2 billion, or $18.52 a share, a year earlier, when the company took a charge of $2.2 billion for the declining value of its assets. Revenue fell 17 percent, to $810 million from $974 million, but topped the average forecast of $763.5 million. Excluding one-time expenses, AOL earned 71 cents a share in the most recent quarter, topping the 63 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Stock in AOL, which is based in New York, rose 55 cents, to $25.20 a share. Since its separation from Time Warner, AOL has been trying to reinvent itself as a content and advertising business, with a variety of Web sites that include the popular technology blog Engadget, the personal finance site WalletPop and the food site Slashfood. But ad revenue fell 8 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the period a year earlier, as display and search revenue continued to falter. The decline was less than in the first nine months of the year, however. The company also indicated that display advertising in the United States inched up 1 percent during the period, for the first time in eight quarters. But international display ad revenue sank 22 percent. The company said it planned to exit most of its unprofitable international markets. Mr. Armstrong said the move would be temporary. He said AOL wanted to rebuild the technology platforms for Web content and advertising to help the company more efficiently serve international markets when it returns in 2011 or 2012.

Time Warner's results followed by one day solid earnings from one of its major competitors, the News Corporation, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch. Other big media companies, including Viacom and CBS, will report earnings in the coming days. Over all, Time Warner reported fourth-quarter revenue of $7.32 billion, up from $7.16 billion in the previous year. Its profit in the quarter of $627 million, or 53 cents a share, is in contrast to a loss of $16.03 billion in the same period last year, a quarter that was affected by a big write-down. The revenue and profit numbers surpassed the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who had expected revenue of $7.14 billion and profit of 52 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Time Warner was once the biggest media company in the world, but recently spun off AOL, about 10 years after its ill-fated merger with the Internet company. Time Warner is now focused solely on producing movies, running cable TV networks and, to a lesser extent, publishing magazines. ''We began 2009 with an ambitious agenda and we achieved what we wanted to,'' said Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive, in a conference call with analysts. Echoing comments from Mr. Murdoch a day earlier, Mr. Bewkes also said the economy was improving in a way that suggested the worst might be over for the media industry. ''There is increasing evidence that industry trends are going our way,'' Mr. Bewkes said. In an interview Mr. Bewkes elaborated, saying, ''It's not that there's this predictable upswing, but what we're seeing is that there's recovery in advertising.'' Running cable networks is Time Warner's most profitable business; the company owns TNT, TBS, CNN and HBO. In the three-month period that ended Dec. 31, revenue from these channels was $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion a year ago. Operating income rose to $772 million from $586 million. In Hollywood, where Time Warner owns the Warner Brothers movie studio, the company's motion picture operations reported a 7 percent increase in revenue, to $3.3 billion. Operating income grew 61 percent, to $436 million. Warner Brothers, which had its most profitable year ever in 2009, released the hit films ''The Blind Side'' and ''Sherlock Holmes'' in the fourth quarter. Its earnings were also helped by DVD sales of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' and ''The Hangover.'' While the company may be performing well in its two core businesses -- movies and cable networks -- the drag on Time Warner continues to be the magazine publishing unit, Time Inc., which includes People, Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune. In the fourth quarter, Time Inc. underwent its latest restructuring, slashing hundreds of jobs that will result in about $100 million in annual savings. In the quarter, Time Inc.'s revenue fell 13 percent to $1.1 billion. This included a 12 percent decline in advertising revenue and 6 percent drop in subscription revenue. But in the first month of the current quarter, the company said it was seeing a bounce back in print advertising. ''We've seen some hopeful signs in print advertising,'' Mr. Bewkes said. ''It's not a great lift. But we don't see it going down anymore.'' PHOTO: Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron in ''The Blind Side,'' released by a unit of Time Warner.

Mr. Joffe, Time Inc.’s primary outside lawyer since 1978, served as the company’s principal litigator as it underwent review by the Federal Trade Commission and fended off a hostile takeover by Paramount en route to merging with Warner in 1990 to form the world’s largest media company. In Delaware Chancery Court in 1989, Mr. Joffe successfully argued that Time’s board had not abused the shareholders’ interests in turning down a takeover bid by Paramount. The court, reaffirming an important precedent, ruled that boards have the right to manage their companies and are not duty bound to follow the wishes of shareholders. The decision, upheld a few days later by the state supreme court, cleared the way for the two companies to form Time Warner. Mr. Joffe later represented Time Warner in its acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System in 1996. He also represented Time Warner before the F.T.C. as it prepared to merge with AOL in 2001. Robert David Joffe was born on May 26, 1943, in Manhattan and grew up in Maplewood, N.J. He attended Harvard, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in 1964 and a law degree in 1967. At Cravath, one of the country’s oldest and most prestigious firms, which he joined straight out of law school, Mr. Joffe became a partner in 1975 and deputy presiding partner in 1997. In 1999 he was elected presiding partner, a position he held until 2006, when he returned to the full-time practice of law. Although Mr. Joffe specialized in antitrust, securities and corporate governance law, he had a strong interest in human rights issues and civil rights law. At Harvard he was the case-note editor for The Harvard Civil Rights/Civil Liberties Law Review, and a few months after joining Cravath, he accepted a fellowship to work for two years in Malawi’s ministry of justice, which was rewriting the country’s laws and setting up a framework for supervising local courts. In 1989, he argued Martin v. Wilks, a pro bono case, before the Supreme Court, representing black workers in Birmingham against Robert K. Wilks and other white firefighters. The Wilks suit took aim at a 1974 consent decree that required Birmingham to hire and promote black firefighters, arguing that because the white firefighters had not been party to the original decree, they should not be bound by it and could file an antidiscrimination suit. The court ruled, 5 to 4, in favor of Mr. Wilks, but the Civil Rights Act of 1991 negated some of the impact of the decision. The act barred challenges to consent decrees by parties who knew or should have known of the decree, or who were adequately represented by the original parties. Some of Mr. Joffe’s most important work came at the end of his career, as the recent financial crisis gathered strength. He was a longtime adviser to the nonmanagement directors of Fannie Mae, and he represented the independent directors of Merrill Lynch in the run-up to its acquisition by Bank of America in January 2009. He also served as counsel to the independent directors of Citigroup, General Electric, General Motors and other companies. Mr. Joffe’s first marriage ended in divorce.

Add to Portfolio News Corporation Time Warner Inc Time Warner Cable Inc Google Inc Go to your Portfolio » Bruce Haynes, a Republican strategist and managing director at the Washington firm Purple Strategies, helped create ads asking customers if Time Warner should “Roll Over or Get Tough” over fees with the News Corporation’s Fox division. In November, a month before its contract with Fox expired, Time Warner Cable began running television, Internet and print ads. “We said, we ought to get some political advice and frame it, somewhat, from those lessons,” said Sam Howe, chief marketing officer of Time Warner Cable. “Name names, and give customers some information.” Fox and Time Warner Cable are playing nice now  they announced an agreement on Jan. 1. But the episode is just one example of how once-private business negotiations are spilling into public view. Two weeks ago, Conan O’Brien released a statement criticizing NBC in an attempt to reach as many people as possible. The same day, Google, rather than conducting backroom negotiations with Chinese officials, posted a blog item saying it would no longer adhere to censorship policies on its Chinese sites. And in another nasty cable fight that was resolved just last week, Scripps Networks recruited its stars from the Food Network and HGTV in ads complaining that Cablevision, a New York-area cable provider, had removed the channels from the service. In retaliation, Cablevision ran ads encouraging viewers to complain directly to the Scripps chief executive. What’s happening, according to some observers, is a shift in how business negotiations are conducted  from closed and discreet to open and political. “There’s a code of the past that we keep things in the boardroom and don’t go public,” said Bobby Calder, chairman of the marketing department at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “What you’re seeing is, I think, a realization that you can go outside and gain some negotiating power.” The campaigns play to populist sentiment, asking the public to do the right thing, an approach that also draws from politics. They create a public spectacle, a narrative that distills dull subjects like contract negotiations into a good-guy, bad-guy conflict  a Harvard Business School case study turns into a shootout with Liberty Valance. “Customarily these kinds of decisions are business decisions that we can make rationally,” said David A. Owens, a professor of management at Vanderbilt’s Graduate School of Management. But the narrative businesses are using now “evokes an emotional response,” he said. “It makes business a drama.” The tactics are examples of what economists call signaling: when two parties in a transaction have different information, one can transmit messages about his status or power by sending signals  or, in this case, buying advertising meant to show that the public is on his side. “You want it to be interesting enough for people to participate in the campaign,” said Mr. Haynes, who worked on the Time Warner strategy. It seemed to work: the two companies worked out their differences. The 1.2 million visitors to the RollOverOrGetTough.com site had helped “terrifically” in the talks, Mr. Howe said. Sunil Gupta, the head of the marketing department at Harvard Business School, said that it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these campaigns. “I doubt that you can do a controlled experiment of any sort to truly understand the effectiveness. The effects of such P.R. efforts are generally intangible.” And these signals can conflict, creating another hazard: by going public with customers, companies are explicitly criticizing the people on the other side of the negotiations, as Time Warner did with Fox and Conan O’Brien had been doing almost every night on NBC’s own network, until his final show on Friday. “You can’t do that too many times  you destroy trust, you destroy a sense of protocol,” Mr. Owens said. “Negotiations have been done the way they’ve been done for a reason.” Part of the reason for the public shift is technological. With Twitter, Facebook and Web sites, companies can solicit support easily. “If you go back 20 years, it would’ve been very, very hard to solicit feedback from millions of customers,” said Chris Nelson, director of crisis management at the public relations firm Ketchum, which advised Time Warner Cable on its strategy. “Now, it’s a piece of cake.” On Jan. 12, Google took what spokesman Gabriel Stricker characterized as “an unusual step,” publishing a blog post announcing that human rights activists had been targets of computer attacks from China, and in response, Google would stop censoring search results in China. “The outcome we were hoping for here is the same thing we’ve always hoped for: to be able to operate securely in China and in a way that increases access to information for our users in China,” Mr. Stricker said via e-mail. But another outcome was a turnaround in Google’s reputation. Long criticized for acting monopolistically, Google is getting commendations from civil liberties and privacy groups and even from young people who are leaving flowers outside its offices in China. Though he was fighting for a television time slot and not freedom of speech, Mr. O’Brien used a similar tactic when, on Jan. 12, he issued a statement on PRNewswire. Mr. O’Brien’s letter, addressed to “People of Earth,” discussed how long and hard he had worked for his “Tonight Show” hosting job, and expressed his “enormous personal disappointment” about NBC’s decision. The Internet audience came back with overwhelming support for Mr. O’Brien, with fan groups forming on Facebook, and Twitter users declaring their support. “If you are in this company’s negotiation, and you want more leverage, if there are hundreds of thousands of people speaking in favor of you, that certainly helps,” said Mr. Gupta. Like Mr. O’Brien, companies are exploiting their direct ties to customers. Scripps Networks, in its battle with Cablevision, had been running ads with the Food Network stars Bobby Flay and Sandra Lee. The company also turned its sites ILoveFoodNetwork.com and ILoveHGTV.com into advocacy sites. But Scripps did not find unanimous support there, a sign that companies run the risk of alienating not only their business partners, but their customers as well. Several respondents said Scripps “created the situation,” as one poster said. Others asked what fees it was charging Cablevision, or tried to calculate exactly how much Scripps was demanding. The companies eventually settled on Jan. 21. But Cindy McConkey, a Scripps spokeswoman, said the company had removed its ads more than a week before that. “I think they grew weary of it,” she said of her customers. “And we did too.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 25, 2010, on page B1 of the New York edition.When Time Warner Cable was tussling over fees with the News Corporation, it did something that would have been unthinkable in the backrooms where deals were once struck: it hired a political consultant to mount a public campaign against its own client.

Several respondents said Scripps “created the situation,” as one poster said. Others asked what fees it was charging Cablevision, or tried to calculate exactly how much Scripps was demanding. The companies eventually settled on Jan. 21. But Cindy McConkey, a Scripps spokeswoman, said the company had removed its ads more than a week before that. “I think they grew weary of it,” she said of her customers. “And we did too.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/business/media/11merger.html?ref=timewarnerinc">How the AOL-Time Warner Merger Went So Wrong<date>Published: January 10, 2010</date><text>A decade ago, America Online merged with Time Warner in a deal valued at a stunning $350 billion. It was then, and is now, the largest merger in American business history.

Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » The Internet, it was believed, was soon to vaporize mainstream media business models on the spot. America Online’s frothy stock price made it worth twice as much as Time Warner’s with less than half the cash flow. When the deal was announced on Jan. 10, 2000, Stephen M. Case, a co-founder of AOL, said, “This is a historic moment in which new media has truly come of age.” His counterpart at Time Warner, the philosopher chief executive Gerald M. Levin, who was fond of quoting the Bible and Camus, said the Internet had begun to “create unprecedented and instantaneous access to every form of media and to unleash immense possibilities for economic growth, human understanding and creative expression.” The trail of despair in subsequent years included countless job losses, the decimation of retirement accounts, investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, and countless executive upheavals. Today, the combined values of the companies, which have been separated, is about one-seventh of their worth on the day of the merger. To call the transaction the worst in history, as it is now taught in business schools, does not begin to tell the story of how some of the brightest minds in technology and media collaborated to produce a deal now regarded by many as a colossal mistake. How did it happen? The romance between Mr. Case and Mr. Levin, they said in interviews with The New York Times, began in the fall of 1999 at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China at Tiananmen Square. MR. LEVIN I was seated for some reason in front of Steve Case and his wife and so we had a little chitchat. It was a stunning evening to be a part of that history. But this next thing that registered on me was that they seem to have a very sweet relationship and I liked that, and we had some fun, joked around, and so from a personality point of view we talked. MR. CASE There was all kinds of hoopla and parades in Tiananmen Square and a state dinner at the Hall of the People, and I remember Jerry had decided to have the Time Warner board meet in China that week and they were on a trip but they also attended some of these functions, so at these different functions I talked to various Time Warner board members, but I don’t think I had any direct conversations with Jerry about the merger until probably a month later. MR. LEVIN We’re now back in the United States and I think Steve Case called me on the phone and in that conversation more than alluded to putting the companies together. I had my traditional script and quasi-legal background that when someone calls you on the phone, make sure they understand you’re not for sale, which we certainly weren’t, and decline any overture, which I did over the phone. In fact, Mr. Case and his team, including Robert W. Pittman, the company’s president, had been plotting for months about how to use its high-priced stock to make a big acquisition. The company hired the investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, and its top media banker Eduardo Mestre, to consider various targets. MR. MESTRE It was one of the highlights of my career because I remember vividly sitting down with the AOL executives and going through with them their vision of how to combine AOL with a more traditional company in creating what at that time was going to be perceived as a company of the future. MR. PITTMAN It was a very heady time because 1999 was the first year the thesis that everybody was going to be on the Internet and every business was going to be on the Internet and it was going to be a primary means of communication finally was accepted; 1999 was the year it sort of kicked in, and I think when it kicked in people started saying, “O.K., what’s the big dream, what’s the big idea, what do we need to do now?” We were actually deep in discussions with eBay to buy eBay and add them, had a little bit of discussion with Larry Probst over at Electronic Arts, and Steve had an idea that we should merge with Time Warner and me and a couple other people said there’s no chance that’s ever going to happen and I sort of paid no attention to it. Meanwhile, Mr. Levin was thinking deeply about how to transform Time Warner for the digital age. MR. LEVIN We were emerging from not just old media but from an analog world into a digital world, and philosophically people were beginning to understand that the digital world was a transformational universe. Before AOL, Mr. Levin, prodded by Gordon Crawford, senior vice president at Capital Research Global Investors in Los Angeles, then the largest institutional shareholder of Time Warner, discussed a merger with Yahoo’s founder, Jerry Yang. 1 2 3 4 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 11, 2010, on page B1 of the New York edition.A decade ago, America Online merged with Time Warner in a deal valued at a stunning $350 billion.

Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein caught his fellow titans by surprise in November, admitting that “we participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret.” That came less than two weeks after he infuriated pretty much everyone else by declaring that Goldman was “doing God’s work.” He was not the only banker indulging in the contrition thing. (In March, Bank of America’s Ken Lewis, who presided over the bungled acquisition of Merrill Lynch, issued his own apology and was still pushed out.) Now the former Time Warner chief executive Gerald Levin, who is not even a banker, has plunged into the zeitgeist. Mr. Levin issued a belated  by a decade  mea culpa for buying AOL and urged others to follow his lead. “I presided over the worst deal of the century, apparently,” Mr. Levin said. “I guess it’s time for those who are involved in companies to stand up and say: You know what, I’m solely responsible for it.” Wall Street has a lot to apologize for, but contrition would be more convincing if it came with accountability: a resignation or a decision to forswear bonuses and certainly a pledge to stop trying to block desperately needed financial reforms. Americans come as well equipped to apologize as anybody. Five minutes on the neighborhood playground will confirm that parents still try their best to instill in their children the merits of saying “I’m sorry.” True contrition is a rare thing in the American corner office, probably because when children become corporate executives they have lawyers who patiently explain how such good manners could get them in trouble in the land of legal liability. In bankers, this is compounded by a sense that they are truly doing God’s work  not merely gambling with taxpayers’ money. At play here, we suspect, are both tactics and a sense of history.

The newspaper says that the AOL-Time Warner hook-up has some stiff competition in that category and has drawn up a shortlist of its picks for worst deal of the century. Among them are the Vivendi-Seagram-Universal tie-up, which nearly wiped out the entire Bronfman family fortune, not to mention being a disaster for shareholders in both companies; and the deal by Fortis, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander to buy and carve up the Dutch bank ABN Amro, which besides being the most expensive banking deal in history, nearly sank both R.B.O.S. and Fortis.

Later that year, Vivendi of France acquired Universal Studios in another gargantuan deal.

Things didn’t quite go according to plan. Last month brought a coda for both of these disastrous deals: Time Warner spun off AOL as a separate company while Vivendi shed its remaining stake in NBC Universal, created by its collaboration with General Electric. NBC Universal is heading into a new combination with Comcast. For consumers, convergence has been at the least confusing. At the start of the past decade, they could confidently leave their homes with just their wallets, keys and mobile phones; now they often feel the need to clutter their briefcases with iPods, iPhones, BlackBerrys, netbooks, e-book readers and other gadgets, too. That seems more like fragmentation. Yet at the turn of another decade, there are signs of a possible new dawn for the idea of convergence. Many of the television sets bought during the holiday season, for instance, have Internet capabilities, and experiments in blending TV and the Web are moving ahead. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, having managed to offload AOL, is pushing a vision of “TV Everywhere” in which pay-television subscribers would be able to watch shows on their computers or other screens as well. In Britain, the BBC and commercial broadcasters plan to introduce a new way of beaming television over the Internet by the end of the year, giving viewers greater choice over what and when they watch. In millions of living rooms, television viewers already use their video-game consoles as impromptu set-top boxes to receive pay-TV signals. The next frontier may be the convergence of mobile phones and other hand-held devices with televisions and computers. Yes, Apple’s iPhone and App Store are nifty, but for now, most people still see their phones primarily as communications tools. Other mobile devices hold promise. Last week the online retailer Amazon, which also sells the Kindle e-reader, said that on Christmas Day, for the first time, it sold more digital books than the ink-on-paper kind. But there will be no mobile mass medium until business models get more sophisticated. Advertising, seen as a way to finance the delivery of books, video, news and other content, remains meager despite years of boosterism about its potential. But this could change now that Google, the biggest player in the online economy, is taking a greater interest. In November, the company acquired AdMob, a specialist in mobile advertising. Google is preparing another bet on convergence, a digital book store that will make e-books available to computers, smartphones and other devices. While the idea of convergence clearly has outlived some of the mergers that were supposed to facilitate it, many media companies are still rooted in a preconvergence, predigital era, keeping tight control over the distribution of their content via separate technologies and through geographical separations. European publishers, for instance, have largely refused to allow Amazon to sell their books in digital formats because of disagreements over the terms. Movie buffs, meanwhile, still generally have to wait months to get their hands on a DVD or video-on-demand version of a new release. Restrictions like these stimulate piracy, because there are few geographic or time restrictions on illegal downloads. Piracy, in turn, has served as a catalyst for convergence, because it has pressured media owners to look for new solutions.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image David Martin/Associated Press Failure of Time Warner and Fox to reach a deal would have blacked out weekend college bowl games in millions of homes. Related Times Topics: Fox Entertainment Group, Inc. | Time Warner Inc. Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc News Corporation Cablevision Systems Corp Go to your Portfolio » The two companies said Friday evening that they had agreed on new terms for a contract covering Fox stations in New York, Los Angeles, Orlando and other markets, averting a blackout of the weekend’s college bowl games in millions of homes. They did not disclose the terms. The deal between the News Corporation and Time Warner caps weeks of sparring over the price that the cable company  and by extension its customers  should pay to watch Fox, ahead of an end-of-the-year contract expiration. Analysts had expected that the deal would set a new high-water mark for local TV stations that want sizable subscriber fees in exchange for so-called retransmission rights. In tense negotiations with Time Warner Cable, Fox had demanded about a dollar a subscriber per month, far more than other stations have received. Time Warner Cable thought 30 cents was more reasonable, said people briefed on the talks who insisted on anonymity because the specifics of the talks were confidential. Most likely, the two companies reached a compromise on the price, but both refused to comment Friday on the figure. “We’re pleased that, after months of negotiations, we were able to reach a fair agreement with Time Warner Cable  one that recognizes the value of our programming,” said Chase Carey, the president of News Corporation, in a statement. Time Warner Cable’s president, Glenn Britt, called it a “reasonable deal.” Meanwhile, customers of another major cable operator, Cablevision, were reminded Friday of what can happen when carriage talks break down. The Food Network and HGTV were unexpectedly removed from Cablevision’s lineups in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut shortly after the stroke of midnight, sending angry customers to their keyboards and phones to demand answers. Cable and satellite operators pay media firms for the right to carry channels, and those fees are reflected in customers’ bills. Cable operators have historically resisted paying directly for the right to retransmit stations, but they have softened their stance in recent years, and some stations now receive between 10 cents and 40 cents a month per subscriber. Fox asserted it deserved more. Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman, has positioned the company as a leader in “creating an economic template for the future.” Every cent represents millions of dollars in monthly revenue. Analysts say the Fox station group’s aggressive stance could benefit other broadcasters. In a report last month, analysts at UBS said the current dispute was “likely a harbinger of things to come as consumers have more alternatives to cable than ever before,” giving programmers more leverage in negotiations. The big fee for Fox was part of a larger package of News Corporation channel renewals, which put cable channels like FX at similar risk of vanishing from Time Warner Cable systems, at least temporarily. Fee negotiations are usually conducted discreetly, and deals are often completed close to their deadlines without viewers ever knowing. But Fox’s clash with Time Warner Cable broke out in public in November when the cable operator started a campaign to hold the line on programmer fee increases. Some networks, it said on its Web site, “are trying to boost their bottom line by squeezing cable TV viewers like you  and threatening to pull the plug on popular shows if we don’t roll over.” Networks say the fee increases are a matter of survival  or at least are necessary to keep producing quality programming. Time Warner Cable representatives traveled to Los Angeles for talks with News Corporation early in the week. Under pressure from the government and from viewers to stave off a blackout, representatives for both sides met in a conference room on the Fox studio lot at 10 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday, and talks continued through Friday evening, said an executive briefed on the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Fox negotiators had the option to pull the plug after the contract expired early Friday morning, but they decided to keep talking. On the other side, the Food Network and HGTV outage affected about 3.1 million subscribers in the New York metropolitan area on Friday. The owner of the popular channels, Scripps Networks, says it deserves more cash for them. “The distribution rates Cablevision pays for Food and HGTV are among the lowest in the industry,” said Kenneth W. Lowe, the chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive. According to the research firm SNL Kagan, distributors pay about 8 cents on average for Food Network and 13 cents for HGTV. Scripps was believed to be asking for about triple that amount, or roughly 25 cents for Food and 40 cents for HGTV. Cablevision took a hard line in its own statement Friday, saying that it had “no expectation of carrying” Scripps’s programming again, “given the dramatic changes in their approach to working with distributors to reach television viewers.” Scripps’s contracts with Time Warner Cable also expired on Dec. 31, but those two companies continued talking into the new year without an interruption in programming.

Skip to next paragraph Related Broadcasters Battling for Cable Fees (December 29, 2009) Add to Portfolio News Corporation Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » The News Corporation is demanding higher subscriber fees for its Fox stations from Time Warner Cable. On Thursday afternoon, the Federal Communications Commission urged the feuding companies to keep negotiating into the new year. Early Friday, Scott Grogin, Fox senior vice president for communications, said that the two sides were still negotiating, according to The Associated Press. An executive briefed on the talks said the extension indicated that the companies were making progress, although hurdles remained. The extension seemed to indicate that the stations would remain on the air while the talks continued in Los Angeles. Earlier in the week, the News Corporation warned that its stations could disappear from the cable operator’s systems in New York, Los Angeles, Orlando, Fla., and other markets after the contract ended on Thursday. If Fox disconnects the signals, subscribers in those markets would be left scrambling for other ways to watch the Sugar Bowl on Friday and the Cotton Bowl on Saturday, among other programs. Some households are likely to switch to over-the-air signals temporarily, assuming they have the necessary digital TV receiver. Both companies appeared content to let their feud and their negotiating tactics play out in public, complete with dueling advertising campaigns. The haggling between the two media giants highlights an emerging issue for networks and local stations: retransmission fees. Station owners like the News Corporation are asking for substantial fees from cable and satellite operators for the right to retransmit their programming. Fox has demanded about $1 a month for each subscriber from Time Warner Cable. On WNYW, the Fox affiliate in New York, a reporter told viewers on Thursday morning, “Time Warner takes our broadcast signal and then resells it, but they do not want to pay fairly for that right.” Time Warner Cable says it is willing to pay a subscriber fee, but that Fox’s demand is excessive. The hard-fought negotiations over Fox are part of a larger renewal of the News Corporation’s contracts with the cable operator. Cable channels like FX and the Speed Channel are also affected, although the News Corporation’s most popular cable channel, Fox News, is not. In the weak advertising climate, subscriber fees are a crucial source of revenue for media companies. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a statement on Thursday that he had urged Fox and Time Warner Cable “to agree to a temporary extension of carriage if they do not come to terms on a new carriage agreement today, in order to prevent disruption to their viewers.” Time Warner Cable, meanwhile, reiterated its willingness to extend negotiations into the new year, saying in a statement, “We implore Fox to not make America’s living rooms a corporate battleground.” Negotiations between cable operators and programmers often come down to the wire at the end of the year, keeping representatives for the companies tied to their desks into the wee hours of New Year’s Day. In a separate case, the owner of the Food Network and HGTV, Scripps Networks, said it removed its channels from Cablevision’s lineups on Friday, a consequence of a breakdown in talks between the two parties. “Viewers love our talent and our shows, which is why Food Network and HGTV rank among the top networks in cable,” Kenneth W. Lowe, the chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive, said in a statement Friday morning. “But our valuable networks simply are not being compensated like top ten networks by Cablevision. The distribution rates Cablevision pays for Food and HGTV are among the lowest in the industry.” The dispute may linger for some time; Cablevision said it had “no expectation of carrying their programming again, given the dramatic changes in their approach to working with distributors to reach television viewers.” More Articles in Business »A contract governing retransmission rights for Fox stations expired at midnight on Thursday, but the News Corporation and Time Warner Cable agreed to extend talks for several hours overnight and were still talking Friday morning.

Live Scoreboard Standings Stats | Injuries Giants Schedule/Results Stats | Roster Depth Chart Jets Schedule/Results Stats | Roster Depth Chart The Colts beat the Jaguars, 35-31, on Thursday night, and improved to 14-0. The Saints will face the Cowboys on Saturday night. “We’re very excited,” said Steve Bornstein, the NFL Network’s president. “It gives us great visibility.” The serendipitous scheduling is good for the league’s channel, which carries eight prime-time games a season and a raft of other league-oriented programming. But it has also battled to be seen. The network has squabbled with cable systems, most notably with Comcast; that long legal battle ended in a settlement last May that increased its availability to a shade over 55 million homes that are served by cable, satellite and telephone companies. But even at that level of subscribers, its most ever, the NFL Network still lacks the much broader exposure of CBS, ESPN, NBC, or Fox, the league’s other TV partners. Which brings us back to December 2007, when the New England Patriots were 15-0 and looking to complete their undefeated season against the Giants. There was enormous clamor from fans, and even Congress, that a history-making game could be seen in a universe of 43 million homes. Eventually, NBC and CBS entered to simulcast it. The result: 34.5 million viewers watched the Patriots win, 13 percent of them from NFL Network homes. A game as important as that one showed the power of broadcast TV. Together, NBC and CBS had 29 million viewers. No NFL Network game has attracted more than the 12.1 million for a Packers-Cowboys game in 2007. Bornstein noted the primary difference between the Giants-Patriots broadcast and the Saints’ and Colts’ games. “It wasn’t only a potentially, and ultimately, a terrific game, but it was the New England Patriots going for an unprecedented undefeated season,” he said. “But this is not the end of the season.” But that distinction did not deter the network from buying newspaper ads to market the games and tweak its foes. The ad that ran Thursday in The New York Times said: “Attention Time Warner and Cablevision Customers: You May Be Denied Two Teams Chasing the Perfect Season.” The tagline added: “Two Nights. Two Undefeated Teams. One Network.” That tactic made it clear that the two games were never destined for a broadcast network simulcast. But as is the practice regarding N.F.L. games on cable, viewers in the TV markets of the four participating teams will be able to see games on local broadcast stations if they do not get the NFL Network. Despite the NFL Network’s growth  and the introduction of the deservedly heralded Red Zone Channel to all cable and satellite subscribers  it is still hindered by not being available in many more homes. It would benefit greatly from deals with Time Warner and Cablevision, which together serve 17 million cable homes nationwide, more than 4 million of them in the New York market. But both cable operators, along with a third, Charter, form the axis of the unwilling. “We’ve had negotiations with Time Warner Cable, and we’re not going to get a deal this year,” Bornstein said. “We’d love to have Cablevision as a distributor, but they’ve elected not to.” Maureen Huff, a spokeswoman for Time Warner Cable, said the cost of carrying the channel is too expensive. “We think it’s an excessive amount of money for eight out-of-market games,” she said. All other N.F.L. games are available on existing networks without adding the league’s channel, she said. Time Warner is seeking its customers’ guidance about what to do about networks raising what they are charging the big cable operator. On its Web site, the company says, “The networks shouldn’t be in the driver’s seat on what you watch and how much you pay,” then asks if it should “Roll Over” or “Get Tough.” The loaded choice has already yielded a landslide for “Get Tough” from more than 400,000 voters. Huff said the online plebiscite is “not about any one network, station or provider.” But it is not difficult to see it as a way for Time Warner to justify its position against paying what the NFL Network has demanded even if the polling is more likely part of its war with Fox’s broadcast and cable networks. “We’re innovative, and we’ve been well-received,” Bornstein said. “Four of the top five distributors get it and are happy. Time Warner’s the only one who doesn’t get it.” E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on December 18, 2009, on page B12 of the New York edition.It was fluky enough for two N.F.L. teams to be undefeated this late in the season, but even more fluky that the Indianapolis Colts’ and the New Orleans Saints’ Week 15 games were scheduled to be shown within three days on the NFL Network.

The discussions, which are still in the early stages and may not result in a deal. The talks come in the wake of AOL’s newfound independence after spinning off from Time Warner last week. AOL’s chief executive, Tim Armstrong, said recently that the company would seek to sell noncore assets as it reshaped itself into an online media company.

He wants to convert the company into a content and advertising company, but according to RBC Capital Markets, as much as a fifth of AOL’s traffic comes from dial-up Internet subscribers checking e-mail and such. So the continued decline of AOL’s access business  five million subscribers today compared with 26 million in 2002  does more than pressure overall company cash flow. It threatens the company’s transformation to a pure content business. Bulls point to AOL’s apparently cheap valuation. Its enterprise value of $2.4 billion is just five times projected free cash flow for 2010. But much of that cash comes from the declining access business. There may be opportunity to improve advertising profit margins in line with peers. That’s what management is seeking, though they concede it will take at least a few years. Mr. Armstrong is essentially in a race against time. He must reinvest much of the cash from the access business into content to get the wider Internet audience to re-engage with his site. AOL managed to survive this choppy decade. But it may not endure the next. Brazil’s Euphoria The roll Brazil has been on is starting to slow. The country’s third-quarter gross domestic product, at 1.3 percent, was lower than expected. And its economic performance is lagging 2008. This mild sluggishness might be a result of the currency’s strength after last year’s collapse. Still, stock market euphoria looks overdone and Brazil’s growth is not soaring to Chinese levels. Brazil, South America’s biggest economy, has outdone most other nations in 2008-9 because of diversified resources, sensible monetary policy and generally sound fiscal policy. The flexibility of a floating exchange rate helped too; the 35 percent devaluation of the Brazilian real in autumn 2008 cushioned the decline in exports and allowed domestic monetary easing to assist an early recovery from the credit crisis. Brazil’s latest G.D.P. figures, though they may not have lived up to expectations, still represent a real growth rate of over 5 percent per annum. The real has recovered close to its pre-crisis level as has the Brazilian stock market, which is up 83 percent this year. But there are problems emerging. The stronger currency has hurt exports. Public spending, already high by emerging-market standards, has risen by 16 percent compared with last year. The primary budget surplus, before interest payments, is less than a third of the statutory target, a dangerous shortfall given Brazil’s big debts. Only monetary policy remains on safe ground; the central bank’s benchmark short-term interest rate is at 8.75 percent, more than four percentage points above the current inflation rate. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is also reducing the country’s economic openness. He has imposed a tax on foreign investments and altered the previously investor-friendly oil exploration policy. With an election due next year, it’s unlikely fiscal policy will look different any time soon. This could start to threaten Brazil’s competitiveness. These factors make it less likely Brazil will sustain the rapid economic growth implied by its inclusion in the BRIC group of emerging-market stars  Brazil, Russia, India and China. The euphoria over Brazil’s prospects may thus prove premature, as it has so often in the past.

The separation occurred almost 10 years after the merger of the two companies was announced to great fanfare with the promise of a synergistic combination of old and new media. Of course, it did not work out that way. The cultures of the two companies clashed, while AOL’s flagship dial-up Internet business was surpassed by broadband. Today, as the two companies go their separate ways, each is a smaller version of what it was a decade ago, and each is still fighting the disruptions that new technologies have unleashed on the media business. But each, in its own way, has focused on the production of content. Time Warner, under its chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, has slimmed down by spinning off its cable business and, now, AOL. Its core business is now the production of television shows and movies through the Turner cable networks and the Warner Brothers movie studio. With the cable and AOL businesses now untethered from Time Warner, perhaps Mr. Bewkes’s most important strategic decision will be what to do with Time Inc., the magazine empire that publishes titles like Sports Illustrated, Time, Fortune and People. In the last quarter, Time Inc.’s operating income declined 40 percent amid an advertising recession and the movement of readers away from print toward the Web. Mr. Bewkes, speaking in April about the future of Time Warner during a conference call with Wall Street analysts, said it “may well include publishing, but we’re not making a religious statement about it either way at this point.” AOL, under Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who became chairman and chief executive in March, has laid out several areas for growth in the face of continued deterioration of its Internet access business, which is still profitable but declining. These areas are premium content, including news and local information, communications like instant messaging and online advertising. But the merger between AOL and Time Warner will likely remain a prominent part of both companies’ legacies, rather than becoming a historical footnote. After all, more than $100 billion in shareholder value was wiped out. On their first day of trading, shares of AOL closed at $23.67.

These areas are premium content, including news and local information, communications like instant messaging and online advertising. But the merger between AOL and Time Warner will likely remain a prominent part of both companies’ legacies, rather than becoming a historical footnote. After all, more than $100 billion in shareholder value was wiped out. On their first day of trading, shares of AOL closed at $23.67.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/technology/companies/20aol.html?ref=timewarnerinc">AOL to Cut One-Third of Its Staff<date>Published: November 19, 2009</date><text>In recent years, amid the fallout from its audacious merger with Time Warner, AOL Inc. has steadily become smaller through subscriber desertions and rounds and rounds of layoffs. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: AOL LLC Post a Comment It is becoming smaller still. On Thursday, AOL announced it would cut its work force by one-third by eliminating close to 2,500 workers. The move comes as the company prepares to be spun off from its parent company, Time Warner, into an independent, publicly traded company. AOL said in a regulatory filing that the job cuts were meant to save about $300 million a year. It will take a $200 million restructuring charge to account for the severance costs. The company said it would ask for volunteers first, and then resort to layoffs if it did not get roughly 2,500 people to accept a buyout package. Tim Armstrong, who became AOL’s chairman and chief executive in March after a successful and lucrative stint at Google, told employees in an e-mail message that he would not accept a bonus this year. In the message, he wrote, “as a member of our team and the person who takes accountability for the results of the company, I am making the decision to forgo my 2009 bonus. That decision is a personal one and is not a sign for the future payout of the overall bonus plan for employees.” Mr. Armstrong, 38, was guaranteed a bonus of at least $1.5 million this year, according to a regulatory filing. His minimum base salary, according to his employment contract, is $1 million. At its height, AOL had more than 20,000 employees in 2004. It currently has about 6,900 and after the latest round of layoffs will be left with about 4,400 workers, making it roughly a fifth of the size it once was. In terms of what was once its core business  selling dial-up Internet access  AOL had the most subscribers in the third quarter of 2002, when it counted 26.7 million of them. At the end of the most recent quarter, it had 5.4 million. Through the first nine months of 2009, AOL lost 1.9 million subscribers, or more than 200,000 a month. This business is still profitable for AOL, although it is declining rapidly. Mr. Armstrong, in the face of continuing declines in the access business, has singled out several areas for growth, including premium content, online mapping and local services, communications like instant messaging, and online advertising. In an interview with The New York Times in July, Mr. Armstrong said of the company’s challenges: “AOL has a choice to make. We either lose slowly or win quickly. We are choosing to win quickly.” Time Warner, whose merger with AOL in 2000 was disastrous for both companies, decided earlier this year to spin off its struggling Internet unit. The spinoff is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. In the most recent quarter, AOL’s revenue was down 23 percent, or $235 million, to $777 million. Of this decline, $138 million was ascribed to a decline in subscriptions, while $92 million resulted from a drop in advertising. AOL became a force on the Internet in the 1990s by offering its ubiquitous dial-up service, but fell behind as high-speed service became widespread and the access business became commoditized. It used its high-flying status and its stratospheric stock price to essentially buy Time Warner in a deal announced in January 2000. The balance of power shifted in the ensuing years, and Time Warner dropped “AOL” from its name. Its formal spinoff in the coming weeks will be the closing chapter of the ill-fated deal.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » The results were hurt by one business that the company has said it will spin-off  AOL  and another that has been battered by the advertising recession and is not viewed by executives as central to the company’s future, the Time Inc. magazine publishing empire. The company’s biggest business, cable networks, which includes channels such as HBO, TNT, TBS and CNN, gained in revenue and profit. Revenue at the movie unit, the Warner Brothers studio, declined mainly because of lower DVD sales, a trend that has been felt across Hollywood, although its profitability improved. Time Warner’s performance, like the results posted Monday by a rival, Viacom, is emblematic of a mainstream media industry that is largely contracting as consumers change how they view television and movies. The trend is compounded by the recession. So media executives are left to cut costs to maintain profitability, rather than increase the revenue pie. “We are executing well, despite the tough environment,” said Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive officer, in a conference call with Wall Street analysts. Over all in the third quarter, revenue declined 6 percent, to $7.1 billion. Net income was $661 million, down from $1.1 billion in the last year’s third quarter. Operating income decreased 10 percent, to $1.4 billion. The results, though, were better than Wall Street forecast, and the company raised its financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Excluding certain items, the company reported earnings-per-share of 61 cents, better than the 55 cents expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters. AOL posted a 23 percent drop in revenue, to $777 million. But the company plans to complete its spin-off of the unit by the end of the year. At Warner Brothers, revenue fell 4 percent, while operating income increased 6 percent to $291 million. Warner Brothers, like other studios, is facing a decline in DVD sales, which once drove growth in Hollywood. But the performance of the unit, particularly the increase in profits, surpassed what many on Wall Street expected. The studio’s major release in the quarter was “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.” “I think the most noteworthy thing in the quarter is film,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital. “They’ve grown operating profits at film for each of the past six quarters. “A lot of it is streamlining and cost cutting,” he said. The only division of Time Warner to post revenue growth was its cable networks. Revenue there rose to $2.87 billion, from $2.73 billion in the quarter a year ago. Operating income rose to $938 million from $909 million. Time Warner confirmed that it would take a $100 million restructuring charge to lay off hundreds of workers at Time Inc., which publishes titles like Time, Sports Illustrated, People and Fortune. Also Tuesday, the company said it would close Fortune Small Business, which is produced by Time Inc. but owned by American Express. In the quarter, Time Inc.’s revenue declined 18 percent to $914 million, while its operating income declined 40 percent, to $97 million, from last year’s third quarter. Advertising revenue declined by $129 million, or 22 percent, while subscriptions declined 13 percent, to $49 million. Mr. Bewkes said he believed much of the downturn in magazine advertising a result of the recession rather than permanent shifts of readers turning away from print and toward the Internet. This view runs counter to that of many others who believe that print is on a steady decline and will never return to the growth it once enjoyed.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Justin Lubin/NBC Michael Cudlitz plays the role of John Cooper in an episode of “Southland,” a police drama dropped by NBC but picked up by the TNT cable channel. Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Mr. Koonin, the president of Turner Entertainment Networks, has been orchestrating the TNT cable channel’s growth for almost a decade, from a unit best-known for “Law and Order” reruns to a financial powerhouse for the parent company, Time Warner. In another sign of its growing reliance on original programming, TNT is expected to announce Monday that it will begin showing “Southland,” the critically acclaimed but abruptly canceled NBC police drama, starting in January. With the move, “Southland” becomes the rare TV series to be dropped by a broadcaster and revived by a cable outlet, where it will compete at 10 p.m. with NBC’s “The Jay Leno Show.” TNT was talking to the producer of “Southland,” Warner Brothers, within hours of the cancellation in October. “We want to provide what the broadcast networks aren’t,” Mr. Koonin said. As NBC’s verdict for “Southland” indicates, the “counterpunching opportunity,” as Mr. Koonin puts it, involves scripted series. TNT’s biggest claims to fame are “The Closer,” which stars Kyra Sedgwick, and “Saving Grace,” starring Holly Hunter. Like other cable channels that are known for original shows, TNT saves most of its ammunition for the summer, when broadcasters are not at the top of their game. But the summer strategy is slowly evolving. On Dec. 7, TNT will introduce the hourlong comedy-drama “Men of a Certain Age,” which will star Ray Romano, star of the CBS sitcom “Everybody Loves Raymond.” The series follows three college buddies as they face middle age. In January, TNT will begin to show the seven episodes of “Southland” that NBC introduced last spring, and the six episodes that NBC ordered but did not show. It will monitor the show’s ratings performance before deciding whether to order more. “We’re not slaves to everything except our brand,” Mr. Koonin said. “It’s the only idol we worship.” Mr. Koonin knows branding, having joined TNT in 2000 from the Coca-Cola Company, where he was the vice president for consumer marketing. He sharpened TNT’s identity as a channel for dramas, adopting the slogan “We Know Drama” in 2001. Later, he turned to TNT’s sibling cable unit, TBS, as a springboard for new and rerun comedies. He now oversees TCM (Turner Classic Movies) and truTV (formerly Court TV) as well. Together, the channels  which are run as one business  represent about 10 percent of all cable viewing, Turner says. “We’re managed and organized much more like a consumer products group than we are a TV network,” Mr. Koonin said. In 2007, Mr. Koonin and his colleagues submitted a three-year plan to executives at Time Warner, the parent company of the Turner Broadcasting unit, of which TNT is a part. The plan, they said at the time, was to schedule three nights of original series in 2010. They reached the target one year early. Next year, Mr. Koonin expects TNT to show at least eight original series. Looking beyond three nights a week, “There seem to be some 10 o’clock opportunities today,” he said, alluding to NBC’s prime-time talk show starring Mr. Leno. Most of the hours of TNT’s day still consist of network reruns and movies. But Mr. Koonin said the original programs are responsible for a “substantial and growing” portion of the channel’s revenues. TNT averages a million viewers at any given time, enough to make it one of the 10 most popular channels on cable. Among 18- to 49-year-old viewers, the channel placed fifth in prime time in mid-October, the most recent week of available Nielsen ratings. TNT also ranks No. 5 on the research firm SNL Kagan’s list of cable advertising earners. The company estimates that TNT will take in $884 million in ad revenue this year, up about six percent from the last year. But Mr. Koonin emphasizes that his target is not bigger cable channels like FX or USA. It is the broadcasters. In the long term, he said, “if we focus on other cable, we’re not going to grow.” There have been missteps. Introducing “Raising the Bar,” a legal drama from Steven Bochco in September 2008, at the same time that many broadcast shows were making debuts, “was foolish,” Mr. Koonin concedes. This year it dropped “Trust Me,” a series set at an advertising agency. “Raising the Bar” and another, “Dark Blue,” are awaiting decisions about their fates. “We’re going to have failures,” Mr. Koonin said. “But we know if our brand is strong, then our shows have an opportunity. That’s why our brand is the most important asset we have.” Cable shows differ from broadcast in significant ways. Cable seasons regularly top out at 13 episodes, rather than the 22 or 24 of broadcast. Producers may shave a day or two off the production schedule for each episode. Marketing budgets are generally lower. But the stars, the sets, and the scripts are all costly. In the case of “Southland,” NBC was paying Warner a license fee of about $1.6 million for each episode. (It reportedly dropped the program because it was more cost-effective to show the newsmagazine “Dateline” instead.) TNT will pay $1.4 million to $1.5 million an episode. Some budget trims will have to be made if a new season’s episodes are ordered. But Mr. Koonin said the show would retain its lead actors and its writing staff. On cable, “will the show look the same? The answer’s yes,” he said. After nearly 10 years at Turner, he says he still finds himself rebutting wrong-headed assumptions about cable “every day.” But he takes that as a challenge: “This is David, as an industry, toppling Goliath,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Kimberly White/Reuters; Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Brian Roberts of Comcast, left, wants to diversify by buying NBC Universal. His shareholders might rather just buy G.E. shares. In a takeover, the fate of Jeff Zucker, chief of NBC, is unclear. Add to Portfolio Comcast Corp Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Sometime in the near future, Comcast, the largest cable system operator in the country, is likely to buy a majority stake from General Electric in NBC Universal, a huge enterprise with content assets in broadcast, cable and film and on the Web. It’s just like the good old days, when media titans strode the earth in search of the grail of synergy, a magical elixir that emerged from vertically integrating seemingly disparate enterprises. In this case, Comcast  a company with around 24 million customers in 39 states that make up 95 percent of its revenue  wants to diversify when cable systems are under a variety of threats. Nothing like a little deal flow to get the blood pumping. Peter Chernin, former head of the News Corporation, has been brought in as an adviser by Comcast, and the possibility of a change in ownership has ginned up all manner of speculation about the fate of Jeff Zucker, the head of NBC. Even Rupert Murdoch has made noises about kicking the tires on the prize, which adds spice. And just in case people aren’t feeling the nostalgia, the conglomerate Vivendi, a battered expression of a bygone era when synergy was not an epitaph, is in the mix as a 20 percent owner of NBC Universal. We haven’t seen anything quite like it since the merger of Time Warner and AOL. And that turned out well, right? Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner and a major competitor to both Comcast and NBC Universal, has seen this movie before and is glad his company is not the star this time. Ever since he took over the company, he’s been busy trying to undo the merger, spinning off the cable division of the company and planning to do the same with AOL. “Somebody has finally noticed that these things don’t work out so well,” Mr. Bewkes said at a media conference this month, according to Peter Kafka, of the blog Media Memo at AllThingsD. “We love to see our competitors taking risks.” The deal Mr. Bewkes seems to wish on his competitors would go something like this: Comcast would make an offer of about $27 billion, creating a new separate enterprise that takes on $9 billion in debt while Comcast would contribute its cable channels, including E Entertainment, the Style Network and the Golf Channel, along with other channels and its local sports networks worth about $6 billion. Comcast would give, by some estimates, $6 billion to Vivendi for its 20 percent share of NBC Universal, and then own 51 percent of the enterprise and use cash flow to gradually buy out G.E. The deal is not without business logic, if you stay away from the S word. It’s not a bad time to be buying NBC Universal, which is struggling with big assets like the peacock network (primetime Leno, anyone?) and Universal Studios (remember “Land of the Lost”? Me neither). But the company’s cable channels  CNBC, MSNBC, Bravo, SyFy and USA  are profitable jewels. And at a time when video on demand is taking off, the enterprise would have lots of audience and plenty of studio product to show, especially as we move to a world where movies are released simultaneously on all manner of platforms. And let’s not forget that the deal comes with a 30 percent stake in Hulu, the online video service, which may not be profitable but could be if it makes the leap to a pay service, which appears likely. And it’s not as though being a stand-alone cable system were a walk in the park these days. They face all kinds of threats. But cable has been a surprisingly stable business while the rest of the media lurches from hit to flop and back again. Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, has never made a secret of his desire to diversify the company and with it, his family’s assets. Unfortunately for Mr. Roberts, his shareholders have the ability to diversify on their own and they’d like the company to stick to its core knitting. According to a report on the potential ramifications of the deal from Bernstein Research, investors have not forgotten Mr. Roberts’s last content crush. “Comcast has spent five years in the penalty box after attempting to buy Disney in 2004,” the report said, mentioning that the company’s stock had underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index in the last five years by 31 percent. The report was called “Comcast: Snatching Defeat From the Jaws of Victory?” and lowered the stock’s target price to $18, from $21. Beyond the economics of the transaction, which are very much in flux, the report predicts a rough road toward regulatory approval: “cable-bashing in an election year is a no-lose bipartisan proposition.” “Media moguls see it almost as a birthright to buy and sell assets, but most of it clearly has not worked out,” said one of the report’s authors, Craig Moffett. “The value of the deal is the conceptual value of vertical integration, and most of it is against the law as a regulatory matter.” He said that by attracting government scrutiny to the tie-up, Comcast could end up encountering some unintended consequences. He invokes the AOL Time Warner deal, in which the newly formed enterprise had to sacrifice its proprietary messenger service  an asset that would have been golden in the development of AOL  and open it up to other users. “Where would that company be today if they had not given up AIM?” he said. “At the time, they didn’t even fight that hard because they wanted to get the deal done so much.” Other stop signs are visible as well, maybe not big enough to halt media companies in full mating frolic, but worth thinking about. Investors have already expressed skepticism, and marginal improvements in earnings will not bring them around. If the price is cheap, investors are free to go ahead and buy shares on their own. And whether he likes it or not, Mr. Roberts is sending some pretty strong signals about his lack of faith in the company’s core business. “Right now, they are in the most structurally advantaged businesses there is in media,” said Mr. Moffett. “People can talk all they want about content being king, but distribution has historically been a much better business because of the huge barriers to entry.” Speaking of which, if Comcast is so hellbent on going shopping, there is a company out there that has been orphaned by the conglomerate that owned it. Its stock has not only outperformed Comcast, but also significantly outperformed the market, and it could generate billions in, yes, synergies on the cost side: Time Warner Cable.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Kimberly White/Reuters; Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Brian Roberts of Comcast, left, wants to diversify by buying NBC Universal. His shareholders might rather just buy G.E. shares. In a takeover, the fate of Jeff Zucker, chief of NBC, is unclear. Add to Portfolio Comcast Corp Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Sometime in the near future, Comcast, the largest cable system operator in the country, is likely to buy a majority stake from General Electric in NBC Universal, a huge enterprise with content assets in broadcast, cable and film and on the Web. It’s just like the good old days, when media titans strode the earth in search of the grail of synergy, a magical elixir that emerged from vertically integrating seemingly disparate enterprises. In this case, Comcast  a company with around 24 million customers in 39 states that make up 95 percent of its revenue  wants to diversify when cable systems are under a variety of threats. Nothing like a little deal flow to get the blood pumping. Peter Chernin, former head of the News Corporation, has been brought in as an adviser by Comcast, and the possibility of a change in ownership has ginned up all manner of speculation about the fate of Jeff Zucker, the head of NBC. Even Rupert Murdoch has made noises about kicking the tires on the prize, which adds spice. And just in case people aren’t feeling the nostalgia, the conglomerate Vivendi, a battered expression of a bygone era when synergy was not an epitaph, is in the mix as a 20 percent owner of NBC Universal. We haven’t seen anything quite like it since the merger of Time Warner and AOL. And that turned out well, right? Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner and a major competitor to both Comcast and NBC Universal, has seen this movie before and is glad his company is not the star this time. Ever since he took over the company, he’s been busy trying to undo the merger, spinning off the cable division of the company and planning to do the same with AOL. “Somebody has finally noticed that these things don’t work out so well,” Mr. Bewkes said at a media conference this month, according to Peter Kafka, of the blog Media Memo at AllThingsD. “We love to see our competitors taking risks.” The deal Mr. Bewkes seems to wish on his competitors would go something like this: Comcast would make an offer of about $27 billion, creating a new separate enterprise that takes on $9 billion in debt while Comcast would contribute its cable channels, including E Entertainment, the Style Network and the Golf Channel, along with other channels and its local sports networks worth about $6 billion. Comcast would give, by some estimates, $6 billion to Vivendi for its 20 percent share of NBC Universal, and then own 51 percent of the enterprise and use cash flow to gradually buy out G.E. The deal is not without business logic, if you stay away from the S word. It’s not a bad time to be buying NBC Universal, which is struggling with big assets like the peacock network (primetime Leno, anyone?) and Universal Studios (remember “Land of the Lost”? Me neither). But the company’s cable channels  CNBC, MSNBC, Bravo, SyFy and USA  are profitable jewels. And at a time when video on demand is taking off, the enterprise would have lots of audience and plenty of studio product to show, especially as we move to a world where movies are released simultaneously on all manner of platforms. And let’s not forget that the deal comes with a 30 percent stake in Hulu, the online video service, which may not be profitable but could be if it makes the leap to a pay service, which appears likely. And it’s not as though being a stand-alone cable system were a walk in the park these days. They face all kinds of threats. But cable has been a surprisingly stable business while the rest of the media lurches from hit to flop and back again. Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, has never made a secret of his desire to diversify the company and with it, his family’s assets. Unfortunately for Mr. Roberts, his shareholders have the ability to diversify on their own and they’d like the company to stick to its core knitting.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Lou Dobbs | CNN | Immigration and Emigration Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » An array of minorities held small protests in New York and other cities on Wednesday, the first night of CNN’s presentation. They are trying to highlight what they say are years of lies about immigration by Mr. Dobbs, who anchors the 7 p.m. hour on CNN. CNN, a unit of Time Warner, has not commented on the protests or covered them on its news programs. One of the activists featured in the documentary said she tried to raise what she called Mr. Dobbs’s “hatred” on one of the channel’s news programs Wednesday, but her remarks were cut from the interview. The anti-Dobbs campaign has, however, drawn considerable attention in the Spanish-language press; the Thursday front page of the New York newspaper El Diario featured a red slash mark through Mr. Dobbs’s face and the word “hipocresia,” Spanish for “hypocrisy,” atop the illustration. The hypocrisy, critics say, lies in CNN’s decision to woo Hispanic viewers with a prime-time documentary while still giving Mr. Dobbs a nightly forum. Roberto Lovato, a founding member of Presente.org, a Latino advocacy group, said in a statement, “We won’t allow the network to court us as viewers while, at the same time, they allow Dobbs to spread lies and misinformation about us each night.” Separately, Mr. Dobbs is also the target of a “Drop Dobbs” campaign by the progressive groups NDN, Media Matters for America, and others. That effort started after Mr. Dobbs repeatedly raised questions about President Obama’s birth certificate. There is no indication that the campaigns are affecting CNN’s revenue, but they are highlighting Mr. Dobbs’s status as an outlier at the channel, which has sought to position itself as a middle ground of sorts in the fractious cable news arena. Mr. Dobbs is known to be exploring an exit from CNN, and he is viewed as a potential hire for the Fox Business Network, an upstart channel owned by the News Corporation. The Latino campaign’s Web site, BastaDobbs.com, features a video compilation of past comments by the CNN anchor, including his claim in October 2006 that “about a third of the prison population in this country is estimated to be illegal aliens.” He was apparently referring to federal prisoners, and he later acknowledged the claim was made multiple times in error. As the timing of the prison comment indicates, there is nothing new about Mr. Dobbs’s controversial stance toward immigration, and CNN executives have argued that his hourlong evening program hews more closely to a newscast. Privately, when some executives are asked about the Dobbs complaints, they sometimes cite the production of “Latino in America,” with the implication being that the channel presents many points of view. The documentary, which drew an average of about 900,000 viewers on Wednesday and Thursday, follows two editions of “Black in America.” It presented Hispanic activists with a new rallying point this fall. Isabel Garcia, a civil rights lawyer who was featured in “Latino in America” and organized an anti-Dobbs protest in Tucson on Wednesday, said that CNN edited her comments about the anchor out of an interview. She had expected a 15-minute conversation about immigration opposite Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., and a staunch supporter in immigration enforcement, on the prime-time program “Anderson Cooper 360.” During the taped interview Wednesday, she said she made several unprompted comments about Mr. Dobbs. She said she called Mr. Arpaio and Mr. Dobbs “the two most dangerous men to our communities,” and said that “because of them, our communities are being terrorized in a real way.” She also asserted that CNN was “promoting lies and hate about our community” by broadcasting Mr. Dobbs’s program. The comments were not included when the interview was shown Wednesday night. “They heavily deleted what I did get to say,” she said. CNN said the segment in question was tied to “Latino in America.” “As with all pre-taped interviews, they are edited for time and relevance to the topic of discussion,” a spokeswoman said. “The debate between Isabel Garcia and Joe Arpaio was no exception.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 24, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.Instead of being simply a draw for Hispanic viewers, CNN’s four-hour documentary, “Latino in America,” turned into a political rallying cry for activist groups who are calling on the cable news channel to fire Lou Dobbs, a veteran anchor with well-known views on immigration.

You watch Kevin Burkhardt at SNY and see that he’s not offering analysis or play-by-play, but genuinely interesting angles on a Mets game. One of the best parts of watching ESPN2’s coverage of the United States Open has been listening to Darren Cahill analyze from courtside. Whenever I’ve tuned in, he has adroitly complemented what has been said in the booth or provided insights that the announcers haven’t. It became my fervent wish that ESPN2 would confine Pam Shriver’s role strictly to courtside analysis, and keep her from roaming Arthur Ashe Stadium. She lacks strong interviewing skills and reporting chops, and doesn’t have the intrepid style of Burkhardt or Michael Barkann, once USA’s roving reporter at the Open. But she knows tennis; her experience would make her ideal to play the Cahill role. It was not to be. I cringed earlier this week when Shriver asked Michael Phelps if she could see his Speedo. (Yes, she really said that.) Better she had kept asking what one great athlete learns from watching another, like Roger Federer. On Wednesday night, viewers witnessed Shriver entering the zone of the bizarre. Before the Melanie Oudin-Caroline Wozniacki quarterfinal match, she broke from her interview with Oudin’s coach, Brian de Villiers, to chat with Oudin’s twin sister, Katherine, and her 9-year-old sister, Christina. Noting that they were wearing T-shirts with Oudin’s mantra, “Believe,” Shriver placed her hand over Christina’s eyes and told her, “Spell it!” Is that what sideline reporting has come to? Asking an excited little girl to spell a word on national TV? And when Christina misspelled the word as “B-E-L-E-I-V-E,” a look of slight mortification crossed her face. “Oh, close enough,” Shriver said. As she walked away, she added, “I’m a terrible speller.” After Wozniacki took the first set, 6-2, Shriver spoke again to de Villiers, who said that Oudin was frustrated and irritated with her play. Shriver didn’t follow up by asking what Oudin should do in the second set. But she did gripe that it was crowded in the box where de Villiers was seated. With Wozniacki leading by 4-2 in the second set, Shriver sat down with Alec Baldwin and asked him to compare Oudin’s experience at age 17 to his as a young actor. Who cared, especially during action? This was ESPN2’s fault; you don’t cut to a celebrity gushfest when the tournament’s darling is close to elimination. ESPN2 didn’t cut her short, though; she wished Baldwin good luck for another season on “30 Rock” and suggested that Oudin hope that all her service games start 30-love. Such an unnecessary distraction. Shriver and ESPN2 showed too much persistence in pressing Oudin to be interviewed on-court after Wozniacki’s straight-sets victory. Off-camera, you could hear Shriver lobbying (“Your moment is now.”) and Oudin resisting (“Like, right now?”). What was next from Shriver, a demand that she eat her broccoli? Her introduction of Oudin lacked a sense of the joy. “Usually, we don’t talk to the loser,” she said, “but honest to God, this is not a loser.” Fortunately, Shriver’s questions were innocuous and Oudin was able to leave quickly. NO NFL NETWORK FOR TIME WARNER Another N.F.L. season began Thursday night and the NFL Network was still not on Time Warner. Steve Bornstein, the president of the network, said: “We couldn’t come to a deal that makes sense for them and for us. I’m disappointed.” It was expected that Time Warner might pick up the NFL Network after the league earlier this year settled a lengthy legal battle with Comcast that lifted the channel from a digital sports tier to a far broader digital level. The absence of a deal with Time Warner means that its more than one million local customers won’t get a new premium service  The Red Zone Channel, a spin-off of the NFL Sunday Ticket’s exclusive satellite package on DirecTV  that shows live action from inside the 20-yard line during Sunday afternoon games. MSG’S HIGH SCHOOL NETWORK Cablevision is launching a full-time high school network, MSG Varsity, and will make it available to all its digital cable and Optimum on-line high-speed customers.

J. Abrams had to decide whether to keep making television shows for the Walt Disney Company or move to a new home base. A bidding war had broken out for him. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Michael Rozman/Warner Brothers Television Entertainment One of the many shows produced by Warner Brothers is The Ellen DeGeneres Show, a talk show. Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Michael Ansell/Warner Brothers Television Entertainment Another is The New Adventures of Old Christine, a comedy series starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Mr. Abrams, credited with “Alias” and “Lost,” signed a rich television deal with Warner Brothers: up to $6 million a year in fees and overhead, and a big percentage of revenue from DVD and syndication sales. “It was the overwhelming enthusiasm and sense of support that intoxicated me,” Mr. Abrams said in an interview. The wooing of Mr. Abrams epitomizes one reason Warner’s television unit is heading into the fall season with an astonishing 45 shows in production, easily making the company the No. 1 television supplier. As networks more blatantly favor internal suppliers, Warner, which is not aligned with a major network, has kept its batting average high by maintaining a deep bench of all-star producers. The track record of the television division, officially called the Warner Brothers Television Group, is coming under increased scrutiny as its corporate parent, Time Warner, retools itself in both form and function. By shedding AOL and its cable infrastructure businesses, Time Warner is placing added weight on operations that have been relatively invisible, like TV production. Hollywood’s attention, meanwhile, is starting to focus more intently on who will succeed Barry M. Meyer, who is expected to retire as chairman of the combined movie and television studio in 2011. Although there are several potential candidates, there is a precedent for plucking leaders from the lower-wattage arena of TV production: Mr. Meyer previously ran that side of the studio. Running it now is Bruce Rosenblum, an ardently affable executive who has worked at the company for more than 20 years. While friends and colleagues say Mr. Rosenblum, 51, has made it clear he wants the top job, he declined to comment. Speaking generally, he said, “The success of the Warner Brothers Television Group isn’t a story about me or any individual on our executive team.” Other significant players in the succession derby are considered to be Jeff Robinov, president of the Warner Brothers Pictures Group, and Kevin Tsujihara, president of the Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group. A Time Warner spokesman, Edward I. Adler, said, “Any such speculation about succession at Warner Brothers is premature.” Few people in Hollywood, much less the average television viewer, realize the scope of Warner’s television studio. It starts with the talent deals. The division’s prime-time stable includes producers like Jerry Bruckheimer (“Cold Case”), Chuck Lorre (“Two and a Half Men”), John Wells (“ER”), David E. Kelley (“Boston Legal”), Max Mutchnick (“Will &amp; Grace”), Mike Fleiss (“The Bachelor”) and Josh Schwartz (“Gossip Girl”). Mr. Abrams is starting to deliver results with “Fringe,” which will return to Fox for a second season on Sept. 17. The division also runs Warner Brothers Animation, the home of Looney Tunes, and a daytime unit called Telepictures Productions, which produces “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” “The People’s Court” and “Extra,” among others. “Our programming is relatable and upbeat  an antidote to the times,” said Hilary E. McLoughlin, president of Telepictures. Warner Brothers Television is also home to TMZ.com, one of the most successful digital ventures in Hollywood, and a spin-off series. The movie side gets the public spotlight  it is hard to compete for attention with $250 million film releases like “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince”  but the television division has delivered 50 percent of Warner’s overall profit for the last five years on about $3.5 billion in revenue. Annual revenue at the whole studio is about $10 billion. The division has its share of problems. Succession is an issue even in this corner of the Time Warner empire, especially among the ranks of executives who focus directly on creative matters. The studio is a co-owner with CBS of the tiny CW network, which is still losing money three years after the companies promised investors that it would be profitable. (The recession has not eased that task.) The Big Four networks, meanwhile, complain that Warner, more than any of the other TV suppliers, overspends on pilots to secure orders and does not come through with the necessary weekly budgets to maintain that initial sizzle. It is one reason cited for the demise of Warner shows like “Pushing Daisies,” which ABC dumped after two seasons.

Abrams had to decide whether to keep making television shows for the Walt Disney Company or move to a new home base. A bidding war had broken out for him. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Michael Rozman/Warner Brothers Television Entertainment One of the many shows produced by Warner Brothers is The Ellen DeGeneres Show, a talk show. Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Michael Ansell/Warner Brothers Television Entertainment Another is The New Adventures of Old Christine, a comedy series starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Mr. Abrams, credited with “Alias” and “Lost,” signed a rich television deal with Warner Brothers: up to $6 million a year in fees and overhead, and a big percentage of revenue from DVD and syndication sales. “It was the overwhelming enthusiasm and sense of support that intoxicated me,” Mr. Abrams said in an interview. The wooing of Mr. Abrams epitomizes one reason Warner’s television unit is heading into the fall season with an astonishing 45 shows in production, easily making the company the No. 1 television supplier. As networks more blatantly favor internal suppliers, Warner, which is not aligned with a major network, has kept its batting average high by maintaining a deep bench of all-star producers. The track record of the television division, officially called the Warner Brothers Television Group, is coming under increased scrutiny as its corporate parent, Time Warner, retools itself in both form and function. By shedding AOL and its cable infrastructure businesses, Time Warner is placing added weight on operations that have been relatively invisible, like TV production. Hollywood’s attention, meanwhile, is starting to focus more intently on who will succeed Barry M. Meyer, who is expected to retire as chairman of the combined movie and television studio in 2011. Although there are several potential candidates, there is a precedent for plucking leaders from the lower-wattage arena of TV production: Mr. Meyer previously ran that side of the studio. Running it now is Bruce Rosenblum, an ardently affable executive who has worked at the company for more than 20 years. While friends and colleagues say Mr. Rosenblum, 51, has made it clear he wants the top job, he declined to comment. Speaking generally, he said, “The success of the Warner Brothers Television Group isn’t a story about me or any individual on our executive team.” Other significant players in the succession derby are considered to be Jeff Robinov, president of the Warner Brothers Pictures Group, and Kevin Tsujihara, president of the Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group. A Time Warner spokesman, Edward I. Adler, said, “Any such speculation about succession at Warner Brothers is premature.” Few people in Hollywood, much less the average television viewer, realize the scope of Warner’s television studio. It starts with the talent deals. The division’s prime-time stable includes producers like Jerry Bruckheimer (“Cold Case”), Chuck Lorre (“Two and a Half Men”), John Wells (“ER”), David E. Kelley (“Boston Legal”), Max Mutchnick (“Will &amp; Grace”), Mike Fleiss (“The Bachelor”) and Josh Schwartz (“Gossip Girl”). Mr. Abrams is starting to deliver results with “Fringe,” which will return to Fox for a second season on Sept. 17. The division also runs Warner Brothers Animation, the home of Looney Tunes, and a daytime unit called Telepictures Productions, which produces “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” “The People’s Court” and “Extra,” among others. “Our programming is relatable and upbeat  an antidote to the times,” said Hilary E. McLoughlin, president of Telepictures. Warner Brothers Television is also home to TMZ.com, one of the most successful digital ventures in Hollywood, and a spin-off series. The movie side gets the public spotlight  it is hard to compete for attention with $250 million film releases like “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince”  but the television division has delivered 50 percent of Warner’s overall profit for the last five years on about $3.5 billion in revenue. Annual revenue at the whole studio is about $10 billion. The division has its share of problems. Succession is an issue even in this corner of the Time Warner empire, especially among the ranks of executives who focus directly on creative matters. The studio is a co-owner with CBS of the tiny CW network, which is still losing money three years after the companies promised investors that it would be profitable. (The recession has not eased that task.) The Big Four networks, meanwhile, complain that Warner, more than any of the other TV suppliers, overspends on pilots to secure orders and does not come through with the necessary weekly budgets to maintain that initial sizzle. It is one reason cited for the demise of Warner shows like “Pushing Daisies,” which ABC dumped after two seasons. Studios typically sell shows to networks at a loss; the studio makes money by selling reruns after a lot of episodes are in the can (usually four seasons’ worth). International buyers are crucial. The television business over all is also going through a brutal retrenchment, and Warner as the largest studio is particularly exposed.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Jin Lee/Bloomberg News Jeffrey Bewkes said that Harry Potter was the most valuable film franchise ever. But the results were better than Wall Street analysts had expected, and full-year profit is expected to be flat compared with 2008. This performance, given the weak economy, suggests resiliency for the company, which has shed its cable business and plans to spin off AOL. “With half of the year behind us, I’m very pleased with what we have accomplished,” said Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, in a conference call with analysts. Yet Mr. Bewkes added that, with respect to advertising, “our visibility remains lower than usual.” In recent years, Time Warner had designs on operating on all levels of the media industry. But today, the company, under Mr. Bewkes, has more modest ambitions: producing mass-market, big-audience television shows and movies. The task is made more difficult by the increasing fragmentation of audiences. But as Mr. Bewkes likes to point out, in such an environment, big hits become more valuable when they can be found. Most recently, Time Warner released “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,” which generated $400 million in box-office receipts in its first five days. Mr. Bewkes called it the most valuable film franchise ever, and there are two installments to go. While advertising across Time Warner’s businesses continued to fall, the rate of decline was less than most expected. This was similar to the performance of Viacom, the media conglomerate, which reported earnings on Tuesday, giving glimmers of hope that spending on advertising might be stabilizing. “The big picture is that the worst is behind us because there was some improvement in the ad market,” said David C. Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak &amp; Company. Only Time Warner’s cable networks reported a gain in revenue, although the film unit reported a 52 percent gain in operating income, driven partly by the success of “The Hangover” and lower marketing expenses, as revenue declined. Revenue from the cable networks increased 5 percent, to $3 billion, compared with last year’s second quarter. All of the gain was attributed to a growth in affiliate fees from cable operators, as advertising declined 3 percent, or $30 million. Revenue at Warner Brothers declined 9 percent, the Time Inc. unit was down 22 percent and AOL was off 24 percent. Over all, revenue declined 9 percent, to $6.8 billion. The company’s net income was $519 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $792 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 45 cents a share, topping the 37 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. In the conference call, executives noted that the company expected a full-year profit near that of 2008, putting Time Warner in a better position than many of its competitors. “We feel really good about how we’ve performed and we feel really good about expectations for the rest of the year,” said John K. Martin Jr., Time Warner’s chief financial officer.

The company argued that despite the hype and hosannas that greeted the merger announcement in January 2000, the intervening decade has proved that each piece will be better off going its own way. The split, which Time Warner executives have said for months was coming, gave a last echo of the dot-com bubble, which burst in the months after the merger was announced. That deal, one of the biggest in history, came at the height of a national infatuation with Internet and media stocks, a time whose reasoning is hard to recall after living through the ensuing bust and boom and in the depths of a severe recession. The merger was fed by heady ideas that did not quite pan out  that big online audiences would necessarily yield big profits, and that there were profound synergies to be had by owning different media. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, has set about paring down one of the world’s largest media conglomerates, in particular shedding delivery mechanisms. The company spun off its cable television subsidiary in March. And AOL, though much-reduced in size, remains a supplier of Internet service to millions of people. “We’re focusing the company now on its core content businesses  TV and film production, television networks and publishing,” Mr. Bewkes said Thursday at the company’s annual meeting. But in other recent comments, he has not ruled out also selling the company’s magazine arm, Time Inc., one of the world’s largest publishers. He added that “for AOL, becoming a standalone company will give it more focus and more strategic flexibility.” It could also make it easier for AOL to attract talent and raise capital. He said the details of the spinoff had not been determined but that he expected it to be completed around the end of the year. With AOL’s revenue and profit shrinking steadily for years, analysts have called it a drag on Time Warner’s stock price. The stock closed Thursday at $23.55, up 55 cents. “There’s still a substantial business at AOL, but Time Warner investors are giving it little to no  potentially negative  value, so separating out should be a positive,” said Richard Greenfield, a managing director of Pali Capital Research. “It won’t be worth nothing, and people have viewed it as worth nothing, or even a liability.” More important, he said, was the message that Mr. Bewkes is pursuing a clear, well-understood strategy. “They said they were going to get rid of cable. They said they were going to get rid of AOL. And they’re doing it,” he said. AOL was built on dial-up Internet service, a once-booming, now almost-forgotten, business. And like many dot-coms in the 1990s, its stock price ballooned far out of proportion to its financial performance. Before the merger, AOL’s market capitalization was more than twice Time Warner’s, but it had less than one-quarter the revenue of its new partner. When the merger was announced in 2000, the two companies had a combined market value of more than $300 billion. By the time the deal was consummated in 2001, with Internet stocks plunging and recession taking hold, that had fallen more than $100 billion. Today, the combined market capitalization of Time Warner and the new Time Warner Cable is less than $40 billion. Steve Case, the AOL chief and co-founder, who was chairman of the merged company until 2003, has been publicly advocating splitting them again since 2005. On Twitter on Thursday, he insisted that the combination could have worked as planned but was poorly run. In one tweet, he wrote, “Thomas Edison: ‘Vision without execution is hallucination’  pretty much sums up AOL/TW  failure of leadership (myself included).” Time Warner’s strategy for AOL has mirrored the entire company’s  a move away from delivery and toward content. It has hired prominent journalists to build a series of online magazines, trying to capitalize on the stream of visitors to its site. For three years, AOL has been steadily getting out of the business of paid Internet service, becoming more reliant on advertising sales, but that strategy has been hampered by the worst advertising slump in generations. In March, Time Warner named a new chairman and chief executive of AOL, Tim Armstrong, who had headed advertising sales at Google. AOL has about 6 million paying subscribers in the United States, down from 13 million at the end of 2006. Last year, for the first time, subscription revenue was smaller than ad revenue. Over all, AOL had $4.2 billion in revenue last year, down from $9.1 billion in 2002. Time Warner as a whole, including the cable unit that is now a separate company, had $47 billion in revenue last year.

The companys first-quarter results were dismal, but beat expectations. Could the company’s vast magazine empire under Time Inc., which publishes Sports Illustrated, Time, Fortune and People, be next? In a regulatory filing Wednesday, Time Warner said it was nearing a decision to spin off America Online, and put an end to the travails that began with the merger in 2000 of the two companies, a deal that has resulted in the evaporation of more than $100 billion of shareholder value. “Although the company’s board of directors has not made any decision, the company currently anticipates that it would initiate a process to spin off one or more parts of the businesses of AOL to Time Warner’s stockholders, in one or a series of transactions,” the company said in the filing. The announcement, which was not unexpected, came on the same day that the company reported first-quarter earnings, which surpassed Wall Street analysts’ expectations. But the numbers for both AOL and Time Inc. were equally dismal. When asked during a conference call about the future composition of Time Warner, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the company’s chief executive, said it “may well include publishing, but we’re not making a religious statement about it either way at this point.” That seemed to leave open the door for a potential sale or spinoff of Time Inc. “They’ve been smart to not box themselves in either way,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “I think they are going to see if this downturn is more cyclical than secular, and see if they can start charging for some of their online content.” By this, Mr. Nathanson meant the company would wait to see how much of Time Inc.’s troubles were because of the cyclical nature of the economy and how much was permanent because of the flight of readers to the Internet. Robin M. Diedrich, an analyst at Edward Jones, said much of Time Inc.’s revenue loss was “not necessarily going to come back when the economy improves.” Ms. Diedrich added, “It’s not surprising that the company is considering what the long-term options are.” As for AOL, Mr. Nathanson echoed what many on Wall Street believe. “We’re pleased AOL will finally be on its own,” he said. “It’s been a distraction for a number of years.” If Time Inc. were eventually to be lopped off, Time Warner still would include several profitable cable networks  TNT, TBS, CNN and HBO  as well as the Warner Brothers movie studio. It would be in keeping with Mr. Bewkes’s stated vision of Time Warner as a company centered on producing television and movies for a mass audience. “Today, we are a much more content focused company,” he said. Time Warner, under Mr. Bewkes, who became chief in 2007, has become a stripped-down conglomerate focused on producing content rather than delivering it. This year the company, which was once the world’s largest media company, spun off its cable division, Time Warner Cable, into a separate publicly traded company. Revenue at both AOL and Time Inc. declined by 23 percent compared with the previous year’s first quarter. In the case of AOL, revenue fell to $867 million. Subscription revenue fell 27 percent, while advertising fell 20 percent. Revenue at Time Inc. fell by $239 million, to $806 million. Advertising fell by 30 percent, or $167 million, and subscription revenue declined by 16 percent, or $58 million. “Advertising at AOL and Time Inc. especially is proving tougher than we expected when we last talked a few months ago,” Mr. Bewkes said during the conference call. Over all, the company said revenue declined 7 percent to $6.9 billion, when compared to the same period last year. Revenue from publishing, AOL and Warner Brothers all declined, while revenue at the cable networks, which have been the most durable segment of the media industry during the recession, rose to $2.8 billion from $2.7 billion. Net income for the quarter was $661 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $771 million and 64 cents a share in the previous period. Excluding some items, earnings were 45 cents a share. By this measure, the company beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations of 39 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. At Warner Brothers, while revenue dipped 7 percent, operating income increased 10 percent to $308 million, partly because of reduced marketing and advertising costs for movies. Time Warner received a nearly $9 billion dividend from spinning off Time Warner Cable, cash that Mr. Bewkes said he would use to buy back stock after the company announces firm plans for AOL. The company still has $2.2 billion left on a stock repurchase plan approved by the board. The rest of the Time Warner Cable cash could be used to pay dividends or make acquisitions, but Mr. Bewkes was cautious on this last point. “We know that most M&amp;A in the media sector has not created value,” he said.

Over all, the company said revenue declined 7 percent to $6.9 billion, when compared to the same period last year. Revenue from publishing, AOL and Warner Brothers all declined, while revenue at the cable networks, which have been the most durable segment of the media industry during the recession, rose to $2.8 billion from $2.7 billion. Net income for the quarter was $661 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $771 million and 64 cents a share in the previous period. Excluding some items, earnings were 45 cents a share. By this measure, the company beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations of 39 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. At Warner Brothers, while revenue dipped 7 percent, operating income increased 10 percent to $308 million, partly because of reduced marketing and advertising costs for movies. Time Warner received a nearly $9 billion dividend from spinning off Time Warner Cable, cash that Mr. Bewkes said he would use to buy back stock after the company announces firm plans for AOL. The company still has $2.2 billion left on a stock repurchase plan approved by the board. The rest of the Time Warner Cable cash could be used to pay dividends or make acquisitions, but Mr. Bewkes was cautious on this last point. “We know that most M&amp;A in the media sector has not created value,” he said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/business/media/08pay.html?ref=timewarnerinc">They Pay for Cable, Music and Extra Bags. How About News?<date>Published: April 7, 2009</date><text>Just a year ago, most media companies believed the formula for Internet success was to offer free content, build an audience and rake in advertising dollars. Now, with the recession battering advertising online, in print and on television, media executives are contemplating a tougher trick: making the consumer pay. Publishers like Hearst Newspapers, The New York Times and Time Inc.are drawing up plans for possible Internet fees. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, is promoting a plan called “TV Everywhere,” to offer consumers a vast array of television online, provided they are paying cable TV customers. And Rupert Murdoch, who once vowed to make The Wall Street Journal’s Web site free, is now an evangelist for charging readers. “People reading news for free on the Web, that’s got to change,” Mr. Murdoch said last week at a cable industry conference in Washington. The Associated Press said on Monday that it intended to police the use of news articles linked on countless Web sites, where many consumers read them free, to make sure the sites shared advertising revenue with those who created the material. But from networks selling downloads of TV shows, to music companies trying to curb file-sharing, to struggling newspapers and magazines, the make-or-break question is this: How do you get consumers to pay for something they have grown used to getting free? Some industries have pulled it off. Coca-Cola took tap water, filtered it and called it Dasani, and makes millions of dollars a year. People who used to ask why anyone would pay for television now subscribe to cable and TiVo. Airlines charge for luggage, meals, even pillows. And some music fans who have downloaded pirated songs are also patrons of iTunes. All of these success stories offered the consumer something extra, even if it was just convenience. “With bottled water, it’s a kind of snobbery and the perception of healthiness that they have marketed,” said Priya Raghubir, professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “With downloads, the benefit is that the paying services allow you to sample many songs free, and you know it’s legal, and the TV shows have no commercials. “With newspapers and magazines, there have to be features you can’t get anywhere else, and maybe part of what you would pay for is the privilege of helping the business survive, but that is more of a difficult sell.” Major publishers say they have not yet decided how to proceed, but that some changes are coming soon. “We’re looking, of course, at ways to extract payments from the consumers of our news  micro-payments, subscriptions, memberships, licensing, even voluntary donations,” Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times, said last week in a speech at Stanford University. “In the coming months, I fully expect that the N.Y.T. will begin laying down some bets based on our best forecasts of how the relationship between journalists and their audience will evolve.” Only a few publishers have tried such a transition, with mixed results. The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times each tried charging for access to some content online, then dropped the requirement because it cost them audience and advertising revenue. Most publications have moved in the other direction, trying to draw the biggest audience for advertisers by offering content free. The Associated Press’s new approach straddles the usual reliance on ads, and the new move to charge someone  though not the consumer  for the content. By adding free features like e-mail alerts, blogs, discussion forums and video, news organizations are trying to persuade readers that they provide something more valuable than the aggregators and blogs that attract news readers online. In 2006, The Washington Post became the first newspaper to win an Emmy for its video. Eric J. Johnson, a professor at Columbia Business School, said he had been amazed by media companies repeatedly adding free online services, like on-demand video. “Before you add something to your site, you should say that if consumers really want it, that should be part of a package that you could charge for,” he said. That is an alien concept to many media veterans, who grew up in a world where news and other content on television and radio were free, and newspapers made far more money from advertisers than from readers. Before the recession, media executives saw their future in online advertising, which was growing 25 to 35 percent annually. But last year, overall Internet ad spending rose 10.6 percent, and only 3.5 percent for television networks, according to a report by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Newspaper Association of America says that for its industry, online ad revenue dropped 1.8 percent last year. The free-versus-paid debate is a recurring one. At the birth of the Internet many sites charged for content, but by the late 1990s the prevailing view was that market forces favored free content. A consumer tollbooth raises money, but it also constricts the audience and ad sales. Media companies decided it was not worth the trade-off. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on April 8, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.Just a year ago, most media companies believed the formula for Internet success was to offer free content, build an audience and rake in advertising dollars.

And none of them are among the 18 official M.L.B. sponsors, who, at some point this year, also are expected to jump in with varying amounts of advertising-dollar support. The cable operators Comcast, Time Warner and Cox, along with the satellite operator DirecTV, make up the one-third ownership group. The M.L.B. Network, while not available on basic analog cable, is available on digital basic or expanded digital basic channels on the cable systems that carry it.  M.L.B. is the fourth professional league to start its own television network, after the National Basketball Association, National Football League and National Hockey League. The M.L.B. Network started with availability in more than 50 million homes, more than any of the other league-owned networks when they began. “I think M.L.B. Network has all the ingredients for success,” said Sam Sussman, senior vice president and media director in charge of sports buying at the media agency Starcom. “It has solid distribution, good talent both in front of and behind the camera, and good content. It can provide viewers with accountability that not all start-ups can do.” Christine Merrifield, senior vice president and director of video investment and activation at the media agency MediaVest, agreed, saying, “It has the makings of a great network.” “It’s lean and its staff can put deals together very quickly and creatively,” Ms. Merrifield said. “And it is getting good traction not only from sports advertisers but also from some nontraditional sports advertisers.” Kevin Collins, senior vice president, director of national broadcast for the media agency Initiative, said that M.L.B. Network was following a pattern similar to ESPN’s when it started, “airing classic footage from its archives and studio shows while waiting to air live regular season games.” “Over time, this network will succeed, especially when the new television rights come up and they are able to add more live games,” he said.  The network has the rights to broadcast a number of preseason M.L.B. games and 26 regular season games, which will be shown every Thursday night beginning April 9 and be the exclusive baseball games broadcast nationally on that night. The network also carried more than a dozen World Baseball Classic games, which brought Sprint and I.B.M. into the network as presenting sponsors of the special nightly “W.B.C. Tonight” studio show, and W.B.C. games, respectively. Bill Morningstar, executive vice president, advertising sales for the M.L.B. Network, said he was in discussions with a number of advertisers in a range of categories, including beer companies, fast-food restaurants, banks and credit card companies, movies and pharmaceuticals. “Our motto has been to try to do a deal a day,” Mr. Morningstar said, “bringing in a steady stream of advertisers in small increments of dollars. We’re telling advertisers to give us a little money and grow with us.” That has resonated with Larry Novenstern, executive vice president and director of electronic media for the media agency Optimedia. “M.L.B. Network is a very good alternative for us,” he said, “to put some seed money down for clients and to see how the audience grows.” Mr. Novenstern said that M.L.B. Network executives had been “user friendly” in his talks with them. “What they need to be doing is looking outside the box, and they are,” Mr. Novenstern said, adding that one of Optimedia’s clients, Denny’s, which sponsors the Professional Bowlers Association tour and broadcasts but is looking to further invest in TV sports, is interested in the M.L.B. Network. Jason Kanefsky, senior vice president and director of national broadcast at the media agency MPG North America, said the M.L.B. Network was “pricing its Thursday night ad units to move.” But finding more advertising dollars for a new network in the current depressed economy will be a challenge, he said “There is no incremental money in the market and may not be for the rest of the year, so whatever money that’s put into M.L.B. Network will have to come from other networks,” Mr. Kanefsky said. Media buyers said that the talent the network had hired  Bob Costas, Al Leiter, Harold Reynolds and Barry Larkin, among others  had given the network credibility. Reaction to the network’s signature studio show, “M.L.B. Tonight,” similar to ESPN’s “Baseball Tonight,” also has been positive. With the start of the M.L.B. regular season on April 6, the network will expand its “M.L.B. Tonight” studio show to about nine hours, from one hour, each night. Tony Petitti, the former executive producer of CBS Sports who is now the M.L.B. Network president, said multiple sets in the studio would be used during the “M.L.B. Tonight” broadcasts, to “accommodate advertisers with in-studio signage opportunities.” The network’s plan to have two cameras in every major league ballpark, which can be used each night to provide live “look-ins” and postgame interviews, also will provide sponsorship opportunities for advertisers.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » The company attributed the loss mainly to a large write-down that it disclosed last month to account for the decline in value of two struggling units, America Online and Time Inc., the magazine division that publishes titles like Sports Illustrated, Time, Fortune and People, and in Time Warner Cable, which the company is spinning off to shareholders. A bright spot was the company’s cable networks, which include HBO, TNT, TBS and CNN. The unit was the only one of four divisions  excluding Time Warner Cable  to have revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue at the unit increased 9 percent, to $2.9 billion, compared with last year’s fourth quarter. For the full year, it also grew 9 percent. The other units  AOL, Time Inc. and Warner Brothers, the movie and television production division  all posted revenue declines for the year and the quarter. Separately, Time Warner Cable, in which Time Warner retains an 85 percent stake, said it lost $8.2 billion in the fourth quarter and would lay off 1,200 people. For the quarter, Time Warner lost $4.47 a share, compared with a profit of $1.03 billion, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $12.71 billion, from $12.64 billion. Excluding the write-downs, the company’s profit was 23 cents a share, compared with the 26 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. For the full year, the company lost $13.40 billion, or $3.74 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $4.39 billion, or $1.17 a share. Its full-year operating loss was $15.96 billion. Revenue rose to $46.98 billion, from $46.48 billion. Stock in Time Warner, which is based in New York, fell 36 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $9.42 a share. As previously disclosed, Time Warner took a $24.2 billion write-down last year. Of that, $14.4 billion was ascribed to the cable unit, $2.2 billion to AOL and about $7.6 billion to Time Inc. In a conference call on Wednesday morning with analysts, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the company’s chief executive, said Time Warner was “well positioned relative to the rest of the industry.” On Tuesday, the Walt Disney Company reported lower-than-anticipated earnings, and the News Corporation, another of Time Warner’s peers, will report earnings on Thursday. Many analysts expect a multibillion dollar write-down. Mr. Bewkes also said that the state of the economy had resulted in “the most uncertainty and the least visibility” in memory. He said that excluding the cable unit and the various one-time items, Time Warner earned 66 cents a share last year and the results for 2009 should be about the same. But the forecast was leavened by the company’s acknowledgment that there was little certainty in business trends for the foreseeable future, especially in the advertising market. “It’s incredibly tough to make decisions right now,” John K. Martin, Time Warner’s chief financial officer, said in the call. One analyst, Michael Nathanson of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, titled his report on Wednesday, “Time Warner: 4Q a Sloppy Mess, but ’09 Guidance Is Clean.” Ad revenue at AOL and Time Inc. declined significantly. Advertising at AOL was down 18 percent, or $113 million, in the period, and at Time Inc. was down 20 percent, or $158 million. As for the drop in print advertising at Time Inc., Mr. Bewkes said, “this may continue for some time.” At Warner Brothers, revenue declined 11 percent, or $395 million despite the success of “The Dark Knight,” the second highest-grossing film of all time, after “Titanic” (in dollars not adjusted for inflation). Time Warner’s DVD of the movie was released in the fourth quarter, and the company cited slowing DVD sales as one factor in the decline. Time Warner also disclosed that Google was seeking to sell its 5 percent stake in AOL, for which it paid $1 billion in 2005. Google, in a recent regulatory filing, estimated that its investment in AOL had shrunk to about $274 million. Under the agreement, Time Warner can now either buy back the stake from Google, or decide to spin off the company to shareholders, thereby allowing Google to extract value. More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 5, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.The media giant Time Warner reported a $16 billion fourth-quarter loss on Wednesday and said that it expected its 2009 profit to be essentially flat. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » The company attributed the loss mainly to a large write-down that it disclosed last month to account for the decline in value of two struggling units, America Online and Time Inc., the magazine division that publishes titles like Sports Illustrated, Time, Fortune and People, and in Time Warner Cable, which the company is spinning off to shareholders. A bright spot was the company’s cable networks, which include HBO, TNT, TBS and CNN. The unit was the only one of four divisions  excluding Time Warner Cable  to have revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue at the unit increased 9 percent, to $2.9 billion, compared with last year’s fourth quarter. For the full year, it also grew 9 percent. The other units  AOL, Time Inc. and Warner Brothers, the movie and television production division  all posted revenue declines for the year and the quarter. Separately, Time Warner Cable, in which Time Warner retains an 85 percent stake, said it lost $8.2 billion in the fourth quarter and would lay off 1,200 people. For the quarter, Time Warner lost $4.47 a share, compared with a profit of $1.03 billion, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $12.71 billion, from $12.64 billion. Excluding the write-downs, the company’s profit was 23 cents a share, compared with the 26 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. For the full year, the company lost $13.40 billion, or $3.74 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $4.39 billion, or $1.17 a share. Its full-year operating loss was $15.96 billion. Revenue rose to $46.98 billion, from $46.48 billion. Stock in Time Warner, which is based in New York, fell 36 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $9.42 a share. As previously disclosed, Time Warner took a $24.2 billion write-down last year. Of that, $14.4 billion was ascribed to the cable unit, $2.2 billion to AOL and about $7.6 billion to Time Inc. In a conference call on Wednesday morning with analysts, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the company’s chief executive, said Time Warner was “well positioned relative to the rest of the industry.” On Tuesday, the Walt Disney Company reported lower-than-anticipated earnings, and the News Corporation, another of Time Warner’s peers, will report earnings on Thursday. Many analysts expect a multibillion dollar write-down. Mr. Bewkes also said that the state of the economy had resulted in “the most uncertainty and the least visibility” in memory. He said that excluding the cable unit and the various one-time items, Time Warner earned 66 cents a share last year and the results for 2009 should be about the same. But the forecast was leavened by the company’s acknowledgment that there was little certainty in business trends for the foreseeable future, especially in the advertising market. “It’s incredibly tough to make decisions right now,” John K. Martin, Time Warner’s chief financial officer, said in the call. One analyst, Michael Nathanson of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, titled his report on Wednesday, “Time Warner: 4Q a Sloppy Mess, but ’09 Guidance Is Clean.” Ad revenue at AOL and Time Inc. declined significantly. Advertising at AOL was down 18 percent, or $113 million, in the period, and at Time Inc. was down 20 percent, or $158 million. As for the drop in print advertising at Time Inc., Mr. Bewkes said, “this may continue for some time.” At Warner Brothers, revenue declined 11 percent, or $395 million despite the success of “The Dark Knight,” the second highest-grossing film of all time, after “Titanic” (in dollars not adjusted for inflation). Time Warner’s DVD of the movie was released in the fourth quarter, and the company cited slowing DVD sales as one factor in the decline. Time Warner also disclosed that Google was seeking to sell its 5 percent stake in AOL, for which it paid $1 billion in 2005. Google, in a recent regulatory filing, estimated that its investment in AOL had shrunk to about $274 million. Under the agreement, Time Warner can now either buy back the stake from Google, or decide to spin off the company to shareholders, thereby allowing Google to extract value.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/business/media/12aol.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Quietly, AOL Becomes an Overseer of Niche Sites<date>Published: January 11, 2009</date><text>Point a Web browser to Engadget.com, TheBoot.com, or TMZ.com, and elaborate sites about technology, country music and celebrity gossip will appear on the screen.

And the subtle links are intentional. Akin to a magazine model of niche titles for fragmented audiences interested in specific subjects, AOL counts more than 75 sites in its publishing portfolio and plans to add 30 more in the coming year. On Monday, the company is expected to announce a formal business unit, MediaGlow, to organize the efforts. The sites are AOL’s latest attempt to make a clean break from its “walled garden” past of dial-up Internet access. “Instead of having a handful of front doors, we’re creating dozens if not hundreds of front doors that are more relevant to advertisers,” said Bill Wilson, the AOL publishing executive who will be the president of MediaGlow. MediaGlow represents the third leg of a tripod for AOL, joining the company’s advertising operation, Platform-A, and its social networking services. Mr. Wilson, like other AOL executives, described the three tiers as a “total reinvention of the company.” Faced with a tattered reputation, a drastic makeover is in AOL’s best interest. The company, while profitable, continues to sustain drops in display advertising on its sites. Imran Khan, an analyst at JPMorgan, estimated last week that AOL suffered an 18 percent decline in advertising revenue in 2008. Time Warner has shown interest in selling AOL for more than a year. Corporate maneuvering aside, tens of millions of consumers visit AOL sites each month, some without even knowing it. The niche strategy is also a trend at other major media companies, said Jonathan Dube, the president of the Online News Association. “They’re selling a much more targeted, focused product, both to the audience and to advertisers,” he said. By organizing their content in new ways and thinking beyond the traditional portal-style Web site, the companies are placing bets on the fragmentation of the Web. The array of Gawker Media blogs, each with its own domain and specific demographic, is an oft-cited example. And Slate, the pioneering online magazine, has applied the same strategy by creating The Root (for an African-American audience), The Big Money (about finance) and the one-week-old Foreign Policy. “Our goal is to create a constellation of high-end editorial sites, with Slate as the biggest star,” said Jacob Weisberg, the editor-in-chief of the Slate Group, a unit of the Washington Post Company. Similarly, AOL executives refer to the publishing unit as a “constellation of brands.” While the AOL.com main page still draws consumers in, “we’re not counting on that,” Mr. Wilson said. “We’re creating all these starting places.” Web sites have always existed to serve niche audiences, of course. The Web encourages the audience to roam. AOL’s 2005 purchase of Weblogs Inc., a company that hosted dozens of blogs, provided a template for the low-cost publishing strategy. Some of the sites it acquired then, like Engadget and the gaming blog Joystiq, are now multimillion-dollar businesses, according to an internal report last October. Ron Grant, the president of AOL, calls the sites “micro-brands.” The music category is a prime example. AOL Music ranks as the most popular site of its kind, according to the measurement firm comScore. But the company also has TheBoot for country music, TheBoomBox for hip-hop, Spinner for rock music, and TourTracker for live event listings. For AOL  which has repeatedly and painfully cut costs across the board  these distinct sites are inexpensive and flexible. MediaGlow’s 500 staffers are supplemented by more than 1,000 freelancers who produce much of the content. Among the titles in development are ones devoted to reality TV, horror films and children’s pop culture. Mr. Grant said AOL’s upfront sales season for advertisers is “looking O.K., even in a down market.” While investors have focused on AOL’s talks with Yahoo, and other possible spin-offs, the company has been able to reorganize itself in “stealth mode,” Mr. Grant said. “Everybody’s been focused on the musical chairs,” he said, “and we’ve just been quietly going on, building this MediaGlow piece.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 12, 2009, on page B4 of the New York edition.Point a Web browser to Engadget.com, TheBoot.com, or TMZ.com, and elaborate sites about technology, country music and celebrity gossip will appear on the screen.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image David S. Holloway/Getty Images for Turner Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warners chairman, said the declining value of AOL would contribute to a $25 billion write-down and a 2008 operating loss. Above, he spoke at a conference in October. Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » And still the effects are being sifted. The latest blow came in the form of a $25 billion write-down Wednesday by Time Warner to reflect the declining value of AOL. That came alongside worse, but just as familiar, news: that the performance of AOL and Time Inc., the company’s other ailing arm, which publishes magazines like Fortune, Time and Sports Illustrated, is weak and will result in worse-than-expected earnings at the company when it reports 2008 numbers on Feb. 4. AOL and Time Inc. have been twin encumbrances for some time; before Wednesday, Time Warner had already taken more than $100 billion in write-downs to reflect the steady erosion of value at AOL. The corporate narrative that is Time Warner recalls the film “Groundhog Day”  an endless loop of the same story, over and over. It’s rather boring, but boring is something many corporate executives and shareholders would gladly sign up for right now. The announcement from Time Warner suggests that its newish chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, who took the job a year ago, may have been a bit too sanguine at the outset of the downturn. In early November, Mr. Bewkes, who in private combines the refinement of the Deerfield and Yale man that he is with the mouth of a sailor, said “our businesses have proved to be resilient” in the third quarter. On the same day, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, portrayed a wholly different view on how the economic problems would affect the media industry, saying they were “extremely challenging.” He said he expected a “prolonged economic slump.” On Wednesday, Time Warner warned that things might not be as resilient as Mr. Bewkes once thought  that advertising revenue was even worse than expected at AOL and Time Inc., even though the company’s other businesses, like the Warner Brothers movie studio and the cable networks CNN, TNT and TBS, were holding strong so far. Time Warner said its operating performance as measured by its chosen metric  operating income before depreciation and amortization  will rise just 1 percent from 2007’s $12.9 billion, instead of its November forecast of a 5 percent increase. Including the fourth-quarter write-down, the company said it would post an operating loss for 2008, in contrast to operating income of $8.9 billion in 2007. The write-down totaled $25 billion, with $15 billion of that ascribed to Time Warner Cable, which the company is soon to spin off to shareholders. Most of the remainder was for writing down the value of AOL and Time Inc. For analysts and investors, the write-downs are financial wizardry that by now are largely beside the point. “People want to know about business trends,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “The advertising trends are showing more and more deterioration. It keeps getting worse.” Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital, said, “It’s not a huge miss, but it does speak to the rapid deterioration of advertising, to the real core weaknesses in those categories, online and publishing.” Shares of Time Warner dropped 6.28 percent, or 69 cents, to close at $10.29 on Wednesday. For Time Warner and its media conglomerate companions like News Corporation and Viacom, the times can seem rather drab  deal flow is a trickle, spicy corporate intrigue is absent. It’s simply about buckling up, laying off a few souls and hoping that amid the economic downturn consumers will still watch television (and advertisers will pay to reach them), go to movies and plunk down cash for DVDs at a clip that sustains the business until the world perks up. Never mind if the way is littered with incremental earnings warnings. So far, that is happening. But amid the malaise, events arise that have significance. A portion of Time Warner’s earnings miss Wednesday, about $100 million, was because of the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers and Circuit City, but for very different reasons. Lehman Brothers had leased office space in the Time &amp; Life Building, Time Inc.’s Midtown Manhattan headquarters, and Lehman’s downfall will cost Time Warner a charge of $50 million to $60 million. It is also setting aside about $40 million in reserves for potential losses related to the bankruptcy of Circuit City, an important retailer that sells Warner Brothers DVDs. For years, the clause that followed the words Time Warner in print was invariably “the nation’s largest media company.” Advertising Age, the trade publication, says it has ranked Time Warner the biggest media company in the United States since 1995. But last week it said that Time Warner will become No. 2 to Comcast after it completes the spinoff of its cable unit. If Mr. Bewkes can find a way to slough off AOL and maybe even the magazine business, it will become smaller.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc CBS Corp Go to your Portfolio » CBS and Time Warner Cable announced a pact that includes higher fees for CBS and Showtime, its sibling premium channel, and that makes available CBS shows for Time Warner Cable’s video-on-demand services. Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal opens a new revenue stream for broadcast television  subscriber fees, which have long been enjoyed by cable networks like ESPN or TNT. For several years, Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, has used the soapbox of investor conferences to argue that cable companies should pony up millions of dollars a year for access to CBS shows. But cable companies have resisted paying for something that has always been free. So the two sides have settled on a wink-and-nod approach by raising the fees that cable companies will pay to deliver cable networks owned by broadcasters  in CBS’s case, Showtime, which offers movies and original shows like “Weeds” and “Californication”  or by obtaining promises from cable companies to buy television advertising. Both sides get what they want. CBS may claim it is receiving value for its shows, while Time Warner Cable can say it is not paying for retransmission, because the money being exchanged is not explicitly for access to shows like the CBS hit “CSI”; it is in the form of a higher payment to Showtime. The process amounts to opaque financial shuffling that confounds analysts. “I’ve given up even trying to figure out what anyone has paid for these things,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company who follows the cable industry. Mr. Moffett’s colleague, Michael Nathanson, who follows CBS for Bernstein &amp; Company, wrote in a research note on Tuesday that “it is intriguing and surprising” that the sides reached a deal, which came two years before an existing deal was set to expire. He also wrote: “The frustrating reality is that we will likely never know the full details of this deal. All distribution agreements include nondisclosure clauses, and deal terms rarely see the light of day.” Executives from other broadcasters, like ABC and NBC, have not been as vocal as CBS in urging such payments because they are already well paid for the cable networks they own. ABC is part of the Walt Disney Company, which owns ESPN, while NBC Universal owns the USA and Sci Fi cable networks. The deal is the first of any significant size in which CBS will be paid for retransmission by a cable company; CBS has previously signed several deals with small cable companies. “Time Warner was significant, in the size and power of it,” Mr. Moonves said on Tuesday. “I think it opens the door for more of these deals. It sets a template, and people now know we will get paid for our content.” The leverage held by CBS is the threat of turning off the signal. Last month, Mr. Moonves said that over the next two or three years, such fees from cable companies would add more than $200 million to CBS’s bottom line. “We have yet to pull our signal off any cable system,” he said then. “I hope it doesn’t come to that. I don’t think it will.” But the cable industry will not acknowledge making direct payments for carrying CBS, creating what Mr. Moffett calls a “ridiculous dance.” “Time Warner does not want to advertise that they are paying because of fear of contaminating future negotiations,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Cable Incorporated Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Viacom, the corporate parent of MTV Networks, has insisted on an increase in rights fees for its 20 channels, which include popular destinations like Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1 and Comedy Central. Looking to instigate a full-scale viewer revolt, the company has placed full-page advertisements in The New York Times and several other newspapers on Wednesday featuring some of its characters, including Dora the Explorer, who is depicted crying because she is being taken away from her fans. Time Warner Cable, which operates cable systems reaching about 13 million subscribers, has argued that this is no time to charge consumers more to watch television, especially when much of the content they are being asked to pay for is offered free online. “Our channels provide 20 percent of their audience, and we only receive 2.5 percent of the fees Time Warner pays,” Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, said Tuesday in an phone interview. Viacom also argued that its fees  it did not disclose the exact figures  were 65 percent lower than cable channel operators like Fox, Walt Disney and Discovery charge. Time Warner has retaliated, saying that Viacom is trying to squeeze more money in fees because it has had sharp declines in advertising revenue. Viacom’s stock price has declined more than 57 percent this year, closing Tuesday at $18.21. “The root of this is that the advertising market has gone soft and Viacom is desperate,” said Alexander Dudley, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable. Viacom executives have asked Time Warner for a rate increase of 23 cents a subscriber for the entire portfolio of channels. Mr. Dudley called that “an outrageous increase at a time of the worst economy anyone has ever seen.” He said the Viacom demand amounts to “about a 35 percent increase for some channels,” a figure Viacom executives said was nonsense. Mr. Dauman acknowledged that revenue was a consideration. “It’s important to protect the subscription-revenue stream,” he said, but he cited increasing costs for popular programming. Time Warner will respond to Viacom’s advertisement, Mr. Dudley said, by highlighting the availability of television content on the Internet. “We will be telling our customers exactly where they can go to see these programs online,” Mr. Dudley said. “We’ll also be telling them how they can hook up their PCs to a television set.” The moves occurred after a long and fruitless negotiation. The deal between MTV Networks and Time Warner expires on Wednesday with the calendar year. MTV Networks cited reports by media analysts indicating that many of their networks are undervalued in existing rights agreements, when compared with what other, lower-rated networks charge. For example, in a report last July for Sanford C. Bernstein, the analyst Michael Nathanson wrote that “many of Viacom’s current monthly affiliate fees (at networks such as Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, VH1 and Spike) appear to be between 41 percent and 80 percent too low given their audience delivery.” Mr. Dudley said that Time Warner had responded to Viacom with an offer of an undisclosed increase, which one MTV executive dismissed as a pittance. Each side said it hoped to make a deal before the midnight deadline.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Cable Incorporated Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Viacom, the corporate parent of MTV Networks, has insisted on an increase in rights fees for its 20 channels, which include popular destinations like Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1 and Comedy Central. Looking to instigate a full-scale viewer revolt, the company has placed full-page advertisements in The New York Times and several other newspapers on Wednesday featuring some of its characters, including Dora the Explorer, who is depicted crying because she is being taken away from her fans. Time Warner Cable, which operates cable systems reaching about 13 million subscribers, has argued that this is no time to charge consumers more to watch television, especially when much of the content they are being asked to pay for is offered free online. “Our channels provide 20 percent of their audience, and we only receive 2.5 percent of the fees Time Warner pays,” Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, said Tuesday in an phone interview. Viacom also argued that its fees  it did not disclose the exact figures  were 65 percent lower than cable channel operators like Fox, Walt Disney and Discovery charge. Time Warner has retaliated, saying that Viacom is trying to squeeze more money in fees because it has had sharp declines in advertising revenue. Viacom’s stock price has declined more than 57 percent this year, closing Tuesday at $18.21. “The root of this is that the advertising market has gone soft and Viacom is desperate,” said Alexander Dudley, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable.

(That is no cheap habit, though: a woman featured in the article had spent nearly $10,000 in the last two years buying virtual luxury gear for her virtual luxury self.) Many luxury-magazine editors and publishers have been arguing that luxury spending will continue, but in the last few months, ad pages have started to plummet. The ad pages for this issue were flat from the issue a year earlier, Mr. Kile said. Still, some say high-end magazines should remain focused on high-end readers even during a recession. “Diluting their franchise, in editorial and/or business terms, is both beastly difficult and often self-defeating,” said David Abrahamson, a professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.

Seeks Volunteers for Job Cuts at Magazines<date>Published: November 10, 2008</date><text>Editors on Monday asked for about 100 volunteers to give up editorial staff jobs at Time, People, Sports Illustrated and a few other Time Inc. magazines, and the company announced the elimination of a similar number of jobs in its business operations. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » The cuts are the first steps toward what Time Inc., the nation’s largest magazine publisher, has said will be the elimination of about 600 jobs worldwide, most of them at its 24 magazines in the United States. They apply to some of the biggest and most prominent publications in the business, underscoring the magazine industry’s steep financial decline this year. More layoffs are expected in the next few days. The company, a unit of Time Warner, said on Monday that it would eliminate 92 jobs in consumer marketing  the divisions that try to bolster sales of the magazines. The consumer marketing departments of individual magazines will be folded into a central operation. The call for volunteers to take a severance package applies to a relatively small part of the company’s work force: writers, editors, photographers and researchers at a handful of magazines who are represented by the Newspaper Guild. Those magazines include Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money. Terms of the severance were not disclosed. In memorandums to the magazine staffs, managers made it clear that if the number of volunteers was not sufficient by the end of this month, layoffs would follow. Executives also warned of additional layoffs in nonunion departments of those and other magazines. Hardest hit in the first round is the group that includes Sports Illustrated, Sports Illustrated Kids and Golf magazines. In a memorandum to his staff, Terry McDonell, managing editor of Sports Illustrated, asked for 40 people to leave voluntarily, out of an editorial staff at the magazine group of about 250 people. “Cost cutting is always painful, even if it can be justified by economic realities,” Mr. McDonell said in an e-mail message. Time magazine asked for 20 volunteers, out of about 250 news employees. People asked for 23, out of an editorial staff of more than 200, and it encouraged other employees to ask for severance, too, or volunteer to drop to a four-day workweek. Fortune and Money did not specify to employees how many volunteers they needed, but company executives said the goal was more than 20 people. Last week, Time Warner reported that in the third quarter, Time Inc. generated operating income of $162 million, down 35.5 percent from the quarter a year ago. Revenue was more than $1.1 billion, down 6.8 percent.

Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, declared that “our businesses have proved to be resilient” in the challenging environment. Both companies lowered their outlook for future quarters. But News Corporation reported a decline in profits for the recent quarter, while Time Warner’s net income was roughly equal to the same period last year, as growth at the company’s cable networks offset drops at AOL and the Time Inc. magazine publishing arm and the Warner Brothers film studio. In the last week, other big media companies have reported earnings, including CBS and Viacom, and virtually all have ratcheted down expectations based on the slumping economy, which has hit advertising particularly hard. The News Corporation, which owns Fox News Channel, the 20th Century Fox movie studio, the Fox broadcast network, The Wall Street Journal and many other newspapers in the United States, Britain and Australia, reported a 30 percent decline in net income, compared with same period last year. Net income in the quarter was $515 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $732 million, or 23 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue at the News Corporation was up 6.3 percent to $7.5 billion. The top performer at the company was its cable networks unit, which includes Fox News. Operating income in this segment was $379 million, up $90 million. At Fox News itself, operating income grew 27 percent. The company did not release a dollar figure, only the percentage gain. In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said, “I’m pleased that our cable group continues to perform extremely well,” but then acknowledged that “all media companies are being tested and the year ahead will be difficult.” The News Corporation’s movie studio had a rough quarter, reporting a $111 million decline in operating income because of a dearth of hit movies. At Time Warner the situation was a bit brighter, although the company still faces its long-running problem of how to revitalize AOL and Time Inc., its magazine publishing unit. Over all, Time Warner reported net income of $1.1 billion in the quarter, the same as last year. Revenue was also flat at about $11.7 billion. Time Warner’s businesses include the Warner Brothers movie studio, the pay-TV channel HBO, cable networks CNN, TBS and TNT, Time Inc. and AOL. Because of this variety, the company can be a bellwether for the advertising economy in general. Like the News Corporation, Time Warner’s cable networks performed well, and advertising revenue across the unit rose 9 percent. Over all, revenues for the company’s cable networks grew 7 percent to $2.7 billion. But at AOL and Time Inc. the advertising picture was starkly different. Time Inc., which includes magazines like Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated, had a decrease of 8 percent, or $51 million, in advertising revenue. Last week Time Inc. said it would streamline its structure and lay off about 600 people, or about 6 percent of its staff. On Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes described it as “the most comprehensive overhaul in Time Inc.’s history.” He said the overhaul would bring $150 million annual savings. Mr. Bewkes has been chief executive of Time Warner, once the world’s largest media company, for about a year. He said his strategy has been to focus on a handful of big content brands. “It illustrates the importance of having brands with scale,” he said. “People is the best example. More people read People each week than watched the finale of ‘American Idol.’ ” AOL, which Time Warner has been trying to shed in a deal, perhaps with Yahoo, had a decline in advertising revenue of 6 percent, or $33 million. This is particularly disheartening for the company, as it suggest that online advertising is also in retreat. Time Warner shares dropped 68 cents, or 6.3 percent, to close at $10.15. The News Corporation, whose earnings were released after the market close, dropped $1.06, or 9.7 percent, to close at $9.93. Shares in the News Corporation dropped $1.13 after the close.

Enlarge This Image Lars Klove for The New York Times The style unit would include Entertainment Weekly. The company outlined the overhaul on Tuesday evening in a memorandum to employees after The New York Times revealed the cuts on its Web site. The layoffs will begin in about two weeks. No magazines are scheduled to close, but some are likely to be severely cut back. Ann S. Moore, Time Inc.’s chairman and chief executive, was already planning an overhaul because of the upheavals in print media, but she was forced to speed up those efforts amid the financial crisis and looming recession. Time Inc.’s 24 magazines in the United States and their Web sites will be organized into three divisions: news, which will include Fortune, Money, Time and Sports Illustrated; lifestyle titles, which include Real Simple, Cottage Living, Coastal Living and Southern Living, among others; and style and entertainment, which includes People, InStyle and Entertainment Weekly, which has suffered a severe downturn and is likely to be whittled down under the new structure. Heads of the news and entertainment units will continue to report to John Huey, the editor in chief of Time Inc. The lifestyle unit, which may be run by Bill Shapiro, who has been development editor, will report to the business side of the company. Martha Nelson, who is editor of the People Group, will head the entertainment division. Ms. Moore declined to be interviewed, but in an article published in The Times of London a little more than two weeks ago she said, “I don’t know if there will be layoffs.” The company, a division of Time Warner, the media conglomerate that includes CNN, Turner Broadcasting, HBO, AOL and the Warner Brothers movie studio, is facing the twin perils of a shifting landscape from a severe downturn and a loss of readers and advertisers to the Web. Time Warner is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 5, and will announce how much savings it expects to wring from Time Inc. It may take a charge to its earnings to account for the revamping. Within Time Warner, where Jeffrey L. Bewkes is nearing his one-year anniversary as chief executive, Time Inc., while profitable, has been a lag on growth. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts in August, Mr. Bewkes said both AOL and Time Inc. “are tracking behind our expectations this year.” Executives said the reorganization was intended partly to allow Time Inc. to focus on its big brands  publications like Sports Illustrated, People, Time and Fortune  on platforms other than print. Examples executives cited were Sports Illustrated-branded kiosks that are popping up in airports and a music festival that was put on by Essence. Power within Time Inc., which through many mergers over the decades became the modern Time Warner, has long been diffuse, with individual publishers and editors essentially running their own shows. That distinct culture is coming to an end. Dawn Bridges, senior vice president for corporate communications at Time Inc., said that, in the future, “we’ll have a more centralized management structure that will group together titles that share similar audiences, advertisers and the talents and skills of their staffs.” The changes will lead to more sharing of writers between magazines within each new division, examples which have already been seen, including a cover story in Time in late September that was written by Andy Serwer, Fortune’s managing editor, and Allan Sloan, a columnist at Fortune. Even after previous cuts, the company still has 10,200 employees globally, with about 7,000 in the United States. (In addition to its well-known American publications, Time Inc. owns nearly 100 magazines abroad.) None of this has been enough to fight off the changes roiling the media industry. When Time Warner last reported earnings  on Aug. 6, for the second quarter that ended June 30  it reported a 6 percent, or $77 million, decline in revenue at Time Inc. to $1.2 billion. Operating income was $218 million, down 15 percent. In a separate announcement Tuesday, Time Inc. sent a memorandum to employees saying that Edward R. McCarrick, a 35-year veteran, would retire at the end of the year as worldwide publisher for Time magazine. David Carr contributed reporting.

Martha Nelson, who is editor of the People Group, will head the entertainment division. Ms. Moore declined to be interviewed, but in an article published in The Times of London a little more than two weeks ago she said, “I don’t know if there will be layoffs.” The company, a division of Time Warner, the media conglomerate that includes CNN, Turner Broadcasting, HBO, AOL and the Warner Brothers movie studio, is facing the twin perils of a shifting landscape from a severe downturn and a loss of readers and advertisers to the Web. Time Warner is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 5, and will announce how much savings it expects to wring from Time Inc. It may take a charge to its earnings to account for the revamping. Within Time Warner, where Jeffrey L. Bewkes is nearing his one-year anniversary as chief executive, Time Inc., while profitable, has been a lag on growth. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts in August, Mr. Bewkes said both AOL and Time Inc. “are tracking behind our expectations this year.” Executives said the reorganization was intended partly to allow Time Inc. to focus on its big brands  publications like Sports Illustrated, People, Time and Fortune  on platforms other than print. Examples executives cited were Sports Illustrated-branded kiosks that are popping up in airports and a music festival that was put on by Essence. Power within Time Inc., which through many mergers over the decades became the modern Time Warner, has long been diffuse, with individual publishers and editors essentially running their own shows. That distinct culture is coming to an end. Dawn Bridges, senior vice president for corporate communications at Time Inc., said that, in the future, “we’ll have a more centralized management structure that will group together titles that share similar audiences, advertisers and the talents and skills of their staffs.” The changes will lead to more sharing of writers between magazines within each new division, examples which have already been seen, including a cover story in Time in late September that was written by Andy Serwer, Fortune’s managing editor, and Allan Sloan, a columnist at Fortune. Even after previous cuts, the company still has 10,200 employees globally, with about 7,000 in the United States. (In addition to its well-known American publications, Time Inc. owns nearly 100 magazines abroad.) None of this has been enough to fight off the changes roiling the media industry. When Time Warner last reported earnings  on Aug. 6, for the second quarter that ended June 30  it reported a 6 percent, or $77 million, decline in revenue at Time Inc. to $1.2 billion. Operating income was $218 million, down 15 percent. In a separate announcement Tuesday, Time Inc. sent a memorandum to employees saying that Edward R. McCarrick, a 35-year veteran, would retire at the end of the year as worldwide publisher for Time magazine.

Now, they have company. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Wikreate, a San Francisco agency, gave a Celebrate the Crisis party where financial sections of newspapers were shredded. Dennys restaurants promotes its $4 Express Slam item. Purveyors of products that are unrelated to finance are getting into the act, placing advertisements that seek to take advantage of the attention the public is paying to Wall Street and the credit crisis. “Life hurts. Laughs help” is the theme of an online campaign for HBO Video, part of the HBO unit of Time Warner, which sells DVDs of comedy series like “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Flight of the Conchords.” The campaign cites several situations that require a sense of humor: “You just opened up a mutual fund. That falls more often than your toddler” and “Your 401(k). Now down to $4K.” The campaign is by Venables Bell &amp; Partners in San Francisco. The headline on magazine ads for cookware from the Crate &amp; Barrel retail chain takes a similar approach: “Oven-proof. Dishwasher-proof. 401(k)-proof.” Because the pots and pans are cast iron and enamel-clad, they are “a lasting investment,” the ads promise.  Brooks Brothers is running ads in newspapers that reprint a 1942 pitch about the retailer’s suits. “It pays to buy at Brooks Brothers,” the vintage ad said, because the most economical clothes “are those that are made to last.” “Just as our ad stated in the 1940s,” the current ad declares, “during these uncertain times, Brooks Brothers is still the investment you can trust.” Marketers outside the financial services industry have been running campaigns for several months that are inspired by the faltering economy. Those ads present products as smart buys because they offer value for money, but do not refer directly to why shoppers may be pinching pennies. The new ads, by contrast, invoke news headlines in a tactic that is known in marketing as borrowed interest, which hopes to gain attention by riding the coattails of important and topical events. For instance, television commercials from the Walt Disney Company, selling tickets for the Broadway musical “Mary Poppins,” feature members of the audience who make remarks like, “You think of everything going on in the world, and it just becomes magic” and “So well worth the money, and the uplifting of the spirit in these difficult times.” Newspaper ads for Equinox gyms, which carry the headline “Mind over madness,” urge consumers “in these changing times” to make “a renewed commitment to yourself to lead a healthy life.” And television commercials for the Denny’s restaurant chain, promoting the Weekday Express Slam  a $4 version of its signature menu item, the $5.99 Grand Slam breakfast  start off this way: “It’s one thing to bail out Wall Street. But who’s gonna bail you out?” The idea is that “Denny’s is telling its customers: ‘Hey, we get it. We’re going to give you a break,’ ” said Cori Zywotow Rice, president at Hill &amp; Knowlton/Samcor, the public relations agency for the Denny’s Corporation. “It is a war right now” in the breakfast category, Ms. Rice said, as fast-food chains like McDonald’s and Wendy’s try to take market share from Denny’s. So invoking something like the $700 billion bailout bill, she added, can be effective. The Denny’s spots are created by the Dallas office of Publicis Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe. Hill &amp; Knowlton/Samcor is the Coral Gables, Fla., office of Hill &amp; Knowlton, a unit of the WPP Group. Ads that play off the financial news can be risky, because the losses involved  of retirement nest eggs, money, jobs  are no laughing matter. “It’s a fine balance,” said Dean Crutchfield, a branding consultant in New York. On one hand, “people are having difficulty,” Mr. Crutchfield said, but on the other, “it’s too big an opportunity to miss.” The best approach is to “find out if it works with your target audience” before producing the campaign, “otherwise, it can blow up in your face.” One marketer, Volkswagen of America, has decided that referring to the economy in new ads inspired by current conditions  which will reintroduce a lease promotion called Sign Then Drive  would not fit with its brand image. “It would be inconsistent with the tonality” of Volkswagen ads, said Tim Ellis, vice president for marketing in Herndon, Va., which “take a ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ standpoint regardless of the economic climate  always optimistic and positive.” Volkswagen had planned to bring back the promotion in November, said Mark Barnes, chief operating officer, “but when we saw the, shall we say, exodus of leasing from the market, we saw an opportunity to bring it forward” to last Friday. Another marketer shying from mentioning the economy in economy-themed ads is Burger King, which has commercials with its King character playing Robin Hood: He puts money back into the pockets of customers who buy items from the B. K. Value Menu. The intent is to play down the problem and play up that “we have a solution,” said Rob Reilly, partner and co-executive creative director at the Burger King agency, Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Boulder, Colo., and Miami, part of MDC Partners. “The problem is out there every day,” Mr. Reilly said. “Do you really need to make a point of it?”  Some agencies are not as reluctant. The office of Taxi in Vancouver, British Columbia, created a make-believe stock market to promote an annual presentation of local advertising honors known as the Lotus Awards. Computer users can play an online game (lotusstockexchange.com) to guess who will win the awards on Nov. 13. “The idea is definitely timely,” said Paul Lavoie, chairman and chief creative officer of Taxi, referring to the campaign, produced by Michael Mayes, creative director at the Taxi Vancouver office. “And we thought it would offer a bit of lightness, a bit of an escape.” “If we’re in the business of making money, yes, it’s tough,” Mr. Lavoie said. “If we’re in the business of ideas, this is the best time for creativity ever.” An agency in San Francisco, Wikreate, even gave a “Celebrate the Crisis” party last Wednesday. Attendees were asked to shred the financial sections of newspapers and toss the scraps over their shoulders while shouting, “Crisis, schmisis!” “The crisis is part perception, part reality,” said Ezequiel Triviño, founder and president at Wikreate (pronounced “We create”). “If we are optimists, if we feel we can get out of the crisis, it will be less prevalent.” Besides, he added, laughing, the party was organized to “celebrate in the least-expensive way we can.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 15, 2008, on page B4 of the New York edition.FOR more than a year, banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms have been running campaigns that address the tumultuous economic conditions.

Time Warner Cable, the local provider, was preparing to impose limits on its new customers’ Internet use. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ben Sklar for The New York Times Richard Tallent, a software programmer from Beaumont, Tex., is against the nascent practice of measuring and billing for high broadband usage. Mr. Tallent, a programmer and photographer who frequently uploads large photographs, slipped in two days before the deadline. If he hadn’t, he would have had to pay $1 for every gigabyte he used over the limit. Time Warner offers plans with limits between 5 gigabytes and 40 gigabytes, amounts a spokesman estimated would cover 95 percent of their customers. What Time Warner is experimenting with in Beaumont may very well be the way phone companies and cable companies sell Internet service in the future. The company says it is not fair for average users to subsidize heavy users. The Federal Communications Commission recently voted to forbid Comcast to slow the service of its most voracious customers. (Comcast recently filed a lawsuit to reverse the F.C.C.’s judgment). Time Warner is testing another method to throttle the once-unlimited use of the Internet. Customers are reacting like patients whose doctor has put them on a strict diet. Some are looking for tools to restrain their Internet use; others are hoping to find another doctor with a more liberal attitude toward vanilla Swiss almond ice cream and prime rib. Some Internet service providers say they want to end their all-you-can-eat plans because a few customers with immense appetites for Web content are overwhelming the networks and slowing the delivery of news and entertainment for everyone else. Other providers blame pirates, who program their computers to crawl the Internet and suck down complete copies of CDs or DVDs. A few companies say that Internet networks are being clogged by legitimate video services like YouTube.com, Hulu.com and Apple’s iTunes, which use more bandwidth than the illicit file traders. Video files are singled out because they are typically thousands of times larger than text files. A minute of high-definition video is about 50 megabytes, about 10,000 times larger than an 800-word e-mail message. Heavy users of the Internet often resent being caricatured as slack-jawed couch potatoes stealing movies. They present themselves as Internet pioneers exploring the best new ways to watch video, telecommute or create remote backups of their data. Some say that citizens in some other countries routinely get much faster, unlimited service for lower prices. Alex Dudley, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable, says that most customers in the Beaumont experiment will not pay much more than they did under the old plan. But it is too early to draw any conclusions about usage patterns or retention rates, he said, adding, “We have not seen an impact on sales in Beaumont.” There are a number of useful tools anyone can use to track their consumption. BWMeter ($30 from desksoft.com) is useful for both diagnosing network problems and measuring consumption. It comes with an alarm that will sound when a limit is reached. Other metering tools include DU Meter (dumeter.com) for $25 and BitMeter II (codebox.no-ip.net) free. Owners of Apple computers might first try the Activity Monitor, a rudimentary tool that is part of the operating system. It tracks C.P.U. usage, memory consumption and network traffic. A more full-featured tool called Net Monitor is available from Guy Meyer, a software developer, for $12 at homepage.mac.com/rominar/net.html. Other tools offer more precision. The Firebug plug-in for the Firefox browser is normally used by programmers to diagnose problems with Web sites. It offers detailed measurements of all Web connections. It is available free at getfirebug.com. The accuracy of these tools is limited because the Internet was not initially intended to be metered. Alex Harper, the creator of MenuMeters, a tool from Raging Menace software (free at ragingmenace.com, though donations are requested), says that he has deliberately avoided tackling the problem of calculating the total amount of data consumed each month. His tool offers a working estimate of the data flowing in and out of a computer. But it won’t be perfect. Home networks are configured in a variety of ways, and the traffic in and out of a home uses different technical specifications, making truly accurate measurements difficult, he said. Data flowing through virtual private networks used to connect people who are working remotely to the office are not easy to measure exactly either. Mr. Harper said that a better location to count the packets of data was at the D.S.L. or cable modem itself or the router attached to it. All of the information entering a house flows through these boxes, making them ideal spots for measuring the data flow. Many high-end routers and others with custom programming offer a measuring feature, but most cheaper versions aimed at home customers don’t have it. Several open-source projects, like the OpenWrt (openwrt.org), provide a means for home users to get a measurement of traffic  if they aren’t afraid to reprogram their router. Some customers facing limits on Internet use are looking for some other Internet service providers. Brett Glass, the founder and owner of Lariat, a small wireless I.S.P. serving Laramie, Wyo., said his customers would not like to be surprised by a giant monthly bill. He said that some of the more than 4,000 other I.S.P.’s like his throughout the country would compete with the big providers by marketing different plans to different types of consumers. Lariat, for instance, sells what Mr. Glass calls business service, designed for heavy and continuous use. It has no prohibition on “peer-to-peer” software commonly used to download large files, which can hog bandwidth. He pointed to WISPdirectory.com as a good site for finding alternate I.S.P.’s. Mr. Tallent, the photographer, says that his choices in Beaumont are slim. Time Warner is the only provider he has found that offers the speeds he needs to run his business. He says he is afraid that the new bandwidth limits, if they are applied to him, will make it too expensive to move photos. Other applications might be hampered as well. Many antivirus software packages and operating systems, for example, check for security upgrades and download them automatically, which could lead to surprise bills. Also, more people are backing up important documents, photos, music and videos on remote computers, a service called “cloud computing.” Getting the documents into the cloud and back down on a PC might become expensive. Mr. Tallent thought about that as he weathered Tropical Storm Edouard and Hurricane Ike, which struck the Texas coast near Beaumont. He evacuated when Ike was nearing, but he forgot the paper copy of his insurance policy. Next time, he said, he’ll keep a digital copy in the cloud, along with favorite pictures. “There are online backup services, so if a hurricane comes and wipes us out, you can download all of your family photos,” he said.

More than 380 readers responded. The range of opinions about Time Warner's AOL, built up over a complex two-decade history, shows how difficult the challenge is for Bill Wilson, AOL's executive vice president for programming. By far the most common answer to the question was succinctly put by a user who called himself DonO: ''Inertia Rocks.'' He and many others have e-mail addresses at AOL.com that they do not want to change. ''I retain my AOL mail address because so many of my friends and mailing lists have it that it would be a pain to switch.'' There were certainly fans of various aspects of AOL's service, like the free virus protection software and parental controls. And there were others who still needed AOL for its global dial-up network, either because broadband was not available in their areas or because they needed it while traveling. But it is clear that AOL's brand faces significant challenges. The general scorn for the company was encapsulated by Cosmé McMoon, who wrote ''AOL = America's Oldest Luddites.'' It sounds like there are as many people regularly imploring their aging parents to give up using AOL as there are people asking them not to drive after dark. Even among satisfied users of the company's services, the name evokes compromises and stasis, a tough position for a technology company. AOL's remaining customers like it that way. J. C. MacKinnon summed up the box that Mr. Wilson finds himself in: ''I use AOL.com because I have always used it. Anytime AOL makes changes, it is annoying.''

But that has not stopped Abu Dhabi Media, flush with oil cash, from spreading even more money around the movie business. The company, which was created last year by the government of Abu Dhabi, is starting a new subsidiary that will spend about $1 billion more over the next five years making feature-length films in partnership with three American producers, said Edward Borgerding, the chief executive of Abu Dhabi Media Company. At the same time, the new company, called Imagenation Abu Dhabi, will manage Abu Dhabi Media’s side of the partnership with Warner Brothers. In addition to movies, Imagenation will also create shows and short films for the Internet. “We certainly want to be in that business and see how it works and take advantage of how the media world is evolving,” said Mr. Borgerding, who added that the company would announce its American partners during the Toronto Film Festival, which will run Thursday through Sept. 13. “There’s a lot of creative destruction going on.” The deal, to be announced Wednesday, comes amid a flurry of partnerships being created between Hollywood studios and outfits in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the U.A.E. But many of those have been aimed at creating studios, theme parks and multiplexes in the U.A.E., and in supporting Arab filmmakers. Direct investment in films is a little trickier: Abu Dhabi Media is controlled by the government, and media companies in the United States do not like to be seen making such deals. The new name, Imagenation Abu Dhabi, gives Warner and other film companies a more politically palatable name to put on promotional materials for jointly financed movies. Each of the three American production partners will open offices in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Borgerding said. While the focus will be on producing Hollywood-type films for English-speaking audiences, Mr. Borgerding said the company also would like to cater to the Arabic-language audience by making movies with Arab stars and Middle Eastern filmmakers. “We’re not just writing the checks,” Mr. Borgerding said of his partners. “These are people who will be matching us dollar for dollar.” While Hollywood was awash in hedge fund and private equity money a few years ago  both MGM and the Weinstein Company, the film company started by the brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, were recipients of private money  that flow of Wall Street cash has since slowed, though it has not stopped. Some hedge funds that invested in slates of films found themselves stung when movies flopped at the box office. Other funds have been hurt by the credit crisis. But entertainment executives, by and large, do not consider money from the oil-rich Middle East as a replacement for slowing hedge fund dollars. Because of cultural and religious issues, financing from the Middle East, especially those from a government used to controlling the media, is unlikely to come without restrictions. In a statement, Mohamed Khalaf al-Mazrouei, the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Media Company and director general of the Abu Dhabi Authority of Culture and Heritage, a government agency, said: “Abu Dhabi has established itself as a major player in the global economy, as evidenced through recent activity in the energy, real estate and transportation sectors. Media is no different, and Abu Dhabi Media Company is fulfilling its ambition to become a global player in the media industry.” Abu Dhabi is also becoming a cultural and media center in the region. Last year, Abu Dhabi Media started The National, an English-language broadsheet newspaper in Abu Dhabi edited by a former editor of The Daily Telegraph in Britain. The government has also enticed the Louvre and Guggenheim museums to establish outposts there. So why is now a good time to pump money into Hollywood? “Primarily because you are kind of buying in at the bottom of the cycle,” Mr. Borgerding said. “The subprime thing hit a lot of those hedge funds. There was a glut of films because a lot of money was chasing a finite amount of creative talent and good stories.” Mr. Borgerding, who grew up in Cleveland and now divides his time between Abu Dhabi, London and Los Angeles, said Imagenation would make six to eight movies a year, with budgets of $10 million to $50 million a film. “We’re not going to be making the Hollywood blockbuster type,” he said, which typically can have budgets of more than $100 million.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic But luckily for an industry that cares mostly about the money, higher ticket prices and a Batman sequel delivered near-record revenue to the major studios. For the crucial summer season, a period from the first weekend in May to Labor Day, when studios record about 40 percent of their annual box office revenue, domestic ticket sales totaled an estimated $4.2 billion, according to movie tracking firms. Despite attendance falling 4 percent (to 586.6 million moviegoers), according to Media by Numbers, that performance still surpassed last year’s $4.18 billion. Factoring in inflation, the summer of 2002 still holds the industry record with $4.63 billion. Studios in 2007 served up an unprecedented number of sequels and comic book-derived movies, both thought to be easy sells. This year’s crop had fewer such films, and the big-budget pictures that studios did deliver came with sizable risks. They consisted of B-list, or drunken, superheroes (“Iron Man” and “Hancock”), a TV show years distant from original episodes (“Sex and the City”) and an animated film with a 45-minute silent stretch (“Wall-E.”) There was also comedy gridlock with Ben Stiller, Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Eddie Murphy, Steve Carell, Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz all headlining different films. Yet nearly all of those movies landed on their feet, providing financial peace of mind for all of the big studios, except 20th Century Fox. “You’re always trying to put together new franchises, and this summer the industry was able to do just that,” said Brad Grey, the chairman of Paramount Pictures. “Iron Man,” a Marvel Studios film that was distributed by Paramount, is perhaps the strongest contender to become a megawatt franchise. The picture, starring Robert Downey Jr., has sold $317.5 million in tickets at North American theaters and more than $250 million overseas. The studios have already locked in April 30, 2010, for the sequel. Other summer entries that performed well enough to spawn sequels include Universal’s “Wanted,” about superhero assassins, and the DreamWorks Animation film “Kung Fu Panda.” Reading the box-office tea leaves for clues about consumer tastes or Hollywood currents is akin to pontificating about symbolism in works of fiction: any halfway plausible argument works. Indeed, veteran movie executives caution about reading too much into the success of any one film. “Sex and the City,” for instance, surprised Warner Brothers with a strong domestic take of $152.4 million, but does that mean Hollywood will start cranking out more female-oriented films? Probably not. One test comes on Sept. 12, when “The Women,” the long-gestating remake of George Cukor’s 1939 classic, reaches theaters. Even so, clear winners and losers emerged over the summer, with some strategies paying off and some Hollywood truisms receiving fresh corroboration. The movie business, for instance, remains highly volatile. The industry had huge flops and huge hits  sometimes at the same studio. Warner, part of Time Warner, was whipsawed between the crash of “Speed Racer” and the surprising success of “The Dark Knight,” a follow-up to “Batman Begins” in 2005. “Speed Racer,” a remake of the old television series, cost an estimated $250 million to produce and market but took in just $43.9 million at the domestic box office. Then “The Dark Knight” came along and cruised to a $504.7 million tally, enough to make it one of the biggest-selling movies of all time. (Warner also had the No. 1 comedy of the summer in “Get Smart.”) Paramount, part of Viacom, reaped huge profits by playing it safe: Most of its summer entries were financed by other production companies with Paramount acting as the distribution partner. The strategy allowed Paramount to limit its risk while focusing on big-budget bets for next summer, including “G.I. Joe,” a reboot of “Star Trek” and “Transformers 2” (the latter is a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks). The studio did suffer one of the biggest flops of the summer, however. “The Love Guru,” starring Mike Myers, sold $32.2 million in tickets  less than half of its cost. “I think that Mike is hilarious and deserves the chance to continue making pictures he believes in,” said Mr. Grey. “Not every movie is going to hit every time.” Universal’s summer was robust, with “The Incredible Hulk” financed by Marvel overcoming bad buzz to become a legitimate hit, and with the musical “Mamma Mia!” printing money, especially overseas. In addition to “Wanted,” the studio also squeezed a hit out of “Hellboy II: The Golden Army,” notable because Sony had passed on making a sequel. “The industry had a great summer because most studios made really satisfying and compelling movies,” said Adam Fogelson, Universal’s president for marketing and distribution. Other movie companies had a harder time. Sony hatched hits with “Hancock,” a Will Smith entry that sold $226.5 million in tickets at the domestic box office, and three modestly budgeted comedies, including Mr. Sandler’s “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan.” “Comedies, even R-rated ones, continue to perform very well,” said Rory Bruer, Sony’s president for distribution. “People want to laugh and escape.” Still, Sony suffered from comparisons with last summer, when it had juggernauts like “Spider-Man 3.” The same was true for the Walt Disney Company, which enjoyed a record summer last year because of the final “Pirates of the Caribbean” installment. This time around, Disney had “The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,” a substantial disappointment because its box office total of $141.6 million was less than half that generated by the first movie in the series. Fox, part of the News Corporation, struggled outright, having its longest losing streak in nearly a decade. The cost-conscious studio, long praised by analysts for its healthy profit margins, stumbled with “X-Files: I Want to Believe” and the disastrous “Meet Dave,” an Eddie Murphy vehicle. A Fox spokesman said some potential blockbusters in coming months should end the drought. Among Fox’s coming films are “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” a remake of the science fiction classic, and “X-Men Origins: Wolverine.” One question about next summer involves the potential impact of the industry’s recent three-month writers’ strike. Warner recently said the strike had affected its summer 2009 pipeline to such a degree that it was shifting the release of “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” from November of this year to July. But the other five major studios said there would be no slowdown in their release schedule. “There is very little evidence there will be a thinning out of the marketplace anytime before next fall,” Mr. Fogelson of Universal said. The 2008 summer season ended with a whimper this long weekend, as Hollywood dropped a smattering of weak movies into theaters, and executives turned their attention to the start of the awards season. The Vin Diesel action picture “Babylon A.D.” sold an estimated $12 million in tickets from Friday to Monday in North America, landing in second place, behind the holdover “Tropic Thunder,” which made $14.3 million ($86.6 million total). “Traitor,” a thriller starring Don Cheadle, sold about $11.5 million and came in third. “The Dark Knight” was fourth. “The House Bunny,” a low-budget comedy from Sony, rounded out the top five with $10.2 million ($29.8 million total.)

The channel, called Elections '08 On Demand, lets people watch videos whenever they want, much the way they can on YouTube or the Web sites of television networks. Depending on where they live, people can tune into the channel to see an infomercial for Barack Obama, coverage of the Democratic National Convention, or historical clips like Lyndon B. Johnson's ''Daisy'' ad. So far the nascent channel offers only about eight hours of programming. But the participating cable companies, many of which joined a consortium this year called Canoe Ventures, say this effort shows that they can work together well. Canoe Ventures is trying to make cable television a more attractive place for advertisers; Elections '08 is the first product it has worked on. The channel is available in 32 million households, primarily the ones served by the six partners of Canoe Ventures: Time Warner Cable, Comcast, Cablevision Systems, Charter Communications, Cox Communications and Bright House Networks. Most subscribers probably have not noticed it, because it is not particularly easy to find: On Time Warner, for example, it is Channel 1279; on Cablevision, Channel 500. Though Elections '08 has been available since January, only 500,000 segments have been viewed, said David Porter, vice president for marketing and new media at the Cox Media division of Cox Communications. And that is even after all the local markets of the participating cable companies pledged to run at least 100 spots a week promoting it. ''What we've accomplished with Elections '08 may not feel and sound like a huge success story to the layperson, but behind the curtain, we've laid the foundation for the cable operators working together in an unprecedented manner,'' Mr. Porter said. ''Trends now are causing us to stop and look at these individual cable operators to say, 'How can we compete in the world of the Internet?' '' Canoe Ventures aims to make cable a more desirable place for advertisers by standardizing the way ads are bought and measured, and the way that technology is used. It is also working on longer-term projects, like placing ads in on-demand content, asking viewers to vote or answer polling questions with their remote controls, and aiming television ads to specific households. Some media professors said that while this effort represented a step forward for the cable industry, it lagged behind the Web portals and TV networks that have already made plenty of similar -- and better -- content available online. ''If you are a high interest voter or an activist, you can find everything on YouTube, and it's very simple to do,'' said Tobe Berkovitz, the associate dean of the college of communication at Boston University. He adds that Mr. Obama's campaign in particular has been active in driving young voters to its Web site. Neither traffic nor advertising on the election channel has been particularly strong. Mr. Obama is the first major candidate to buy time on it, but only in 15 states; his seven-minute segment is running Aug. 18 through Sept. 3. Other than Mr. Obama, only a handful of local politicians -- and the Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens, who is promoting wind energy -- have bought ad time. Mr. Porter of Cox said he expected more interest as Election Day neared, adding that the sales team for the channel was trying to get Senator John McCain to advertise. The pitch to politicians is that they can have a longer time to talk to voters than during the standard 30-second TV spot. With the On Demand feature, the voters, in turn, can choose to watch the messages at their own convenience and on a big screen. Bill Perkins, who is handling media buying for Gov. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. of Indiana, the Republican incumbent, spent $10,000 for 30-minute segments to appear on the election channel in September and October in the Chicago market, which covers a few Indiana counties. ''It's an interesting experiment,'' he said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EFDD1238F934A2575BC0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=timewarnerinc">CORRECTION; Corrections<date>Published: August 17, 2008</date><text>An article last Sunday about the business strategy of Time Warner misstated the operating income of its film unit, which included Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema, for the 2007 fiscal year.

Meyer pulled a sheet of paper from the fax machine in his home office, inhaled deeply and held it up to the light of a nearby window. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Time Warner Revenue Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Damon Winter/The New York Times Time Warners new C.E.O., Jeff Bewkes, is pruning the media monolith, with a focus on content over distribution. The number on the fax was eye-popping: $66 million, plus change. Ka-ching. The opening-day box office receipts for the Batman film “The Dark Knight” had just set a record. And for myriad reasons  including the late Heath Ledger’s delicious turn as the Joker  the blockbuster is still filling theaters on a pace that may land it just behind “Titanic” on the list of all-time, top-grossing films. Mr. Meyer is the chairman of Warner Brothers, the Hollywood studio behind “The Dark Knight,” and the film has had its debut at a transformative moment for his studio’s parent, Time Warner. In an effort to focus more sharply on “content creation” (or what nonsuits still like to call movies and television shows), Jeffrey L. Bewkes, who became chief executive of Time Warner in January, is whittling down the company’s many branches. It’s a makeover that will unravel about two decades’ worth of mergers that created the company in its current form, putting its trophy studio, Warner Brothers  as well as the ups and downs of moviemaking  more directly in Wall Street’s glare. Time Warner, initially the amalgam of the old Warner studio and the Time Inc. magazine empire, grew to include Turner Broadcasting, America Online, a cable company and such prized cable channels as HBO. Some analysts have had a hard time embracing this goliath as it has grown into the world’s biggest media company. So, it turns out, have some of its executives. “It’s always been frustrating that as well as we do, it becomes a blip on the screen,” says Mr. Meyer of Warner’s contribution to Time Warner’s overall bottom line. “We joke that we could have the greatest year in history, and if AOL misses its advertising target by one-tenth of a percentage point, that would be the headline.” Up or down, Warner’s performance will stand out much more starkly in the years ahead because the days of Time Warner being all things to all media are gone. For now, Mr. Bewkes is staking the company’s future on three big content providers: Warner Brothers, Turner Broadcasting (which includes TNT, TBS and CNN) and HBO. To ramp things up on the entertainment front, he’s also been overseeing internal discussions about acquisitions in film and television  including a possible takeover of NBC Universal, should its parent, General Electric, decide to sell, according to executives and bankers who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of the discussions. Elsewhere in the company, it’s all about downsizing. Time Warner’s cable operation is being spun off, eviscerating the once-popular corporate notion peddled by business consultants and merger specialists that content and distribution should reside under one roof. Mr. Bewkes is also looking to sell AOL or, more likely, find a partner like Yahoo or Microsoft to take it off his hands, leaving Time Warner with a small stake in the online company. It is less clear how the Time Inc. unit, which publishes magazines like Time, People, In Style, Fortune and Sports Illustrated, meshes with Mr. Bewkes’s strategy. According to Time Warner insiders, the company is likely to shrink the publishing unit to just a handful of the most profitable titles. Some analysts predict that Time Warner might try to sell the publishing unit en masse, but only if market conditions improve. What is clear is that Mr. Bewkes is tethering his fortunes to companies that are juggernauts in their respective industries and are sprawling, global brands. They also represent the antithesis of the notion that content for the masses is passé, and that popular culture has devolved into narrow niches and user-generated fare like video clips of bulldogs riding skateboards. Get ready then, says Mr. Bewkes, for global fireworks. “Around the world, the consumption of entertainment products is growing rapidly,” he says. “The question is how do you offer it, and how do you get paid for it?” THE troika that Mr. Bewkes prizes faces distinct challenges. HBO is under constant pressure to remain a cultural tastemaker by finding new fare to replace hits like “The Sopranos” and “Sex and the City,” while Turner Broadcasting’s cable stable is susceptible to the vagaries of advertising and viewers who are increasingly watching video online. For its part, Warner has to produce movies and television shows at a time when it is harder  though not impossible (see “The Dark Knight”)  to attract large audiences. This is compounded by the fact that the industry’s engine of growth, DVD sales, has slowed to a near standstill.

Meyer pulled a sheet of paper from the fax machine in his home office, inhaled deeply and held it up to the light of a nearby window. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Time Warner Revenue Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Damon Winter/The New York Times Time Warners new C.E.O., Jeff Bewkes, is pruning the media monolith, with a focus on content over distribution. The number on the fax was eye-popping: $66 million, plus change. Ka-ching. The opening-day box office receipts for the Batman film “The Dark Knight” had just set a record. And for myriad reasons  including the late Heath Ledger’s delicious turn as the Joker  the blockbuster is still filling theaters on a pace that may land it just behind “Titanic” on the list of all-time, top-grossing films. Mr. Meyer is the chairman of Warner Brothers, the Hollywood studio behind “The Dark Knight,” and the film has had its debut at a transformative moment for his studio’s parent, Time Warner. In an effort to focus more sharply on “content creation” (or what nonsuits still like to call movies and television shows), Jeffrey L. Bewkes, who became chief executive of Time Warner in January, is whittling down the company’s many branches. It’s a makeover that will unravel about two decades’ worth of mergers that created the company in its current form, putting its trophy studio, Warner Brothers  as well as the ups and downs of moviemaking  more directly in Wall Street’s glare. Time Warner, initially the amalgam of the old Warner studio and the Time Inc. magazine empire, grew to include Turner Broadcasting, America Online, a cable company and such prized cable channels as HBO. Some analysts have had a hard time embracing this goliath as it has grown into the world’s biggest media company. So, it turns out, have some of its executives. “It’s always been frustrating that as well as we do, it becomes a blip on the screen,” says Mr. Meyer of Warner’s contribution to Time Warner’s overall bottom line. “We joke that we could have the greatest year in history, and if AOL misses its advertising target by one-tenth of a percentage point, that would be the headline.” Up or down, Warner’s performance will stand out much more starkly in the years ahead because the days of Time Warner being all things to all media are gone. For now, Mr. Bewkes is staking the company’s future on three big content providers: Warner Brothers, Turner Broadcasting (which includes TNT, TBS and CNN) and HBO. To ramp things up on the entertainment front, he’s also been overseeing internal discussions about acquisitions in film and television  including a possible takeover of NBC Universal, should its parent, General Electric, decide to sell, according to executives and bankers who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of the discussions. Elsewhere in the company, it’s all about downsizing. Time Warner’s cable operation is being spun off, eviscerating the once-popular corporate notion peddled by business consultants and merger specialists that content and distribution should reside under one roof. Mr. Bewkes is also looking to sell AOL or, more likely, find a partner like Yahoo or Microsoft to take it off his hands, leaving Time Warner with a small stake in the online company. It is less clear how the Time Inc. unit, which publishes magazines like Time, People, In Style, Fortune and Sports Illustrated, meshes with Mr. Bewkes’s strategy. According to Time Warner insiders, the company is likely to shrink the publishing unit to just a handful of the most profitable titles. Some analysts predict that Time Warner might try to sell the publishing unit en masse, but only if market conditions improve. What is clear is that Mr. Bewkes is tethering his fortunes to companies that are juggernauts in their respective industries and are sprawling, global brands. They also represent the antithesis of the notion that content for the masses is passé, and that popular culture has devolved into narrow niches and user-generated fare like video clips of bulldogs riding skateboards. Get ready then, says Mr. Bewkes, for global fireworks. “Around the world, the consumption of entertainment products is growing rapidly,” he says. “The question is how do you offer it, and how do you get paid for it?” THE troika that Mr. Bewkes prizes faces distinct challenges. HBO is under constant pressure to remain a cultural tastemaker by finding new fare to replace hits like “The Sopranos” and “Sex and the City,” while Turner Broadcasting’s cable stable is susceptible to the vagaries of advertising and viewers who are increasingly watching video online. For its part, Warner has to produce movies and television shows at a time when it is harder  though not impossible (see “The Dark Knight”)  to attract large audiences. This is compounded by the fact that the industry’s engine of growth, DVD sales, has slowed to a near standstill. (Warner executives are quick to point out that DVD sales haven’t fallen off the cliff, however, as some analysts had predicted.) Mr. Bewkes describes Time Warner’s new raison d’être as “dominating niches with a clear brand strategy.” “HBO today means ‘Entourage,’ ‘Big Love,’ ‘Flight of the Conchords’ and the coming ‘True Blood,’ ” he says. “There are 10 subniches below the brand.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Cablevision Systems Corp Time Warner Inc Go to your Portfolio » The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York said Monday that the so-called network DVR, which records programs on a faraway computer rather than on the device itself, does not violate copyright law. The ruling, a turning point in a two-year legal battle, represented a major victory for Cablevision, which wants to offer network DVR services through its existing set-top boxes. It also dealt a significant blow to the media companies that had sued to stop the technology, which include Turner Broadcasting and the major TV networks. For most consumers, the decision does not make much difference. If Cablevision ultimately builds out the system it has in mind, it will simply make it easier for Cablevision customers who do not own DVRs to get recording capabilities through their cable boxes. In May 2006, when Turner Broadcasting filed the initial copyright infringement suit, DVRs were in 1 out of 14 homes with televisions in the United States. The technology has rapidly gained household share, and is now present in one in four homes. The growing prevalence of the technology has made Cablevision’s initial ambitions seem slightly less threatening and radical. The Turner suit was joined by 20th Century Fox, CBS, ABC, NBC, and other plaintiffs. They jointly alleged that the network DVR technology violated copyright laws by storing television recordings on a central server. In March 2007, a lower court agreed with the media companies, saying that use of the technology “would be engaging in unauthorized reproductions and transmissions” of copyrighted content. But Cablevision appealed, and Monday’s ruling by John M. Walker Jr., a Second Circuit judge, declared that the technology “would not directly infringe” on the media companies’ rights. The media companies will now consider appealing to the United States Supreme Court. “We respectfully disagree and are considering the appropriate next steps in this matter,” James Anderson, a spokesman for Turner, said in a statement. Network DVRs could add recording functionality to the tens of millions of digital set-top boxes in living rooms and bedrooms across the country, and only a simple software upgrade would be needed. Tom Rutledge, Cablevision’s chief operating officer, called the decision a “transformative opportunity” for the cable industry. “We can now provide high-quality DVR capabilities to almost all of our customers in a very short period of time,” he said. “It changes cable’s competitive posture against satellite; it makes the services less expensive to provide; and it makes it easier to upgrade the services.” Most DVRs, popularized by TiVo, rely on an internal hard drive to record television episodes. They enable users to play back programming and fast-forward past ads. The network DVRs developed by Cablevision have the same capabilities but without the hard drive. Instead, they record the programs on the cable operator’s centralized servers, saving money and avoiding the trouble of installation. “Cablevision has been innovative here, and I think other cable companies will follow them,” said Tom Eagan, a senior media analyst at Collins Stewart. (Comcast and Time Warner, which are the country’s two largest cable providers and potential beneficiaries, declined to comment.) Cablevision says it has not yet determined whether it will introduce the network DVR service to its 3.1 million cable customers. But Craig E. Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said the ruling could have “seismic implications across the media landscape.” “In short order, effective DVR penetration could now jump to north of 60 percent of cable households (that is, all digital cable subscribers),” Mr. Moffett wrote in a report. “That means a huge increase in the number of viewing hours per day potentially subject to ad-skipping.” Network DVRs also prop open the door to new methods of advertising. Cablevision could insert ads dynamically, customizing and updating commercial pods for different consumers and at different times. “It allows advertisers to do things they can’t do on a physical DVR,” Mr. Rutledge said. “Let’s say you record an episode of ‘Lost.’ Three months later you want to play it back. The advertising that was on ‘Lost’ is stale and no longer applies, but the capability to refresh the advertising exists if the content owner wants to do that with the cable operator.” Given the two-year dispute, though, it is hard to imagine the major media companies hurrying to sign up. In court, the media companies argued that network DVRs were tantamount to video-on-demand, and that they should receive license fees for the recording. Cablevision and the appeals court disagreed. The company noted that each user would record programs on his or her own individual server space, making it a DVR that, as Mr. Moffett put it, has a “very long cord.” More Articles in Business »RECORDING TV shows  and skipping the commercials that come with them  may become more pervasive in the wake of a new court ruling that blesses a new networked form of digital video recorder.

Under a July 21 deal with the dissident shareholder Carl C.

Mr. Miller had been added to the list at the suggestion of Yahoo, and his selection was considered likely. Time Warner’s decision surprised Yahoo and Mr. Miller, as both had been given indications by Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, that the company would not object to his joining the Yahoo board, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were considered confidential. But a Time Warner spokesman, Edward I. Adler, said Friday that Mr. Bewkes “never gave the green light” to a waiver of Mr. Miller’s noncompete agreement. Mr. Miller declined to comment. A person close to Yahoo said the company was now likely to appoint two directors from Mr. Icahn’s original list by Aug. 15. The Los Angeles Times first reported that Mr. Miller would probably not join the Yahoo board. Mr. Miller, who is a partner at Velocity Interactive Group, an investment company, was pushed out of AOL in 2006, and his relationship with some AOL executives has been strained since then. His appointment to the Yahoo board could have put him back across the negotiating table from some of those executives. Yahoo has explored the possibility of a merger with AOL as an alternative to Microsoft’s Jan. 31 offer to purchase Yahoo, or later, its search business. The conversations are continuing, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. News of Time Warner’s decision to block Mr. Miller’s appointment came as Yahoo was conducting its much-anticipated annual shareholder meeting in San Jose. In a ballroom that was two-thirds empty, about 150 shareholders heard Yahoo’s chairman, Roy Bostock, give a spirited defense of his company’s dealings with Microsoft. Mr. Bostock said Microsoft, not Yahoo, was to blame for the failure of the companies to reach an agreement. In a statement, Microsoft responded, “Yahoo is attempting to rewrite history.” Many Yahoo shareholders remain angry that the company did not sell to Microsoft, which in May offered $47.5 billion, or $33 a share, for Yahoo. Yahoo shares closed at $19.80 on Friday, near a four-year low. In a sign of their dissatisfaction, investors controlling 22 percent of shares represented at the meeting voted against the re-election of a Yahoo director, Arthur Kern. Mr. Bostock received a 20.5 percent “no” vote, and Jerry Yang, the chief executive officer, a 14.6 percent “no” vote.

Perelman’s 57-acre East Hampton estate the Creeks, Vivi Nevo was in his element. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Gluekit Add to Portfolio Time Warner Inc Goldman Sachs Group Incorporated Yahoo Inc Microsoft Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Matthew Staver/Bloomberg News Vivi Nevo, center, with Susan Decker, president of Yahoo, and Chris Schroeder, HealthCentral Network chief, at the 2007 Allen media conference. Mr. Nevo, with his fiancée, the megawatt Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi (the star of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), sitting on his lap, watched Jon Bon Jovi give an impromptu performance before taking a turn on the dance floor to Dave Mason’s “Feelin’ Alright.” A wind-up doll of kinetic energy, who bounds about like a shortstop, Mr. Nevo, who is 43, is said to be the largest individual shareholder of Time Warner, was once the largest private investor in Goldman Sachs, is engaged to China’s most famous actress, vacations on Rupert Murdoch’s sailboat, is the godfather of Lachlan Murdoch’s son, counts Lenny Kravitz as a good friend and attended Madonna’s wedding in 2000. And many people, including even some of his close friends, a few of whom joined him at Mr. Perelman’s estate over the Fourth of July  and spoke about the party anonymously because it was a private event  have no idea what his background is or how exactly he made his fortune. Twenty years or so ago, Vivi Nevo, his first name a nickname for Aviv, was living in a studio apartment in the Concorde building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Today he is the media industry’s Zelig, often referred to among his media friends as “the international man of mystery.” “He is everywhere, all the time, like no one I have ever seen,” said Graydon Carter, the editor in chief of Vanity Fair, which frequently hosts Mr. Nevo at its high society parties. Who is Mr. Nevo? An Israeli who took a modest inheritance from his family and parlayed it into a sizable fortune through savvy investing, much of it in media and Internet companies  and into connections in the media world. Behind the scenes, his influence on the media industry is subtle. For upstart Internet companies, he has been an important broker of relationships with traditional firms; and for Time Warner, in particular, he was an advocate, when the Yahoo takeover battle erupted, of trying to assemble a three-way partnership among Yahoo, Microsoft’s MSN and Time Warner’s AOL. Of all the characters the media business attracts  and creates, for that matter  perhaps no one is more remarked upon, wondered about or marveled at than Mr. Nevo. Among his many overlapping circles of friends, nearly all say that Mr. Nevo is a force in their lives: a loyal friend, a trusted conveyor and keeper of information and someone who never forgets a birthday or a bar mitzvah. “He’s someone I’ve really liked,” said John J. Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, who met Mr. Nevo several years ago while he was at the helm of Credit Suisse. “I trust him. He’s got great instincts for the business.” Gordon Crawford, senior vice president and a director of Capital Research and Management and one of the best-known media investors, met Mr. Nevo around 10 years ago and the two became close. This month they flew together to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the investment bank Allen &amp; Company’s annual media conference. “I don’t know anyone who’s worked harder at developing contacts,” Mr. Crawford said. “It’s definitely more than social. I think he’s a pretty astute observer of what’s going on in the media.” Mr. Nevo has an uncanny ability to network and a knack for putting himself in the right place at the right time. In the spring of 1999, John Thornton, who was then president of Goldman Sachs, was in Los Angeles for the bank’s road show before it went public, and after giving a presentation, he sat down. “The guy sitting next to me was Vivi Nevo, and we just started talking and developed a nice rapport right then.” Later, Mr. Thornton became an adviser to Time Warner. “So I dealt with him a lot there,” Mr. Thornton recalled. “He was very active in talking with management. I can’t think of anyone who is principally a private investor who is that focused on one industry.” Mr. Nevo’s discretion, combined with a lack of a paper trail, equates to a constant chirping of questions in the media industry about his back story. “He’s a great character, so that draws attention to him,” said Lachlan Murdoch, explaining the growing fascination that people in the media business have about Mr. Nevo. “He’s also a very private individual. “When I moved back to Australia”  after leaving the News Corporation, where his father is chairman, in 2005  “we spoke a lot. He’s been a friend through thick and thin.” Those who knew Mr. Nevo in the 1980s, after he moved to New York from Israel, have watched his rise with curiosity. “You’re asking questions I’ve asked myself many times,” said Nicolas Rachline, who met Mr. Nevo in the late 1980s when both were part of a fashionable New York expatriate crowd that hung out at Le Bilboquet, a French restaurant on the Upper East Side. “What the hell does Vivi do? He seems to be a powerful player in the entertainment industry. How, I don’t know.” 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Over the Fourth of July weekend at the billionaire Ronald O. Perelman’s 57-acre East Hampton estate the Creeks, Vivi Nevo was in his element.

Mr. Nevo, with his fiancée, the megawatt Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi (the star of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), sitting on his lap, watched Jon Bon Jovi give an impromptu performance before taking a turn on the dance floor to Dave Mason’s “Feelin’ Alright.” A wind-up doll of kinetic energy, who bounds about like a shortstop, Mr. Nevo, who is 43, is said to be the largest individual shareholder of Time Warner, was once the largest private investor in Goldman Sachs, is engaged to China’s most famous actress, vacations on Rupert Murdoch’s sailboat, is the godfather of Lachlan Murdoch’s son, counts Lenny Kravitz as a good friend and attended Madonna’s wedding in 2000. And many people, including even some of his close friends, a few of whom joined him at Mr. Perelman’s estate over the Fourth of July  and spoke about the party anonymously because it was a private event  have no idea what his background is or how exactly he made his fortune. Twenty years or so ago, Vivi Nevo, his first name a nickname for Aviv, was living in a studio apartment in the Concorde building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Today he is the media industry’s Zelig, often referred to among his media friends as “the international man of mystery.” “He is everywhere, all the time, like no one I have ever seen,” said Graydon Carter, the editor in chief of Vanity Fair, which frequently hosts Mr. Nevo at its high society parties. Who is Mr. Nevo? An Israeli who took a modest inheritance from his family and parlayed it into a sizable fortune through savvy investing, much of it in media and Internet companies  and into connections in the media world. Behind the scenes, his influence on the media industry is subtle. For upstart Internet companies, he has been an important broker of relationships with traditional firms; and for Time Warner, in particular, he was an advocate, when the Yahoo takeover battle erupted, of trying to assemble a three-way partnership among Yahoo, Microsoft’s MSN and Time Warner’s AOL. Of all the characters the media business attracts  and creates, for that matter  perhaps no one is more remarked upon, wondered about or marveled at than Mr. Nevo. Among his many overlapping circles of friends, nearly all say that Mr. Nevo is a force in their lives: a loyal friend, a trusted conveyor and keeper of information and someone who never forgets a birthday or a bar mitzvah. “He’s someone I’ve really liked,” said John J. Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, who met Mr. Nevo several years ago while he was at the helm of Credit Suisse. “I trust him. He’s got great instincts for the business.” Gordon Crawford, senior vice president and a director of Capital Research and Management and one of the best-known media investors, met Mr. Nevo around 10 years ago and the two became close. This month they flew together to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the investment bank Allen &amp; Company’s annual media conference. “I don’t know anyone who’s worked harder at developing contacts,” Mr. Crawford said. “It’s definitely more than social. I think he’s a pretty astute observer of what’s going on in the media.” Mr. Nevo has an uncanny ability to network and a knack for putting himself in the right place at the right time. In the spring of 1999, John Thornton, who was then president of Goldman Sachs, was in Los Angeles for the bank’s road show before it went public, and after giving a presentation, he sat down. “The guy sitting next to me was Vivi Nevo, and we just started talking and developed a nice rapport right then.” Later, Mr. Thornton became an adviser to Time Warner. “So I dealt with him a lot there,” Mr. Thornton recalled. “He was very active in talking with management.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Microsoft Corporation Times Topics: Yahoo! Inc. There have been on-again, off-again deal talks among the three companies all year. And in recent days, Time Warner has signaled a renewed interest in a possible transaction, according to executives at all three companies who have been briefed on the discussions. Both Microsoft and Yahoo continue to listen to ideas from Time Warner, the executives said, but neither company appeared to be especially interested at this point. Microsoft and Yahoo seem to be focused on their talks with each other, which have run hot and cold since Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to buy Yahoo. On Aug. 1, Yahoo shareholders will have the chance to vote on a slate of directors proposed by the activist investor Carl C. Icahn, who would like to replace Yahoo’s management and sell the company, or parts of it, to Microsoft. Richard Greenfield, an analyst who covers Time Warner for Pali Capital, said it seemed unlikely that any deal for AOL would be struck before the Yahoo shareholder vote. “I don’t see why anyone would make a move now with all the pieces on the chess board where they are,” he said. He added that Time Warner was in a difficult spot because the value of AOL was declining. Its main business of selling graphical display ads is under pricing pressure. And its brand has such a “toxic” connotation with consumers, Mr. Greenfield says, that the company does not use the AOL name when it starts new Web sites. But Yahoo and Microsoft also face significant problems. “I’m not sure a combination of any of them solves it,” he said.

The acquisition may be completed in a matter of days. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Chris Rank/Bloomberg News Jon Rowe, a meteorologist in the Atlanta studios of the Weather Channel. Time Warner ended its bid for the channel Friday. An NBC spokesman, Cory Shields, said the consortium, made up of NBC Universal and two private equity firms, the Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, had been “selected to participate” in the negotiations with Landmark Communications, which put the channel up for sale in January. The NBC group’s bid amounts to more than $3 billion, according to an executive close to the transaction, down significantly from the $5 billion that Landmark had hoped to receive. Another executive said Time Warner withdrew from the bidding on Friday morning because of concerns about the price. The executives declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the negotiations. Time Warner, which owns CNN and other news and information outlets, had shown interest in the Weather Channel’s Web site and other assets but had told Wall Street it would exercise “price discipline” in the bidding. The Weather Channel is the leading brand of weather information on television, reaching 95 million households. If NBC completes the acquisition, it is likely to merge the channel with its own start-up venture, the NBC Weather Plus Network. The four-year-old service, a joint venture of NBC and its local affiliates, is a 24-hour digital cable network and Web site. It has not yet turned a profit and is perceived as faltering. Within NBC, weather is viewed as a critical component of the company’s news and information brand. Steve Capus, the president of NBC News, said that NBC Weather Plus meteorologists already appear frequently on the network’s news programs. In a recent interview, Mr. Capus declined to speculate about how Weather Plus might mesh with the Weather Channel. “We were in the weather business yesterday, we’re in the weather business today, and we’re going to be in the weather business tomorrow,” he said.

Ripp, the newly appointed chief financial officer of America Online, faxed a letter to the Las Vegas offices of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen with disturbing news: it appeared that an AOL business partner, and Arthur Andersen client, had forged a signature on a contract and booked several million dollars of sham revenue. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Stephen M. Case, left, of AOL, and Gerald M. Levin, of Time Warner, before announcing a deal to merge. AOL, via Bloomberg News Joseph A. Ripp helped uncover fraudulent transactions between AOL and two partners. That letter set off a chain of events that culminated in the accounting scandal that followed Time Warner’s merger with AOL, including huge fines and criminal convictions. Mr. Ripp, a longtime finance executive at Time Warner who had been sent to AOL’s Dulles, Va., headquarters to oversee the accounting operations there, was called one of the “white hats” in the whole affair by the Justice Department. But three weeks ago, on May 19, the Securities and Exchange Commission, after nearly six years of investigating accounting at AOL, filed a civil lawsuit against eight former executives alleging financial fraud. Seven were AOL executives before the merger; the eighth was Mr. Ripp. Through his lawyer, Mr. Ripp declined to comment. But many of his old colleagues at Time Warner said they were flabbergasted by the turn of events. “I think it’s fair to say that everyone at Time Inc. is completely shocked by this. Joe Ripp is as far from being a crook as anyone you’ll ever know,” said John Huey, the editor in chief of Time Inc., who also described the complaint as “almost Kafkaesque.” Gerald M. Levin, the former chief executive of Time Warner, said of Mr. Ripp, “This is precisely the type of guy you’d want to manage your financial group.” Mr. Ripp’s journey from whistle-blower to defendant is another example of the long shadow cast by the AOL-Time Warner merger, now widely regarded as one of the most disastrous corporate marriages in history. It is also a cautionary tale for corporate executives who may illuminate fraudulent conduct to one government agency but then find themselves a target of another. “This is one of the huge challenges any corporate executive faces when the federal government comes after you,” said C. Evan Stewart, a securities lawyer at Zuckerman Spaeder in Manhattan and a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and Fordham Law School. “You face this whipsaw from different competing government agencies.” How did Mr. Ripp, who successfully minded the finances of Time Inc. for 25 years and has been lauded by Justice lawyers as a pivotal figure in exposing criminal fraud at AOL, wind up in the cross hairs of the S.E.C.? The S.E.C. claims Mr. Ripp “knowingly or recklessly engineered, oversaw and executed a scheme to artificially and materially inflate the company’s reported online advertising revenue.” The S.E.C.’s complaint highlighted several well-scrutinized AOL advertising deals, most prominently a $400 million one with the German media giant Bertelsmann. That deal resulted in a Time Warner restatement of earnings in 2005 and S.E.C. wrist slaps for three executives, who were allowed to keep their jobs. Scott W. Friestad, an associate director in the S.E.C.’s division of enforcement, said Mr. Ripp “wasn’t the architect or the originator of the conduct.” “He came to the party later than the others,” Mr. Friestad said. But, he added, “We don’t view Mr. Ripp as an innocent bystander.” At Time Inc., Mr. Ripp had a reputation for being cautious when confronted with accounting questions. He was not even aware of Time Warner’s talks with AOL leading up to the deal. “He was the type of C.F.O. that annoyed people because he was so prissy,” Mr. Huey said. Mr. Huey’s predecessor, Norman Pearlstine, now the chief content officer at Bloomberg L.P., said, “any allegations of fraud are inconsistent with the man I knew at Time Inc.” On Jan. 7, 2000, Mr. Levin assembled his top executives to inform them of the merger deal. Nina Munk, the author of “Fools Rush In,” a book on the deal, wrote of that meeting: “Joe Ripp, the company’s chief financial officer, was numb. Levin hadn’t consulted him! A no-nonsense numbers man, Ripp had devoted his entire career to Time Inc. and then Time Warner.” After a long career tending to the books at Time Inc.  he began working with the publishing house in 1975 as an accountant at Ernst &amp; Young  and its parent, Time Warner, Mr. Ripp found himself out of a job after the Time Warner-AOL merger because AOL’s chief financial officer took on that role with the parent company. He had four years left on his contract with Time Warner. He could have simply collected a nice sum and just gone fishing. Instead he went to AOL at the urging of his bosses. “Joe was sent in to make sure they had the kind of financial talent on the management team they needed,” recalled Don Logan, the former chief executive of Time Inc., who was once Mr. Ripp’s boss. 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in Business »On May 14, 2001, Joseph A.

Night Shyamalan work on The Happening. In 2000, he was on a conference call with executives from Walt Disney Studios discussing “Unbreakable,” the follow-up to his phenomenally successful movie “The Sixth Sense.” He wanted to market “Unbreakable” as a comic-book movie  the tale of an unlikely superhero  but Disney executives insisted on portraying it as a spooky thriller, like “The Sixth Sense.” “I remember the moment that it happened, exactly where I was sitting at the table, the speakerphone,” he recalled in an interview from his office in a converted farmhouse near Philadelphia. “That moment may have been the biggest mistake that I have to undo over 10 years so the little old lady doesn’t go, ‘Oh, he’s the guy who makes the scary movies with a twist.’ ” Eight years later, movie audiences still know Mr. Shyamalan as the guy who makes scary movies with a twist. He also has not been able to undo his reputation in Hollywood as a talented filmmaker who will not play by studio rules. After the success of “The Sixth Sense,” he criticized Disney executives, dared to compare his talent to Steven Spielberg’s and Alfred Hitchcock’s and has steadfastly asserted his reputation as an outsider by refusing to move from Philadelphia to Hollywood. His outsider persona continued to work for him, so long as the films “The Sixth Sense,” “Unbreakable” and “Signs” continued to make money. But when his films started to falter at the box office  his last movie, “Lady in the Water,” was drubbed by critics and ignored by moviegoers  the Hollywood establishment’s support began to wane. That failure has put considerable pressure on his new film, “The Happening,” an R-rated horror movie for Fox that opens on June 13. Another failure would harm the Shyamalan name and make it difficult for him to keep full control over his films. But Mr. Shyamalan, who says he has become press shy, offers no apologies and believes that some of the criticism about him was largely based on his refusal to accept Hollywood norms. “I have two options: conform to the paths that have been laid out prior to me or deal with it,” he said emphatically. “So which one do you suggest I do? I wouldn’t be where I am now if I hadn’t denied those conventions to begin with.” His career illustrates one of the stubborn paradoxes of Hollywood: the film industry loves the myth of the auteur, the rugged individual filmmaker who plays by his own rules, until faced with the reality. Around the time that “The Sixth Sense” was released, this was a particularly potent idea, as studios tried to build brands around star directors like Quentin Tarantino and the Wachowski brothers (who made “The Matrix”), hoping their names would sell movies the way Hitchcock’s once did. But the studios also need to heed the brutal realities of the movie business. All of these directors have had high-profile stumbles that suggest moviegoers care more about what is on the screen than what is above the title. And unlike animated brands like Shrek, real-life characters like Mr. Shyamalan can prove difficult to work with. “It never really worked,” argues David Weitzner, the former head of worldwide marketing for Universal and an adjunct professor at the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. “It’s pomposity on the part of studios to think that the public is going to respond to an advertising message that says to see the film because it’s from the director of another film. It’s stupid and to some degree, it’s fueled by ego.” Even given their limited success with marketing brands, studio marketing departments continue to use the method to sell films. “They’re marketing anything they can find to market because we’re living in a time where it’s so competitive and difficult,” said Michael Taylor, chairman of the film and television production division at the School of Cinematic Arts. Mr. Shyamalan, who will get his name above the title for “The Happening,” still believes that a director’s name on the marquee  one that is not Steven Spielberg’s  can sell a blockbuster as easily as a star’s can. “The problem is the assumption that if I am selling the movie  because I’m selling me  that I’m being egotistical. If Will Smith did the same thing, it would be perceived very differently,” he said. “You’re supposed to be hidden if you’re a director. That’s a rule that who said in the movie business?” Born in India, Mr. Shyamalan was raised in suburban Philadelphia by his parents, both doctors who knew little about the film industry. He attended the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, then made two commercially unsuccessful films, “Praying With Anger” (1992) and “Wide Awake” (1998), before selling his screenplay for “The Sixth Sense” to Disney for $3 million. The movie, made for about $40 million, grossed more than $600 million worldwide. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »M.

And unlike animated brands like Shrek, real-life characters like Mr. Shyamalan can prove difficult to work with. “It never really worked,” argues David Weitzner, the former head of worldwide marketing for Universal and an adjunct professor at the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. “It’s pomposity on the part of studios to think that the public is going to respond to an advertising message that says to see the film because it’s from the director of another film. It’s stupid and to some degree, it’s fueled by ego.” Even given their limited success with marketing brands, studio marketing departments continue to use the method to sell films. “They’re marketing anything they can find to market because we’re living in a time where it’s so competitive and difficult,” said Michael Taylor, chairman of the film and television production division at the School of Cinematic Arts. Mr. Shyamalan, who will get his name above the title for “The Happening,” still believes that a director’s name on the marquee  one that is not Steven Spielberg’s  can sell a blockbuster as easily as a star’s can. “The problem is the assumption that if I am selling the movie  because I’m selling me  that I’m being egotistical. If Will Smith did the same thing, it would be perceived very differently,” he said. “You’re supposed to be hidden if you’re a director. That’s a rule that who said in the movie business?” Born in India, Mr. Shyamalan was raised in suburban Philadelphia by his parents, both doctors who knew little about the film industry. He attended the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, then made two commercially unsuccessful films, “Praying With Anger” (1992) and “Wide Awake” (1998), before selling his screenplay for “The Sixth Sense” to Disney for $3 million. The movie, made for about $40 million, grossed more than $600 million worldwide. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/technology/24cable.html?ref=timewarnerinc">Cable Prices Keep Rising, and Customers Keep Paying<date>Published: May 24, 2008</date><text>Americans discouraged by higher gas prices and airline fares may decide to spend more vacation time at home, perhaps watching television.

But that, too, will cost them more than ever. Cable prices have risen 77 percent since 1996, roughly double the rate of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this month. Cable customers, who typically pay at least $60 a month, watch only a fraction of what they pay for  on average, a mere 13 percent of the 118 channels available to them. And the number of subscribers keeps growing. The resiliency of cable is all the more remarkable because the Internet was supposed to change all things digital. Technology has led to more choices and lower prices for news and music as well as cellphone and landline minutes  not to mention computers, cameras, music players and phones themselves. Yet here is a rare instance where Silicon Valley has failed to break a traditional media juggernaut. And not for lack of trying. Technology companies keep insisting they will provide new low-cost ways to get video into the home, but so far their efforts have created more black boxes to stash under the TV, not real competition for cable that could bring prices down. “A couple of years ago, there was a thesis that we were at the twilight of Comcast as the gatekeeper,” said Craig Moffett, a cable industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “That thesis still titillates some. But technologically and economically, it’s probably not going to happen.” So why hasn’t technology had a bigger impact? One answer is the alliance between cable companies and Hollywood producers of content to sell channels in bundles, rather than letting consumers pay only for the channels they want. The producers of cable television content share $15 billion to $20 billion a year in fees from cable subscribers, roughly equal to the $20 billion they receive in advertising revenue, Mr. Moffett said. Without those fees, the cable companies say, prices would go up. “If each channel depended on individual consumers electing to pay individually for it, this would slash potential viewership and seriously hurt the ability of most channels to attract their current level of advertising dollars,” said Jenni Moyer, a spokeswoman for Comcast. “Lost ad revenue would have to be replaced by higher license fees.” The industry says the digital era has brought its customers better image quality, more on-demand services and solid value through packages that combine cable, phone and Internet service. It also says consumers are actually getting more viewing value for their dollar, at least relative to inflation. The National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association says that from 1998 to 2006, the price consumers paid for each viewing hour was essentially flat. The chief economist of the Federal Communications Commission, Gregory S. Crawford, disagrees, saying the industry is not factoring in the real cost of the programming that subscribers are watching. By his analysis, the increase has been around 50 percent from 1997 to 2005. The F.C.C. and some politicians have been in a pitched battled with the cable industry, trying to get it voluntarily to offer so-called à la carte pricing. But cable companies insist that this is not economically feasible. Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview that since 1996, when Congress increased competition in telecommunications, prices have dropped for many other services. “We’ve seen the opposite occur in the cable industry,” he said. “The dramatic increases in pricing we’ve seen are one of the most troubling issues from a consumer point of view.” In 2007, average monthly revenue for each Cablevision subscriber was $75, up from $65 in 2005, according to SNL Kagan, a research company. At Time Warner it was $64, up from $54.50. The cable industry has never felt the pricing pressures the music industry is feeling. The most obvious reason is that Internet speeds have not been fast enough to permit easy downloading of movies and other video material. That is changing, though. People are viewing millions of videos online each month  albeit mostly short video clips, and not Hollywood movies. At the same time, the use of file-sharing tools like BitTorrent to download illegally popular movies and television shows is growing. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology »Americans discouraged by higher gas prices and airline fares may decide to spend more vacation time at home, perhaps watching television.
