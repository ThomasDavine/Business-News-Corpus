Based on those study findings, the F.D.A. rejected that higher-dose formulation, known as Amplify, citing concern about cancer risks. But in presenting data at the conference on Thursday, Dr. Eugene J. Carragee of Stanford University said that not all the findings of a Medtronic-sponsored clinical trial had been made public before. The trial results showed a significantly higher number of cancers in the study group that received Amplify when compared to a control group that received a bone graft as part of a spinal fusion, he said. Dr. Carragee added that the Amplify study findings had potential implications for patients who received Infuse, because both products contained the same active ingredient, a bioengineered bone growth protein known as rhBMP-2. In a telephone interview, Dr. Carragee said that doctors often administered Infuse off-label at levels significantly above the recommended dosages, ones that approach or exceed the amount of rhBMP-2 found in a dose of Amplify. “This information requires careful consideration because of the large number of patients receiving high doses” of Infuse, he said, adding that he was particularly concerned about its use in certain patients like smokers or those with genetic factors that put them at higher risk for cancer. Dr. Carragee and researchers detailed the study at a meeting in Chicago of the North American Spine Society, a professional organization. It showed that three years after surgery, there were 20 cancers in the Amplify group versus five cases in the bone graft group. Cancers take many years to develop, so the data might indicate that the bone growth protein plays a role in promoting cancer rather than causing it. Medtronic’s Infuse had already been at the center of a debate between Dr. Carragee and the drug’s supporters. In June, a medical publication that Dr. Carragee edits, The Spine Journal, released a special issue containing articles that challenged earlier published research backing the widespread use of Infuse. The researchers involved in the Medtronic-sponsored studies defended their findings. In response to that publication, Medtronic gave a $2.5 million grant in August to Yale University to conduct an independent review of all study data that examined the safety and effectiveness of Infuse. That report is not expected to be completed until some time next year. Asked for comment on Dr. Carragee’s presentation Thursday, a Medtronic spokeswoman, Marybeth Thoorsgard, released a statement stating that “the results from the independent reviews being managed by Yale will address the safety and effectiveness” of Infuse.

In June, a medical journal charged that researchers sponsored by Medtronic had generated misleading studies about the product, called Infuse, that overstated its benefits and asserted that it did not pose risks. Infuse is a bioengineered material used primarily in spinal fusions, a procedure in which vertebrae are joined to reduce back pain. Industry analysts have speculated that sales of Infuse have dropped since the periodical, The Spine Journal, published its special issue on the product. Experts said that Medtronic’s action was the first time that a medical device maker would turn over the underlying and detailed patient data from company-sponsored studies to independent experts so that they could review it and draw their own conclusions. Typically, companies release only summaries of that information, a practice that can hamstring the ability of experts to examine it. Infuse has been used in about a quarter of the estimated 432,000 spinal fusions performed in the United States each year. When The Spine Journal special issue first appeared, the company announced that it would respond to the publication’s assertions by conducting a review of all Infuse-related study information. Under the plan announced Friday, Yale will use the $2.5 million provided by Medtronic to assemble of panel of outside experts, who will then commission two academically recognized research organizations to review the company’s study data. Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, who will oversee the effort, said that Medtronic’s decision was groundbreaking because it would allow independent researchers to assess the underlying data supporting a product’s safety and effectiveness. “Published data is often missing critical information,” Dr. Krumholz said. Dr. Eugene Carragee, editor of The Spine Journal, said he was pleased that Medtronic officials had decided to release the data. The plan will give access to the study data to other researchers along with the groups Yale retains. Dr. Carragee, a professor at Stanford, said that he remained concerned that little study data exists for one major use of Infuse, a type of spinal fusion, because a study of that application was halted early when patients suffered complications. Still, he added Medtronic’s decision was “a big step in the right direction”. Side effects associated with Infuse include infection, bone loss, unwanted bone growth and male sterility. A stronger version of Infuse called Amplify, was recently rejected for approval by the Food and Drug because of concerns about possible cancer risks. Along with the recent issue of The Spine Journal, the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation of Medtronic’s marketing of the product and a Senate committee is also conducting an inquiry.

In a series of reports published in a medical journal on Tuesday, the specialists called the research misleading and biased.The repudiation, appearing in a full issue of The Spine Journal devoted to the topic, represents a watershed in the long-running debate over conflicts of interest for the sponsorship of scientific studies by makers of drugs and medical devices. It is extremely rare for researchers to publicly chastise colleagues, and editors of leading medical journals said they could not recall an instance in which a publication had dedicated an entire issue for such a singular purpose. Medtronic, the nation’s biggest maker of medical devices, has been facing intensifying scrutiny over its promotion of Infuse, the bone growth product at the center of the controversy. The bioengineered material is used primarily in spinal fusions, a procedure in which spinal vertebrae are joined to reduce back pain. Infuse is used in about a quarter of the estimated 432,000 spinal fusions performed in this country each year. The articles published on Tuesday charge that researchers with financial ties to Medtronic overstated Infuse’s benefits and vastly understated its risks by claiming there were none. “It harms patients to have biased and corrupted research published,” five doctors wrote in a joint editorial that accompanied the reports. “It harms patients to have unaccountable special interests permeate medical research.” “The spine care field is currently at a precarious intersection of professionalism, morality and public safety,” Dr. Christopher M. Bono, editor of the special edition, said in a statement. “As physicians and journal editors, we felt an obligation to present a thorough examination of this controversial issue.” It is too early to predict how the articles will affect the financial fortunes of Medtronic, which earned an estimated $900 million from Infuse in its most recent fiscal year. But the potential consequences seem significant, and the company’s new chief executive, Omar Ishrak, decided to issue a statement in response. Mr. Ishrak noted that the articles did not challenge the data Medtronic had submitted to the Food and Drug Administration that led to Infuse’s approval in 2002 for use in one type of spinal fusion. Separately, other company officials said Medtronic planned to retain independent experts to examine the issues raised by the publication. “Integrity and patient safety are my highest priorities,” Mr. Ishrak said. Medtronic officials acknowledged in interviews that it was common for them to review studies of its products before publication. However, they sought to distance themselves from the content of the published reports, and said outside researchers, not the company, had determined the significance of data and how it should be presented. At the heart of the issue are potential side effects related to Infuse’s use that emerged during patient studies conducted about a decade ago by outside researchers with significant financial ties to Medtronic. Medtronic, as required, reported that data to the F.D.A., and the agency considered the rate of those complications significant enough in some cases to require the company to list them on Infuse’s label. But in reporting on such studies in 13 medical journal articles published during the last decade, researchers whose studies were paid for by Medtronic maintained that Infuse’s use was not tied to any complications. In one article released Tuesday, experts said those reports played down Infuse’s risks and slanted them to favor Infuse’s performance over a bone graft, the material traditionally used in a fusion. Those experts estimated that the incidence of adverse events in connection with Infuse’s use ranged from 10 to 50 percent, depending on how it was used. Those side effects, they said, include male sterility, infection, bone loss and unwanted bone growth. A stronger version of Infuse, called Amplify, was recently rejected for approval by the F.D.A. because of concerns about possible cancer risks. In 2008, the agency warned the public that it had received reports of life-threatening injuries associated with the use of Infuse in the cervical portion of the spine, a use that was not approved by the agency. Dr. Eugene J. Carragee, editor of The Spine Journal, said he believed that Infuse was a valuable product for patients who were not candidates for a bone graft. But he added that the publication had undertaken the review because he and other experts hoped to cleanse the scientific record. 1 2 Next Page »In an extraordinary move, a group of spine specialists are publicly repudiating the research of other experts that has backed the widespread use of a Medtronic bone growth product.

Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote to Omar Ishrak, Medtronic’s recently named chairman and chief executive, seeking extensive documents related to its bone-growth product, Infuse. “Reports that doctors conducting medical trials while on Medtronic’s payroll may have hidden serious side effects for patients are deeply troubling,” Senator Baucus said in a statement. “We need to do everything we can to ensure companies aren’t concealing serious medical complications from patients just to increase profits,” he added. Medtronic, in a statement late Tuesday, said it would respond to the senators’ request. The company did not comment specifically on the accusations of unreported complications and financial bias in research, but said it routinely reported all adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration “irrespective of any financial relationship between the company and the clinical investigator or study author.” Marybeth Thorsgaard, a spokeswoman for Medtronic, said three specific complications listed in the letter — abnormal bone growth, swelling in the neck and throat, and a form of sterility — were all listed as side-effect warnings on the Infuse product label. The senators’ query was prompted in part by a forthcoming spinal journal article saying some of the 13 Medtronic-sponsored studies of Infuse had failed to properly disclose complications. The Justice Department has been investigating the marketing of Infuse, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings by Medtronic since late 2008, and to people who have been contacted more recently by federal investigators. And in May, Senator Baucus wrote to the company to ask why it had canceled contracts with Novation, a group-purchasing organization. The senator said he was concerned that patients or hospitals could end up paying more for Medtronic products. Senate staff is reviewing Medtronic’s confidential reply. The senators set a July 11 deadline for Medtronic to respond, saying that they wanted the company to furnish “all documents and communications” with researchers, medical journals, the F.D.A., advisory board members and other Medtronic consultants, concerning adverse events or complications from the product. Infuse is a bioengineered protein used instead of real bone in many graft operations. The F.D.A. has warned of serious problems for some spinal surgery patients. Infuse, approved by the F.D.A. for limited purposes in 2002, is widely used for broader purposes, as doctors are allowed to do. Medtronic had $15.9 billion in sales and $3.1 billion in profit last year.

That finding is in stark contrast to earlier research by doctors paid by Medtronic, who found no connection between the product, Infuse, and a condition that causes sterility.Infuse is a bioengineered bone growth protein that has been widely used in spinal fusion procedures since 2002. The Infuse label notes the sterility-related complication as a possible side effect, but the Medtronic-sponsored researchers in published reports attributed that complication to surgical technique, not the product itself. The Stanford surgeon, Dr. Eugene J. Carragee, found that men treated with Infuse developed a condition that causes temporary or permanent sterility at a far higher rate than men who received a bone graft, another material that is used to fuse spinal vertebrae. He urged doctors to counsel men about Infuse’s risks. The study was posted Wednesday on the Web site of The Spine Journal, which he edits. “It is important that men who are considering having children have the opportunity to weigh the risks of the various available procedures,” said Dr. Carragee, who based his study on 240 patients he treated several years ago with Infuse or a bone graft. The type of spinal fusion at issue is known as an anterior lumbar fusion, a procedure performed on about 80,000 patients a year in this country. Infuse is used in about half of those procedures, and men make up about half of the patients who undergo spinal fusions. The sterility complication at issue in Dr. Carragee’s study affects only men, not women. Among the 69 patients treated by Dr. Carragee who received Infuse, five men developed the complication related to sterility, in contrast to one patient among the 174 men who received a bone graft. The condition resolved itself in half of those six patients. Two surgeons who were involved in the original Infuse trial defended their findings in statements, saying that not enough men had experienced sterility-related complications in their study to statistically link the problem to Infuse. The surgeons, Dr. J. Kenneth Burkus and Dr. Thomas A. Zdeblick, noted the complication in a medical journal article published soon after Infuse was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002, but they divided those patients by the surgical technique used, not by whether or not the men had received Infuse. In his Web article, Dr. Carragee questioned why the researchers had not broken out the patients in their study between those who had received Infuse and those who had not, a method that he said was a standard way to present clinical trial results. In an e-mail, Dr. Zdeblick said Dr. Carragee’s study was of limited value because it reflected the results of a retrospective look at patients rather than a clinical trial. Such reports “are notorious for being misleading,” he wrote. The new study is likely to intensify a debate over whether industry-financed researchers present study findings in ways that favor the interests of corporate sponsors. Dr. Burkus, who practices in Columbus, Ga., and Dr. Zdeblick, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, have each received millions of dollars from Medtronic in consulting fees or royalty payments. Both men have adamantly insisted that those financial relationships have not affected their scientific judgment. Nevertheless, in a commentary accompanying the new study, Dr. James D. Kang of the University of Pittsburgh wrote that industry support was one way to explain the different conclusions reached by Dr. Carragee and the Medtronic-sponsored researchers. “There does not seem to be any rational explanation for these observational differences,” Dr. Kang wrote. Dr. Dan M. Spengler, a professor and former chairman of orthopedic surgery at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved with the study, said it added to growing evidence about various risks from Infuse. “It’s just startling to me,” he said. Marybeth Thorsgaard, a spokeswoman for Medtronic, based in Minneapolis, said the company believed that it had provided the F.D.A. and doctors with all available medical information about Infuse. Analysts have estimated that sales of Infuse reached about $900 million in Medtronic’s most recent fiscal year; overall company sales hit $16 billion during that period. “You have to consider the totality of the data that has been presented, not how one study was reported,” said Ms. Thorsgaard. Dr. Carragee’s report is not the first time doctors have challenged how Medtronic-sponsored researchers characterized the risks of Infuse in medical articles. Since 2006, an orthopedic surgeon in Croatia, Dr. Tomislav Smoljanovic, has written more than 35 letters to medical journals questioning the claims. In their 2002 report, Dr. Burkus and Dr. Zdeblick reported that a major clinical study involving Infuse had found no adverse effects with the product, including the sterility-related complication. Among other things, Dr. Smoljanovic and colleagues pointed out in letters that the Medtronic-sponsored researchers, while identifying that six men in their study had developed the sterility-related complication, had not identified how many of those men had received Infuse as opposed to a bone graft. Last year, Dr. Burkus and his colleagues publicly disclosed in response to the Croatian physicians’ letters that five of the six men affected in their study had received Infuse. However, they have insisted that the figure was not statistically significant to link the problem with Infuse. Dr. Carragee, the Stanford surgeon, said his Infuse study was prompted by a complaint he received from Dr. Smoljanovic about an Infuse-related article in The Spine Journal. Dr. Carragee said he and his colleagues had posted their study online, ahead of the publication’s print edition, because of the public health implications of the findings. He said that forthcoming edition of The Spine Journal would be dedicated to complications involving bioengineered bone growth products like Infuse.A surgeon at Stanford University, in a study released Wednesday, suggests that one of Medtronic’s best-selling spinal products poses a risk of male sterility.

An agency review of clinical studies raised questions about a higher rate of cancers in patients treated with the new product, which is called Amplify, compared with those who did not get it. Meanwhile, a long-running investigation by the Justice Department into the marketing of Infuse is apparently widening. In recent years, a number of physicians were contacted by prosecutors in connection with that inquiry, but just a few weeks ago, another doctor said he had also been contacted by Justice Department officials. He asked not to be identified because the inquiry is under way. Prosecutors have also sought records from United States Army researchers involved in studies of Infuse, a bioengineered bone growth product that has also been used to treat severely wounded American soldiers, according to people who have been contacted as part of the inquiry. Medtronic has said it plans to discuss the rejection of Amplify with regulators to try to allay their concerns, and the company has not been charged with any wrongdoing in the criminal inquiry. But the developments could pose significant future problems for Medtronic, a medical device giant whose other products include heart pacemakers and defibrillators. A Wall Street analyst, Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo Securities, said Infuse accounts for the vast majority of Medtronic’s sales of biologic products, which he projected would reach $897 million in the company’s current fiscal year. Mr. Biegelsen said the continuing federal investigation of Infuse, along with the F.D.A.’s rejection of Amplify, could lead to a slowdown of Infuse sales over the next year. He estimated that off-label use by doctors of the bone-growth protein made up 70 to 80 percent of Infuse sales. The extent of the federal criminal inquiry involving Infuse is not clear. But the doctor who was recently contacted by Justice Department officials also said that it was his understanding that prosecutors had contacted other physicians in recent months. One military surgeon testified before a federal grand jury in Boston investigating the Infuse issue about a year ago, said people with knowledge of the inquiry who also requested anonymity because it was continuing. Army officials have also provided the Justice Department with the results of a military investigation into the experimental use of Infuse on dozens of soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, said Col. Norvell V. Coots, commander of the Walter Reed Health Care System. The Army’s 2008 report on that investigation found that a former military doctor, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, had overstated Infuse’s benefit in a medical journal study that examined its use in the treatment of solders whose shin bones had been severely shattered by explosive devices in Iraq. Dr. Kuklo, who became a Medtronic consultant, also forged the signatures of that study’s co-authors in a journal submittal, the Army said. Medtronic later broke its ties to him, and the medical journal that published the article retracted it. Medtronic has previously disclosed both the existence of a federal inquiry into its marketing of Infuse as well as the Justice Department’s interest into research it underwrote at Walter Reed. In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, the company released a statement noting its previous disclosures. It declined to say whether federal officials were examining specific issues like company-sponsored research. “Medtronic does not comment on what precise topics the government may or may not be examining at any point in the investigation,” the company said. Henry J. Dane, who represented Dr. Kuklo in the Walter Reed investigation, said the Justice Department had subpoenaed the doctor’s records. Mr. Dane said he understood that prosecutors had also sought records from academic researchers and doctors outside the military who worked on other studies about Infuse that had been financed by Medtronic. “He’s far from the only one,” to get a subpoena, said Mr. Dane, referring to Dr. Kuklo. Mr. Dane said that a lawyer in Boston, Thomas C. Frongillo, has represented Dr. Kuklo and other physicians contacted by the Justice Department in the Infuse investigation. Reached by telephone, Mr. Frongillo declined comment. Several academic researchers involved in Medtronic-financed studies about Infuse did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Boston, Christina DiIorio-Sterling, cited Justice Department policy in declining to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Infuse for a certain type of spinal fusion procedure, in which problem spinal vertebrae are joined in an effort to stop severe back pain. Doctors are free to use an approved product in any way they choose, and many surgeons began using Infuse for other types of spinal fusion operations. Some of the doctors who performed research studies into such so-called off-label uses of Infuse received millions of dollars in consulting fees from Medtronic, Congressional investigations have found. In 2008, the F.D.A. issued a warning about the use of bone-growth proteins like Infuse in one off-label fusion procedure used to treat neck pain, citing reports of life-threatening injuries.One of Medtronic’s most profitable divisions — selling bone growth products used in spinal fusion procedures — faces growing pressure amid a widening criminal investigation into the company’s marketing of one product and a rejection by federal regulators of another one.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/25/medtronic-bypasses-a-hospital-group-buyer/?ref=medtronicinc">Medtronic Bypasses a Hospital Group Buyer<date>February 25, 2011, 5:53 pm</date><text>Medtronic could save more than $40 million a year through its decision to cancel five group-purchasing contracts worth $2 billion and to negotiate prices directly with hospitals instead, Bernstein Research said in an investor note on Friday. Whether the hospitals are happy with the move remains to be seen. Novation, the spurned middleman that held the contracts, is certainly unhappy. Sixteen large hospitals have written Medtronic to express “extreme disappointment,” the group purchasing organization Novation said in a statement Thursday announcing the cancellations. Novation said thousands of hospitals could end up paying higher prices, and would struggle to compare medical devices because of Medtronic pricing confidentiality clauses. “This move will likely raise costs for member organizations by eliminating the price protection that members benefit from through Novation’s national agreements,” Pete Allen, senior vice president of sourcing operations at Novation, said in a statement. The hospitals’ letter, dated Feb. 16 and released by Novation on Friday, added, “Neither the health care community nor the country as a whole can afford the type of disruption and increased cost that your decision will have on our facilities.” But Medtronic said it already had direct relationships with those hospitals and wanted to save money by cutting out the middleman. Medtronic, in a statement issued Friday, emphasized “health care reform and economic uncertainty” as reasons to do more direct selling. “This analysis has led us to cancel five of our Novation agreements, which we believe will ultimately take costs out of the health care system,” the company said. “Medtronic expects there to be no disruption in our day-to-day business operations with our hospital customers, as the vast majority of our contracts are already negotiated at the local level.” A Medtronic spokesman declined any further comment. The company’s stock rose just under 1 percent on Friday. Medtronic, based in Fridley, Minn., is one of the world’s largest medical device makers with 2010 sales of $15.8 billion and profits of $3.1 billion. Novation, in Irving, Tex., bills itself as the hospital industry’s leading supply contracting company. It is owned by VHA Inc. and the University HealthSystem Consortium and was founded in 1998 as more hospitals sought group purchasing. Derrick Sung, a health care analyst with Bernstein Research, said the move would save Medtronic $40 million to $60 million a year through the cancellation of a 2 to 3 percent administrative fee charged by Novation – money that could be passed back as hospital savings if necessary to keep its customers. But he left no doubt that the change benefited the device maker more than the hospitals, “MDT’s bold move could represent a positive shift in bargaining power away from the hospitals and back to the device manufacturers,” Mr. Sung wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Medtronic still has other contracts in place with other group purchasing organizations, Mr. Sung added. The Medtronic contracts with Novation represented about 5 percent of Novation’s estimated $40 billion in annual business. Other device makers could also turn against group purchasing organizations in the pricing tug of war. Mr. Rose said Medtronic’s decision showed there were limits to how much purchasing organizations could squeeze their suppliers.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/health/28device.html?ref=medtronicinc">New Questions Raised About a Medtronic Device<date>Published: December 27, 2010</date><text>Two senators are raising new questions about an experimental use of a Medtronic device in spinal surgery on veterans and soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center from 2002 to 2004.Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee’s ranking Republican, wrote the commanding general of Walter Reed on Dec. 17 to ask about safeguards in a study by three Army surgeons. Senator Grassley’s office provided the letter to The New York Times. The senators asked what the Army was doing to investigate certain back surgeries at Walter Reed and whether patients had been told they were receiving devices for uses not cleared by the Food and Drug Administration. They also asked how Army protocols could ensure proper review of medical tests involving soldiers and veterans. The surgeons, who have received money from Medtronic, had implanted and written about a Medtronic device called Hydrosorb Mesh, which contained a bone-growth material called Infuse. Hydrosorb was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for nonweight-bearing purposes but not for spines, the senators wrote. Doctors are free to use F.D.A.-approved medical devices for any purpose they see fit, but in this case, Army officials said the surgeons should have sought permission for the study. The Army doctors had implanted Hydrosorb Mesh in spinal fusion procedures for 35 patients in an 18-month period, according to a study published in the journal Neurosurgical Focus in 2004. The study covered 22 patients, including 15 active duty soldiers, to determine whether the bio-absorbable Hydrosorb was possibly preferable to similar titanium mesh. The study concluded, in glowing terms, that Hydrosorb might be “ideally suited” to spinal use. Medtronic has also made payments for consultancy or other services to the three doctors — Timothy R. Kuklo, Michael K. Rosner and David W. Polly Jr., all then with Walter Reed. Six years after the implants, however, Hydrosorb has still not been approved for that use. The senators expressed safety concerns. Mr. Baucus said in a statement, “Safety must come first, especially for America’s men and women in uniform, and putting soldiers’ health at risk is an unacceptable price to pay for medical advancements. This case raises serious questions about whether men and women in uniform always receive the best care — questions that need answers.” Col. Norvell V. Coots, commander of the Walter Reed Healthcare System, said last week that he would respond to the senators by Jan. 14 with assurances of improved controls over research and publication. Walter Reed plans no further action, he added, although investigators have concluded the doctors violated Army rules by failing to seek or receive permission to conduct research or publish the article. Walter Reed has located 15 of the patients who had received the experimental back surgery, he said, and found all had been appropriate candidates for back surgery and were doing well. “We never put our patients at risk,” he said. Medtronic, based in Fridley, Minn., is one of the world’s largest medical device makers with sales of $15.7 billion in the year ended Oct. 29. Marybeth Thorsgaard, a company spokeswoman, said Medtronic supported Walter Reed research through a grant to a foundation. Dr. Kuklo, a West Point graduate, was found by Army investigators in 2008 to have fabricated signatures of co-authors of another journal article on a different Medtronic product and presented data that did not match hospital records, though he contests the data charge. He left the Army in 2006. Medtronic has disclosed it had paid Dr. Kuklo $823,339 from 2001 until early 2009, when the company suspended his consultancy. Dr. Kuklo’s lawyer, Henry J. Dane, said Army doctors did not need to obtain permission for studies of fewer than 10 patients. The review of Hydrosorb cases included three doctors writing about 22 patients, he said, an average of seven each. Colonel Coots, however, said that is an incorrect reading of the rule. Mr. Dane also said Dr. Kuklo was a dedicated researcher whose work improved treatment for soldiers with severe injuries. Colonel Coots praised Dr. Kuklo as a good surgeon but said he did not obtain the required permission for some research. The issue was first raised in September 2009 by Dr. Charles D. Rosen, a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of California, Irvine. In a letter to the Army surgeon general, Dr. Rosen asked whether soldiers receiving the implants had been given informed consent. “I’m appalled that experiments are being done on our U.S. soldiers without their knowledge,” Dr. Rosen said on Monday. “And to not have follow-up is, I think, dropping the ball big time.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/24device.html?ref=medtronicinc">Medtronic Posts Profit but Cuts Its Full-Year Forecast<date>Published: November 23, 2010</date><text>Medtronic, the maker of medical devices and a bellwether in its industry, cut its profit forecast for the year on Tuesday as it grapples with markets that have slowed while people postpone treatments.Demand for medical devices has fallen in the downturn, and people who have lost jobs, or who face higher co-payments and deductibles in their health plans, are putting off medical care. In August, Medtronic reported a drop in first-quarter sales that caught the market by surprise and sent its shares and those of rival heart and orthopedic device makers reeling. On Tuesday, Medtronic posted a second-quarter profit slightly ahead of analyst targets, helped by lower-than-expected taxes, on revenue growth of just under 2 percent. The chief executive, William A. Hawkins, said demand for medical devices had started to stabilize since a slowdown at the beginning of the summer. Still, the company trimmed its fiscal-year outlook for a second time and projected earnings per share of $3.38 to $3.44, down from $3.40 to $3.48 in August. Net income in Medtronic’s second quarter, which ended Oct. 29, fell to $566 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $868 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Medtronic said it had earned 82 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 81 cents, according to Thomson Reuters . “They kind of met expectations, but they see a tougher second half of the year,” a Noble Financial Capital analyst, Jan Wald, said. “My read is that the market growth they thought they’d see in the second half of the year, they’re not expecting to see.” Revenue rose to $3.90 billion, in line with analysts’ expectations, compared with $3.84 billion a year earlier. Revenue from implantable cardioverter defibrillators fell 1 percent, to $745 million, and declined 5 percent from pacemakers, to $472 million, hurt by slower market growth and pricing pressures in the United States and abroad. “Japan continues to be a major headwind, reflecting double-digit price cuts from April,” an analyst with JPMorgan, Michael Weinstein, said in a research note. Revenue from spinal products declined 1 percent in the quarter, to $850 million. Medtronic said it expected revenue growth of 2 to 4 percent for the second half of the 2011 fiscal year. It predicted the overall market would grow 2 to 3 percent. The company said its outlook omitted potential revenue from new products in the pipeline, whose introductions were delayed because of warning letters from the Food and Drug Administration.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/business/23device.html?ref=medtronicinc">Medtronic to Acquire Ardian<date>Published: November 22, 2010</date><text>Medtronic Inc., the heart device maker, said it would acquire Ardian, a closely held company developing a hypertension device that kills nerves near the kidney.Medtronic, based in Minneapolis, said it would pay $800 million in cash plus milestones based on Ardian’s revenue through 2015. Medtronic already owns 11 percent of the company. William A. Hawkins, Medtronic’s chief executive, said in September that the company would pursue “opportunistic” acquisitions to fill holes in its business. Medtronic has been looking for higher-growth areas as its core businesses in heart and spinal devices experience an industrywide slowdown. Medtronic has announced 25 pending or completed acquisitions over the last five years, with an average size of $446 million and an average premium of 71 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest deal was the 2007 purchase of Kyphon, a device maker for spine surgeries, for $3.8 billion. Medtronic had $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments as of July 10. Ardian’s technology is “one of the most exciting growth markets in medical devices,” Sean Salmon, vice president for Medtronic’s coronary and peripheral business, said in a statement. Medtronic gained 10 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $34.70.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/economy/22ahead.html?ref=medtronicinc">Looking Ahead to Economic Reports This Week<date>Published: November 21, 2010</date><text>ECONOMIC REPORTS With Thanksgiving on Thursday, some reports this week have been moved up the calendar.

The company halted sales of the so-called defibrillator leads in October 2007 after they were linked to users’ deaths. “Both the plaintiffs and Medtronic realized this was the best resolution for people injured by these wires,” Hunter J. Shkolnik, a lawyer for injured defibrillator users, said on Thursday in an interview. Medtronic lowered its profit forecast in August, citing slower defibrillator sales. It expects fiscal 2011 earnings of $3.40 to $3.48 a share, down from an earlier forecast of $3.45 to $3.55, company officials said that month. “Medtronic is pleased we were able to negotiate terms that were mutually agreeable to the parties,” Christopher Garland, a company spokesman, said in an interview. The settlement of the case, In Re Medtronic Inc. Sprint Fidelis Leads Products Liability Litigation, covers about 8,100 cases, or “virtually all” claims in the United States, Mr. Garland said. The settlement resolves cases in both federal and state courts. It will provide an average payout of more than $33,000 each to patients who have defibrillators with wires that have broken or are considered likely to break. The amount will depend on the extent of the injuries and defects. Medtronic had more than 50 percent of the $5.8 billion global market for defibrillators before sales of the leads were halted. The wires deliver electrical jolts from the stopwatch-size defibrillators to regulate faltering heartbeats. About 268,000 patients had those leads at one time, company officials said. They were introduced in 2004, the officials said. The company estimates that 170,000 people worldwide still have defibrillators with the Sprint Fidelis leads inside them. Medtronic acknowledged in March 2009 that the flawed wires “may have been a possible or likely contributing factor” in 13 deaths. The settlement over the Sprint Fidelis defibrillators is the second such accord over a line of the Medtronic’s heart devices. The company agreed in 2007 to pay more than $114 million to settle lawsuits over its Marquis line of defibrillators.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/business/25device.html?ref=medtronicinc">Medtronic Meets Profit Estimate but Cuts Forecast<date>Published: August 24, 2010</date><text>Medtronic, the medical device maker, reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday in line with Wall Street expectations, but weaker global demand for medical implants led the company to slash 2011 earnings expectations.Medtronic said it earned $830 million, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $445 million, or 40 cents a share, last year, when revamping charges and legal fees hurt performance. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $868 million, or 80 cents a share, meeting the forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Revenue in the period, which ended June 30 and was the first quarter of Medtronic’s fiscal year, fell 4 percent to $3.77 billion, partly because of an unfavorable foreign currency impact and a $200 million benefit from an extra week in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell short of the $3.94 billion expected by analysts and was weaker than expected across all major divisions, including defibrillators, pacemakers and spinal repair products. “A softer global health care market impacted by decreased utilization and increased pricing pressure made for a difficult first quarter,” the chief executive, William A. Hawkins III, said in a statement. In light of the sales slowdown, Medtronic scaled back its estimated 2011 revenue and earnings guidance. The company said it now expects fiscal 2011 earnings to range from $3.40 to $3.48 a share, with revenue growth of 2 percent to 5 percent on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Medtronic reported that global sales of its cardiac and vascular products fell 5 percent to $2.03 billion. Those sales actually increased 1 percent when adjusted for foreign currency and the extra week last year, the company said. Sales of the company’s spinal products continued to slump, falling 9 percent to $829 million as surgeons performed fewer back operations. Spinal devices make up Medtronic’s second-largest franchise. Medtronic spent nearly $4 billion to acquire the spinal implant maker Kyphon in 2007, though the unit has not performed to expectations.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/business/26device.html?ref=medtronicinc">Profit Surges at Medtronic After a Rival Has Trouble<date>Published: May 25, 2010</date><text>Medtronic, the maker of heart rhythm devices, said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit surged eightfold on higher sales of defibrillators after a rival, Boston Scientific, had to withdraw its products from the market.Net income climbed to $954 million, or 86 cents a share, in the three months ended April 30. That was up from $103 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier when one-time items weighed on results, the company said in a statement. Earnings, excluding some items, were 89 cents a share, 1 cent more than the average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. William A. Hawkins, Medtronic’s chairman and chief executive, said the company had taken about two-thirds of the American market share lost by Boston Scientific during the monthlong suspension. That added about $60 million to $70 million to company sales, Mr. Hawkins said in a conference call with analysts. “We are working hard to protect as much of what we gained as we can,” he said in an interview by telephone after the analyst call. “They’ve recaptured a fair amount of what they lost, but they have not gained it all back,” he added. Medtronic’s defibrillator sales for the quarter rose 13 percent, to $881 million. Excluding the $60 million to $70 million in sales gains from the recall, Medtronic’s defibrillator sales in the United States for the fourth quarter were little changed, at $567 million. Medtronic’s overall revenue climbed 9.6 percent, to $4.2 billion, with six of the company’s seven product lines recording higher sales. Medtronic forecast earnings for fiscal 2011 of $3.45 to $3.55 a share, including a 5-cent charge for acquisitions. Analysts had estimated profit of $3.48. Medtronic’s stock fell 69 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $39.95.

Kuklo, back to active duty to face court-martial charges. But no decision has been made, Col. Norvell V. Coots, commander of the medical center, said in an e-mail message to a reporter. Dr. Kuklo, a West Point graduate, retired from the Army in 2006. His lawyer said Wednesday he was not aware of the investigation. “It is news to me,” the lawyer, Henry J. Dane, said in a telephone interview. “This is not good news.” Mr. Dane said Dr. Kuklo now worked at a private spine clinic in Texas and denied any misconduct during 27 years in the Army. Dr. Kuklo, he said, “established essentially the whole credible research effort at Walter Reed.” But last year, in the wake of the Army accusations, Medtronic suspended and then ended a consulting contract with Dr. Kuklo that had paid him $788,000 over eight years. And Washington University in St. Louis suspended him from a tenured medical professorship and then agreed to his resignation. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, is still investigating the matter, first reported by The New York Times last May. The court-martial investigation was revealed on Wednesday in an e-mail message to The Times from Col. Scott F. Young, the chief legal adviser to the commander of the Walter Reed Health Care System in Bethesda, Md., and confirmed by Colonel Coots. Colonel Young, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request, said the materials described “allegations of misconduct by Dr. Kuklo” that were part of an investigation “to determine if there was evidence of offenses that would be triable by court-martial.” He was not more specific. “That investigation is still ongoing,” Colonel Young added. An expert on military courts-martial said a preliminary investigation may or may not result in formal charges. “When they’re doing the investigation, it’s not surprising that he doesn’t know about it,” Michelle M. Lindo McCluer, director of the National Institute of Military Justice at the American University law school in Washington, said in a telephone interview. Ms. McCluer, previously a top Air Force attorney, said a court-martial of Dr. Kuklo would involve returning him to active duty to face charges, a procedure allowed by courts in unusual cases. Possible penalties include a loss of retirement pay or other sanctions. Dr. Kuklo was accused in a 2008 Army investigation of making false claims and forging co-authors’ signatures on a medical journal article about the use of a Medtronic bone-growth product called Infuse. He was also accused of overstating the benefits of Infuse, which was used to treat soldiers who had suffered severe lower leg injuries. Subsequently, Army officials have said Dr. Kuklo failed to properly disclose his industry consulting relationships and outside employment. One former chairman of the orthopedics department at Walter Reed, Dr. William C. Doukas, has called for Dr. Kuklo to be brought back to active duty for punishment. Another former department chairman, Dr. David W. Polly Jr., has defended Dr. Kuklo, co-written papers with him and also consulted for Medtronic.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/business/26valve.html?ref=medtronicinc">Medtronic Heart Device Is Approved<date>Published: January 25, 2010</date><text>Federal regulators have approved Medtronic’s minimally invasive heart valve, the first replacement valve that can be implanted via a catheter rather than open-heart surgery.

The report on the investigation, which was conducted by a panel at Washington University into a study by Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, was completed on Wednesday. Dr. Kuklo resigned his post at Washington University this summer amid a controversy over the study, which involved a Medtronic bone growth product called Infuse. Dr. Kuklo conducted the research in question while a surgeon at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. He became a highly paid consultant to Medtronic when he joined Washington University in St. Louis in mid-2006. In a report last year, Army officials accused him of inflating the number of combat soldiers whose leg injuries had been successfully treated with the product. Officials also found that he had forged the names of four Army doctors before submitting the study to a medical journal for publication. After a lengthy review, the Washington University panel concluded that it had been possible for Dr. Kuklo to support the number of leg injuries he reported if such injuries were defined broadly. The panel also raised the possibility that some of the data discrepancies had reflected problems in Walter Reed’s patient record-keeping system. Seizing on that finding, Dr. Kuklo’s lawyer sent a letter Thursday to Senator Charles E. Grassley, describing it as exonerating his client. Mr. Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, began an investigation of Dr. Kuklo’s study after it was the subject of a Page 1 article in The New York Times in May. The allegation of “falsification or fabrication of the supporting data for the paper required an impartial review by qualified scientists,” the lawyer, Henry J. Dane, wrote. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Washington University said that Mr. Dane had misrepresented the panel’s full report by selectively citing from it in his letter, which he sent to The Times and other publications. Among other things, the spokeswoman said, the panel’s review had found “insufficient evidence” of research fraud but that the findings were not an “exoneration.” A copy of that full report, which was reviewed by The Times, also shows that the panel found instances of research misconduct in connection with the forgery of the other doctors’ names. In his presentations to the panel, Dr. Kuklo maintained that he had included the other doctors’ names as a courtesy and had not intended to mislead any one. But the committee disagreed, finding that Dr. Kuklo’s decision to use four different handwriting styles to sign for the physicians suggested “intentional deception.” The panel also found that Dr. Kuklo had committed research misconduct in connection with representations he made about another study. As a result of the controversy surrounding his Infuse study, Medtronic suspended his consulting agreement.

In its statement, Washington University said that his resignation was not being reconsidered. More Articles in Health » A version of this article appeared in print on October 16, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.An academic panel investigating a former Army surgeon who performed a study of a Medtronic bone treatment study said in a report that it had found instances of research misconduct but failed to find proof that he had falsified data. The report on the investigation, which was conducted by a panel at Washington University into a study by Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, was completed on Wednesday. Dr. Kuklo resigned his post at Washington University this summer amid a controversy over the study, which involved a Medtronic bone growth product called Infuse. Dr. Kuklo conducted the research in question while a surgeon at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. He became a highly paid consultant to Medtronic when he joined Washington University in St. Louis in mid-2006. In a report last year, Army officials accused him of inflating the number of combat soldiers whose leg injuries had been successfully treated with the product. Officials also found that he had forged the names of four Army doctors before submitting the study to a medical journal for publication. After a lengthy review, the Washington University panel concluded that it had been possible for Dr. Kuklo to support the number of leg injuries he reported if such injuries were defined broadly. The panel also raised the possibility that some of the data discrepancies had reflected problems in Walter Reed’s patient record-keeping system. Seizing on that finding, Dr. Kuklo’s lawyer sent a letter Thursday to Senator Charles E. Grassley, describing it as exonerating his client. Mr. Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, began an investigation of Dr. Kuklo’s study after it was the subject of a Page 1 article in The New York Times in May. The allegation of “falsification or fabrication of the supporting data for the paper required an impartial review by qualified scientists,” the lawyer, Henry J. Dane, wrote. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Washington University said that Mr. Dane had misrepresented the panel’s full report by selectively citing from it in his letter, which he sent to The Times and other publications. Among other things, the spokeswoman said, the panel’s review had found “insufficient evidence” of research fraud but that the findings were not an “exoneration.” A copy of that full report, which was reviewed by The Times, also shows that the panel found instances of research misconduct in connection with the forgery of the other doctors’ names. In his presentations to the panel, Dr. Kuklo maintained that he had included the other doctors’ names as a courtesy and had not intended to mislead any one. But the committee disagreed, finding that Dr. Kuklo’s decision to use four different handwriting styles to sign for the physicians suggested “intentional deception.” The panel also found that Dr. Kuklo had committed research misconduct in connection with representations he made about another study. As a result of the controversy surrounding his Infuse study, Medtronic suspended his consulting agreement. In recommending sanctions, the panel pointed out that Dr. Kuklo had already left the institution voluntarily. In its statement, Washington University said that his resignation was not being reconsidered.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/business/01valveside.html?ref=medtronicinc">Two Medical Devices, Two Different Methods<date>Published: September 30, 2009</date><text>Both the Edwards and CoreValve heart valves offer a less invasive alternative to surgery.

There are also concerns about the durability of nitinol, an alloy made from nickel and titanium. The material has long been used in implanted medical devices including coronary stents, the tiny tubes used to prop open clogged veins. But nitinol can be also prone to metal fatigue. Dr. John R. Liddicoat, the vice president of Medtronic’s structural heart disease business, said he expected the percentage of patients needing pacemakers would come down as doctors were better trained in the valve’s use and as ways of implanting it were improved. He added that the CoreValve had performed well in thousands of European patients and had not experienced durability issues. F.D.A. officials declined to discuss their talks with Medtronic. But speaking generally, Matthew Hillebrenner, an F.D.A. official, said that the collapse of an artificial heart valve would be “catastrophic.” For its part, the Edwards device also encountered problems during its development. In 2005, the company stopped an early study after several patients died. The company then revised the implant procedure. Edwards officials say they do not expect to report results from its current study to the F.D.A. before next year. But analysts say that the trial appears to be proceeding well because the agency recently gave Edwards permission to use the device in about 500 additional patients over the next year. “The signal to me is that the F.D.A. has a comfort level with the safety of this valve,” said Kristen Stewart, a medical device industry analyst with Credit Suisse . Michael A. Mussallem, the chairman and chief executive of Edwards, said that his company hoped to start human trials later this year of an improved valve, which he said was as easy to implant as the CoreValve unit. The next step, he said, would be starting a study sometime in the next year or two involving patients who are now candidates for open-heart surgery. “The idea of going into younger patients is the big opportunity,” Mr. Mussallem said.

The contest pits two major companies, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic. Analysts estimate a market for the product that could exceed $1.5 billion within six years. But if the valves catch on, their benefits for the nation’s aging population could be substantial  even if the impact on the nation’s health care bill may be hard to calculate. The new valves  which make it possible to repair the heart without the rigors of chest-opening surgery  have been available in Europe for about 18 months, with sales of about $100 million split about evenly last year between the two companies. While doctors say that the early results have been promising, they add that it is too early to gauge the technology’s long-term benefits. In the United States, the devices are currently being tested in older, critically ill patients in clinical trials. Many medical experts and financial analysts predict that if the devices live up to their makers’ claims, they could revolutionize valve replacement, a common heart operation, and extend the lives of thousands of frail patients who are not now considered candidates for surgery. The development of the new valves makes it clear that even as Congress debates ways to control the nation’s skyrocketing health costs, medical technology continues to advance in ways that may drive up health care spending even further with costly new procedures that can enable more people to live longer. Most heart valve replacements involve people of Medicare age. The race between Edwards and Medtronic involves one of the heart’s four valves  the aortic valve, which controls blood flow into the aorta from the heart. Aortic valves were involved in the vast majority of the estimated 95,000 open-heart surgeries in the country last year to replace a diseased valve with a new one, according to Millennium Research, a consulting group. An estimated 20,000 people die annually from valve-related disease, including those too sick to withstand surgery. The new valves from Edwards and Medtronic would be meant to enable more such patients to have life-saving valve replacements. The new units, known as percutaneous heart valves, are implanted through catheters, in much the same way that artery-opening stents are. A catheter holding a compressed replacement valve is inserted through a small incision in the groin or, if blood vessels are blocked, through an opening near the ribs. The catheter is then snaked through a vessel into the heart and the new valve is released, essentially compressing the diseased tissue and moving into its place. But the new technology would not be inexpensive. The current cost of heart valve replacement surgery is about $50,000, a sum that includes surgical fees, hospital costs and the price of a replacement valve, which sells for about $5,000. By contrast, the new valves currently sell for up to $30,000. Both Edwards and Medtronic, though, say that the higher prices for the valves would be offset by lower costs from anticipated shorter hospital stays. Edwards, which recently enrolled the last of about 1,000 patients in a major trial of its valve that is already under way, has a significant head start. Its device, if successful in that study and subsequently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, could be on the market in the United States in two years. Medtronic entered the race only in April, by purchasing CoreValve, a privately held company, for $700 million. Although the company hopes to start a major trial next summer, it is still discussing the study’s design with the F.D.A. “It is a two-valve race, with Edwards in the lead in the U.S.,” said Kristen Stewart, a medical device industry analyst with Credit Suisse. If the new valves prove beneficial in the sickest of patients, the next big question will be whether they should be used in patients who are now considered suitable candidates for open-heart surgery. Many heart specialists, pointing to the rapid proliferation of other expensive medical technologies, are urging caution. They point out that the success rate of conventional open-heart surgery is extremely high and that the replacement valves now in use are highly durable, lasting 10 to 15 years. With only a few years of data on the new valves, it remains uncertain how long they can last. That is why the studies so far are focusing mainly on people who are not candidates for conventional surgery. “We are willing to put in a valve that will not last as long in a patient who is at high surgical risk,” said Dr. Robert Guyton, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Emory University in Atlanta, who is involved in the Edwards trial. He and other doctors also say that the technology of implanting heart valves through catheters is still highly experimental. While complication rates are coming down as doctors gain experience, the procedure still can sometimes damage the heart or cause strokes. “It’s like baseball, you either hit a home run or you strike out,” Dr. Lars G. Svensson, a heart surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic who is also participating in the Edwards trial. Such risks may matter little to patients suffering from aortic stenosis, or a narrowing of the valve caused by the hardening of fat deposits. Once patients begin to experience that condition’s symptoms, including shortness of breath and dizziness, they can die in two or three years if the valve is not replaced. That was the situation facing Henry Tipton, a 97-year-old retired naval officer who lives in Sterling, Va. About three years ago, Mr. Tipton’s doctor told him he was too old for open-heart surgery and his outlook was bleak. Then the doctor heard about the Edwards trial, which was just starting. “I really had no alternative, so I decided to go ahead and take a chance,” said Mr. Tipton in a recent telephone interview from Utah where he was traveling with family members. “Within one day of the implant of the artificial valve, I felt completely recovered.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 1, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.A race is on to develop the potentially next big thing in heart surgery: a replacement valve that can be implanted through thin tubes known as catheters rather than by traditional open-heart surgery.

Such devices are intended to detect a chaotic heart rhythm that can cause sudden cardiac death, and then fire an electric jolt to restore normal heart rhythm. The studies showed that the devices reduced the likelihood of sudden death among male patients with congestive heart failure and other cardiac problems. But researchers reported their analysis did not show that benefit for women. The study was published on Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine, a medical journal. The three major producers of defibrillators are Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. In recent years, sales of the devices, which can cost more than $35,000, have been flat  partly because doctors have tried to be more selective about which patients receive the devices and also because of product recalls. Cardiologists said the results of the overview, which is technically known as a meta-analysis, needed to be interpreted cautiously because the clinical trials on which it was based involved far more men than women. In addition, women with heart failure are significantly less likely than men to die from sudden cardiac arrest. As a result, large numbers of women would have to be studied to determine a possible benefit. Researchers found that there were only about 930 women among the 4,700 patients studied in the trials that were reviewed. Dr. Charles Swerdlow, a professor of medicine at the University of California in Los Angeles, said the report suggested a need for more research on which women benefited from defibrillators. But he stressed that clinicians should not base decisions about whether a woman should receive one on the basis of the review’s findings. “We need to know more about why the benefit for women is less consistent than the benefit for men,” Dr Swerdlow said. In an editorial accompanying the study’s publication, Dr. Rita Redberg, a professor at the University of California in San Francisco, wrote that the report underscored the need for women and minorities to be better represented in clinical trial studies. Dr. Redberg added the better representation of women was particularly important in the case of implanted defibrillators, given both the cost of the devices and data showing that women suffer more post-implantation complications than men. “It is important to know the benefits of I.C.D. use for women, especially considering the known risks of morbidity and mortality,” Dr. Redberg wrote.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » Medtronic’s implantable heart devices and spinal implants have lost market share in recent years. The company, the world’s largest device maker, reported higher-than-expected sales for the quarter, which ended July 31, in part because of an extra week compared with last year’s calendar. Medtronic earned $445 million, or 40 cents a share, in the latest quarter, down from $723 million, or 64 cents a share. Excluding one-time charges like restructuring and litigation costs, Medtronic says it earned 79 cents a share. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts expected 78 cents a share in earnings, on average. Those estimates typically exclude one-time items. Revenue increased 6 percent, to $3.93 billion, from $3.71 billion a year ago, and beat Wall Street estimates of $3.81 billion. Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, reaffirmed its 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.20 a share with revenue of 5 to 8 percent on a constant-currency basis. The company’s earnings were hurt by a $442 million payment to Abbott Laboratories and another competitor to end lawsuits over patents for drug-coated stents. Stents are mesh-wire tubes used to prop open clogged arteries after they have been surgically cleared of fatty plaque. Abbott and Medtronic had been suing each other in the United States and Europe since 1998. Medtronic also recorded a $69 million charge related to an announcement last quarter it would lay off 1,800 employees. Company shares fell 14 cents, to $37.86.

The company, the world’s largest device maker, reported higher-than-expected sales for the quarter, which ended July 31, in part because of an extra week compared with last year’s calendar. Medtronic earned $445 million, or 40 cents a share, in the latest quarter, down from $723 million, or 64 cents a share. Excluding one-time charges like restructuring and litigation costs, Medtronic says it earned 79 cents a share. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts expected 78 cents a share in earnings, on average. Those estimates typically exclude one-time items. Revenue increased 6 percent, to $3.93 billion, from $3.71 billion a year ago, and beat Wall Street estimates of $3.81 billion. Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, reaffirmed its 2010 earnings forecast of $3.10 to $3.20 a share with revenue of 5 to 8 percent on a constant-currency basis. The company’s earnings were hurt by a $442 million payment to Abbott Laboratories and another competitor to end lawsuits over patents for drug-coated stents. Stents are mesh-wire tubes used to prop open clogged arteries after they have been surgically cleared of fatty plaque. Abbott and Medtronic had been suing each other in the United States and Europe since 1998. Medtronic also recorded a $69 million charge related to an announcement last quarter it would lay off 1,800 employees. Company shares fell 14 cents, to $37.86.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/business/29device.html?ref=medtronicinc">2nd Medtronic Consultant Draws Senate’s Scrutiny<date>Published: July 28, 2009</date><text>A Senate investigation of ties between doctors and the medical device maker Medtronic is putting a spotlight on another of the company’s consultants. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » That physician, Dr. David W. Polly Jr., urged members of a Senate panel in 2006 to continue paying for Defense Department medical research into combat-related injuries. But Dr. Polly did not disclose during his testimony that he was a Medtronic consultant and was billing the company $6,000 for his appearance, according to documents released Tuesday. Instead, he told lawmakers that he was representing a professional medical association of orthopedic surgeons, according to the documents. Dr. Polly, who is a medical professor at the University of Minnesota, subsequently received some of the Defense Department research funds, to head an animal study involving a Medtronic bone growth product called Infuse, according to the documents. Dr. Polly is the latest academic researcher to come under scrutiny in the Senate investigation, which is being conducted by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Grassley publicly released a number of documents, including Dr. Polly’s bills to Medtronic, as part of a continuing investigation into the company’s marketing of Infuse, a bioengineered bone growth product. Between 2003 and 2007, Dr. Polly received more than $1.14 million in fees and expenses from Medtronic, those records show. And the extent of his financial entanglements with the company, as detailed by those records, could raise questions about the ability of academic medical centers to manage potential conflicts of interest by faculty members who are also highly paid consultants to medical product companies. In late 2006, university officials allowed him to work on the Defense Department-financed study of Infuse. The medical school knew he was a company consultant, but under the school’s rules Dr. Polly had to acknowledge only that he received more than $10,000 annually. Medtronic paid him about $350,000 that year alone in expenses and fees, the records show. In an interview and subsequent e-mail messages this week, Dr. Polly said that he had done nothing wrong in connection with his 2006 appearance at the hearing, which was conducted by the Defense Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. A transcript of that hearing shows that he identified himself at the hearing as a representative of a professional medical group, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. He did not note his ties to Medtronic, according to the transcript. The documents released Tuesday also indicate that for his appearance at the hearing, Dr. Polly billed Medtronic $6,000. Dr. Polly said this week that he could not address specific questions about charges to Medtronic because his billing records were not immediately available. “If I billed Medtronic for services that were inappropriate I would be happy to refund that money,” he said in the interview. “My relationship with the company has always been on the up-and-up.” Dr. Polly’s study, which the Defense Department paid over $466,000 to support, involved laboratory animals and was intended to show whether the use of various antibiotics in combination with Infuse could speed the healing of badly fractured shin bones that were also deeply infected. Such trauma injuries are common in soldiers wounded in Iraq by roadside bombs and other explosive devices. Until 2003, Dr. Polly was the head of the orthopedics department at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. He is the second former Walter Reed doctor to come under scrutiny by Senator Grassley. The other, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, published a study of Infuse’s use on Walter Reed patients that a British medical journal retracted in March after an Army investigation concluded that he had falsified its results. Dr. Polly is an author on an influential Medtronic-sponsored study that found that the use of Infuse, a bioengineered protein that stimulates bone growth, was cost-effective in spinal fusions when compared with using bone grafts, the traditional material. While he was still in the military, Medtronic paid his traveling expenses for medical meetings in this country and abroad. The general counsel of the University of Minnesota, Mark Rotenberg, said that the medical school had allowed Dr. Polly to work on the Defense Department study despite his ties to Medtronic because the study involved laboratory rats, rather than people, and because Dr. Polly had said that it was not of economic significance to the company. The medical school instructed him not to disclose any data from the study to Medtronic before its public release. Asked about Dr. Polly’s testimony, Medtronic said it believed that he should have disclosed that the company had paid him for his preparation for the 2006 hearing and his travel. Late Tuesday, Medtronic said it plans to conduct an internal inquiry of Dr. Polly’s activities and would soon announce new policies regarding consultants that covered disclosure-related issues. A lawyer for Dr. Polly, John Lundquist, said the physician will review any concerns about how he tracked and billed for consulting activities. Duff Wilson contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Washington University Washington University is reviewing Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo. Related Times Topics: Timothy R. Kuklo Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Alex Wong/Getty Images Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, is playing a crucial role in the bodys investigation of Dr. Kuklo. The new disclosures, which the medical school made in response to a Senate investigation, may intensify the controversy surrounding the physician, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, an orthopedic surgeon who formerly worked at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The Army has accused Dr. Kuklo of falsifying a medical journal study about the use of a Medtronic bone-growth product on American soldiers with severe leg injuries, reporting more favorable results than other Walter Reed doctors found. The medical school documents also shed new light on Medtronic’s financial support of Dr. Kuklo’s research on those soldiers, who were treated with the company’s bone-growth product called Infuse. Since the Kuklo controversy was the subject of a front-page New York Times article in May, Medtronic has consistently said it was not aware of, and had not supported, the Walter Reed study about Infuse, which Dr. Kuklo published last August in a British medical journal. The journal retracted it in March after the Army discredited it. But the documents show that for more than a year Medtronic financed a separate, unpublished research study by Dr. Kuklo while he was at Washington University that also reviewed the use of Infuse on Walter Reed patients with combat-related leg injuries. Dr. Kuklo has not responded to interview requests over the last two months and did not do so on Tuesday. Medtronic acknowledged that it had supported Dr. Kuklo’s second Walter Reed study but stated, “Washington University discontinued the study in question, thus it was never completed, nor was a manuscript ever submitted for consideration.” Washington University told Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, that Dr. Kuklo had stopped that study in 2008 after school officials confronted him about not disclosing his ties to Medtronic when he began the study two years earlier. It was not until mid-2007, nearly a year after joining the medical school, that Dr. Kuklo disclosed in a filing that he was a Medtronic consultant, making more than $50,000 annually from the company. Given the option of reducing those financial ties to below $10,000, Dr. Kuklo opted to stop the study, the school said. In addition to the Senate investigation, being led by Mr. Grassley, the Kuklo matter is the subject of a Justice Department inquiry. Washington University has told the senator that it is continuing to investigate Dr. Kuklo’s apparent failure to adequately disclose his Medtronic ties as required in conflict-of-interest filings with the school. “Dr. Kuklo’s relationships to Medtronic and the adequacy of his related disclosures to the University are also of great concern to us,” the medical school’s dean, Dr. Larry J. Shapiro, wrote in a letter to Senator Grassley that the senator’s office released Tuesday along with other documents from the university’s investigation. A company spokeswoman declined to say whether Dr. Kuklo had submitted to Medtronic any data from his retracted study before it was published last August. Dr. Kuklo joined the medical faculty of Washington University in August 2006, when he still was on military active duty. Medical school officials said they were unaware of that continuing military relationship, and Army officials are currently investigating whether Dr. Kuklo sought and received their permission to take the teaching job. While at Walter Reed, Dr. Kuklo had received research and travel support from Medtronic, according to Army records. The school said it later discovered that Dr. Kuklo had signed a personal consulting agreement with Medtronic just three days after submitting a conflict-of-interest form in September 2006 in which he stated he did not have or anticipate having any financial ties to companies involved in his research. The consulting deal was also retroactive to Aug. 1, 2006. Dr. Kuklo, while still at Walter Reed, had presented data at a 2005 conference about the use of Infuse at the medical hospital  information that he would later develop into a substantive report that he began submitting to medical journals starting in 2007. It was around that same time, university information indicates, that Medtronic also began to underwrite another, related follow-up study of Infuse’s results on the injured Walter Reed soldiers. The published report, eventually retracted by The British Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, dealt with single doses of Infuse. The second study, never completed or published, was meant to review the effect of multiple doses of the bone growth product on soldiers treated at Walter Reed. The university told Senator Grassley that its review of Dr. Kuklo, which is continuing, began in February, a month after it received an Army report that he had falsified the published Infuse study and forged the names of four other military doctors on it. In late May, Medtronic suspended its consulting relationship with Dr. Kuklo, and the doctor took a paid leave from Washington University at the school’s request. Medtronic recently said that it had paid Dr. Kuklo nearly $800,000 in fees since hiring him as a consultant in mid-2006, including more than $132,000 this year. It was in December that the Army told Medtronic about the results of its inquiry. Dr. William C. Doukas, a former chairman of the orthopedics department at Walter Reed, said in a recent interview that he often gave Dr. Kuklo permission to take leaves while working at the military hospital to speak about Infuse at medical conferences. “I defended him, not knowing what he was doing,” Dr. Doukas recently said. “I thought he was speaking forthrightly.” But last year, when Dr. Doukas learned about Dr. Kuklo’s fabricated study, he told an Army investigator then he believed that the orthopedist should be brought back from retirement for punishment, according to a previously undisclosed portion of the Army’s report.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The medical device maker indicated in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had received a subpoena on May 21 from the United States attorney in Boston seeking information about its financial ties and other dealings with Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, a former orthopedic surgeon at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. Steven Cragle, a Medtronic spokesman, said that the company had no comment on the subpoena beyond its S.E.C. filing. Dr. Kuklo, who is currently an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, has repeatedly declined to comment on the episode. Last week, Medtronic, at the behest of Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, disclosed that it had paid about $800,000 in consulting fees over the years to Dr. Kuklo, with the vast bulk of those funds paid to him in the last three years. It was over that period that Dr. Kuklo submitted his now-challenged Infuse study to a series of medical journals before it was published last August in the British edition of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. It claimed Infuse performed “strikingly” better than a traditional bone graft when used to repair serious leg injuries suffered by American combat soldiers in Iraq. In an investigation completed last year, the Army accused the orthopedist of forging the name of other military doctors on that Infuse article and citing patient data that did not match Walter Reed records. For Medtronic, the Justice Department subpoena represents a new stage in a deepening quandary involving Dr. Kuklo. While Medtronic’s chief executive, William A. Hawkins, was formally informed of the Army’s findings on Dec. 31, the company continued to pay Dr. Kuklo tens of thousands of dollars in fees and continued to have him speak to other doctors about Infuse. The company suspended his consulting contract last month after The New York Times published an article in early May detailing the Army’s findings and after Senator Grassley began seeking data about Medtronic’s financial ties to the physician. Earlier this week, Mr. Cragle, the Medtronic spokesman, declined to say when Medtronic first learned of the allegations against Dr. Kuklo. The new subpoena comes as the Justice Department and Senator Grassley continue to investigate whether Medtronic violated any federal rules by promoting unapproved uses of Infuse, a charge that the company denies. Dr. Kuklo became a Medtronic consultant in August 2006, the month that he left Walter Reed, though he did not formally retire from the Army until months later. While Medtronic’s filing did not cite Dr. Kuklo by name, it did make reference to a Justice Department request for documents related to a retracted article in the British medical journal. According to the filing, the department requested “contracts, research grants, speaking and education programs, and payments for certain named physicians” involved in the study reported in the British journal. Dr. Kuklo is the only person associated with that report accused of any wrongdoing.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The medical device maker indicated in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had received a subpoena on May 21 from the United States attorney in Boston seeking information about its financial ties and other dealings with Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, a former orthopedic surgeon at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. Steven Cragle, a Medtronic spokesman, said that the company had no comment on the subpoena beyond its S.E.C. filing. Dr. Kuklo, who is currently an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, has repeatedly declined to comment on the episode. Last week, Medtronic, at the behest of Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, disclosed that it had paid about $800,000 in consulting fees over the years to Dr. Kuklo, with the vast bulk of those funds paid to him in the last three years. It was over that period that Dr. Kuklo submitted his now-challenged Infuse study to a series of medical journals before it was published last August in the British edition of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. It claimed Infuse performed “strikingly” better than a traditional bone graft when used to repair serious leg injuries suffered by American combat soldiers in Iraq. In an investigation completed last year, the Army accused the orthopedist of forging the name of other military doctors on that Infuse article and citing patient data that did not match Walter Reed records.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The Army is now investigating the propriety of tens of thousands of dollars in payments by that product’s maker, Medtronic, to the surgeon, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, for consulting, travel and educational activities on behalf of the company while he was employed by the Army, Walter Reed’s commander, Col. Norvell V. Coots, said in an interview Monday. Medtronic sells Infuse, a bone-growth product that was used at Walter Reed on soldiers with severely shattered shins. Those cases were the subject of Dr. Kuklo’s study, which was published in a journal last year then retracted after the Army challenged it. Medtronic disclosed last week that it had paid nearly $800,000 to Dr. Kuklo since 2001, including $42,627 in 2006 after he signed a consulting contract in August 2006 and larger amounts in 2007 and 2008. The company has said it was not involved with the discredited study. The Army is also exploring whether Dr. Kuklo violated military regulations by accepting a full-time teaching job at Washington University school of medicine in St. Louis in August 2006, Colonel Coots said. Army records show that Dr. Kuklo, who is a West Point graduate, was a still a full-time, active-duty employee assigned to Walter Reed at the time he signed the Medtronic contract and accepted the Washington University teaching job. He was granted “terminal leave” from the Army on Dec. 31, 2006, and formally retired on March 31, 2007, the military records show. Colonel Coots said the Army had found no records to show Dr. Kuklo sought or received permission to consult for Medtronic or take a new full-time job while still employed by the Army, as regulations require. Colonel Coots said that he started the new investigation about two weeks ago and that he expected a final report, which he planned to make public, within a month. “We are trying to be as open and transparent as possible,” he said. Dr. Kuklo, who is also a lawyer, has repeatedly declined to comment. Medtronic said Monday that it had believed Dr. Kuklo was a professor, not an Army employee, in August 2006, and that in signing the consulting contract he warranted that he had obtained all required approvals. Washington University, which put Dr. Kuklo on voluntary leave in May, did not respond to a request for comment Monday evening.

Kuklo, were more extensive than previously acknowledged. Army officials have accused Dr. Kuklo of falsifying research about the benefits of a Medtronic bone-growth product called Infuse in treating American soldiers who suffered severe leg injuries in Iraq. Until mid-2006, Dr. Kuklo, an orthopedic surgeon, worked at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. Dr. Kuklo, now an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, has declined requests to speak about the incident, which has drawn increasing attention over the last month. Medtronic, which says it was not involved in the discredited research study, has only gradually disclosed the extent of its financial ties to Dr. Kuklo. Initially, for example, Medtronic officials said that the company had supported some of Dr. Kuklo’s research through grants to a foundation but refused to say when the company had hired him as a consultant. That drew the attention of Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who had already been investigating Medtronic in connection with its marketing of Infuse. About two weeks ago, in responses to Senator Grassley’s demands for information, Medtronic disclosed that it had hired Dr. Kuklo as a consultant in August 2006, the month when he left Walter Reed to take his current teaching post. The company had also previously acknowledged that before mid-2006, it had paid Dr. Kuklo’s travel expenses to attend medical conferences while he was in the military. But it did not disclose then what it now acknowledges  that Medtronic also paid him during that same period to speak on the company’s behalf at such meetings and to train other doctors. That latest wrinkle came to light this week after Medtronic’s chief executive, William A. Hawkins III, responded to a question from a reporter from the cable news stations CNBC about the company’s relationship with Dr. Kuklo. In his response, Mr. Hawkins said those ties had started in August 2006 when Dr. Kuklo left Walter Reed. On Wednesday, Medtronic issued a public clarification about Mr. Hawkins’s comments. “Dr. Kuklo,” the statement said, “did perform a number of reimbursable functions, including training and education, for the company while he was a practicing physician at Walter Reed prior to that time.” In response to a reporter’s question, a Medtronic spokeswoman, Marybeth Thorsgaard, acknowledged Thursday that the company had directly paid Dr. Kuklo before August 2006 to give speeches and train other doctors on the company’s behalf. Ms. Thorsgaard, in a written statement, said that Medtronic’s relationship with Dr. Kuklo was not unusual. “Medtronic has worked with military physicians to support their efforts to participate in events at which they may enhance their own expertise or share their accomplishments and knowledge with others,” the statement said. Ms. Thorsgaard declined to say how frequently Dr. Kuklo had performed such services for the company while he was in the military or how much he had been paid to do so. She said Medtronic would provide that data to Senator Grassley next week. Military physicians are permitted to receive money for outside duties like speaking on a medical product company’s behalf or consulting with one. But they are supposed to clear such arrangements with military officials.

Army officials, alerted by Dr. Andersen, began an investigation. They uncovered an apparent case of falsified research by a doctor who had befriended Dr. Andersen when they both worked at Walter Reed, treating American soldiers severely injured in Iraq. The full report of that Army investigation, recently obtained by The New York Times, provides an unusually detailed anatomy of a suspected case of medical research fraud  one all the more disturbing because it occurred at the nation’s premier military research hospital. Within the last week, the Justice Department opened an inquiry into the episode, said two people with knowledge of it, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The disputed journal article was written by a former Army orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, who is now a medical professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Kuklo, the investigation found, forged the signatures of Dr. Andersen and other Army doctors on his study and never showed it to them before it was published. The British journal that published Dr. Kuklo’s study retracted it in March and has banned him from its pages. His future at Washington University will very likely be determined by an inquiry the medical school is said to be conducting. University officials declined to comment for this article. The Walter Reed episode also shows how medical journals may fail to conduct adequate due diligence on the studies they publish  information that other doctors rely on for guidance. As happened in the Kuklo case, for example, they often deal only with a study’s principal author, rather than all the credited contributors. In his study, Dr. Kuklo, who has not responded to repeated interview requests, reported that a bone-growth product sold by Medtronic, called Infuse, performed “strikingly” better than the traditional bone-grafting technique used to heal soldiers’ shattered shin bones. Other Walter Reed doctors told an Army investigator that claim was overblown. Medtronic financed some of Dr. Kuklo’s research and travel while he was at Walter Reed and hired him as a consultant in August 2006 when he took his current academic post. But Dr. Kuklo did not disclose his Medtronic relationship in the journal article, which was published in August 2008. Medtronic has declined to provide the financial details of its relationship with Dr. Kuklo, although the company said Friday that it planned to provide some of that information next week to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who is investigating the matter. Medtronic has said that it had no involvement in the disputed Infuse study, despite its business ties to Dr. Kuklo. The report was published in Britain last August in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. Colleagues and friends of Dr. Kuklo say they are shocked by the accusations against him and predict he will eventually be cleared of any wrongdoing. “I think that Tim is a brilliant researcher and surgeon,” said Lt. Col. Richard C. Rooney, a spine surgeon at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Tex., who knows Dr. Kuklo and his work. “I don’t believe the accusations. I don’t care if the head of Walter Reed made them.” For his part, Dr. Kuklo did not formally respond to Army investigators. But Col. J. Edwin Atwood, an Army cardiologist who led the Army’s inquiry, wrote in his report that even if Dr. Kuklo had participated, it might have had little influence on his findings. “What has transpired here,” he wrote, “is the ultimate tragedy and catastrophe in academic medicine.” Treating War’s Injured With the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the orthopedics department of Walter Reed, a sprawling facility in Washington, became an extension of the front lines. The injured included soldiers with gaping holes in their lower legs caused by explosive devices like homemade bombs filled with ball-bearings and nails. Hundreds of them would receive amputations. Dr. Kuklo, a native of Canton, Ohio, who had come to Walter Reed as a medical resident in the 1990s, was one of the specialists who treated the wounded. Back then, his colleagues viewed Dr. Kuklo, a West Point graduate who is married with two children, as likable, hard-working and ambitious. Dr. Andersen also once considered him a friend, and credits Dr. Kuklo with helping him to decide to become an orthopedist. “He was a good mentor,” said Dr. Andersen, who is currently serving in a combat hospital in Baghdad. Infuse, the subject of Dr. Kuklo’s study, is a bioengineered bone-growth protein that the Food and Drug Administration approved in 2002. Walter Reed surgeons used it both in certain spinal surgeries and to treat severe leg injuries. Dr. Kuklo, a spine specialist, also had other research interests that dovetailed with Medtronic’s; while at the military hospital, he led five studies financed by the company, Army officials say. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on June 6, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.Dr. Romney C.

Dr. Kuklo, a spine specialist, also had other research interests that dovetailed with Medtronic’s; while at the military hospital, he led five studies financed by the company, Army officials say. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/business/21surgeon.html?ref=medtronicinc">Senator Rebukes Medtronic Over List of Consultants<date>Published: May 20, 2009</date><text>The medical device maker Medtronic said Wednesday that it had suspended its consulting agreement with a former military doctor accused by the Army of falsifying research involving use of one of the company’s products on injured soldiers.

Army doctors can accept money to consult for medical product companies if they are given approval. Military officials said Wednesday that they had not found records that Dr. Kuklo sought or received such permission. “We are still checking files, but a review of known administrative and personnel records maintained at Walter Reed show no request for, or approval of, off-duty employment submitted by Dr. Kuklo for consultant services for Medtronic,” Chuck F. Dasey, a spokesman for Walter Reed, wrote in an e-mail message late Wednesday. Medtronic said Wednesday that it had suspended its consulting relationship with Dr. Kuklo until the controversy surrounding him had been resolved. The developments involving Dr. Kuklo came Wednesday as a top Senate Republican, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, rebuked Medtronic and arranged the public release of a list Medtronic had given of doctors who consult for the company on the product at the center of the controversy, a bone-growth treatment called Infuse. Mr. Grassley, in a letter to the company that he entered into The Congressional Record, asked why Medtronic had not included Dr. Kuklo on that consultants list. This year, after an Army investigation, a British medical journal retracted an article Dr. Kuklo had written in which he reported that Infuse had greater success than another technique in healing the shattered legs of American soldiers wounded in Iraq. In its inquiry, the Army found that Dr. Kuklo had forged the names of four other Walter Reed doctors he claimed to be his co-authors on the study, and presented data that appeared to have been fabricated because it did not match Walter Reed patient records. As recently as last week, a Medtronic spokeswoman, Marybeth Thorsgaard, described Dr. Kuklo as an active, paid consultant for the company, though she said Medtronic had not underwritten the challenged study. Dr. Kuklo, who has repeatedly declined requests for comment, is currently an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. On Wednesday, Ms. Thorsgaard said that the company, along with its consulting contract with Dr. Kuklo, also had a product development and royalty agreement with him involving spinal devices that were unrelated to Infuse. She did not elaborate on the status of that agreement. Mr. Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has been investigating since last year whether Medtronic illegally promoted unapproved uses for Infuse. Medtronic, which has denied that accusation, provided him last year with a list of Infuse consultants. After Dr. Kuklo’s links to Medtronic and Infuse came to light last week in a New York Times article, Mr. Grassley’s staff checked the consultants list and noted that Dr. Kuklo’s name was not on it. In reaction, he wrote a letter to Medtronic’s president and chief executive, William A. Hawkins III, asking why Dr. Kuklo had been omitted. Mr. Grassley entered that letter and the list he had received into The Congressional Record. “In the future, I hope that instead of not providing me with the name of the physician involved in Infuse, or any other matter that I am looking into, that Medtronic contact me to avoid the situation in which we find ourselves,” Mr. Grassley wrote to Mr. Hawkins. Ms. Thorsgaard, the company spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message to a reporter that Medtronic had omitted Dr. Kuklo’s name from the list because he had a general consulting contract with Medtronic, rather than one specific to Infuse. She said Wednesday that the company planned to supply Mr. Grassley with data about Dr. Kuklo. The consultants list shows that Medtronic paid about $943,000 from 2003 to 2008 to 22 doctors for consulting specifically about Infuse. Several of them, contacted Wednesday, acknowledged their industry ties and said they always disclosed them. Medtronic omitted from its consultants list some other doctors, like Dr. Kuklo, who have been consultants to the company and spoken about Infuse. They include Dr. David W. Polly Jr., another former Walter Reed physician who is now at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Polly acknowledged through a university spokesman that he is a Medtronic consultant  a relationship he has disclosed in publications.

Related Grassley Letters on Disputed Medical Study Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, released letters Monday seeking information about the physician, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo. The letters were sent late Friday to Walter Reed officials, two medical journals and the head of Washington University in St. Louis, where Dr. Kuklo works as an associate professor in the medical school. The New York Times reported last week that a British medical journal had retracted an article by Dr. Kuklo earlier this year after learning from Army officials that he had, among other things, forged the names of four other doctors he cited as the study’s co-authors. Army investigators determined that Dr. Kuklo’s article had overstated the benefits of a Medtronic bone-growth product, called Infuse, that was used at Walter Reed to treat American soldiers who had suffered severe lower leg injuries in Iraq. Army officials also cited discrepancies in the data cited by Dr. Kuklo, saying he had described more injuries than Walter Reed records showed. Dr. Kuklo, who worked at Walter Reed from 2003 to 2007, has declined to respond to numerous telephone calls and e-mail messages seeking comment. Officials of Washington University have also declined to say whether they are investigating Dr. Kuklo, although Army officials and others say that the school is conducting such an inquiry. Medtronic may also face repercussions from the case. Since last year Senator Grassley and, separately, the Justice Department have been investigating whether the company illegally promoted uses of Infuse that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration  by paying doctors, among other alleged measures. The company has denied doing so. Medtronic, while acknowledging that Dr. Kuklo is a company consultant, has repeatedly declined to say when it hired him as a consultant or how much it has paid him over the years, either directly or to support his research. But the company’s and doctor’s financial relationship goes back to at least 2001. From 2001 to 2006, Medtronic spent more than $13,000 to pay Dr. Kuklo’s travel expenses to numerous medical conferences and other professional meetings, according to Defense Department records reviewed by the Center for Public Integrity and Northwestern University’s Medill Journalism School. In a response to an inquiry last September from Senator Grassley, Medtronic provided the lawmaker with a list of outside doctors who were paid consultants for Infuse. Dr. Kuklo, who has made about 15 paid presentations for Medtronic about the bone-growth product, was not on that list, a spokeswoman for Senator Grassley said last week. Asked last week by a reporter about that issue, a Medtronic spokeswoman, Marybeth Thorsgaard, said in a written statement that the doctor was not included because “some consultants, like Dr. Kuklo, have general agreements that are not specific to a single therapy or subject matter.” In the Friday letter to Walter Reed officials, Senator Grassley asked for information about, among other things, direct or indirect payments by Medtronic to Dr. Kuklo and other Army doctors involved with Infuse or other company products. He is also seeking the full report of the Army’s investigation as well as relevant conflict-of-interest policies. Col. Norvell V. Coots, commander of the Walter Reed Health Care System, said Monday that he welcomed the review. “My guess is we will probably find something more here,” the colonel said in a telephone interview. A spokesman for Washington University said it would cooperate with Senator Grassley’s request. One of the medical journals that received the lawmaker’s inquiry was the British periodical The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, which published and later retracted Dr. Kuklo’s Infuse study. The other was an American journal that has the same name but operates separately from the British publication. It had read but rejected Dr. Kuklo’s article before he submitted it to the British publication. Senator Grassley asked the journals to provide him with any information relevant to the submitted article, including whether Dr. Kuklo disclosed receiving funding from Medtronic. The published article did not contain such a disclosure. A spokesman for the British publication said it would provide whatever information it was able to Mr. Grassley’s committee.

Since last year, the Justice Department and Senator Charles E.

Removing it from the bodies of thousands of patients is a lot more complicated and dangerous. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Jodi Hilton for The New York Times Dr. Laurence M. Epstein, a surgeon at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston, specializes in extracting defibrillator cables made by Medtronic. Related Times Topics: Medtronic Inc. Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Jodi Hilton for The New York Times Defective Medtronic cables are being replaced with a new version, pictured. Consider the Sprint Fidelis, a heart defibrillator cable. In 2007 its maker, Medtronic, stopped selling it after five patients who had the cables died. But only now is the full scope of the public health problem becoming clear for the Sprint Fidelis, which is still used by 150,000 people in this country. In the next few years, thousands of those patients may face risky surgical procedures to remove and replace the electrical cable, which connects a defibrillator to a chamber of the heart. Medtronic estimates that the cable has failed in a little more than 5 percent of patients after 45 months of being implanted. But as a preventive measure, some patients with working cables are having them removed. Already, four patients have died during extractions. Experts fear that the toll could quickly rise if such procedures are not performed by skilled doctors at medical centers that have performed many of the operations. “I think we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr. Charles J. Love, a cardiologist at Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus, who specializes in cable extractions. For many of the patients around the country who may need the procedure, finding the right medical center will not be easy. There is little publicly available data on the volumes and success rates of the procedures at the nation’s hospitals. Some hospitals disclose their own numbers, but many more do not. “There are people who are doing this that don’t meet the criteria,” said Dr. Bruce Wilkoff, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Even experienced cardiologists at well-regarded hospitals, like Dr. Laurence M. Epstein at Brigham and Women’s Hospital here, consider the procedure challenging. Dr. Epstein recently operated on a patient, a 63-year-old man, whose Sprint Fidelis cable had become so overgrown with tissue that it was stuck inside a major vein. To free it, Dr. Epstein cautiously threaded a catheter-guided laser through the blood vessel to dissolve the entrapping tissue. It was a risky move. The deaths of the four Sprint Fidelis patients at other hospitals apparently occurred when less practiced doctors damaged a vein or the heart, causing extensive bleeding. Finally, Dr. Epstein pulled the cable out. “This was one of the more difficult ones,” said Dr. Epstein, who added that he had removed scores of the Sprint Fidelis cables in the last year without a major complication. It is not unusual for heart cables, or leads as doctors call them, to eventually wear out or fail, which is why there are doctors who specialize in removing them. What makes the Sprint Fidelis situation stand out is the vast number of patients who got the cable before its recall. A quarter-million people around the world received a Sprint Fidelis in the three years from its introduction in 2004 to its recall in October 2007. The cable’s chief flaw is the tendency for it to crack, creating electrical problems. The defibrillator may fail to give a heart a life-saving jolt to disrupt a potentially fatal rhythm. Or it may repeatedly discharge, shocking patients for no reason. Also, when a Sprint Fidelis is used with a device that combines a defibrillator with a pacemaker, the cable’s flaw may interfere with the pacemaker’s ability to keep a patient’s heart beating at a steady rhythm. Medtronic has given patients some guidance about extractions, like telling them to seek a hospital experienced in the procedure if they decide to have a Sprint Fidelis removed. Though the company has declined to indicate which medical centers have such experience, it recently compiled such a list. Last year, to win approval for a new heart cable from the Food and Drug Administration, the company agreed to provide the F.D.A. with future data from “10 experienced extraction centers,” according to agency records. But Medtronic says it does not plan to make such a list public. “Medtronic believes that a patient’s physician is in the best position to make decisions related to patient care, including the most appropriate lead extraction center,” the company wrote, in response to a reporter’s question. Experts say patients should ask a hospital how many of the procedures it has performed, and go to medical centers that do at least 50 a year. Medtronic has been shielded so far from legal claims over the recalled device. More than 1,000 patient lawsuits involving the Sprint Fidelis have been thrown out because of a ruling last year by the Supreme Court. The court held in a ruling involving a different medical device that federal law protects device makers from liability suits involving some products, as long as the F.D.A. has approved their products. Some Democrats in Congress have vowed to pass legislation that would override the Supreme Court decision. They cite the Sprint Fidelis problem as one reason, also noting the F.D.A. let it onto the market without extensive testing. Medtronic is supplying replacement cables, but the cost of the operation to implant a cable, which can run $15,000 to $20,000 is being borne by Medicare or private insurers. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on April 7, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.BOSTON  Pulling a medical device off the market is one thing. Removing it from the bodies of thousands of patients is a lot more complicated and dangerous. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Jodi Hilton for The New York Times Dr. Laurence M.

Consider the Sprint Fidelis, a heart defibrillator cable. In 2007 its maker, Medtronic, stopped selling it after five patients who had the cables died. But only now is the full scope of the public health problem becoming clear for the Sprint Fidelis, which is still used by 150,000 people in this country. In the next few years, thousands of those patients may face risky surgical procedures to remove and replace the electrical cable, which connects a defibrillator to a chamber of the heart. Medtronic estimates that the cable has failed in a little more than 5 percent of patients after 45 months of being implanted. But as a preventive measure, some patients with working cables are having them removed. Already, four patients have died during extractions. Experts fear that the toll could quickly rise if such procedures are not performed by skilled doctors at medical centers that have performed many of the operations. “I think we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr. Charles J.

Skip to next paragraph Medtronic The Sprint Fidelis lead connects the heart to a defibrillator. Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The new data reflect the first fatality update by Medtronic since October 2007, when it recalled the device  a thin electrical cable that connects an implanted defibrillator to a patient’s heart. The company cited five deaths when it recalled the product, saying fractures in the cable could cause a defibrillator to fail to deliver a lifesaving shock to an erratically beating heart, or to fire for no reason. Separately, a previously undisclosed Food and Drug Administration report indicates that Medtronic began receiving reports soon after the device reached the market in late 2004 that the cable, known as the Sprint Fidelis, was fracturing. The company also revised its manufacturing process in the months before withdrawing the Sprint Fidelis from the market, according to the F.D.A. report, which was provided to The New York Times by lawyers suing Medtronic. A top Medtronic official said in an interview on Friday that the manufacturing change in question was unrelated to the reasons for the recall and that even at the time of the recall internal data did not suggest it was fracturing at a significantly higher rate than other company leads. When Medtronic may have known the Sprint Fidelis posed safety problems, and how it responded to that information, could be significant factors if patient lawsuits over the product were to start moving forward again. This month, top Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation that would effectively nullify a Supreme Court decision last year that has blocked lawsuits against medical device makers like Medtronic. The company recently said that about 2,000 legal claims involving the Sprint Fidelis had been filed against it. The death statistics Medtronic released Friday underscore both the scope of the Sprint Fidelis problem and the difficult choices that doctors and patients face in deciding what to do about it. About 150,000 people in this country still have the Sprint Fidelis leads in their bodies. Along with fatalities, the F.D.A. has received about 2,200 reports of serious injuries related to the leads. Medtronic officials said they believed that reflected the number of people who had undergone surgery to have a failed lead replaced with a new one. Dr. David Steinhaus, Medtronic’s medical director, said the updated figures, which the company distributed Friday to doctors, was based on a review of available data by company officials and a panel of five outside physicians. He said that the outside panel was particularly concerned with the four deaths related to surgical efforts to remove the lead. Doctors often choose to leave a fractured heart device lead in place when implanting a new one. In the advisory to physicians on Friday, the panel urged that doctors who think a patient would benefit from having a failed lead extracted have the procedure performed by a physician skilled in doing so. “If you are going to have it done, you ought to go to a place where they are doing a lot of them,” Dr. Steinhaus said. Besides the deaths related to the surgeries, the panel appears to have concluded that the nine other deaths may have been tied to the device’s failure to function properly. The F.D.A. report is based on a visit by regulators to a Medtronic facility in Mounds View, Minn., soon after the device was removed from the market, where the officials interviewed executives and inspected records. The report shows that by late 2005 the company had received 30 complaints about device fractures and had identified several possible ways in which the lead might be failing. About that time, the company opened an internal investigation into the problem, according to the report. What happened next is not clear, because the F.D.A. redacted portions of the report before releasing it. But the document indicates that Medtronic engineers met often about the problem throughout 2006 and that they performed a “statistical analysis of the three failure modes” of the lead in October of that year, the report states. It was in February 2007 that Dr. Robert G. Hauser, a cardiologist at the Minneapolis Heart Institute, met with Medtronic officials and informed them that his database of heart patients showed that the Sprint Fidelis was fracturing at a troubling rate. In a telephone interview this week, Dr. Hauser said Medtronic officials said nothing to him then about the company’s internal investigation. Asked to respond Friday, Medtronic issued a statement saying that fractures of heart device leads were not unusual and that at the time of the Hauser meeting it “had no data to demonstrate that there was a statistically significance difference” in failure rates between the Sprint Fidelis and the company’s other leads. Soon after meeting with Dr. Hauser, Medtronic sent a letter in March 2007 to doctors informing them of his data and saying it was investigating the issue. Two months later, Medtronic took steps to change how it manufactured the Sprint Fidelis, the F.D.A. report shows. Tim Samsel, the company’s vice president for quality and regulatory, said in a telephone interview that the manufacturing change was intended to address “acute” lead fractures at the time of implant, not the chronic fractures that eventually led Medtronic to recall the device. Between the company’s meeting with Dr. Hauser and its recall of the Sprint Fidelis, it is estimated that tens of thousands of additional patients received the device. Asked this week to review the F.D.A. report, Dr. William H. Maisel, a cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said it suggested that Medtronic long knew there were issues with the Sprint Fidelis. “In 2006, the company recognized there was a problem,” said Dr. Maisel, who has been critical of Medtronic’s handling of the lead.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » But some experts say that debate would not be occurring if federal officials, medical device makers and more doctors had thrown their weight more fully behind efforts to develop a national database of patients who get heart devices. The Obama administration has announced plans to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into studies to compare the effectiveness of competing medical treatments and devices. Monitoring patients’ outcomes through registries could be part of that process. But setting up such registries in this country has proved difficult so far. Back in 2004, Medicare required the creation of a national registry for defibrillators  devices that send out an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially deadly heart rhythm. Medicare officials made the registry a condition for approving payments for defibrillators for a new class of heart patients, despite equivocal evidence that they needed the device. The purpose of the registry was to track how many of those patients would really benefit from the devices, which can cost $25,000 or more. Despite requiring the registry, Medicare has never put any money into supporting it, said Dr. Stephen Hammill, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic who has headed the defibrillator effort. And while defibrillator makers did help support the $3 million annual cost of operating the registry in its first year, they have since cut back that financing  even though the Medicare ruling permitted them to sell tens of thousands of additional defibrillators a year. Dr. Alan Kadish of Northwestern University, who is also involved in the registry, said he did not think that manufacturers believed that they would “be fulfilling their fiduciary obligations to shareholders by funding” studies that compare the effectiveness of their devices to those of competitors. The database, which took several years to set up, is being run by two professional groups, the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society. In recent years, information on more than 340,000 people who have received defibrillators  their age, medical condition and the device they received  has been entered into it. Hospitals are now paying for the effort. In return, they are receiving reports about how their own patients’ short-term complication rates compare with nationwide rates. But the limited financial support, as well as technical problems that make it hard to merge registry information with Medicare records, have undermined the registry’s utility. Researchers, for instance, cannot compile data about patients’ longer term results  information that is critical in determining the effectiveness and reliability of defibrillators. The potential value of even a small registry in detecting device problems was shown in the case of Medtronic’s troubled product, an electrical cable known as the Sprint Fidelis lead that connects a defibrillator to a patient’s heart. Using a small registry of patients receiving defibrillators at the Minneapolis Heart Institute and a few other facilities, Dr. Robert G. Hauser, a cardiologist there, was the first to detect problems with the Sprint Fidelis. Further research by him indicated that the cables seemed to be failing in an unusually high number of patients, causing the defibrillator either to go off for no reason or to fail to deliver a shock when required. By early 2007, Dr. Hauser brought his concerns to Medtronic, which agreed to investigate. But the company did not recall the Sprint Fidelis until that October. During the intervening months, thousands of additional patients received the devices. The company said when it recalled the unit that five deaths might have linked to its problems. This week, Dr. Hauser and a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, Dr. David L. Hayes, released a study based on defibrillator patients at their two institutions, which indicated that the Sprint Fidelis was failing at a far higher rate in patients who still had the device than Medtronic had reported. The company defended its findings, which are based on its monitoring of about 20,000 patients. And the debate ensued. Dr. Kadish of Northwestern University said that a well-run national registry could easily resolve such disputes because it could look at far more patients than either the Hauser-Hayes study or Medtronic. And had such a registry been in operation, he said, it could have detected the Sprint Fidelis flaw much earlier. “It would have popped up, and it would have been easy to estimate the magnitude of the problem,” he said. The defibrillator database is now being revised so it can monitor the reliability of devices, Dr. Hammill said. And last year, the Food and Drug Administration asked that the database be expanded to track the performance of leads like the Fidelis. Researchers said they planned to test those revisions shortly, although it might take a year or more to gather enough information about device performance to make that data useful. “These registries can have an enormous role in quality and surveillance,” Dr. Hammill said.

Skip to next paragraph Related Medtronic Buys Two Companies (February 24, 2009) Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The Medtronic device, known as the Sprint Fidelis lead, is an electrical cable that connects an implanted defibrillator to a patient’s heart. The study also indicated that the component’s failure rate might be increasing over time, a potentially troubling development for patient care. More than 235,000 people received the Sprint Fidelis leads before they were recalled, and many of those patients still have them in place. The device’s flaw, which made it prone to fracturing, caused some defibrillators to deliver unnecessary shocks to a patient’s heart or to not fire when needed to send a life-saving jolt. The new study found that the Sprint Fidelis lead was still functioning in only 88 percent of the patients studied three years after being implanted. By contrast, data collected by Medtronic, using that three-year yardstick, indicated the lead continued to work in about 95 percent of patients. Medtronic released a statement on Monday saying it still believed its own figures were accurate. “It is important to note that data collected from center to center would be expected to vary,” Medtronic said. “We believe that our analyses are representative of overall Fidelis performance.” The new study, published Monday on the Web site of Heart Rhythm, a medical journal, is based on combined data from 3,000 patients from two major hospitals, the Minneapolis Heart Institute and the Mayo Clinic. Its authors are Dr. Robert G. Hauser of the Minneapolis Heart Institute and Dr. David L. Hayes of the Mayo Clinic. It was Dr. Hauser who first raised concerns that the Fidelis lead was fracturing and failing in patients several months before Medtronic recalled the component in late 2007. By then Medtronic said its failure might have been involved in five deaths. Two experts not involved in the Hauser-Hayes study said it was difficult to explain the discrepancies between the new report and Medtronic’s data. Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a cardiologist and the editor of Heart Rhythm, said one possibility for the discrepancy in malfunction rates might reflect the failure of many physicians to report component problems to Medtronic. In addition to relying on doctors’ reports of problems, the company is monitoring some 21,000 patients. As a result, a Medtronic spokesman, Christopher Garland, said that underreporting was not a problem. He also said a recent Canadian study had findings similar to the company’s. Another cardiologist, Dr. Charles Swerdlow of Los Angeles, said that the discrepancy between Medtronic’s data and the new study might be a result of physicians reading patient symptoms as caused by lead fractures when actual fractures had not occurred. In their study, Dr. Hauser and Dr. Hayes reviewed the performance of all defibrillator leads implanted at their institutions from 2004 to 2008. Of about 3,000 leads implanted during that period, the Sprint Fidelis accounted for 848 leads, or about 28 percent of the total. During the period, the annual failure rate of the Sprint Fidelis was 3.75 percent compared with 0.6 percent for other leads, the study found.

Skip to next paragraph Related Medtronic Buys Two Companies (February 24, 2009) Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The Medtronic device, known as the Sprint Fidelis lead, is an electrical cable that connects an implanted defibrillator to a patient’s heart. The study also indicated that the component’s failure rate might be increasing over time, a potentially troubling development for patient care. More than 235,000 people received the Sprint Fidelis leads before they were recalled, and many of those patients still have them in place. The device’s flaw, which made it prone to fracturing, caused some defibrillators to deliver unnecessary shocks to a patient’s heart or to not fire when needed to send a life-saving jolt. The new study found that the Sprint Fidelis lead was still functioning in only 88 percent of the patients studied three years after being implanted. By contrast, data collected by Medtronic, using that three-year yardstick, indicated the lead continued to work in about 95 percent of patients. Medtronic released a statement on Monday saying it still believed its own figures were accurate. “It is important to note that data collected from center to center would be expected to vary,” Medtronic said. “We believe that our analyses are representative of overall Fidelis performance.” The new study, published Monday on the Web site of Heart Rhythm, a medical journal, is based on combined data from 3,000 patients from two major hospitals, the Minneapolis Heart Institute and the Mayo Clinic. Its authors are Dr. Robert G. Hauser of the Minneapolis Heart Institute and Dr. David L. Hayes of the Mayo Clinic. It was Dr. Hauser who first raised concerns that the Fidelis lead was fracturing and failing in patients several months before Medtronic recalled the component in late 2007. By then Medtronic said its failure might have been involved in five deaths. Two experts not involved in the Hauser-Hayes study said it was difficult to explain the discrepancies between the new report and Medtronic’s data. Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a cardiologist and the editor of Heart Rhythm, said one possibility for the discrepancy in malfunction rates might reflect the failure of many physicians to report component problems to Medtronic. In addition to relying on doctors’ reports of problems, the company is monitoring some 21,000 patients. As a result, a Medtronic spokesman, Christopher Garland, said that underreporting was not a problem. He also said a recent Canadian study had findings similar to the company’s. Another cardiologist, Dr. Charles Swerdlow of Los Angeles, said that the discrepancy between Medtronic’s data and the new study might be a result of physicians reading patient symptoms as caused by lead fractures when actual fractures had not occurred. In their study, Dr. Hauser and Dr. Hayes reviewed the performance of all defibrillator leads implanted at their institutions from 2004 to 2008. Of about 3,000 leads implanted during that period, the Sprint Fidelis accounted for 848 leads, or about 28 percent of the total. During the period, the annual failure rate of the Sprint Fidelis was 3.75 percent compared with 0.6 percent for other leads, the study found. They also reported that the failure rate was increasing. “The hazard of the Sprint Fidelis lead is increasing, while the failure rate of other defibrillator leads are low and stable,” the two cardiologists wrote.

The risky operation went terribly wrong. As doctors extracted the device, a thin electronic cable, from the patient's heart, a vessel was punctured, causing extensive bleeding. The 33-year-old patient, Mark Turnidge, died two days later, leaving behind a wife and two young sons. ''They told me he had suffered massive brain damage,'' said his wife, Wendy Turnidge. She is considering suing the doctors, as well as the device's maker, Medtronic, which she said bore blame for her husband's death. But a Supreme Court decision last year stands as a barrier against suing medical device companies -- an obstacle that some members of Congress want to remove. At issue is a February 2008 court ruling that barred patients or their survivors from suing makers of complex medical devices -- like the Medtronic product -- if the Food and Drug Administration has approved their sale. Since that ruling judges nationwide, including the one in St. Paul, have cited it to dismiss cases against a wide range of manufacturers, including Medtronic. The most recent dismissal was this past Tuesday, by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. But now, some members of Congress want to give potential plaintiffs like Ms. Turnidge a chance for legal recourse. Two House Democrats, Henry A. Waxman of California, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the head of its health subcommittee, plan to reintroduce soon legislation that would effectively nullify the Supreme Court decision. A similar Senate bill, sponsored last year by Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, is expected to be reintroduced in coming months. The lawmakers, as well as patient advocates and others, say the Supreme Court's medical device decision has left patients legally powerless against what they criticize as spotty oversight of products by the F.D.A. ''Consumers face the worse of all possible worlds,'' said David C. Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and a medical industry watchdog. ''The F.D.A. has shown itself incapable of keeping dangerous products off the market, and now the Supreme Court has said patients can't sue companies for redress.'' Those with lawsuits dismissed since the Supreme Court ruling include a woman burned internally by a device meant to reduce menstrual bleeding; a man who sustained internal injuries from a prostrate treatment device; and numerous patients who say they were injured by faulty joints or heart implants. Mr. Pallone says he also expects the House Energy and Commerce Committee to hold hearings this session to question whether the F.D.A. process for approving devices is adequate. ''The F.D.A. has limited resources and can't assess all the risks that a device poses once it gets on the market,'' he said. Medical device producers and some conservative legal groups have lined up to oppose the legislation, which is supported by plaintiffs' lawyers. Last year, at a Congressional hearing, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a device industry trade group, said that the F.D.A. was the appropriate body to set nationwide safety standards and that allowing juries to second-guess such decisions would stifle product innovation. ''We are clearly very troubled by this legislation,'' Christopher White, the trade group's general counsel said in an interview. ''Our concern is that it would undermine the F.D.A. process.'' The Supreme Court, in a case argued last fall, is now weighing whether to give the same type of legal protections to drug manufacturers. In that case, like the one decided in February 2008, the Bush administration supported pre-empting many product liability suits against F.D.A.-approved products. In the 2008 decision, the court held that the Medical Devices Amendments of 1976 -- the statute that created a classification system under which the F.D.A. reviews medical devices -- specifically pre-empted product liability lawsuits against so-called Class III devices. Such devices are the ones receiving the F.D.A.'s highest level of safety scrutiny before the agency approves them for sale. Mr. Pallone argues that the Supreme Court misread the intent of Congress in passing the 1976 law. For consumer advocates like Professor Vladeck, at Georgetown, it is cases like Mr. Turnidge's that highlight why the absolutes of the Supreme Court's decision do not reflect the vagaries of the F.D.A. review process.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/jobs/15boss.html?ref=medtronicinc">For Medtronic’s Chief, Success That Hits Home<date>Correction: February 22, 2009Published: February 14, 2009</date><text>IN 10th grade, I pleaded with my parents to send me away to school.

The two lawmakers, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, sent a letter asking the nonprofit group that sponsors the conference, the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, for information about its financial relationships with device manufacturers and drug producers. The senators also sent a letter to Columbia University, which has an affiliation with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. Two well-known researchers at Columbia, Dr. Martin B. Leon and Dr. Gregg W. Stone, are involved with the foundation; Dr. Leon is its former chairman and Dr. Stone its current one. In a statement, the foundation said it would ''comply fully'' with the information request. ''C.R.F. is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in all of its research and educational activities and ensuring independence, objectivity and scientific rigor in all of its programs,'' the statement said. According to the foundation's most recent tax filing on the Web site guidestar.org, it had revenue in 2005 of $47.2 million. Columbia University Medical Center issued a statement saying it would respond to the request for information. ''It is important to note that Columbia University and its Medical Center have conflict of interest policies and procedures in place, and we expect that they are followed by all members of the faculty,'' the statement said. The manufacturers cited in the senators' letters are Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Medinol. The annual conference here, known as Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, has attracted hundreds of doctors from around the world who specialize in using devices that are placed in the body through catheters, most notably heart stents, the tiny devices that are used to prop open clogged arteries. At the meeting, manufacturers of stents and related surgical products or drugs display their products in an exhibition hall. The letters sent Thursday are part of a recent wave of inquiries by Senators Grassley and Kohl into potential conflicts of interests between medical researchers and drug and device companies. The lawmakers are also among those sponsoring legislation that would require the industry to more fully disclose such financial ties. In their letter to the foundation, the lawmakers also took note of a comment in an article published last November in The New York Times. In the article, a researcher, Dr. Jeffrey W. Moses, who serves on the board of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, said that the safety of heart stents ''is not the big issue any more.'' The senators wrote: ''As you are no doubt aware, there are divergent scientific opinions concerning such products, the safety and efficacy of which are a matter of dispute among cardiologists.'' The letter to the Cardiovascular Research Foundation asked the group to disclose all financing it had received since 2003 from the five device manufacturers named in the letter and also to provide documentation of any payments and benefits the foundation had provided to 22 researchers including Dr. Stone, Dr. Leon and Dr. Moses. The lawmakers asked Columbia to provide information about the disclosures those researchers had made to the institution about their income from industry sources. At the same conference on Thursday, researchers released results of a new study indicating that a drug-coated stent called Endeavor, made by Medtronic, was linked to more heart attacks and deadly blood clots than the Cypher stent made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/business/17stent.html?ref=medtronicinc">Medtronic Shares Fall on Questions About Stent<date>Published: October 16, 2008</date><text>Shares of the medical device maker Medtronic fell Thursday after a study showed that its new drug-coated stent was associated with more heart attacks and blood clots than a rival stent made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.

He noted that the study did not directly compare the two devices and that the registries raised questions about, among other things, patient complexity and optimal use of anticlotting drugs, both of which are crucial variables in driving adverse events.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Stryker Corp Zimmer Holdings Incorporated Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The amount of medical device advertising directed to consumers on television or over the Internet  an estimated $193 million last year  represents just a small fraction of the volume of consumer advertising for prescription drugs, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a consulting firm. But some experts maintain that the advertising of a medical device can have more of an impact on a patient’s well-being than a drug, because devices often require surgery to implant and may remain inside the body for years. “The results are irreversible because you are kind of stuck with a device,” said Dr. Kevin J. Bozic, a professor of orthopedics at the University of California, San Francisco. On Wednesday, the Senate Special Committee on Aging plans to hold a hearing about direct-to-consumer promotions of medical devices. Dr. Bozic, who was an author of a recent medical journal article critical of consumer advertising, is among those scheduled to testify. In a statement, the committee’s chairman, Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he was holding the hearing because he thought that the Food and Drug Administration might have to increase its scrutiny of medical device promotions, much as it had done for pharmaceutical advertisements. “The medical device industry is just beginning to get into the game,” Mr. Kohl said. David Nexon, a senior official at the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group in Washington that represents medical device makers, said the organization thought that current F.D.A. rules governing direct-to-consumer advertising were adequate. He added that while an advertisement might stimulate a patient to ask a doctor about a device, the process of receiving one involves a discussion of its benefits and risks. “You may take a pill because it doesn’t involve very much,” Mr. Nexon said. “But you don’t undergo surgery unless you think you have a serious need for it.” In 2007, spending by medical device makers on direct-to-consumer advertising was nearly double the amount in 2005, according to data provided to the Congressional Research Service by TNS. Over the last three years, a variety of device makers have started ad campaigns. Stryker, for instance, has run ads for a ceramic replacement hip, a device that some patients have since complained squeaks loudly enough to be heard while they walk. Another orthopedics maker, Zimmer Holdings, has advertised a replacement knee created for women, and Medtronic, a maker of heart devices, has run consumer promotions about heart defibrillators. At the hearing on Wednesday, an official of Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, is expected to testify that current rules requiring consumer drug advertisements to provide balance between a medication’s benefits and risks should be extended to cover medical devices.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Stryker Corp Zimmer Holdings Incorporated Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The amount of medical device advertising directed to consumers on television or over the Internet  an estimated $193 million last year  represents just a small fraction of the volume of consumer advertising for prescription drugs, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a consulting firm. But some experts maintain that the advertising of a medical device can have more of an impact on a patient’s well-being than a drug, because devices often require surgery to implant and may remain inside the body for years. “The results are irreversible because you are kind of stuck with a device,” said Dr. Kevin J. Bozic, a professor of orthopedics at the University of California, San Francisco. On Wednesday, the Senate Special Committee on Aging plans to hold a hearing about direct-to-consumer promotions of medical devices. Dr. Bozic, who was an author of a recent medical journal article critical of consumer advertising, is among those scheduled to testify.

Two insiders had said Kyphon, which Medtronic acquired in 2007, improperly persuaded hospitals to keep people overnight for a simple outpatient procedure to repair small fissures of the spine. Medicare then reimbursed the hospitals much more generously than it otherwise would have for the procedure, which was developed as a noninvasive approach that could usually be done in about an hour. By marketing its products this way, Kyphon was able to artificially drive up demand among hospitals, bolstering its revenue and driving up its stock price. Medtronic subsequently bought the company, its competitor, for $3.9 billion, greatly enriching Kyphon’s senior executives. The settlement requires Medtronic to pay the federal government $75 million plus interest, and to enter into a “corporate integrity agreement” with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agreement will require the company to give correct advice to customers about how to apply for Medicare reimbursements. The company will also have to set up internal procedures to make sure it complies with the law. The lawsuit, by two former Kyphon employees, was filed under the False Claims Act, a federal statute that allows private citizens to sue companies they believe to be cheating the government. The act was originally passed to fight profiteering during the Civil War, but in recent years it has been used to bring allegations of Medicare fraud. The medical device business is filled with small start-up companies trying to generate excitement about their new products and technologies, hoping to build market share and to attract deep-pocketed buyout offers. It has been fraught with allegations of bribes, exaggerated claims, and other unethical behavior. The acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s civil division, Gregory G. Katsas, said the settlement with Medtronic showed that the government was determined “to ensure that the Medicare Trust Fund is used to pay for necessary medical care, and is not depleted as a result of aggressive marketing schemes.” The scheme at Kyphon was based on Medicare’s practice of reimbursing hospitals more for complex inpatient back surgery than for outpatient care. The two whistle-blowers, Charles M. Bates and Craig Patrick, said Kyphon had deliberately urged doctors to admit patients overnight, knowing the admissions were unnecessary. Hospitals saw the overnight admissions as a way to raise revenue, the two said, and bought Kyphon’s products, even though they were expensive, starting at $3,500 to repair one spinal fissure. The hospitals could recover the cost through the improper reimbursements for overnight stays. Kyphon sold so much equipment this way that at one point it enjoyed a 90 percent profit margin, according to the two insiders, both of whom worked in sales positions. The former employees said the scheme began in 1999, when Kyphon’s products first came to the market. Kyphon’s rapid sales growth and profitability eventually gave rise to a patent dispute with Medtronic, which was dropped when Medtronic acquired it. The acquisition richly rewarded Kyphon’s shareholders, particularly its top executives. The company said its top 15 executives stood to receive about $145 million by cashing in their options and restricted stock. A spokeswoman for Medtronic, Marybeth Thorsgaard, said the company had known Kyphon was under investigation when it made the acquisition. She said it knew that Kyphon’s marketing strategy was being challenged, and took the risk of litigation into account. “There were no surprises,” she said. Kyphon was formed in 1994 to develop a new way of repairing small fractures of the spine, which are common in patients with osteoporosis. If not treated, such small breaks can have serious complications, including severe back pain, additional fractures and the physical deformity known as dowager’s hump. A balloon is inserted through a tiny incision and inflated to open a space at the point of the fissure. A special cement is then injected into the space, repairing the crack. The cement takes about 10 to 20 minutes to dry. Mary Louise Cohen, a lawyer representing the whistle-blowers, said patients typically walk away after the procedure and need hospitalization only in unusual cases. By 2005, when Mr. Bates and Mr. Patrick filed their complaint in Federal District Court in Buffalo, there were more than 4,500 doctors in the United States treating spinal fractures with Kyphon’s products. More than 150,000 patients worldwide had undergone the procedure, called a kyphoplasty. The vast majority were handled on an inpatient basis. Mr. Bates, of Birmingham, Ala., joined Kyphon in 2001 as a sales representative and enjoyed success at first. By showing doctors and hospitals the most lucrative ways to bill Medicare, he was able to increase Kyphon’s sales in his territory from $16,000 a month to more than $200,000 a month in less than a year, according to the lawsuit. The company gave him awards and promotions. Mr. Patrick, of Hudson, Wis., was a reimbursement manager for Kyphon, whose job was to find ways to increase insurance coverage of Kyphon’s treatment, and make sure government programs like Medicare paid for it at the maximum rate.

The equipment  automated external defibrillators  has been marketed to health-conscious consumers for its ability to provide life-saving jolts of electricity to people whose hearts have stopped beating, or are beating so chaotically and rapidly that they could die within minutes. In reporting their findings at a major cardiology meeting in Chicago and online in The New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers who conducted the trial noted that the devices clearly save lives in hospitals, emergency vehicles and in busy public settings like airports and casinos where trained employees are on duty. But the study, which included more than 7,000 patients at risk of having the seizures because of previous heart attacks, found that patients in homes equipped with the gear died at the same rate as those without it. The seizures, known as sudden cardiac arrest, strike about 125,000 Americans each year in their homes and 40,000 in public settings outside of hospitals. Unlike a heart attack, which involves a restriction of blood flow to the heart’s muscle and is often not fatal, sudden cardiac arrest is a quick killer. Some studies have shown the survival rate from such seizures in the home to be as low as 2 percent. The government-supported clinical trial used the HeartStart Home Defibrillator from Philips Medical Systems, a $1,300 device approved for over-the-counter sale. Competing defibrillators from companies like Zoll Medical, Cardiac Science and HeartSine Technologies require a doctor’s prescription, but those are easily obtainable from the medical equipment companies that distribute them. Another major competitor, the Physio-Control division of Medtronic, suspended distribution of its portable defibrillators in the United States last year while it sorted out complaints from federal regulators about its quality controls. The home defibrillators currently account for less than $20 million of the $192 million market for portable defibrillators outside of hospitals, according to Mike Arani, an analyst in San Antonio with the market research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan. Advocates of the technology had hoped that positive results from the clinical trial might encourage investments to drive down the price to as little as $500, which could lead to a surge in sales. Patients in the study  both those with the defibrillators and without them  fared surprisingly well, with fewer seizures than expected and higher than anticipated resuscitation rates. Everyone in the trial was trained to recognize the signs of sudden cardiac arrest, to call 911 immediately, and to give cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. Without immediate CPR, defibrillation is less likely to succeed. Four of 14 patients whom the HeartStart deemed in need of a shock, and who then were given it, survived, according to the researchers. But the numbers were too small to be statistically significant. The authors of the online report said that the result was “fortunate” for the handful of survivors but that any program to get defibrillators into homes would be “an inefficient strategy in public health terms.” “There was a lot to be learned in this study,” said Michael Miller Jr., the head of cardiac care for Philips Medical Systems, which is a subsidiary of Royal Philips Electronics. Among other things, he said, more than half of the incidents occurred when no one was around to witness them, suggesting a possible market for better alert systems. Mary F. Hazinski, a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association on home defibrillators, said that despite the study’s findings, home defibrillators might be a worthwhile investment in remote areas where quick emergency response was unlikely.

(March 30, 2008) Letters: Supreme Court Inc. (April 13, 2008) Times Topics: United States Supreme Court Blogrunner: Reactions From Around the Web Enlarge This Image Andy Friedman I. The headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, located across from Lafayette Park in Washington, is a limestone structure that looks almost as majestic as the Supreme Court. The similarity is no coincidence: both buildings were designed by the same architect, Cass Gilbert. Lately, however, the affinities between the court and the chamber, a lavishly financed business-advocacy organization, seem to be more than just architectural. The Supreme Court term that ended last June was, by all measures, exceptionally good for American business. The chamber’s litigation center filed briefs in 15 cases and its side won in 13 of them  the highest percentage of victories in the center’s 30-year history. The current term, which ends this summer, has also been shaping up nicely for business interests. I visited the chamber recently to talk with Robin Conrad, who heads the litigation effort, about her recent triumphs. Conrad, an appealing, soft-spoken woman, lives with her family on a horse farm in Maryland, where she rides with a fox-chasing club called the Howard County-Iron Bridge Hounds. Her office, playfully adorned by action figures of women like Xena the Warrior Princess and Hillary Rodham Clinton, has one of the most impressive views in Washington. “You can see the White House through the trees,” she said as we peered through a window overlooking the park. “In the old days, you could actually see people bathing in the fountain. Homeless people.” Conrad was in an understandably cheerful mood. Though the current Supreme Court has a well-earned reputation for divisiveness, it has been surprisingly united in cases affecting business interests. Of the 30 business cases last term, 22 were decided unanimously, or with only one or two dissenting votes. Conrad said she was especially pleased that several of the most important decisions were written by liberal justices, speaking for liberal and conservative colleagues alike. In opinions last term, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and David Souter each went out of his or her way to question the use of lawsuits to challenge corporate wrongdoing  a strategy championed by progressive groups like Public Citizen but routinely denounced by conservatives as “regulation by litigation.” Conrad reeled off some of her favorite moments: “Justice Ginsburg talked about how ‘private-securities fraud actions, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively.’ Justice Breyer had a wonderful quote about how Congress was trying to ‘weed out unmeritorious securities lawsuits.’ Justice Souter talked about how the threat of litigation ‘will push cost-conscious defendants to settle.’ ” Examples like these point to an ideological sea change on the Supreme Court. A generation ago, progressive and consumer groups petitioning the court could count on favorable majority opinions written by justices who viewed big business with skepticism  or even outright prejudice. An economic populist like William O. Douglas, the former New Deal crusader who served on the court from 1939 to 1975, once unapologetically announced that he was “ready to bend the law in favor of the environment and against the corporations.” Today, however, there are no economic populists on the court, even on the liberal wing. And ever since John Roberts was appointed chief justice in 2005, the court has seemed only more receptive to business concerns. Forty percent of the cases the court heard last term involved business interests, up from around 30 percent in recent years. While the Rehnquist Court heard less than one antitrust decision a year, on average, between 1988 and 2003, the Roberts Court has heard seven in its first two terms  and all of them were decided in favor of the corporate defendants. Business cases at the Supreme Court typically receive less attention than cases concerning issues like affirmative action, abortion or the death penalty. The disputes tend to be harder to follow: the legal arguments are more technical, the underlying stories less emotional. But these cases  which include shareholder suits, antitrust challenges to corporate mergers, patent disputes and efforts to reduce punitive-damage awards and prevent product-liability suits  are no less important.

(March 30, 2008) Letters: Supreme Court Inc. (April 13, 2008) Times Topics: United States Supreme Court Blogrunner: Reactions From Around the Web Enlarge This Image Andy Friedman I. The headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, located across from Lafayette Park in Washington, is a limestone structure that looks almost as majestic as the Supreme Court. The similarity is no coincidence: both buildings were designed by the same architect, Cass Gilbert. Lately, however, the affinities between the court and the chamber, a lavishly financed business-advocacy organization, seem to be more than just architectural. The Supreme Court term that ended last June was, by all measures, exceptionally good for American business. The chamber’s litigation center filed briefs in 15 cases and its side won in 13 of them  the highest percentage of victories in the center’s 30-year history. The current term, which ends this summer, has also been shaping up nicely for business interests. I visited the chamber recently to talk with Robin Conrad, who heads the litigation effort, about her recent triumphs. Conrad, an appealing, soft-spoken woman, lives with her family on a horse farm in Maryland, where she rides with a fox-chasing club called the Howard County-Iron Bridge Hounds. Her office, playfully adorned by action figures of women like Xena the Warrior Princess and Hillary Rodham Clinton, has one of the most impressive views in Washington. “You can see the White House through the trees,” she said as we peered through a window overlooking the park. “In the old days, you could actually see people bathing in the fountain. Homeless people.” Conrad was in an understandably cheerful mood. Though the current Supreme Court has a well-earned reputation for divisiveness, it has been surprisingly united in cases affecting business interests. Of the 30 business cases last term, 22 were decided unanimously, or with only one or two dissenting votes. Conrad said she was especially pleased that several of the most important decisions were written by liberal justices, speaking for liberal and conservative colleagues alike. In opinions last term, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and David Souter each went out of his or her way to question the use of lawsuits to challenge corporate wrongdoing  a strategy championed by progressive groups like Public Citizen but routinely denounced by conservatives as “regulation by litigation.” Conrad reeled off some of her favorite moments: “Justice Ginsburg talked about how ‘private-securities fraud actions, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively.’ Justice Breyer had a wonderful quote about how Congress was trying to ‘weed out unmeritorious securities lawsuits.’ Justice Souter talked about how the threat of litigation ‘will push cost-conscious defendants to settle.’ ” Examples like these point to an ideological sea change on the Supreme Court. A generation ago, progressive and consumer groups petitioning the court could count on favorable majority opinions written by justices who viewed big business with skepticism  or even outright prejudice. An economic populist like William O. Douglas, the former New Deal crusader who served on the court from 1939 to 1975, once unapologetically announced that he was “ready to bend the law in favor of the environment and against the corporations.” Today, however, there are no economic populists on the court, even on the liberal wing. And ever since John Roberts was appointed chief justice in 2005, the court has seemed only more receptive to business concerns. Forty percent of the cases the court heard last term involved business interests, up from around 30 percent in recent years. While the Rehnquist Court heard less than one antitrust decision a year, on average, between 1988 and 2003, the Roberts Court has heard seven in its first two terms  and all of them were decided in favor of the corporate defendants. Business cases at the Supreme Court typically receive less attention than cases concerning issues like affirmative action, abortion or the death penalty. The disputes tend to be harder to follow: the legal arguments are more technical, the underlying stories less emotional. But these cases  which include shareholder suits, antitrust challenges to corporate mergers, patent disputes and efforts to reduce punitive-damage awards and prevent product-liability suits  are no less important. They involve billions of dollars, have huge consequences for the economy and can have a greater effect on people’s daily lives than the often symbolic battles of the culture wars. In the current Supreme Court term, the justices have already blocked a liability suit against Medtronic, the manufacturer of a heart catheter, and rejected a type of shareholder suit that includes a claim against Enron. In the coming months, the court will decide whether to reduce the largest punitive-damage award in American history, which resulted from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.

The threat seems largely theoretical. But a team of computer security researchers plans to report Wednesday that it had been able to gain wireless access to a combination heart defibrillator and pacemaker. They were able to reprogram it to shut down and to deliver jolts of electricity that would potentially be fatal  if the device had been in a person. In this case, the researcher were hacking into a device in a laboratory. The researchers said they had also been able to glean personal patient data by eavesdropping on signals from the tiny wireless radio that Medtronic, the device’s maker, had embedded in the implant as a way to let doctors monitor and adjust it without surgery. The report, to published at www.secure-medicine.org, makes clear that the hundreds of thousands of people in this country with implanted defibrillators or pacemakers to regulate their damaged hearts  they include Vice President Dick Cheney  have no need yet to fear hackers. The experiment required more than $30,000 worth of lab equipment and a sustained effort by a team of specialists from the University of Washington and the University of Massachusetts to interpret the data gathered from the implant’s signals. And the device the researchers tested, a combination defibrillator and pacemaker called the Maximo, was placed within two inches of the test gear. Defibrillators shock hearts that are beating chaotically and dangerously back into normal rhythms. Pacemakers use gentle stimulation to slow or speed up the heart. Federal regulators said no security breaches of such medical implants had ever been reported to them. The researchers said they chose Medtronic’s Maximo because they considered the device typical of many implants with wireless communications features. Radios have been used in implants for decades to enable doctors to test them during office visits. But device makers have begun designing them to connect to the Internet, which allows doctors to monitor patients from remote locations. The researchers said the test results suggested that too little attention was being paid to security in the growing number of medical implants being equipped with communications capabilities. “The risks to patients now are very low, but I worry that they could increase in the future,” said Tadayoshi Kohno, a lead researcher on the project at the University of Washington, who has studied vulnerability to hacking of networked computers and voting machines. The paper summarizing the research is called “Pacemakers and Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators: Software Radio Attacks and Zero-Power Defenses.” The last part refers to defensive possibilities the researchers outlined that they say would enhance security without draining an implant’s battery. They include methods for warning a patient of tampering or requiring that an incoming signal be authenticated, using energy harvested from the incoming signals. But Mr. Kohno and Kevin Fu, who led the University of Massachusetts arm of the project, said they had not tried to test the defenses in an actual implant or to learn if anyone trying to use them might run afoul of existing patent claims. Another participant in the project, Dr. William H. Maisel, a cardiologist who is director of the Medical Device Safety Institute at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said that the results had been shared last month with the F.D.A., but not with Medtronic. “We feel this is an industry-wide issue best handled by the F.D.A.,” Dr. Maisel said. The F.D.A. had already begun stepping up scrutiny of radio devices in implants. But the agency’s focus has been primarily on whether unintentional interference from other equipment might compromise the safety or reliability of the radio-equipped medical implants. In a document published in January, the agency included security in a list of concerns about wireless technology that device makers needed to address. Medtronic, the industry leader in cardiac regulating implants, said Tuesday that it welcomed the chance to look at security issues with doctors, regulators and researchers, adding that it had never encountered illegal or unauthorized hacking of its devices that have telemetry, or wireless control, capabilities. “To our knowledge there has not been a single reported incident of such an event in more than 30 years of device telemetry use, which includes millions of implants worldwide,” a Medtronic spokesman, Robert Clark, said. Mr. Clark added that newer implants with longer transmission ranges than Maximo also had enhanced security. Boston Scientific, whose Guidant division ranks second behind Medtronic, said its implants “incorporate encryption and security technologies designed to mitigate these risks.” St. Jude Medical, the third major defibrillator company, said it used “proprietary techniques” to protect the security of its implants and had not heard of any unauthorized or illegal manipulation of them. Dr. Maisel urged that patients not be alarmed by the discussion of security flaws. “Patients who have the devices are far better off having these devices than not having them,” he said. “If I needed a defibrillator, I’d ask for one with wireless technology.” More Articles in Business »To the long list of objects vulnerable to attack by computer hackers, add the human heart.

This decision is particularly unsettling at a time when the Bush administration has been working overtime to weaken federal regulations, and regulatory agencies, and to pre-empt the power of states to impose tougher standards. In this week’s case, a New Yorker was injured when a balloon catheter made by Medtronic burst while being inserted to dilate a coronary artery. The court’s decision hinged on whether the Medical Device Amendments of 1976  which gave the F.D.A. the prime responsibility for regulating medical devices  pre-empted the right of injured patients to sue for damages in state courts. Two lower federal courts, and now eight of the nine justices of the Supreme Court, have concluded that it does, thus settling that narrow legal issue. The court’s majority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, stressed that intricate medical devices go through a rigorous assessment process in which F.D.A. experts balance their potential risks and benefits while a lay jury simply looks at the possible damage done to a patient by a device and is not concerned with its benefits to other patients. Justice Scalia’s faith in the F.D.A. far outstrips our own. The supposedly expert and rigorous reviewers at the F.D.A. are hardly infallible. They may approve marketing of a device based on questionable evidence and they are notoriously derelict about removing dangerous products once they are on the market. A slew of authoritative reports in recent years  from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the Government Accountability Office and the F.D.A.’s own science board  have found serious defects in the agency’s management, scientific capabilities and information technologies, as well as shortages of personnel and funding, all of which weaken its ability to protect the public. The mere fact that injured patients might be able to sue should provide additional pressure on companies to ensure that their products are safe and to remove them from the market should unexpected dangers emerge. And surely patients deserve a chance at fair compensation for any injuries they have suffered. When it passed the 1976 law, Congress almost certainly had no intention of removing the right to sue. Senator Edward Kennedy, the Senate sponsor of the law, and Representative Henry Waxman, who sat on the House panel that approved it, have both said that Congress had no intention of granting the manufacturers immunity from lawsuits over injuries caused by their devices. Congress should move quickly to pass corrective legislation and be prepared to do the same in other areas if the Supreme Court extends its pre-emption doctrine to drugs and other products.

Hours after the decision in the case, Riegel v. Medtronic, was announced, lawyers involved in a group of Florida state court cases related to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s drug-coated Cypher heart stent received an e-mail message from Judge Mary Barzee Flores asking for briefs on whether the lawsuits should be allowed to continue. And lawyers for patients with injuries they attribute to other devices like heart valves, artificial hips and defibrillators said they were girding for a flood of court filings from device makers like Medtronic asking judges to dismiss such lawsuits. “Medtronic probably already has summary judgment motions ready to go, and I expect to see them filed in the next few days,” said Hunter J. Shkolnik, a New York lawyer. “The next six months will be consumed fighting about such motions,” Mr. Shkolnik predicted. He represents more than 600 plaintiffs with lawsuits in state court in Minneapolis stemming from potentially faulty electrical leads Medtronic made for heart defibrillators. Lasr fall, Medtronic recalled the product, known as the Sprint Fidelis, after reports that the leads  wires that connected the device to the heart  were more prone to developing potentially deadly fractures than an older lead called the Quattro. In addition to the Sprint Fidelis and the heart stent cases  some in Massachusetts have named Boston Scientific rather than Johnson &amp; Johnson as the defendant  lawyers said Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling could also affect the course of personal injury lawsuits filed against St. Jude Medical over a silver-coated heart valve recalled in 2000. There were 19 state and federal cases pending involving the St. Jude valve as of last October, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the company, which is based in St. Paul. Other lawsuits that could be affected are ones against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Synthes over spinal disks, and Stryker over artificial hip components. Soundtec, an Oklahoma City-based producer of an implantable hearing aid, had been told just two weeks ago by the Arkansas State Supreme Court that the federal approval of its device did not protect it from a claim in state court that its design was defective. Lawyers say the Arkansas decision is now likely to be reversed. Recent settlements of large groups of lawsuits on terms relatively favorable to device makers are a sign that lawyers had been anticipating the Supreme Court outcome, according to Mark Herrmann, a Chicago lawyer who defends drug and device companies. In December, for example, Medtronic announced an agreement to pay $114.1 million to settle 2,682 injury lawsuits related to its 2005 recall of defibrillators with a defective battery. In November, Boston Scientific agreed to pay up to $240 million to settle 8,550 claims stemming from recalls of defibrillators made by a subsidiary, Guidant. Plaintiffs in those cases are free to stay out of the settlements and try to continue suing the companies. But the odds against their success are much steeper now, according to both plaintiffs and defense lawyers. The Supreme Court’s Riegel decision turned on interpretation of laws and regulations governing Class III medical devices, which include products that sustain life, prevent major health problems or might pose unreasonable risks if they malfunction. The majority of Class III devices submitted for F.D.A. consideration  hundreds each year  are variants on products like standard pacemakers that were already in the market when the main law covering devices was passed by Congress in 1976. While companies must notify the F.D.A. when introducing such products, the agency does not require extensive safety and effectiveness testing before allowing them to be sold. But many of the industry’s most sophisticated and profitable Class III devices  implants like defibrillators, newer pacemakers that balance the heart rate in different chambers of the heart, drug-coated stents to prop open arteries, artificial hips, spinal disks, knees and stimulators that control pain  are seen as so different from pre-1976 devices that they must undergo a more thorough safety and effectiveness review. In Riegel, lawyers agree, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended that such a premarket approval process  known as P.M.A.  would bar patients from filing lawsuits that in effect, second-guess regulators’ judgments about the safety and effectiveness of devices they have reviewed. P.M.A. applications may take nine months or more to be processed and may include a hearing before a panel of outside experts. The Supreme Court ruling also presumes that the labels companies develop to warn of side effects and limitations are adequate because they, too, receive F.D.A. review. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »The Supreme Court’s decision Wednesday protecting many types of medical device makers from personal injury lawsuits began rippling through the courts and law offices almost immediately.

It required a painstaking 90-minute operation here at Morristown Memorial Hospital. But thousands of other patients with failing hearts remain trapped in doubt. Their defibrillators are meant to deliver electric shocks to restore normal rhythms if their hearts start beating chaotically. Should they have the potentially faulty wire, or lead, removed  or leave it in place and hope it does not fail? And if they do have it extracted, how will they pay for it? Medtronic is limiting its contribution to only a replacement lead and $800 toward each procedure, which can cost $12,500 or more. So far insurers are deciding whether to cover the replacement operation on a case-by-case basis, unless the lead has already fractured. “This has been a nightmare,” said the Morristown patient. He described his fears and agreed to let a reporter observe the procedure on the condition that his identity remained private. The lead, called the Fidelis, is a spaghetti-thin plastic tube enclosing electrical wires and sensors. The risks of the patient’s operation, besides the possibility for infection, included potential perforation of his heart and the veins in his chest. There was also a slight danger of damaging the heart valve through which the lead had been threaded in 2005, when doctors had screwed the tip into muscle in the bottom of the right ventricle of his heart. As it turned out, the procedure went relatively smoothly. Dr. Christopher J. Magovern, the surgeon who performed the procedure, said the patient would probably soon be back on the job as a supervisor for heating and air-conditioning projects. Most Fidelis users will not end up needing such an operation, although all have been advised to check with their doctors. But the number of patients with the potentially faulty leads has made this the most widespread problem yet involving a heart device. And the episode has drawn renewed scrutiny to the way medical devices  particularly heart leads  are approved and regulated in this country. The episode has led to investigations in both houses of Congress. “It seems like a good time to figure out where we are in regulating leads and what we can do better,” said Daniel G. Schultz, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s center for devices and radiological health. Dr. Schultz will head an F.D.A. delegation at a meeting in Boston on Thursday. The conference was arranged by Dr. William H. Maisel, the director of the Medical Device Safety Institute, a research arm of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. At the session, regulators, doctors and device companies plan to share information and proposals for changing the way heart devices are approved and then monitored after they reach the market. The $5.6 billion global market for defibrillators stalled last year and has rebounded only slightly since then. The industry has been clouded by design defects and sometimes lax quality control, and by product recalls that included Guidant defibrillators in 2005 that were linked to seven deaths. Sales in the United States, which accounted for more than $4 billion of last year’s total, have also been damped by data indicating that as many as 80 percent of patients getting defibrillators never end up needing a life-saving jolt from them. The devices can cost $30,000 or more. On Oct. 15 Medtronic reported that the Fidelis lead was fracturing at a higher rate than the Quattro, a thicker lead it had been rapidly displacing since being introduced in 2004. Data suggested that 2.3 percent of Fidelis implants fracture within 30 months, meaning more than 5,000 likely malfunctions among the estimated 235,000 patients with the leads. Medtronic said that Fidelis fractures, which could prevent the defibrillator from firing when needed, had been linked in reports it received to five deaths. The fractures, which disrupted the lead’s sensing mechanism, also caused numerous unnecessary shocks. So far, the business impact has been less that Medtronic had originally forecast. Last month, the company  which gets close to 40 percent of its revenue from defibrillators, heart pacemakers and related products  said overall sales had risen 2 percent in the past year to $3.12 billion in its fiscal second quarter ending Oct. 26. Medtronic said the 11 days of business in the quarter after the Fidelis warning had resulted in $130 million in lost sales. There was an additional $31 million in write-offs and other costs, like mailing notifications to patients and doctors. The company has directly contacted 175,000 patients about Fidelis and “virtually all of the rest” through their hospitals and doctors, according to Robert Clark, a spokesman. The company moved so swiftly to shift customers back to the older Quattro lead that it now expects the total lost sales to end up below the $150 million to $250 million shortfall it had forecast. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »MORRISTOWN, N.J.  For one heart patient, there will be no more agonizing over whether the implanted device meant to save his life might kill him instead.

But during an argument on Tuesday, none of the court's many precedents appeared to offer a clear path to answering the question in the latest case: whether the manufacturer of a medical device approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration can be sued for damages under state law if the device injures a patient. The device at issue was a balloon catheter that burst during an angioplasty, causing serious injury to the patient, Charles R. Riegel. He and his wife, Donna, sued the manufacturer, Medtronic, which had received approval to market the device in 1994, two years before the incident. Two lower federal courts in New York dismissed the suit on the ground that the F.D.A.'s ''premarket approval'' precluded the imposition of liability under state law. The Supreme Court last looked at a medical device case in 1996, when it ruled that devices approved by the F.D.A. under a different, more expedited process were not shielded from state liability. At that time, the federal government itself argued against pre-emption. But in 2004, the Bush administration reversed the government's position and began to take the manufacturers' side, as it did before the justices on Tuesday in an argument by a deputy solicitor general, Edwin S. Kneedler. Explaining the change in policy, Mr. Kneedler said that in 2004, the F.D.A. ''recognized that there would be a serious undermining of F.D.A.'s approval authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits if a state jury could reweigh those.'' A question in this case, Riegel v. Medtronic Inc., No. 06-179, is whether the court will give the government's position the usual deference it accords an agency's interpretation of its basic statute. The federal law at issue is the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which in its section on pre-emption bars states from imposing on medical devices ''any requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter.'' Beginning with a case in 1992 about warning labels on cigarette cartons, the Supreme Court has treated the word ''requirement'' as including not only obligations directly imposed by state laws and regulations, but also the award of damages by state tort systems. For a jury to say, ''Well, gee, it should have been done differently in this particular situation'' is the equivalent of imposing a requirement in addition to federal approval, Theodore B. Olson, the lawyer representing Medtronic, told the justices. ''The F.D.A. is the right place for these decisions to be made and this balancing process to occur,'' Mr. Olson said, adding that while ''nothing is perfectly safe,'' it would harm consumers to ''discourage the marketing of products that might save our lives.'' Medtronic no longer makes the balloon catheter, called Evergreen, involved in the case. While Mr. Olson's argument clearly found traction with some justices, most notably Justice Antonin Scalia, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, Allison M. Zieve, was also effective in sowing doubts that ''premarket approval'' by the agency was rigorous enough to justify shielding the manufacturer from state liability. Ms. Zieve, a lawyer with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, conceded that the law would prevent a state from imposing its own premarket approval process that differs from the federal one. But she said that premarket approval was a preliminary judgment of safety and effectiveness that did not relieve a manufacturer of an obligation to make a device better and safer. Premarket approval was not ''irrelevant to the tort suit'' but was not by itself adequate to invoke pre-emption, Ms. Zieve said. Several justices, including Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and John Paul Stevens, expressed concern about shielding manufacturers during a regulatory ''hiatus,'' after a manufacturer had discovered a problem with an approved device but before the F.D.A. had learned of it or taken action. ''There could be a newly discovered risk that the F.D.A. never knew about and, nevertheless, the claim would be pre-empted?'' Justice Stevens asked Mr. Olson. ''Yes, and that's a judgment that Congress made,'' the company's lawyer replied.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/20/business/20medtronic.html?ref=medtronicinc">Medtronic Profit Tops Estimates, Despite Recall<date>Published: November 20, 2007</date><text>Medtronic said yesterday that second-quarter earnings fell 2 percent from a year ago as the recall of a component used with its implantable devices to treat abnormal heart rhythms hurt revenue.

In a letter to the agency, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, asked agency officials a series of questions about its oversight of leads, the wires that carry electrical information between an implanted defibrillator and the heart. Among other issues, Mr. Waxman asked the agency to provide information about how it determines how much to test leads before marketing and why the agency does not give leads the same scrutiny that it has given in recent years to defibrillators.

Ms. Moynahan, a branch chief at the F.D.A.s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the agency would examine whether the stress tests it currently required were sufficient to catch problems with the leads, or electrical wires, that connect implanted defibrillators to the heart. A defibrillator is designed to give a jolt to an erratically beating heart to return it to a normal rhythm. On Sunday, Medtronic urged doctors to stop using a family of leads called Sprint Fidelis because they were prone to cracking, with potentially life-threatening consequences like firing repeatedly and unnecessarily, or not sending a jolt when needed. The company has said it thinks at least five patients might have died because of the flaw and that 4,000 to 5,000 patients would encounter problems with the leads, which would force them to undergo potentially risky replacement procedures. An estimated 235,000 patients are thought to have Sprint Fidelis leads. Questions have been raised both about whether Medtronic acted quickly enough in stopping use of the leads and about whether the agency sufficiently scrutinized the Sprint Fidelis before approving it in 2004 and after it reached the market. Late Tuesday, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, sent letters to officials at Medtronic and the agency that he wanted them to meet with members of his staff to discuss their handling of the situation. What I found troubling is that Medtronic took months to stop the sales of the faulty lead, even though the problem had been reported in a peer-reviewed journal months prior, he wrote to Medtronic. Officials of Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, have insisted that they acted prudently and halted sales of the product even though they said the data they had about the products fracture rate was equivocal. Dr. Robert J. Myerburg, a professor of medicine at the University of Miami who headed an outside panel that issued a report in 2006 that was highly critical of Guidants handling of problems related to defibrillators, said it was difficult to judge how Medtronic handled the issue without knowing more information. For example, Dr. Myerburg said he would want to know how the companys anticipated rate of failure for the Sprint Fidelis compared with the reality. A Medtronic spokesman has said it anticipated that the Sprint Fidelis would perform at least as well as older leads. As for the F.D.A., Ms. Moynahan said that although the agency had required Medtronic to test an earlier version of a defibrillator lead in patients before approval, it had not required the company to do so for the Sprint Fidelis. That was because it the agency had determined that the Sprint Fidelis was not a significant, or generational, change in product design, she said. The Sprint Fidelis lead is thinner than the earlier version, the Sprint Quattro, which has performed very well. Several experts have said the thinner design of the Fidelis model is probably what makes it less durable and more prone to fracturing. Before approving it, the agency did not require clinical testing of the Fidelis. Ms. Moynahan said she believed that clinical tests would not have identified the problem, because the number of patients in the study group would have been too small and because the fracture problems developed well after implantation. Instead, the F.D.A. required the product to pass only tests intended to identify design flaws. Those were principally mechanical stress tests meant to recreate the pressures in the body. Because the Fidelis passed those tests, Ms. Moynahan said, the agency must review why the tests did not pick up the problem.

Skip to next paragraph Related F.D.A. Consumer Update on Heart Device Recall On Monday, anxious patients were doing just that, causing some doctors offices to be flooded with calls as people tried to determine whether they might have the defective models. The risk of a defective wire is low. Medtronic said that about 2.3 percent of the estimated 235,000 patients with the defective wire, or 4,000 to 5,000 people, would experience a lead fracture within 30 months of implantation. But learning through tests that ones defibrillator has a faulty lead can create agonizing decisions for patients and doctors. One decision is whether to remove the wire, a procedure that carries some risks, or leave it in place alongside a replacement. Removal carries significant risk of damage to the heart and veins through which the wire wends from the defibrillator, a generator implanted under the skin near the collarbone. When working properly, defibrillators deliver a potentially life-saving shock if the heart beats rapidly and purposelessly in a rhythm known as ventricular fibrillation. A surge from the device can restore a life-supporting heart rhythm. If the Medtronic lead, called the Sprint Fidelis, were faulty, it could simply signal the patient to check with a doctor about a possible malfunction. Or it could deliver a painful, body-rocking shock when such a jolt is not needed. Or the device could fail to deliver a life-saving shock when it is needed. The malfunction does not involve conventional pacemakers without defibrillators, Medtronic said. Dr. David R. Broudy, a cardiologist and electrophysiologist who implants defibrillators in Seattle, said Monday that he was in the habit of telling all patients about potential complications when he implants defibrillators. He said there was a 2 to 3 percent chance of complications, including serious infections and malfunctions in leads and other parts. He says he has 92 defibrillator patients who have a Sprint Fidelis lead, although on Monday he received calls from only three of them. Like other doctors, he said he would send letters alerting patients who do not call. Medtronic also said that it would send letters to all Sprint Fidelis patients. Defibrillator patients generally carry cards that contain the leads identifying numbers, which in the Medtronic recall are 6930, 6931, 6948 and 6949. Each patient is being asked to come in for computerized testing that could detect abnormalities in resistance and other electrical functions that could signal an impending fracture in the lead. In Seattle, Dr. Broudy said that in trying to assess what to do for each of his patients with the potentially defective lead, he would check factors like the number of times the device had appropriately delivered shocks and the degree of a patients anxiety. There are different needs for different patients, he said. Those who have had frequent abnormal heart rhythms, he said, may be more dependent on the device than others. Even patients in whom no evidence of possible cracks in the leads is found will need to have their Medtronic defibrillators reprogrammed. The quandary will be for those found to have a fractured lead. Doctors can insert a new lead into the vein if there is room for it, attach it to the heart, and then put a cap on the old one. The risks of surgically removing the lead depend in part on how long it has been in place. Scar tissue forms around the lead after it is implanted. Removal can produce bleeding from torn veins and damage heart muscle. The risk of such complications ranges from 1.4 percent to 7.3 percent. Dr. John Kassotis, director of cardiac electrophysiology at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said, You can definitely take the leads out if they have been in less than six months and usually if it is less than two years. Patients who do need surgical removal of the lead should go to doctors and medical centers that have extensive experience in performing such procedures, experts interviewed Monday said. Barnaby J. Feder contributed reporting from New York.

Medtronic said that about 2.3 percent of the estimated 235,000 patients with the defective wire, or 4,000 to 5,000 people, would experience a lead fracture within 30 months of implantation. But learning through tests that ones defibrillator has a faulty lead can create agonizing decisions for patients and doctors. One decision is whether to remove the wire, a procedure that carries some risks, or leave it in place alongside a replacement. Removal carries significant risk of damage to the heart and veins through which the wire wends from the defibrillator, a generator implanted under the skin near the collarbone. When working properly, defibrillators deliver a potentially life-saving shock if the heart beats rapidly and purposelessly in a rhythm known as ventricular fibrillation. A surge from the device can restore a life-supporting heart rhythm. If the Medtronic lead, called the Sprint Fidelis, were faulty, it could simply signal the patient to check with a doctor about a possible malfunction. Or it could deliver a painful, body-rocking shock when such a jolt is not needed. Or the device could fail to deliver a life-saving shock when it is needed. The malfunction does not involve conventional pacemakers without defibrillators, Medtronic said. Dr. David R. Broudy, a cardiologist and electrophysiologist who implants defibrillators in Seattle, said Monday that he was in the habit of telling all patients about potential complications when he implants defibrillators. He said there was a 2 to 3 percent chance of complications, including serious infections and malfunctions in leads and other parts. He says he has 92 defibrillator patients who have a Sprint Fidelis lead, although on Monday he received calls from only three of them. Like other doctors, he said he would send letters alerting patients who do not call. Medtronic also said that it would send letters to all Sprint Fidelis patients. Defibrillator patients generally carry cards that contain the leads identifying numbers, which in the Medtronic recall are 6930, 6931, 6948 and 6949. Each patient is being asked to come in for computerized testing that could detect abnormalities in resistance and other electrical functions that could signal an impending fracture in the lead. In Seattle, Dr. Broudy said that in trying to assess what to do for each of his patients with the potentially defective lead, he would check factors like the number of times the device had appropriately delivered shocks and the degree of a patients anxiety. There are different needs for different patients, he said. Those who have had frequent abnormal heart rhythms, he said, may be more dependent on the device than others. Even patients in whom no evidence of possible cracks in the leads is found will need to have their Medtronic defibrillators reprogrammed. The quandary will be for those found to have a fractured lead. Doctors can insert a new lead into the vein if there is room for it, attach it to the heart, and then put a cap on the old one. The risks of surgically removing the lead depend in part on how long it has been in place. Scar tissue forms around the lead after it is implanted. Removal can produce bleeding from torn veins and damage heart muscle. The risk of such complications ranges from 1.4 percent to 7.3 percent. Dr. John Kassotis, director of cardiac electrophysiology at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said, You can definitely take the leads out if they have been in less than six months and usually if it is less than two years. Patients who do need surgical removal of the lead should go to doctors and medical centers that have extensive experience in performing such procedures, experts interviewed Monday said.

But several experts said yesterday that there was no similar focus on a crucial component of those products  the wires, or leads, that connect them to the heart and convey the potentially life-saving shocks. Defibrillators are intended to deliver an electric shock, when necessary, to stabilize a dangerously erratic heartbeat. Medtronic, the market leader in defibrillators, has earned plaudits from the Food and Drug Administration and cardiologists for its announcement on Sunday, voluntarily urging doctors to stop using a family of leads known as the Sprint Fidelis, because they are prone to cracking, with potentially life-threatening consequences. An estimated 235,000 patients are thought to have Fidelis leads, and the company estimates that 4,000 to 5,000 patients  or about 2.3 percent  will experience fractures in the leads. But there are also suggestions that Medtronic, at least until relatively recently, was operating somewhat in the dark because of limited data about the problems scope. Meanwhile, F.D.A. records suggest that a patient death apparently linked to the problem occurred in 2006, well before Medtronic sent an alert to doctors. Dr. William Maisel, a heart device expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said that Medtronics warning appeared to be another instance of industry executives and regulators scrambling to catch up to a problem, rather than creating ways to anticipate it. What is frustrating here is that this was another situation that was predictable, said Dr. Maisel, who is also a consultant to the F.D.A. Yesterday, Medtronic and several of its outside consultants said that the companys decision to halt the devices use was a close call, because the available data about its failure rate was not overwhelming. We decided that the right thing to do for patients was a conservative one, said Rob Clark, a company spokesman. Medtronic paid a price in the stock market yesterday, as its shares fell more than 11 percent on news of the safety warning and after the company said it expected the problem to reduce sales in the current quarter by up to a quarter of a billion dollars. Meanwhile, an inevitable wave of personal injury lawsuits began yesterday, including one filed in federal court in Minneapolis, where Medtronic is based. The problem that Medtronic disclosed is a tendency for cracks to form in the wire, which either blocks or distorts its electrical flow. The flaws may result in faulty signals being sent to a defibrillator, causing it to unnecessarily shock the heart or, in rare instances, to fail to deliver a life-saving jolt when needed. Several medical experts said they suspected that the devices problems might reflect the fact that the Fidelis is the thinnest lead made by Medtronic. In recent years, both Medtronic and a smaller competitor, St. Jude Medical, have introduced smaller-diameter leads because some doctors prefer them, in part because they are easier to thread through a patients blood vessels. Guidant, now owned by Boston Scientific, continues to use a thicker lead. Some cardiologists said yesterday that they believed the new thinner leads might not be durable enough to survive either the pressure of implantation or the stresses exerted on them once they are in the body. Dr. Ranjit Suri, a cardiologist at New York Hospital in Queens, said he and his colleagues had stopped using all small-diameter leads, including the Sprint Fidelis, because of problems with them. We need to make sure the downsizing of leads doesnt come at a price, Dr. Suri said. In a telephone conference yesterday with analysts, Dr. David Steinhaus, a top medical officer at Medtronic, described the lead fractures as classic fatigue failures, a term that typically describes a weakening of metal exposed to repeated stress. He said the company had extensively tested the product before putting it on the market. 1 2 Next Page » Barnaby J. Feder contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic A Defective Wire Related Press Release from Medtronic on Fidelis Defibrillator Medtronic Webcast on Fidelis Defibrillator Toll-free number for patients: 800-551-5544, ext 41835 The faulty component is an electrical lead, or a wire that connects the heart to a defibrillator, a device that shocks faltering hearts back into normal rhythm. The company is urging all of the roughly 235,000 patients with the lead, known as the Sprint Fidelis, to see their doctors to make sure it has not developed a fracture that can make the device misread heart-rhythm data. Such a malfunction can cause the device to either deliver an unnecessary electrical jolt or fail to provide a life-saving one to a patient in need. In most cases, the defibrillators can be reprogrammed without surgery to minimize the problem. Medtronic estimated that about 2.3 percent of patients with the Fidelis lead, or 4,000 to 5,000 people, would experience a lead fracture within 30 months of implantation. Those patients will require a delicate surgical procedure to replace the lead, experts said. Medtronic said it would stop selling the lead and recall all leads not yet implanted. Replacing leads on a heart device like a defibrillator is considered by experts to be far more dangerous than replacing the device itself. As a result, doctors said that patients were better off leaving the lead in place except in those instances where it has stopped functioning properly. The Fidelis lead has been used with Medtronic defibrillators since 2004, and most patients who received Medtronic defibrillators since then have them. Patients who have recently had defibrillators replaced because their batteries were running down may not have the leads because doctors commonly attach replacement defibrillators to the existing leads when possible. Vice President Dick Cheney uses a Medtronic defibrillator, but it was implanted in 2001, before the Fidelis lead was introduced. The White House declined to comment last night. Questions about the performance of the Fidelis lead have surfaced before. For example, earlier this year, Dr. Robert G. Hauser of the Minneapolis Heart Institute published an analysis that found, among other things, that a significant number of patients were experiencing inappropriate shocks because their defibrillator was firing when not needed. Such jolts can be extremely painful. Dr. Hauser, who played a central role several years ago in bringing to light malfunctions in defibrillators made by Guidant, said that he discussed his findings earlier this year with Medtronic officials, who said there was not enough data to come to any conclusions. In March, however, the company issued a letter to doctors sharing those concerns with doctors. Last month, when 30 months of data showed a continuing fracture problem, Medtronic began talking with its independent medical advisers about what to do next. The numbers that we saw were not that bad, but they were worrisome, troubling, said Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine and a member of the advisory board. Statistically speaking, there is not enough data to be sure that Fidelis is unusually prone to fracture. But with mounting evidence that there was cause for concern, Medtronic decided to act now. Five deaths have been linked to the fractures as a possible, though not confirmed, contributor. The numbers suggesting that the problem was significant enough to halt sales of the lead come from two other sources: a clinical trial currently following the progress of 650 patients at 17 hospitals and the mountain of data collected from 25,000 patients in CareLink, Medtronics system for remotely monitoring implants. Medtronic said that data from fractured leads that have been returned had helped it understand where the malfunctions occur. Federal safety regulators, who participated in the announcement yesterday, endorsed Medtronics decision to stop selling the lead. Pulling this device from the market is the right thing to do, said Daniel G. Schultz, director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug Administration. The recall is the latest in a series of setbacks for Medtronic and its two main rivals in the $6 billion global defibrillator market, St. Jude Medical and Boston Scientific, which now owns Guidant. Sales have slumped in the United States in the last two years because of a string of safety recalls and concern among doctors that it is too difficult to identify which patients would benefit from the devices. They can cost $30,000 or more. Medtronic declined to discuss the potential financial impact of its actions regarding Fidelis prior to a conference call scheduled for this morning with Wall Street analysts. The company, which had $12.3 billion in sales last year, has more than 55 percent of the defibrillator market, and the devices are its biggest product. Medtronic will cover the cost of a replacement lead for those that have fractured, plus up to $800 in medical expenses that are not covered by insurance. But the company will not pay for procedures to replace functioning leads that patients want taken out to head off possible problems in the future, a company spokesman, Robert Clark, said. Mr. Clark declined to comment on how many unused leads the company expected to take back and destroy. He said Medtronic would attempt to design a similarly narrow lead to replace the current products. Medtronic is recommending that doctors switch back to its older Quattro lead, but doctors will have other options from other companies. The biggest long-term financial impact on Medtronic could come not from doctors using other leads but from the possibility that they could switch to complete defibrillator packages from other companies. Medtronic said that none of its pacemakers used the leads. Pacemakers are device that, instead of shocking a heart back into a stable rhythm, are meany to ensure a continuous steady beat. Medtronic developed Fidelis as part of the race among cardiac device companies to develop ever more compact and flexible products that can be implanted more easily and safely. Whatever happens, Medtronic is hoping to contrast its response with that of Guidant three years ago, when deadly defects were discovered in some of its defibrillators. Guidant, which Boston Scientific acquired in 2006, angered doctors and regulators by failing to quickly disclose the problems. Since then, the Heart Rhythm Society, the professional group for doctors who implant defibrillators, has developed guidelines for handling product safety problems. Dr. Schultz at the F.D.A. said the companys actions were an indicator of how much the industry had learned from the mistakes made in handling the Guidant malfunction. Dr. Hauser, the Guidant whistle-blower, agreed. I think that in the old days, this lead could have continued on the market for a long time, maybe forever, he said.

If, as expected, the Food and Drug Administration follows the panels recommendation, the devices maker, Medtronic, may be able to enter the lucrative American market for drug-coated stents by the end of this year. The market for drug-coated heart stents, with sales this year forecast at just under $2 billion by Millennium Research, is currently shared by just two companies: Boston Scientific and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Heart stents are tiny metal-mesh cylinders inserted in coronary arteries as scaffolds to keep them open after blockages have been cleared. Drug-coated stents, which do a better job than bare- metal devices in preventing blockages from re-forming, currently account for about two-thirds of coronary stent implants. The device companies have been able to charge well over $2,000 each for them, compared with $800 or less for bare-metal stents. Medtronic, based in Minneapolis, presented data to the panel suggesting that its new device, called the Endeavor, was less prone than others to having clots form inside it years after being implanted. Such potentially deadly clotting, known as late stent thrombosis, is rare. But fears about it have driven down sales of drug-coated stents from Boston Scientific and Johnson &amp; Johnson more than 30 percent in the last year. Endeavors apparent safety advantage, however, was based on relatively short-term data. And the trials suggested that Endeavor, which releases its drug unusually quickly  95 percent of it within 10 days  is less effective at keeping blood vessels wide open than the Taxus stent from Boston Scientific or the Cypher from Johnson &amp; Johnson. It is unclear whether that difference may lead to potential long-term performance differences. Analysts have estimated that Endeavor could grab anywhere from 12 percent to 18 percent of the domestic drug-coated stent market in its first year. An unknown factor is the impact of the timing of approval for a fourth drug-coated stent, the Xience V from Abbott Laboratories. Boston Scientific plans to be a co-marketer of it, under the Promus brand name. Abbott has less long-term safety and performance data, but many doctors have said Xience is easier to insert than Endeavor and does a better job of preserving blood flow. Abbott hopes to get Xience reviewed by the same advisory panel at the end of November and has forecast that the F.D.A. will let it begin selling the device in the first half of next year.

Medtronic defended the continuing payments as legitimate compensation for work the doctors have done. Medtronic said it welcomed the opportunity to speak with Mr. Grassley and his staff. The company also said the payments had been made in the normal course of working with doctors on the best use and design of new medical devices. Innovation in medical devices does, in fact, depend on the input of the physician, a Medtronic spokesman, Robert Clark, said. In the case that led to last years settlement, the Justice Department accused Medtronic of paying kickbacks through what government officials described as sham consulting agreements, sham royalty agreements and lavish trips to desirable locations offered to doctors from 1998 to 2003. In the settlement, Medtronic denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Grassley, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the federal Medicare program, sent a letter to Medtronics chief executive last week, asking the company to explain its payments to the surgeons after 2003. He also asked the company to explain its financing of organizations involved in providing continuing medical education to these doctors. Transparency builds trust, and full disclosure about the dollars that device makers give to doctors would let patients know if they should be more or less concerned about a doctors allegiance to a particular product line, Mr. Grassley said yesterday. Medtronics payments to surgeons appear to have continued for at least several months after the settlement was reached in July 2006. Through much of 2006, the companys payments included nearly $6 million in consulting fees to dozens of doctors, according to the whistle-blowers lawyer, Andrew R. Carr Jr. of the firm Bateman Gibson in Memphis, who obtained a list of payments from a former Medtronic employee. Mr. Carr filed a lawsuit in 2003 on behalf of Jacqueline Kay Poteet, who managed travel services for Medtronics spinal device business. In early 2006, Mr. Carr filed an additional lawsuit on Ms. Poteets behalf, a supplemental complaint that accused the company of continuing to use these improper payments in 2004 and 2005. The 2006 documents clearly appear to confirm the allegations of my supplemental complaint, Mr. Carr said. He said he had alerted members of Congress to what he sees as an inadequate investigation of his clients claims by the Justice Department. The enormous sham consulting payments continue unabated to this date, Mr. Carr said. Nothing has changed. The Justice Department declined to comment on Mr. Carrs accusations. In recent months, Mr. Grassley has raised many questions about the large sums of money paid to doctors by drug and medical device companies. In August, he introduced legislation that would require payments for consulting, lectures, attendance at seminars and the like to be made public through a federal registry, allowing colleagues and patients to see a doctors financial ties with particular manufacturers. In the case of Medtronic, several doctors received six-figure fees from the company in 2006, according to the list of payments. One, Dr. Hallett H. Mathews, a prominent spine surgeon in Virginia, received nearly $300,000 in the first 10 months of 2006. Dr. Mathews had received payments of nearly $700,000 for the first nine months of 2005, according to previous documents supplied by the whistle-blower. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 27, 2007, on page C3 of the New York edition.An influential senator is raising new questions about payments made to spine surgeons by Medtronic, one of the nations largest makers of medical devices.

Collins Jr. steps down as chief executive of Medtronic at the companys annual meeting tomorrow, his successor, William A. Hawkins, will have plenty of reasons to praise and thank him. But many Medtronic shareholders may be happy to see Mr. Collins go. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Slow Growth Since Mr. Collins moved up to chief executive from president and chief operating officer in 2001, Medtronics annual sales have more than doubled, to $12.3 billion, and earnings have surged to $2.41 a share from 85 cents. But Medtronics stock price has suffered from the companys missed earnings estimates, delays in getting new products to market and unexpectedly weak demand for its implantable heart-regulating devices. Yesterday, after the company reported first-quarter sales of those devices that were weaker than expected, the shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. During Mr. Collins tenure the shares have underperformed the average stock in the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index. We wonder if Hawkinss leadership will usher in a new attitude or a new approach or a new tone or even a new outlook for a company that seems to have it all going for it but cant seem to make investors happy, Daniel Owczarski, an analyst at Soleil Securities in Chicago, wrote in a June report to clients. Mr. Collins, 59, has preferred to cite the companys dominance of the markets for implanted electrical devices that treat failing hearts, chronic pain, incontinence and brain disorders like Parkinsons disease. He began his tenure with the acquisition of MiniMed, the largest maker of insulin pumps, adding the huge diabetes market to the portfolio of chronic diseases the company addresses. And he punctuated his last weeks by agreeing to pay $3.9 billion to buy Kyphon, which makes devices to treat spinal fractures and disk compression, a deal that will cement Medtronics lead in orthopedic spine therapies when it closes next year. Medtronic, based in Minneapolis, has also enhanced its reputation for merging diverse technologies into new products. Many of its products combine drugs with devices. It is also a leader in linking wireless communications with pumps, diagnostic devices and implants so that doctors can track patients remotely over the Internet. Its the premier medical device company in the world, said Timothy B. Nelson, an analyst who follows the cardiovascular portion of the device business for Piper Jaffray &amp; Company. But Wall Street hopes Mr. Hawkins, 53, who has been president, chief operating officer and heir apparent since 2004, will have better luck with Medtronics stock than Mr. Collins, who plans to stay on as chairman for another year. For all the growth in sales and earnings, shares of Medtronic, which ended regular trading at $52.86 yesterday, down 16 cents, produced a total return including dividends of only about 25 percent under Mr. Collins. They consistently overpromised and under-delivered, said Glenn Reicin, a device industry analyst at Morgan Stanley who has predicted the company will continue to underperform the market under Mr. Hawkins. One current sign of perpetual overoptimism, Mr. Reicin said, is the companys forecast that the Food and Drug Administration will clear Medtronic to sell its drug-coated Endeavor heart stent in the United States before the end of the year. Endeavor was originally forecast to arrive in 2005. But Mr. Reicin said there was no way the F.D.A. would approve it before 2008, and by that time, Abbott Laboratories will be close to entering the market with Xience V, a device many doctors prefer. Perhaps the biggest drag on the company has been the unexpected sales slump for its most sophisticated heart devices: implanted cardioverter defibrillators that monitor the rhythms of failing hearts and provide life-saving shocks when heartbeats become dangerously rapid or chaotic. The devices are the flagship product of cardiac rhythm management, a field that includes implanted pacemakers, which Medtronic introduced in the 1960s. But cardiac rhythm implants accounted for just under 40 percent of Medtronics sales in the fiscal year that ended April 27. The slump began in 2005 after reports of occasionally deadly malfunctions in cardioverter defibrillators from Guidant, Medtronics biggest competitor. Guidant was slow to disclose the problems to doctors. Concerns about the devices increased when Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, the third major device maker, discovered defects requiring a recall of some products. Medtronics sales of the devices, which cost as much as $35,000, declined 1 percent, to $2.92 billion, in the last fiscal year. Yesterday, in reporting first-quarter results after the markets close, the company said sales of the cardioverter defibrillators in the period were weaker than expected, at $726 million. There has been much debate over whether Medtronic and other device makers have overestimated the size of the potential market for the devices. While they undeniably save lives, it remains hard to predict which patients will benefit. Some studies show that up to 80 percent of those who receive the implants never need a life-saving shock, although many of them suffer occasional unnecessary jolts. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on August 22, 2007, on page C4 of the New York edition.When Arthur D.

LOUISE KRAMER ABOUT THOSE EARNINGS Federal securities regulators filed civil charges last week against three former executives of Nicor, a major natural-gas distributor, accusing them of a three-year scheme to manipulate earnings. The charges, filed in Federal District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, were lodged against Thomas L. Fisher, the former chief executive; Kathleen Halloran, the former chief financial officer; and George Behrens, the former treasurer. Securities officials are asking for financial penalties and seeking to bar all three from serving as officers or directors of public companies. Mr. Fisher retired from Nicor in November 2005 after working there 38 years. Ms. Halloran retired in August 2004, and Mr. Behrens resigned in June 2006. In a statement released by his lawyer, Dan Reidy, Mr. Fisher said, I look forward to demonstrating in court that I did not violate the securities laws in any way whatsoever. Ms. Halloran has always acted properly, said her lawyer, Ann Tighe. Ms. Tighe said she was confident that Ms. Halloran would be exonerated. A lawyer for Mr. Behrens could not be reached. In July, Nicor, based in Naperville, Ill., paid a $10 million fine for disputed accounting for natural-gas costs. A former controller, Jeffrey L. Metz, also settled and agreed to pay a $60,000 penalty. The Securities and Exchange Commission contends that a fraud scheme began in 1999 as a way for Nicor to illegally profit from its natural-gas inventories. The three executives are accused of engaging in, or approving, improper transactions, and of making misrepresentations in financial statements and documents filed with federal securities regulators.

About 150 aspiring teachers have been taking a five-day advanced-training math and science seminar, which ends today, at St. Johns University in New York. Participants are about to begin a two-year stint teaching in a public school. Last year, Medtronic gave $250,000 to recruit math and science teachers for Teach for America.

The companies said that Medtronic would also become responsible for an additional $320 million allocated to fulfilling the terms of Kyphons acquisition of two smaller device companies. Kyphon makes a catheter that is inserted where a segment of backbone has collapsed from injury or illness. A balloon is then inflated to restore the bone to a more normal position. Once the space is created, the balloon is withdrawn and cement is inserted to keep the bone in place while the patient heals. Kyphon reported yesterday that sales in its second quarter this year reached $144.3 million, more than 40 percent higher than a year ago. About half the growth came from its vertebral compression procedure, which is called kyphoplasty, and half from the acquisition in January of St. Francis Medical Technologies, which developed a spacer that reduces pressure on diseased spinal disks and the surrounding bone. Medtronics offer for Kyphon, in cash and assumed debt, values the company at $71 a share, a 32 percent premium over the closing price on Thursday of $53.68. Kyphons shares rose $12.92, to $66.60. Shares of Medtronic fell 11 cents, to $50.81. The deal is expected to close early next year. In addition to reinvigorating Medtronics spine subsidiary, which has slowed to single-digit sales growth this year, the deal is seen by some analysts as a harbinger of a new wave of acquisitions in the medical device industry. Medtronic is one of several major device makers that led consolidation in the cardiovascular device industry. It continues to generate big profits from products like implantable defibrillators, but growth rates in the cardiovascular business have plunged from the mid-20s to about 7 percent in recent years, said Thomas J. Gunderson, who follows the industry for Piper Jaffray &amp; Company in Minneapolis. Hence, Mr. Gunderson said, Medtronic and cardiovascular rivals like Johnson &amp; Johnson have both the incentives and the cash to go on a shopping spree for smaller, faster-growing device companies. Even before the Kyphon deal was announced, Lawrence Biegelsen, who follows devices in New York for Wachovia Capital Markets, had singled out spine products as an area ripe for consolidation. He noted that leaders like Medtronic and the DePuy subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson were losing market share to smaller companies, Medtronic entered the spine business when it acquired Sofamor Danek for $3.3 billion in 1999. Its current spinal products are sold primarily to middle-age patients with problems like scoliosis and degenerating disks. Kyphon, by contrast, has focused mostly on elderly patients since it was founded in 1994. It has also cultivated ties to thousands of spine specialists trained in radiology who operate with catheters rather than traditional surgical tools  a group that Medtronic has so far rarely approached with its products. The deal would mean an end to patent litigation between the two companies that some analysts had predicted Medtronic would lose. I think thats the main reason for this acquisition, said Alexander K. Arrow of Lazard Capital Markets. Medtronic has been trying for five or six years to get around Kyphons intellectual property. This was the one patient niche in spine they couldnt get into. Arthur D. Collins Jr., chairman and chief of Medtronic, denied in an interview that Kyphons patent position had been a major driver of the deal. Medtronic said the deal would not add to its profits before the fiscal year ending in April 2009. Richard W. Mott, Kyphons president and chief executive, said that joining Medtronic would be particularly helpful in expanding kyphoplasty in overseas markets like Japan, where Kyphon has just completed clinical trials, but has few employees. He said Medtronic would help draw attention to the problem of vertebral compression, which can cause pain, numbness or tingling, weakness and urinary problems. More than half of the people suffering compression from osteoporosis are undiagnosed, Mr. Mott said. We dont have the resources to reach a lot of them. More Articles in Business »Medtronic, a major medical device maker, said yesterday that it had agreed to purchase Kyphon, which sells a minimally invasive therapy for spinal compression and fractures, for $3.9 billion.

Medtronics offer for Kyphon, in cash and assumed debt, values the company at $71 a share, a 32 percent premium over the closing price on Thursday of $53.68. Kyphons shares rose $12.92, to $66.60. Shares of Medtronic fell 11 cents, to $50.81. The deal is expected to close early next year. In addition to reinvigorating Medtronics spine subsidiary, which has slowed to single-digit sales growth this year, the deal is seen by some analysts as a harbinger of a new wave of acquisitions in the medical device industry. Medtronic is one of several major device makers that led consolidation in the cardiovascular device industry. It continues to generate big profits from products like implantable defibrillators, but growth rates in the cardiovascular business have plunged from the mid-20s to about 7 percent in recent years, said Thomas J. Gunderson, who follows the industry for Piper Jaffray &amp; Company in Minneapolis. Hence, Mr. Gunderson said, Medtronic and cardiovascular rivals like Johnson &amp; Johnson have both the incentives and the cash to go on a shopping spree for smaller, faster-growing device companies. Even before the Kyphon deal was announced, Lawrence Biegelsen, who follows devices in New York for Wachovia Capital Markets, had singled out spine products as an area ripe for consolidation. He noted that leaders like Medtronic and the DePuy subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson were losing market share to smaller companies, Medtronic entered the spine business when it acquired Sofamor Danek for $3.3 billion in 1999. Its current spinal products are sold primarily to middle-age patients with problems like scoliosis and degenerating disks. Kyphon, by contrast, has focused mostly on elderly patients since it was founded in 1994. It has also cultivated ties to thousands of spine specialists trained in radiology who operate with catheters rather than traditional surgical tools  a group that Medtronic has so far rarely approached with its products. The deal would mean an end to patent litigation between the two companies that some analysts had predicted Medtronic would lose. I think thats the main reason for this acquisition, said Alexander K. Arrow of Lazard Capital Markets. Medtronic has been trying for five or six years to get around Kyphons intellectual property. This was the one patient niche in spine they couldnt get into. Arthur D. Collins Jr., chairman and chief of Medtronic, denied in an interview that Kyphons patent position had been a major driver of the deal. Medtronic said the deal would not add to its profits before the fiscal year ending in April 2009. Richard W. Mott, Kyphons president and chief executive, said that joining Medtronic would be particularly helpful in expanding kyphoplasty in overseas markets like Japan, where Kyphon has just completed clinical trials, but has few employees. He said Medtronic would help draw attention to the problem of vertebral compression, which can cause pain, numbness or tingling, weakness and urinary problems. More than half of the people suffering compression from osteoporosis are undiagnosed, Mr. Mott said. We dont have the resources to reach a lot of them.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/technology/18medtronic.html?ref=medtronicinc">2nd Medtronic Neck Disk Wins Panel Approval<date>Published: July 18, 2007</date><text>Medtronic, which late Monday became the first medical device maker cleared to sell an artificial neck disk in the United States, may also become the first company to sell a device that would compete with it. An independent panel of orthopedics experts recommended late yesterday by a 7-1 vote that the Food and Drug Administration approve the second device, the Bryan cervical disk, a newer design. The company says the Bryan more closely resembles a natural spinal disk than the Prestige ST disk that the F.D.A. cleared for sale a day earlier. Both the Prestige and Bryan devices are already in use in Europe. Analysts said that the expert panels recommendation was unlikely to translate into full F.D.A. approval of the Bryan before winter, but yesterdays vote confirmed Medtronics commanding head start in the race to move artificial disk technology from the lower spine, where the products have been a disappointment, into the upper spine, where many doctors think the disks have a better chance of becoming a popular alternative to spinal fusion. Estimates of the number of cervical, or upper spine, fusions performed annually in the United States are as high as 250,000. Although Wall Street expects a cautious response from insurers and surgeons to lead to slow growth initially, some analysts say the market for the cervical devices could eventually top $1 billion. The news yesterday was not all good for Medtronic, though. In a separate development, the F.D.A. posted on its Web site a warning letter that the agency sent the company last week detailing a range of device safety reporting and monitoring violations at the Minneapolis factory where the company makes implantable pumps to control pain. Among other things, the agency cited Medtronic for failing to follow up on at least 37 reports from doctors, patients or patients families of potential injuries like lower limb paralysis that may have been linked to problems with the pumps. The company received a separate F.D.A. warning letter about manufacturing violations at the same plant last year. Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, said it was working with the agency on both warnings. While spinal products have been an important growth area for the company, its primary focus remains cardiovascular devices like its implanted defibrillators and the drug-coated Endeavor stent, which it expects to bring to the American market within the next year. Artificial cervical disks like Prestige and Bryan can relieve conditions like numbness in the arms or the disabling pain sometimes associated with degeneration of the disks in the upper spine. Such relief can often be obtained by fusing the bones around the diseased disk if rest, drugs and exercise fail to help. But patients receiving the disks may recover more quickly than those who undergo fusion and often retain more flexibility in their necks. We wanted to place our bets in more than one area, said Peter L. Wehrly, president of Medtronics spinal and biologics group, when asked why the company had invested in two different cervical disk designs. The Prestige is made of stainless steel, while the Bryan consists of a dense polymer core and titanium end plates meant to more closely resemble a natural disk. The Prestige is approved for replacing only a single disk. The company said the Bryan was likely emerge as the better design for patients needing multiple disks replaced. Skeptics said doctors may be reluctant to steer patients away from fusion because of its high success rate and relatively good insurance coverage. Cervical disk implantation is likely to end up costing patients  or insurers  about as much as fusion surgery, which is about $32,000, according to Medtronic.

Although the appeal will most likely turn on the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the 1976 medical devices amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the case is part of a broader debate in Washington over the extent to which the Bush administration and Congress may preclude the states from imposing consumer regulations that are more stringent than the federal government’s. Federal agencies under the control of Bush administration appointees have sought to adopt regulations covering matters as diverse as auto safety and medicine labeling to preclude active state prosecutors and trial lawyers from bringing lawsuits that would impose higher safety standards. An array of agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, have proposed or adopted rules that would make it more difficult for consumers to bring lawsuits under state laws that are more favorable to victims than are federal regulations. Critics of the Bush administration say that the approach strips consumers of valuable state protections. Supporters say the federal effort to pre-empt the states sets uniform national standards and discourages overzealous state prosecutors. In the case before the Supreme Court, both the Bush administration and the defendant company, Medtronic, had urged the justices to reject the appeal of a patient who was injured when a balloon catheter it made ruptured during an angioplasty in 1996. The patient, Charles R. Riegel, and his wife, Donna, sued Medtronic for a variety of state tort law violations, including negligent design and breach of warranty. The company maintained that Mr. Riegel’s surgeon should not have used the balloon catheter because of Mr. Riegel’s condition and that the surgeon used the device in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. Both a Federal District Court and a Federal Appeals Court in New York dismissed most of the Riegels’ claims. Those courts concluded that because the F.D.A. had approved the balloon catheter after a rigorous review and before it went to market, injured patients could not file claims against Medtronic under state law. The medical devices amendment forbids a state from adopting any requirement “which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement” in federal law. Federal courts around the nation have taken different views of whether that provision bars state law damage claims against medical devices approved by the F.D.A. The issue has so confounded the courts that three appeals courts reviewing the same medical device made by the same company have reached two different conclusions about whether patients could bring a lawsuit. Lawyers involved in the Medtronic case say they expect the court to hear from manufacturers and business groups in support of Medtronic, as well as from states and consumer organizations on behalf of the patient who was injured. The case, Riegel v. Medtronic, No. 06-179, is expected to be heard by the court in the fall. A group of similar cases involving drugs is moving through the courts.

The preliminary decision, which is expected to become final in August, extends to the ProDisc-L made by Synthes a national coverage ban imposed a year ago on the Charité lumbar disk made by Johnson &amp; Johnson; the Food and Drug Administration cleared the Pro Disc-L for sale last summer. It also signaled that Medicare will not cover Medtronics Maverick lumbar disk when that device reaches the market. Yesterdays decision applies to patients over 60, which is most of the 43 million people Medicare covers. Local administrators of Medicare benefits will continue to be able to pay for the devices in younger disabled patients on a case by case basis. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that administers Medicare, said that none of the clinical trials used to gain F.D.A. approval of the devices included patients over 60, leaving Medicare with no basis for saying the devices were a reasonable or necessary therapy for such patients. Information on safety in real-world patient situations is essential for informed choice, the agency said in the memorandum summarizing its proposed decision. Wall Street had foreseen the dawn of a major new orthopedics market when the Charité artificial disk received F.D.A. approval in October 2004. The disks were seen as a potential alternative for as many as 25 percent of the 220,000 Americans who annually undergo spinal fusion surgery to deal with severe and chronic lumbar pain. But sales have been disappointing. Insurers have continued to classify the devices as experimental, and many refuse to cover the cost of the implant procedure, which can run more than $10,000 per disk and several times that amount in hospital and doctors fees. Some patients have filed lawsuits claiming they have been injured by the Charité and, in an effort to distinguish itself, Synthes has been ramping up its marketing far more slowly than Johnson &amp; Johnson. Like the Charité, the ProDisc consists of metal end plates around a hard plastic core. Synthes and doctors supporting it had argued that its design makes it easier to implant the disk and keep it firmly anchored. That might make it harder to remove if necessary, but could also make the ProDisc less prone to wear and to displacements requiring remedial surgery. Synthes, based in Switzerland, had also argued that ProDisc had achieved better results than Charité in comparison to spinal fusion in its trials. But Medicare officials said that the comparisons to spinal fusion were not decisive because it has not been proven that fusion is better than no treatment beyond rest and exercise in dealing with degenerative disk disease. The agency also found that one commonly claimed advantage of the disks  that they preserve more freedom of motion in the spine than fusion  also has not been proven in rigorous studies.

Net income increased to $812 million, or 70 cents a share, for the quarter that ended on April 27, from $740 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier, the company, based in Minneapolis, said. Profit beat analysts’ estimates. Sales of Medtronic’s market-leading defibrillators grew 1.6 percent from a year earlier, to $770 million, the company said. The results do not signal an end to a defibrillator sales slump that began last year, one analyst said, because Medtronic pushed its staff to increase sales at the end of its fiscal year. That added product to customers’ inventories in a practice called channel stocking. In September, Medtronic began a $100 million promotional campaign to increase sales of the $30,000 devices, after recalls prompted caution among doctors and patients and hurt fiscal first-quarter sales. “Little good can come out of this quarter,” said Glenn M. Reicin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, in a note to clients. “Strong growth will only magnify the channel stocking issues that management has been denying all along” and raise concern that demand will fall in the next quarter, he said. Defibrillators are stopwatch-size devices put in the chest to shock stopped hearts back to normal rhythm. Medtronic holds about half of the $5.6 billion-a-year defibrillator market, followed by Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. The earnings were released after the markets closed. Shares of Medtronic rose 23 cents, to $50.80. Profit of 66 cents a share, excluding some items, beat the 62-cent average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Skip to next paragraph Edward J. Ludwig Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » For most of his 27 years with the company, Edward J. Ludwig, 55, an accountant by training, had an equally modest public profile. But Mr. Ludwig, who became president in 1999, chief executive in 2000 and chairman in 2002, has moved further into the spotlight as his company has grown. This year, he succeeded Arthur D. Collins Jr., chairman and chief executive of Medtronic, as chairman of AdvaMed, the worlds largest medical technology association. Mr. Ludwig spoke recently about his companys product line and its acquisition of GeneOhm Sciences last year. Following are excerpts: Q. How would you describe Becton, Dickinsons position in the device industry? A. Were in the middle of the food chain in terms of technical sophistication, but were moving north. The life cycles in some of the industrys most technical products like implanted devices are extraordinarily short so you can see huge swings in market share. Im not sure we want to go that far from our steadier growth. When you make 25 billion needles a year, you develop manufacturing expertise. So we use manufacturing as a competitive advantage. There are other companies with single safety products. We make them in an enormous array at high quality and at low prices. Q. Is there a unifying theme to the way the company is growing? A. Weve been most successful where we apply technology to an underappreciated health problem. For example, about 15 years ago, we began advocating on behalf of health care safety. We invested $500 million to produce safety-engineered devices to protect doctors and nurses like shields, sliding clasps, needles that retract into the device  all sorts of things that make the needle unable to hurt anyone. Q. What problems are currently underappreciated in this country? A. Health care-associated infections is a growing problem. We have 2 million infections a year from M.R.S.A. [an antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria] alone with 80,000 to 90,000 deaths. Its costing the health care system $6 billion to treat these infections. It can cost a hospital $40,000 for a single such infection. Hospitals get reimbursed just $10,000 to treat it, and thats probably going to go away. Medicare is taking the view that a hospital shouldnt have the problem if it is delivering good health care. Q. And how is Becton, Dickinson going after that problem? A. One thing is active surveillance for it, which is why we acquired GeneOhm. They have a real-time diagnostic system that can identify M.R.S.A. in two hours with more than 90 percent accuracy. Its a simple nasal swab. Dr. Lance Peterson at Evanston Northwestern Hospital has been using it on everyone coming into the hospital. Theyve reduced M.R.S.A. by 60 percent. When they find a case, they isolate the person. The industry is at a tipping point on this. For example, the Veterans Administration is about to require active surveillance in its hospitals. We are investing over $30 million over the next couple of years to build a new factory in Quebec where GeneOhms device is made. Q. Arent these new tests expensive? A. Not compared to the cost of dealing with an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in your hospital. But its true, our garden-variety prepared plated media sell for 50 cents to $1 apiece. The chrome agar plate we developed for M.R.S.A. sells for $7. And the molecular tests we acquired with GeneOhm that get answers in two hours can cost $20 to $25. To sell it you have to find the right person in the hospital. You have to get to the chief operating officer, chief financial officer or the head of infection control as opposed to a purchasing agent. Weve also developed the software tools to help them track their infection patterns and rates. Q. Arent you increasingly dependent on acquisitions for innovations? A. Making the right acquisitions has become more and more challenging. But it works both ways. Once you become broad and deep in a space, you become the logical partner to come to. You get in the deal flow. Entrepreneurs know we have the ability to scale up and improve manufacturing.

We are investing over $30 million over the next couple of years to build a new factory in Quebec where GeneOhms device is made. Q. Arent these new tests expensive? A. Not compared to the cost of dealing with an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in your hospital. But its true, our garden-variety prepared plated media sell for 50 cents to $1 apiece. The chrome agar plate we developed for M.R.S.A. sells for $7. And the molecular tests we acquired with GeneOhm that get answers in two hours can cost $20 to $25. To sell it you have to find the right person in the hospital. You have to get to the chief operating officer, chief financial officer or the head of infection control as opposed to a purchasing agent. Weve also developed the software tools to help them track their infection patterns and rates. Q. Arent you increasingly dependent on acquisitions for innovations? A. Making the right acquisitions has become more and more challenging. But it works both ways. Once you become broad and deep in a space, you become the logical partner to come to. You get in the deal flow. Entrepreneurs know we have the ability to scale up and improve manufacturing.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/02/business/02device.html?ref=medtronicinc">A Remote Heart Monitor Fails to Impress an F.D.A. Panel<date>Published: March 2, 2007</date><text>Medicines march toward remote monitoring of patients hit at least a temporary roadblock yesterday. An implanted wireless device intended to continuously monitor patients with weak hearts  and then provide the data to doctors via the Internet  did not keep enough of them out of the hospital to prove its effectiveness, according to a panel of experts assembled by the Food and Drug Administration. The devices manufacturer, Medtronic, has been developing wireless data-gathering technology for implanted therapeutic devices like defibrillators and insulin pumps. It aimed to make the product reviewed yesterday, a device the size of a pocket watch and known as the Chronicle implantable hemodynamic monitor, the first major implant approved solely for diagnostic monitoring. The Chronicle monitors blood pressure and other conditions inside the hearts of patients suffering heart failure, a disease that reduces the amount of blood the heart pumps. The goal is to warn patients, their doctors and other people who care for them when they are in danger at a point before they need to be hospitalized. Rising blood pressure can be caused by something as simple as eating too much salty food, which leads to water retention. If the rising pressure is caught in time, many patients can be stabilized at home with drugs or behavior changes. Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, estimated that as many as 400,000 of the nations 5 million heart patients were sick enough to benefit from the implant. But the clinical trial, which enrolled just 274 patients, did not show a big enough reduction in hospital visits among Chronicle patients to be sure that it was helping. There was agreement that this technology has a lot of promise, said Rob Clark, a spokesman for Medtronic. Were going to come back to the F.D.A. and explore other ways to bring this to market. Skeptics have wondered how closely doctors would look at the flood of data if the product was approved, because health care providers are not reimbursed for such monitoring. The advice to deny approval of the device is not binding on the F.D.A. But the agency rarely overrides such recommendations, particularly when they come on a vote as strong as yesterdays 9-2 decision. Medtronics shares declined 21 cents, to $50.15, in trading yesterday, which ended before the panels vote was announced. The shares fell an additional 30 cents in after-hours trading.

Panel Supports Artificial Disks for Upper Spine<date>Published: September 20, 2006</date><text>GAITHERSBURG, Md., Sept. 19  An independent panel of reviewers voted unanimously Tuesday to recommend that federal medical regulators approve the first artificial replacement for failing disks in the upper spine. Skip to next paragraph Small BusinessGo to Special Section » The panel told the Food and Drug Administration that the stainless steel device, made by Medtronic, performed at least as well in its clinical trials as spinal fusion  a common surgical procedure. But the group attached several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that Medtronic perform additional safety studies if the product goes on the market. While the F.D.A. is not required to follow the panel’s recommendation, the agency is expected to approve Medtronic’s application by next spring. Analysts are forecasting that Medtronic would then grab an early lead in what some analysts estimate could become a $1 billion market in the next decade. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Synthes, Stryker and numerous smaller device companies are also developing upper spine, or cervical, disks. Analysts estimate that 250,000 cervical fusion operations are performed annually in the United States. The artificial disks are meant to address conditions like numbness in the arms in addition to the severe pain and immobility sometimes associated with disk degeneration. Tuesday’s panel recommendation comes nearly two years after Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced the first artificial disk, a device for the lower, or lumbar, portion of the spine called the Charité. That disk has run into strong resistance from insurers and criticism from some surgeons who say it is an unacceptably hazardous alternative to spinal fusion. Several lawsuits have been filed this year by Charité patients whose operations failed. A second lumbar disk, the ProDisc from Synthes of Switzerland, was approved by the F.D.A. last month. Supporters of arthroplasty, as the use of artificial disks is called, say cervical implants will be more widely used and quickly accepted than the lumbar products. The cervical procedure, they say, is less hazardous, easier to revise and involves techniques that are more familiar to surgeons. “There’s almost unanimous opinion that arthroplasty will fare better in the cervical area,” said Robin R. Young, a medical device industry market consultant based in Wayne, Pa. Still, Mr. Young and other analysts say insurers may be slow to embrace cervical disks for one of the same reasons that they are treating lumbar disks as unproven technology  the devices are meant to last for decades in patients but virtually all of the clinical data covers much shorter time spans. The safety data presented to the panel covered about 540 patients, but the effectiveness data was limited to 250 patients, about half of whom received the implant, which is called the Prestige ST. Another challenge for the cervical disks is that cervical fusion surgery is generally considered far more likely to be successful than lumbar fusion. So doctors and patients may see less need for an alternative. “Getting paid for this will be hard,” said Glenn A. Stiegman, vice president of regulatory affairs for Musculoskeletal Clinical Regulatory Advisors, a consulting firm. The advisory panel on Tuesday also recommended that Medtronic be barred from claiming that using artificial disks to preserve a patient’s range of motion could protect adjacent natural disks from degeneration. Although orthopedists believe that to be true, and believe that fusion surgery can speed degeneration, the panel said that published research did not support such a conclusion. Medtronic’s data for patients who were monitored for two years suggested that the disk had actually achieved results on a series of pain, motion and safety measures that the F.D.A. had agreed would allow it to claim the device superior to fusion surgery. The median period before disk patients returned to work was 45 days compared to 61 for fusion patients. But overall satisfaction rates in the two groups were nearly identical. Medtronic said after the hearing that it intended to press the agency to reach a different conclusion. “We’ll try to provide incremental data to prove the claim,” said Peter L. Wehrly, the senior vice president who oversees Medtronic’s spinal subsidiary. Yesterday’s review was complicated by the fact that the trial data was based on a slightly different form of the device than the one for which Medtronic is seeking approval. Based on feedback from surgeons, the company has slightly thickened one portion of the device and altered the position of the screws that hold the implant in place. The changes allow the company to make larger disks. The panelists were also concerned that Medtronic had shown that small amounts of stainless steel particles can wear away from the device over time, but that when it tested their potential health impact in rabbits the company had been unable to track what happened to the bits of steel. “I’m a bit dumbfounded why the particles were not found anywhere,” said Dr. Sanjiv H. Naidu, a surgeon and material science expert from the Pennsylvania State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pa., who was one of the 10 panel members. Similar particles caused inflammation in tissue recovered from four patients who had the device removed during the trial for various reasons. The panel recommended that the F.D.A. require additional animal studies and more research on how the device’s end plates interact with the body. Medtronic has also begun a clinical trial for another, more compact version of the Prestige that is made of a titanium ceramic and held in place by two raised ridges on each plate. A separate Medtronic trial is testing an entirely different disk called the Bryan that sandwiches metal plates around a dense plastic core. The stainless steel Prestige is intended for cases where only one disk is being replaced while the others are meant to work with multiple disk procedures.

Related Complete Coverage: Diabetes » With my wife in New Jersey for a couple of days to attend a meeting, Annie managed to dribble some grape soda into my mouth, followed by a few spoonfuls of Marshmallow Fluff. Fifteen minutes later, my blood sugar rising, I came to my senses enough to think, Not again! No, Im not one of those out-of-control diabetics who refuse to follow their doctors advice. I knew a guy like that once. When I told him I tested my blood sugar seven or eight times a day, he told me, Id rather die than do that. And then he did die, a couple of years later, from severe low blood sugar. Im at the other extreme, always testing, then taking a little insulin to bring down a high or having a snack to avoid a low. The crazy thing, though, is that by carefully following my doctors advice to keep my blood-sugar levels as close to normal as possible (which, studies have shown, greatly reduces the risk of long-term complications), I always live on the edge, a cupcake away from a coma. Every day or two, I get a brief, mild low that leaves me feeling muddle-headed and cranky for half an hour. Not the end of the world, but a definite annoyance. And in the 30 years since developing diabetes during my freshman year of college, Ive had seven or eight awful lows like the one last August. So imagine my enthusiasm when I learned last fall that the Food and Drug Administration had finally approved the first implantable sensor to continuously measure glucose, beeping or vibrating a warning whenever levels head too high or too low. On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town. The device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesnt control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. Id already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection. Like the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice. Even with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump. When everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading. Then the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasnt working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working. At first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high. I kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more. Two hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture. Over the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them. The main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMeds studies show the sensors accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test. I also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasnt, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month. But the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week. On July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses. I made it through our annual Cape Cod vacation without incident, but Annie kept a wary eye on me. I think I owe it to her to start shelling out that $350 per month, at least until the insurance companies figure out what a lifesaver this transformative new technology can be.

Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, agreed last month to pay the money to settle accusations made in lawsuits by two whistle-blowers that the companys spinal-implant division, Medtronic Sofamor Danek, paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to use its products. But the company, which denied wrongdoing, and the government made the settlement contingent on the dismissal of both whistle-blowers lawsuits. Yesterdays motion by Mr. Carr, who represents the second whistle-blower, objected to the dismissal. His client, a former Medtronic employee named Jacqueline Kay Poteet, filed suit in late 2003. Taking up the lawsuit of the first whistle-blower, who has not been identified because the case is under seal, the Justice Department accused the company of paying the kickbacks through what federal officials described as sham consulting agreements, sham royalty agreements and lavish trips to desirable locations offered to doctors from 1998 to 2003. While Medtronic said it had no specific comment on yesterdays filing, a company spokesman asserted in a statement that it supported the governments motion to dismiss the case. Medtronic believes that the law against copycat complaints should finally resolve the Poteet case, the statement said. A spokesman for the Justice Department said the government declined to comment. Ms. Poteet has also accused the company of continuing to make improper payments to doctors in 2004 and 2005 as a way of inducing them to use Medtronics devices in their back operations. The government did not appear to follow up on these accusations, which Ms. Poteet made in a supplemental complaint of continuing wrongdoing, Mr. Carr said in yesterdays filing. Mr. Carr, a lawyer at Bateman Gibson in Memphis, also said government lawyers told him in March 2004 that the first proceeding was legally tainted, although yesterdays filing offered little additional detail. After federal officials told Ms. Poteet last October that the government was likely to reach a $40 million settlement, she and her lawyer objected, according to yesterdays filing. When her lawyer discussed filing an objection to the proposed settlement, the government lawyers indicated that her status in the case might be challenged, according to the objection. This is precisely what is now happening. At the time the settlement was announced last month, federal officials said they would seek the dismissal of Ms. Poteets suit because it essentially made the same accusations as the first whistle-blowers.

The Justice Department accused Medtronic of paying kickbacks through what officials described as sham consulting agreements, sham royalty agreements and lavish trips to desirable locations offered to doctors from 1998 to 2003. Kickbacks to doctors are incompatible with a properly functioning health care system, Peter D. Keisler, assistant attorney general for the civil division, said in a statement. They corrupt physicians medical judgment and they cause overutilization and misallocation of vital health care resources. Medtronic was the subject of two lawsuits filed in Federal District Court in Memphis by whistle-blowers on the actions of its spinal-implant division, Medtronic Sofamor Danek. The company and its division deny any wrongdoing. Yesterdays agreement covers the first lawsuit, which was filed in 2002; the whistle-blower who filed it has not been identified. Justice Department officials are seeking to have the second lawsuit dismissed. The lawsuits were the subject of a New York Times article in January. Medtronics chief executive, Art Collins, in a statement, said that the company had cooperated fully with the government during its investigation of the allegations, and we believe our companywide efforts regarding business conduct and ethical practices assisted us in achieving a practical resolution of these cases. As part of a five-year corporate integrity agreement, Medtronic said it would establish an electronic database to track transactions with its customers unrelated to device sales. The information will be reviewed by Medtronic senior management and an outside review group. The parties reached the settlement to avoid the delay, uncertainty, inconvenience and expense of protracted litigation of these claims, according to the agreement. Medtronic did not admit liability, the settlement says. Complex back surgery has become a lucrative business for companies making implants, and Medtronic was accused of spending tens of millions of dollars on consulting contracts and other types of payments to prominent spine surgeons. The second whistle-blower lawsuit, filed by a former employee who managed Medtronics travel services, claimed the company gave some surgeons excessive remuneration, unlawful perquisites and bribes in other forms for purchasing goods and medical devices. The employee, Jacqueline Kay Poteet, accused the company in a supplemental complaint of continuing the improper payments in 2004 and 2005. David Kustoff, the United States attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, said Justice Department officials were seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed on the ground that Ms. Poteet was essentially making the same accusations as the first whistle-blower. A department spokesman declined to comment further on the second lawsuit. The dismissal of Ms. Poteets lawsuit is subject to approval by the court, and the settlement could be rescinded if the dismissal does not take place, according to the agreement. Medtronic said it would place the $40 million into escrow pending dismissal of the lawsuit, and it would take a one-time charge in the quarter ending July 28. The lawyer for the second whistle-blower, Andrew R. Carr Jr. of Bateman Gibson in Memphis, said he intended to oppose the dismissal of his clients lawsuit. Based on his understanding of the first case, there are material differences between the two, he said. Disputes over whether a particular whistle-blower is first to file and entitled to a share of any settlement proceeds is not unusual, said Lesley Ann Skillen, a lawyer with the New York firm of Getnick &amp; Getnick. Theres been a lot of litigation on that. Even if the court grants the governments move to dismiss the lawsuit, the whistle-blower has the right to appeal the decision, she said. This money could be tied up for years, she said.

But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has decided to withhold information identifying the doctors involved in those procedures. In a telephone interview, the agency's top official, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, said it had decided to do so for legal and policy reasons, including concerns about violating patient confidentiality. The agency released the data Friday to The New York Times in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed last year. It said it planned to release the data on its Web site today. The complication rate in the Medicare records falls within the general boundaries of studies that have looked at the matter. But such studies have also indicated that complication rates can vary widely among doctors and hospitals based on factors like the number of implants a doctor performs. The agency's decision not to publish data on doctors could reignite a long-running debate over patient access to data that shows how complication rates for widely used procedures like heart device implants differ among doctors and hospitals. For example, studies have indicated that for defibrillator implants, such rates can vary sharply based on factors like the number of procedures a doctor performs. An implantable defibrillator is a device that interrupts a potentially fatal type of heart rhythm. An analysis of the data by The Times indicates that about 4 percent of the 45,000 patients who underwent implants reported at least one complication to the agency over a 16-month period ended in April. The two most frequently reported ones  blood clots and displacement of a cable that connects a device to the heart  can vary in their degree of severity. Dr. McClellan added that the agency would soon make all the defibrillator data, including information on doctors, available to researchers, who typically agree to keep the names of the doctors and hospitals confidential. The new records are the first batch of hundreds of thousands of similar ones that the agency plans to collect to see which types of heart patients benefit from a defibrillator. Dr. McClellan said the agency was particularly concerned that making information about doctors public might result in disclosing the identity of patients, which are legally protected. "We are working on methods now to provide information at the physician and physician group level consistent with our statutory restrictions and our primary objective of protecting patient information," he said. Some heart device specialists said they thought that Medicare officials should make the doctor and hospital data available to patients. But they added that such raw data, to be useful, would have to be adjusted to reflect factors like whether a doctor treated significantly sicker patients who would be prone to complications. "It's like any other product," said Dr. Brian Olshansky, a heart-device specialist at the University of Iowa Hospitals in Iowa City. "You want to know about the doctors that kill people and about the doctors that hurt people." In recent years, there has been a growing debate among doctors and health care policy experts over how much data should be made available to patients about the quality of doctors' practices and complication rates. Some doctors say that patients have a right to such data while others argue that physicians and hospitals can address their problems more effectively if such information is held within the medical profession. "I think that a lot of people in the clinical community are starting to embrace the idea" of public disclosure, said Dr. Matthew R. Reynolds, a researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. "But there is also a lot of fear because a lot of hospitals that have different outcomes treat sicker patients." Currently, only New York and a few other states publicly release data comparing complication rates at hospitals in heart procedures involving surgery. A lawyer for The Times, David E. McCraw, said Friday that the newspaper planned to appeal the agency's decision to withhold physician information. In its request last year, The Times said it was not seeking patient names. The agency started collecting the defibrillator data early last year. At that time, the agency sharply expanded the number of heart patients who could get a device and started requiring doctors to fill out forms with detailed patient health data. Doctors are also supposed to note whether any of about 16 specific complications occurred during an implant. 1 2Next Page » Jo Craven McGinty and Ron Nixon contributed reporting for this article.

In separate statements, the two companies, Medtronic Inc. and St. Jude Medical, said they planned several steps to heighten their scrutiny of device safety and reliability, like increasing the number of outside doctors who serve as consultants reviewing such issues. The statements were issued just before the start of a meeting tomorrow in Boston of a medical group that represents specialists who implant heart devices like defibrillators and pacemakers. Last month, the group, the Heart Rhythm Society, issued a report calling on device makers to create, among other things, independent panels of doctors and other specialists to review product safety. The medical group's report was issued in response to a situation last year in which one producer, the Guidant Corporation, did not alert doctors to life-threatening flaws in some defibrillators and allowed more than 4,000 suspect units to be implanted in patients when safer ones were available. While reports of device failures were relatively low, the consequences of such failures were life-threatening. A group of doctors and other experts retained by Guidant to review its actions found that the company had failed to fully assess the patient consequences of its decisions because engineers, rather than doctors, were involved in making them. At least seven patients have died during episodes in which those devices short-circuited. Last month, Guidant, which is now owned by Boston Scientific, said it would adopt all the recommendations in the Heart Rhythm Society's report and urged that an industrywide safety monitoring panel be established. In their statements, Medtronic and St. Jude did not endorse that idea but said they were moving to adopt some of the medical group's proposals. For example, Medtronic, which is the nation's biggest maker of heart devices, said that rather than creating a new safety panel, the company was expanding the number of outside physicians who consult with the company on device performance and safety issues. In addition, the company said that, along with notifying doctors of product recalls, it would send notices directly to patients, another step urged by the medical group. For its part, St. Jude Medical, the country's third-biggest heart device maker behind Guidant, said it was planning to expand its existing board of outside advisers. The company said it would create a board focusing specifically on the wires, or leads, that connect an implanted device to the heart. It said that it would also directly notify patients about product problems. Also yesterday, a leading medical publication, The New England Journal of Medicine, released an article on its Web site by three physicians who participated in the Guidant-sponsored panel. In that article, the three doctors wrote that they believed that independent scrutiny of company safety data was vital. "Voluntary, independent review at the level suggested is a notion both foreign and frightening to most corporations, whose perceived need is to protect business interests," the physicians wrote. "But corporate culture fosters a loyalty to corporate goals that may create unintended bias and distorted perceptions about product performance and patient safety." One doctor involved in the report, Dr. Bruce D. Lindsay of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he was heartened by the steps announced by Medtronic and St. Jude. "My impression is that it is a positive response," he said. But another specialist who helped write the report, Dr. Robert J. Myerburg of the University of Miami, said the companies ought to set up panels specifically devoted to product safety issues. "It has to be a go-to group that you can call on a Friday night," he said. More Warnings on Defibrillators By Bloomberg News The Boston Scientific Corporation said yesterday that it had warned physicians that another 996 defibrillators made by its Guidant unit might quit prematurely, leaving patients unprotected from sudden cardiac death. No deaths or injuries have been linked to the battery failures, the company said. The defect, a faulty low-voltage capacitor, was confirmed in 30 defibrillators removed from patients as of May 8, and is suspected in at least 46 devices still implanted, Boston Scientific said. The defect involves a single manufacturing batch of 996 defibrillators. The company said it learned of the failures after purchasing Guidant in April 21 for $27.5 billion. Regulators imposed sanctions on Guidant in December because of quality-control flaws after the recall last year of 109,000 defibrillators linked to at least seven deaths. Many recalled devices were sold years after Guidant learned of the flaws.

That investigation is looking into whether the companies provided incentives to physicians to use their products. One government official said authorities were looking into Ela Medical's activities in the Miami area. Separately, a device industry official said that federal authorities had made inquiries about Ela Medical. Both people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry is in progress and not yet a public matter. The general counsel for the Sorin Group, an Italian company based in Milan, said in a statement that the device maker was unaware of any investigations. The company has said it complies with all applicable regulations and industry practices. "To the best of our knowledge, neither Ela Medical nor any other Sorin Group company is a target of any inquiry or investigation by any law enforcement agency," that executive, Brian Sheridan, wrote this month in an e-mail message. The inquiry into Ela Medical is apparently being conducted by investigators with the Food and Drug Administration and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesman for the F.D.A., Jason Brodsky, and a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office, Laura Bradbard, said that as a matter of policy the agencies do not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation. Ela Medical is a very small player in the United States market for heart devices like defibrillators, according to analysts' estimates. Together, it and Biotronik, a German company based in Berlin, have about a 5 percent market share. A defibrillator is a device that uses electricity to interrupt a type of irregular heart rhythm that is potentially fatal. A pacemaker stimulates a heart that is beating too slowly. With the aging of the population, defibrillators are among the fastest growing categories of medical devices and can cost from $20,000 to $35,000 a unit. They also have profit margins of about 75 percent. Not surprisingly, there is intense competition by producers for the loyalties of heart specialists who either prescribe or implant such devices. The Justice Department is investigating whether the country's three big makers of implanted heart devices  Medtronic, Guidant and St. Jude Medical  used illegal inducements to get doctors to use their products. They have all denied wrongdoing. Federal law prohibits certain types of payments to doctors that are meant to influence their choice of a particular product. The Justice Department investigation is said to be looking at whether the big companies, among other things, provided doctors with excessive payments to enroll patients in post-marketing studies of their devices as a way of increasing sales. Such studies can have questionable scientific value, experts said. That investigation began in October, soon after an article in The New York Times reported that internal Guidant e-mail messages suggested that a product evaluation survey run by that company, in which doctors were paid $1,000 each to participate, was actually an effort to improve device sales. In October, when the Justice Department issued its subpoenas, it did not send one to Ela Medical. The company said recently that it had not received any demands for information. Late last year, the Sorin Group, in response to an inquiry from a reporter, declined to release a list of the postmarketing trials that Ela Medical was sponsoring in this country. The company said it believed that its payments to doctors were modest and in line with payments made by other producers. Several hospitals in the Miami area said this month that they had not been contacted by government officials about Ela Medical.

Net income climbed to $669.6 million, or 55 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 27, from $544.1 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue in the period, which ended Jan. 27 and was the third quarter of Medtronic's fiscal year, rose 9.4 percent, to $2.77 billion. Sales of Medtronic's market-leading defibrillators, used to correct abnormal heart rhythms, rose 21 percent. Guidant, Medtronic's closest competitor in cardiac devices, recalled 109,000 defibrillators last year after they were linked to seven deaths. Guidant agreed last month to be acquired by Boston Scientific. "The two things that people are generally most touchy about and most attuned to are defibrillators and the spine business, and those look good," said Philip Nalbone, an analyst with RCM Capital Markets in San Francisco. "They came in below our expectations" in several other product lines, he added. Company officials will have to explain lower-than-expected total sales and lagging growth for products in the neurological, diabetes, vascular and cardiac-surgery lines, Mr. Nalbone said.

But producers of expensive medical devices have found a better way  they often have others, like taxpayers and insurers, pick up the labor cost. Last year, for example, when Medtronic and Guidant recalled certain heart defibrillators, both companies provided new devices free and agreed to reimburse patients up to $2,500 in out-of-pocket expenses for replacement operations. About 24,000 heart patients had such procedures; some 19,000 of them with Medtronic devices and an estimated 5,000 with Guidant units. Neither producer, however, offered to pick up hospital and doctor bills. Instead, publicly funded plans like Medicare and private insurers are typically paying them. The total cost of those surgical operations is unknown, but estimates suggest the figure will mount into the tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars. Not surprisingly, insurers and others have started to push back. Last summer, after the defibrillator recalls, a major insurance group called on the government to require device makers to cover recall-related medical costs. The government and Medtronic have started talks to determine that producer's potential liabilities, a Medicare official said. The question of how much device manufacturers should pay, if anything, for the removal and replacement of flawed units extends far beyond heart devices to products like artificial hips and knees. But many health policy experts involved in the issue said the size and expense of last year's recalls of defibrillators, devices intended to interrupt a chaotic heart rhythm, have set off a new round of debate. Karen M. Ignagni, the president of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group in Washington, questioned why insurers and their customers, "who are the ultimate payers," should bear the costs of having devices replaced. The same group last summer urged government officials to require device makers to pay such expenses. Manufacturers of implantable devices insist that their responsibilities are clearly spelled out in product warranties and that medical costs related to a device's replacement are not covered. Also, Medtronic, the country's biggest producer of heart devices, said that the medical costs of a replacement operation were effectively offset by its provision of a free device and the out-of-pocket payments. "We believe that in a majority of cases, the warranty covers the preponderance of costs associated with a replacement procedure," said the company, which is based in Minneapolis. Just how much Medicare and private insurers will pay out to cover the recent 24,000 operations resulting from defibrillator recalls is not clear. But the price tag is expected to be significant. For example, while Medicare pays a fixed fee for a heart device replacement that includes both the price of a device and hospital costs, it also makes separate payments to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist involved in a procedure. Estimates of such hospital and physician costs vary widely. But even using a conservative figure of $5,000 for a procedure, the bill for the 24,000 replacement procedures would amount to $120 million. Meanwhile, the defibrillator recalls highlight an issue that affects the ability of both the government and insurers to recoup costs from device producers  the difficulty of tracing device replacement costs to a specific patient and a particular manufacturer. For example, the claim form used by Medicare does not discriminate between a procedure involving the normal replacement of a defibrillator, such as when its battery has worn out, from one involving surgery to replace a recalled device. Also, both Medicare and private insurers cannot quickly tell which manufacturer's device was used. "They can't tell from their records if a doctor implanted a Guidant," said Jeffrey Swann, a lawyer in Louisville who is representing several insurers who are considering suing that company. To try to reconstruct that data, Mr. Swann explained, insurers are going back to last summer, when they saw a spike in claims from cardiologists after Guidant issued its recall. Based on those claims, they have contacted the doctors to see if a Guidant device was involved and, if so, determine what action the physician took. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in Business &gt;When carmakers recall a vehicle, they provide a replacement part and cover the cost of the labor to install it.

Another doctor in Virginia received nearly $700,000 in consulting fees from Medtronic for the first nine months of 2005. Skip to next paragraph Kate Medley for The New York Times Jacqueline Kay Poteet, formerly a senior travel manager for Medtronic, arranged doctors' trips to conferences. These doctors work in a growing field, complex back surgery, and this makes them particularly valuable to the spinal-implant division of Medtronic. In recent years, the company has spent tens of millions of dollars on consulting contracts and other types of payments to them and numerous other prominent surgeons, according to papers filed as part of a whistle-blower lawsuit. The suit contends that some of these payments were made to attract or retain the doctors' business. Medtronic, based in Minneapolis, is one of the country's largest medical device makers, with $10 billion in annual sales. The documents shed new light on a matter that has troubled the medical device industry for years: the assertion that companies employ a variety of financial ruses to pay doctors who use their devices, a practice that medical and legal experts say is unethical and possibly illegal. But despite industry efforts to clean up such practices, the documents and accusations made by former Medtronic employees suggest that the problem persists and may have gotten worse. The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Memphis two years ago and since amended, was brought by the whistle-blower, a former Medtronic employee. The Justice Department, which has the right to intervene in the case but has not yet done so, is seeking to recover Medicare funds. According to legal filings, it proposes that Medtronic settle the matter by paying $40 million. The suit, which was sealed until Jan. 13, accuses Medtronic of giving spine surgeons "excessive remuneration, unlawful perquisites and bribes in other forms for purchasing goods and medical devices." The plaintiff, Jacqueline Kay Poteet, a senior manager of travel services for Medtronic until 2003, has also accused the company in a supplemental complaint of continuing these improper payments in 2004 and 2005. Her lawyer, Andrew R. Carr Jr. of the firm of Bateman Gibson in Memphis, has objected to the proposed settlement offer as too low. Whistle-blowers typically receive a share of any settlement. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. All the doctors involved in the lawsuit who were reached for comment said that the payments to them were appropriate and fair compensation for work done for Medtronic. The company, which said it continues to cooperate fully with the government to resolve the case, declined to comment directly on the accusations, saying they remained the subject of litigation. In a written response, a spokesman, Rob Clark, said, "We take these allegations very seriously and we do not tolerate conduct that is illegal or unethical." Consulting arrangements with doctors to improve devices, he said, "are critical, in our view, to the delivery of state-of-the-art health care and are perfectly legal." Medical device makers, with billions in sales at stake, have for years actively courted physicians who prescribe their products and recommend them to other doctors. Companies frequently compensate doctors through generous consulting fees and speaking honorariums, or by underwriting their trips to attend medical conferences, former employees and industry consultants say. The internal Medtronic documents filed as part of the suit offer an unusually detailed glimpse of the intense campaign that device makers wage to win doctors' loyalty. They show that Medtronic spent at least $50 million on payments to doctors over some four years, through June or later in 2005. Both doctors and device companies defend the financial relationships they have as essential for the development of what are often life-saving products. But critics contend that these financial ties exert too much influence on medical decisions, and that the payments are rarely, if ever, disclosed to patients. The payments become illegal when they are linked to a doctor's use of a particular device and violate the federal law against kickbacks, which says that payments and other benefits cannot be provided to doctors if the payments are intended to induce them to use the company's products. 1 2 3Next Page » More Articles in Business »A prominent surgeon in Wisconsin was paid $400,000 a year by Medtronic for a consulting contract requiring him to work just eight days.

Stents are used to prop open heart arteries after blockages have been cleared. Endeavor and Cypher are part of a new generation of stents that are coated with drugs to reduce the tendency of scar tissue to grow so aggressively that blood flow is seriously impaired. The trial results clarified the challenges Medtronic faces in entering the $3.2 billion domestic market for drug-coated stents. Investors initially responded favorably yesterday, but selling later in the day drove Medtronic down 15 cents, closing at $56 a share. Endeavor patients just missed being within the range of scar tissue accumulation that regulators had agreed would be "noninferior." While disappointed, Medtronic said it was encouraged that Endeavor's greater susceptibility to the buildup of scar tissue, a process known as restenosis, did not lead to a significant difference in serious health consequences for the 436 patients in the trial. In addition, the results showed that the doctors involved had an easier time implanting Endeavor, with a success rate of 98.1 percent compared with 91.2 percent for Cypher. Taken together, the results reinforced the assessment by Medtronic and others that it will need data from another trial - the fourth for Endeavor - to gain regulatory approval in the United States. Medtronic said yesterday that Endeavor IV, which compares the clinical results from the stent with those of patients who received the Taxus stent made by Boston Scientific, will finish enrolling patients next year. Data from that trial, which involves 1,584 patients, could be available in time for Medtronic to gain approval by the end of 2007. Medtronic received approval in late July to sell Endeavor in Europe, and that cleared the way for sales in 40 countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and South Africa.

The trial results clarified the challenges Medtronic faces in entering the $3.2 billion domestic market for drug-coated stents. Investors initially responded favorably yesterday, but selling later in the day drove Medtronic down 15 cents, closing at $56 a share. Endeavor patients just missed being within the range of scar tissue accumulation that regulators had agreed would be "noninferior." While disappointed, Medtronic said it was encouraged that Endeavor's greater susceptibility to the buildup of scar tissue, a process known as restenosis, did not lead to a significant difference in serious health consequences for the 436 patients in the trial. In addition, the results showed that the doctors involved had an easier time implanting Endeavor, with a success rate of 98.1 percent compared with 91.2 percent for Cypher. Taken together, the results reinforced the assessment by Medtronic and others that it will need data from another trial - the fourth for Endeavor - to gain regulatory approval in the United States. Medtronic said yesterday that Endeavor IV, which compares the clinical results from the stent with those of patients who received the Taxus stent made by Boston Scientific, will finish enrolling patients next year. Data from that trial, which involves 1,584 patients, could be available in time for Medtronic to gain approval by the end of 2007. Medtronic received approval in late July to sell Endeavor in Europe, and that cleared the way for sales in 40 countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and South Africa.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DB173FF930A25753C1A9639C8B63&amp;ref=medtronicinc">Corrections<date>Published: October 13, 2005</date><text>An article in Business Day yesterday about Medtronic's report to financial analysts about its medical device business misstated the company's current target date for regulatory approval of its Endeavor stent.

It also raised its earnings forecast for this fiscal year and the next two, which helped send the shares up in after-hours trading. The company was able to accentuate the positive in the analyst meeting because it will wait until next week to talk about the one piece of its business that is not doing so well. That discussion will come Monday, during a major cardiology conference in Washington. There, researchers plan to release results of a clinical trial that Medtronic has been hoping will help it win federal approval for the Endeavor drug-coated coronary stent. So far the Endeavor is sold only overseas. In this country Medtronic sells only a bare-metal coronary stent that ranks far behind the market leaders, Boston Scientific and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and puts the company out of the running in the $6 billion global cardiovascular market for drug-coated coronary stents. Fortunately for Medtronic, the high level of interest in its Endeavor stent is less a function of its importance to the company than the damage its success might do to Boston Scientific, a smaller company much more dependent on the coronary stent business. The cardiovascular business, which includes stents, accounted for less than 10 percent of Medtronic's $2.69 billion in revenue in its fiscal first quarter, which ended July 29. Boston Scientific controls nearly 60 percent of the $3.5 billion domestic market for drug-coated stents, while Johnson &amp; Johnson has the rest. Stents are metal cylinders that prop open arteries after blockages have been cleared; drug coatings combat the formation of scar tissue. The Endeavor clinical trial primarily tested whether the stent is as effective as Johnson &amp; Johnson's Cypher stent in preventing arteries from reclogging eight months after the implant. It also made a number of safety comparisons. Many analysts are speculating, based on conversations with doctors, that Endeavor will not fare well in the comparison. In fact, according to Thomas Gunderson, who follows the industry for Piper Jaffray &amp; Company in Minneapolis, the need for better clinical data could push the United States introduction of Endeavor beyond Medtronic's current target of late 2006. The uncertainty comes at the same time that Medtronic appears unlikely to persuade federal antitrust regulators to force Johnson &amp; Johnson to give it access to a highly efficient stent-installing technology called Rapid Exchange. That access would be a condition for allowing Johnson to complete its $25.4 billion takeover of Guidant. Analysts say that if Johnson is compelled to share that technology with a rival, it is more likely to license it to Abbott Laboratories, rather than Medtronic. Unlike Medtronic, Abbott is new to the coronary stent market and it is not expected to complete the trials necessary to enter the market until 2008. None of this is good news for Medtronic's cardiovascular business unit, which has grown at just a 1 percent rate annually during the last five years. But as Medtronic executives emphasized repeatedly at yesterday's meeting, it is largely beside the point in assessing the company's overall prospects. Medtronic is one of just nine companies in the Fortune 500 to have grown at more than 15 percent annually during the last five years. Profits have been growing slightly faster. Based primarily on the outlook for its three biggest businesses - cardiac rhythm management implants, spinal devices and implants to treat chronic pain and nerve diseases - Medtronic forecast yesterday that it could keep up the pace into 2008. "Never has the outlook been more predictable or more robust," William A. Hawkins, the company's chief operating officer, said in his closing remarks at the conference, which was broadcast on the Web. The company now projects earnings in the current fiscal year, which ends next spring, at $2.18 to $2.23 a share, up from $2.10 to $2.23 a share. It also raised forecasts for 2007 and 2008. The new forecasts reflected a lower tax rate, Medtronic said, achieved in part by concentrating manufacturing in Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico. Medtronic said its tax rate was now 26 percent, down from 32 percent a few years ago. The stock, which had closed at $52.87 a share in regular trading, topped $54 in after-hours trading, after the company disclosed its revised earnings outlook. Medtronic's cardiac rhythm business includes pacemakers and implantable defibrillators. The pacemakers are growing overseas only, but the defibrillators, which provide shocks to interrupt irregular heartbeats, have grown from a $1 billion market to a $3.7 billion market in the last five years. Guidant, the second-largest competitor in the implantable defibrillator market, has been plagued by recalls after reports of defects in older models that led to patient deaths. Medtronic said yesterday that it serves only 50 percent of the market and that it expected its sales to grow at more than 20 percent. The company said that its spinal business is growing at a similar clip. Many of its devices and its bone-growth stimulant are linked to the spinal fusion market. Medtronic is also investing heavily in developing artificial disks. Medtronic was asked yesterday what royalties it might recover from the large portfolio of spinal device patents it acquired last spring as part of a $1.35 billion settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit, and whether it planned to file infringement suits. Despite years of litigation over the hundreds of patents and a review after the case that has involved eight patent lawyers, Medtronic said yesterday it still did not have an answer to such questions. By coincidence, Medtronic investors also got good news from the United States Supreme Court. The court said that it would not take up an appeal of a lower court decision that 14 patients cannot sue Medtronic over alleged defects in pacemaker wires that connect the device to the heart. Medtronic had argued in the lower courts that device companies are shielded from such lawsuits if federal regulators have reviewed their clinical data before the product is marketed and given them clearance to sell it.

Robert Clark, a company spokesman, said in response to a question that Medtronic was examining whether to release publicly some of the device data that it reports annually to the Food and Drug Administration in regular filings. In those reports, manufacturers of devices like defibrillators and pacemakers provide the F.D.A. with far more details about how and why those devices are malfunctioning than they currently give to doctors. Mr. Clark declined to elaborate further or to say if or when Medtronic would make a decision. But any action by Medtronic, because of its dominant position in the market, is likely to influence what others do. His comments came as heart specialists, industry officials, regulators and others gathered at a meeting here to discuss better ways to disclose data to doctors and patients about heart device failures and the potential risks. The meeting, which was called by a professional medical group, the Heart Rhythm Society, followed a widely publicized episode about decisions by Guidant not to disclose electrical flaws in some of its products. The meeting did not result in the adoption of any immediate changes, but many physicians, corporate officials and regulators involved in it said during the proceeding that they expected policy changes to be made. For example, they pointed to the need to standardize the ways that data about heart device failure was collected, reviewed for its health implications, and then disseminated, if needed, to physicians and patients. Several participants also called for greater efforts to collect data about device failures so that any problems could be promptly identified either by the F.D.A. or physicians. The two other major device makers, Guidant and St. Jude Medical, previously said that they would actively review the proposals for change discussed at the meeting. Medtronic already provides doctors with more detailed product data than its two main competitors. An F.D.A. official at the meeting also acknowledged that the agency might not currently be able to identify serious problems with heart devices that, while occurring in low numbers, could have serious patient consequences.

A top agency official said that it would take far too long for the agency to go through the hundreds of reports it received each year and separate data that could be released publicly, like the product performance data, from data that was a company trade secret.

No one disputes that many heart patients need a defibrillator, a device that sends out an electrical jolt to interrupt a chaotic heart rhythm that can cause sudden cardiac arrest, which is often fatal. But some doctors say the units, which are fast becoming one of the most costly medical devices in use today, are being implanted in many other patients who may not need them because they are either too well or too sick. Both the medical and financial consequences of that debate have been growing as use of the device has soared. Last year, an estimated 135,000 devices were implanted in patients in the United States alone, a near tripling of the number in 2000. Meanwhile, the three major device producers, Guidant, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, have reaped a financial bonanza as domestic sales rose during that same period to $3.5 billion, from $1.3 billion, according to Harris Nesbitt, an investment firm. The overuse or inappropriate use of medical treatments is a familiar theme. But defibrillators pose unique issues because they are increasingly being used as a standard piece of safety equipment, like an air bag in an automobile, in an ever-growing number of heart patients whose individual need for the device is not clear. Defibrillator prices are also like those found on a new car, ranging from about $20,000 to $35,000 each. "They are expensive and in theory almost anyone in the country could benefit," said Dr. Mark Hlatky, a professor of health research and policy at Stanford University School of Medicine. "So where do you draw the line?" The dilemma reflects a growing medical conundrum. Defibrillators were first used in the 1980's only in patients who had survived an episode of sudden cardiac arrest. But since then, studies largely funded by the industry have resulted in a steady expansion of the device's use to ever-broader pools of heart patients with varying degrees of risk of cardiac arrest. The problem, however, is that medical researchers have not figured out how to tell which patients in these broader groups are at high risk and which ones are at low risk. The result: they all qualify for a unit. The problem is no small matter. Experts agree that many, if not the majority, of defibrillator candidates are at a low risk of cardiac arrest. "We can identify groups at risk, but we cannot really identify the individuals in those groups who are at higher risk," said Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a cardiology professor at Indiana University School of Medicine. Meanwhile, physicians like Dr. Zipes and health policy experts say that manufacturers have used a variety of strategies to increase profits by keeping device prices high. For example, rather than offering a low-cost unit that does the basic job of stopping a bad heart rhythm, defibrillator makers are engaged in a sort of medical arms race in which producers turn over models by adding new features like different ways to measure heart rhythms. Some of these additions are valuable, while others are just "bells and whistles," experts say. "These companies don't compete on price, they compete on features," Dr. Hlatky said. Doctors and patients also have no reason not to go for a top of the line model, said experts like Dr. Hlatky. Many physicians acknowledge that they do not consider product prices when deciding which model of defibrillator is best for their patient. And patients have little reason to care about cost because insurers like Medicare cover the cost of an implant procedure, which includes the device, regardless of its cost. As in other areas of medicine, there have been claims that device makers retain the loyalty of physicians by providing them with consulting arrangements and other financial incentives. The companies insist that they have done nothing wrong and that their prices are fair.
