It is the most ambitious effort yet to jump-start a national market for energy upgrades that many people believe could eventually be worth billions.Focusing mainly on commercial property at first, the group plans to exploit a new tax arrangement that allows property owners to upgrade their buildings at no upfront cost, typically cutting their energy use and their utility bills by a third. The building owners would pay for the upgrades over five to 20 years through surcharges on their property-tax bills, but that would be less than the savings. The consortium is led by a company called Ygrene Energy Fund of Santa Rosa, Calif., which has already won an exclusive contract to manage a retrofit program for a half-dozen communities in the Miami area, with the city expected to join in a few weeks. It is in the late stages of completing a contract with Sacramento, and is seeking deals in other cities. State and city officials are optimistic they may have found a way to tackle one of the nation’s biggest energy problems — waste in older buildings — without new money from Washington. If enough building owners sign on, private capital would be put to work paying for retrofit projects that promise to save local businesses money while creating thousands of new construction jobs. “We are so used to reaching our hand out and saying, ‘Washington, we need this,’ and ‘Tallahassee, give us that,’ ” said Edward MacDougall, the mayor of Cutler Bay, Fla., a Miami suburb that took the lead in setting up the deal in that region. “This is really a home-grown mechanism where we don’t need to do that.” The consortium was put together by the Carbon War Room, a nonprofit environmental group based in Washington set up by Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur and billionaire, to tackle the world’s climate and energy problems in cost-saving ways. With the United States government nearly paralyzed on climate policy, he said, his group is seeking a way forward. “We see this as the first of hopefully many, many, many projects, and a big step in the right direction,” Mr. Branson said in an interview last weekend in New York. In the past three years, half the states have passed legislation permitting energy retrofits financed by property-tax surcharges, and hundreds of cities and counties are considering such programs. While the situation poses some risks, and programs aimed specifically at homeowners have run into a snag, many jurisdictions are moving forward with plans to focus on commercial properties. Environmental groups have lauded the trend as one of the most exciting developments in years regarding climate change. They point out that wide use of such programs could cut emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from power plants by reducing electricity demand. “It’s a big deal,” said James D. Marston, head of energy programs for the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that has worked with Carbon War Room in developing the approach. Over the long haul, he said, “we’re talking about tens of billions of dollars in investments, and energy savings that are 10 times that amount. If you do this correctly, you would be able to shut down a third of the coal plants in the country.” While that may take a while, there seems to be little question that the new approach could draw substantial private capital into the market for energy upgrades, which have historically been difficult for many midsize and smaller businesses to finance. As envisioned for Miami and Sacramento, the plans will work like this: Ygrene and its partners will gain exclusive rights for five years to offer this type of energy upgrade to businesses in a particular community. They will market the plan aggressively, helping property owners figure out what kinds of upgrades make sense for them. Lockheed Martin is expected to do the engineering work on many larger projects. The retrofits might include new windows and doors, insulation, and more efficient lights and mechanical systems. In some cases, solar panels or other renewable power might be included. For factories, the retrofits might include new motors or other gear. Short-term loans provided by Barclays Capital will be used to pay for the upgrades. Contractors will offer a warranty that the utility savings they have promised will actually materialize, and an insurance underwriter, Energi, of Peabody, Mass., will back up that warranty. Those insurance contracts, in turn, will be backed by Hannover Re, one of the world’s largest reinsurance companies. As projects are completed, the upgrade loans, typically carrying interest rates of 7 percent, will be bundled into long-term bonds resembling those routinely issued by governmental taxing districts. Barclays will market the bonds. Retirement funds have expressed interest in buying these bonds, which will be repaid by tax surcharges on each property that undergoes a retrofit. Perhaps the most serious risk is that fly-by-night contractors will be drawn to the new pot of money, pushing energy retrofits that are too costly or work poorly. “Contractors are cowboys,” said Dennis Hunter, chairman of Ygrene. He promised close scrutiny of the ones selected for the Miami and Sacramento programs. Ygrene is one of about a dozen start-up companies around the country pursuing such deals. The company appears to have substantial momentum, but some of its competitors have already stumbled, telling property owners they qualified for retrofits but then failing to deliver the necessary short-term financing. Still, many people are optimistic this approach will get off the ground. “This is a game-changer,” said John D. Kinney, whose company, Clean Fund of San Rafael, Calif., has raised $250 million to invest in such projects. The company just used the technique to help finance a large solar installation at a development called Sonoma Mountain Village in Rohnert Park, Calif. Experts point out that, with modern techniques and equipment, a retrofit can typically cut a building’s energy use so much that the project pays for itself in as little as five years. The most famous recent example was the refurbishment of the Empire State Building, which cut energy use by nearly 40 percent, turning it into one of New York’s greenest buildings. The new financing approach is called Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE. For decades, cities and counties have created special taxing districts to finance improvements that benefit private property, such as street lights or sewers. Bonds are issued to pay for the projects, then repaid with surcharges on tax bills. If an owner sells, the surcharge stays with the property. Several years ago, the city of Berkeley, Calif., hit on the idea of using that approach to finance energy upgrades on private homes. The idea took off, and 25 states and the District of Columbia soon passed PACE legislation. One of the most successful programs to date has been in Sonoma County, Calif., where retrofit projects exceeding $50 million have been financed. While the initial focus was on homeowners, those programs slowed last year when an arm of the federal government that oversees the mortgage market took a hostile stance toward such projects on residential property, on the grounds that they add risk to mortgages. In most states, a lien associated with a retrofit project would have to be paid ahead of the mortgage if the property went into foreclosure. A legal and political battle is under way to try to force the Federal Housing Finance Agency to reverse its stand. So far, it appears that PACE programs for commercial properties pose fewer legal complications.A business consortium that includes Lockheed Martin and Barclays bank plans to invest as much as $650 million over the next few years to slash the energy consumption of buildings in the Miami and Sacramento areas.

Widmer, Designer of Military Aircraft, Dies at 95<date>Published: July 2, 2011</date><text>The day the legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager shattered the sound barrier in 1947, Robert H. Widmer marched into his boss’s office at the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation in Fort Worth to say he wanted to design the world’s first supersonic bomber. He was told to stick to the contracts the company was already fulfilling.Mr. Widmer, an aeronautical engineer, nonetheless threw himself into designing the plane on his own time. Two years later, when the Air Force asked for bids to build a bomber that could fly at extreme altitudes and supersonic speeds, he had all but finished. Convair, as the company was called, won the contract for the bomber, the B-58, with Mr. Widmer’s design. He named the plane the Hustler. Able to fly as high as 15 miles and at a speed twice the speed of sound, it carried some of the most sophisticated military systems yet developed. The Russians had nothing that came close. Bomber pilots passed up transfers with pay raises and promotions just to fly it, Popular Science reported. Mr. Widmer, whose family said he died in Fort Worth on June 20 at the age of 95, would go on to lead the design and development of major aircraft like the F-111 “Aardvark” and the F-16 “Fighting Falcon” as well as the Tomahawk cruise missile, helping to enforce the cold war strategic balance known as mutual assured destruction. His daughter, Gail Widmer Landreth, said he saw lethal airplanes as instruments of peace. When the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics presented Mr. Widmer with its Reed Aeronautics Award for 1983, the organization said he had pioneered “the eras of supersonic cruise and fly-by-wire computerized flight control.” Well into his 80s, Mr. Widmer continued to go to the office every day as the company became General Dynamics, then Lockheed, then Lockheed Martin. In his later years he worked on the sort of unmanned aircraft that became integral to American warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. A short man with a high-pitched voice, he also continued to display the salty personality for which he was known. “He swore like a sailor,” said Armand Chaput, who worked on advanced aircraft design at General Dynamics and now teaches at the University of Texas. “People were afraid of him, but they really respected him. He could shred you.” Robert Henry Widmer was born in Hawthorne, N.J., on May 17, 1916. Attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he built a small racing biplane as his thesis project and was named the outstanding aeronautical engineer in his class. He earned a master’s degree at the California Institute of Technology but dropped his plans to earn a Ph.D. to join Convair at its headquarters in San Diego, where he first worked on marine aircraft. Transferred to the company’s main aircraft factory in Fort Worth, he honed the wing of the B-24 “Liberator,” the most-produced American military aircraft. When Convair moved on to the B-36 “Peacemaker,” Mr. Widmer presided over wind-tunnel tests. The B-36 went on to become the Air Force’s largest bomber ever and a strategic stalwart in the 1950s. But it experienced repeated problems, prompting Stuart Symington, secretary of the Air Force, to pay a visit to Fort Worth, as The Dallas Morning News recounted the episode in 1997. After being lobbied by Mr. Widmer, Mr. Symington decided that the program should continue and nervously phoned his decision to Defense Secretary James Forrestal. Mr. Symington then asked Mr. Widmer and two Air Force officers to stand and join hands. “If this damn airplane doesn’t make it,” Mr. Symington told them, “we’re going to walk either east or west until our hats float.” A decade later, similar mechanical problems dogged the F-111, a medium-range attack plane. For a time Mr. Widmer flew to Washington every Saturday to confer with Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara about ironing out the flaws, Mr. Chaput said. Mr. Widmer later defied his bosses by secretly pushing ahead on the F-16, a lightweight fighter, even though there seemed to be no market for it, Mr. Chaput said. Mr. Widmer hid prototypes in hangars. Several years later, the Pentagon decided it wanted such a fighter, and General Dynamics, thanks to Mr. Widmer’s surreptitious efforts, was ready. Having been initially threatened with dismissal for insubordination, Mr. Widmer was instead promoted to vice president for science and engineering for all of General Dynamics. Among his later projects was the Tomahawk cruise missile, which was used extensively in the Persian Gulf war and the Iraq war, and a more fuel-efficient engine for automobiles that carmakers declined to buy. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Widmer is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Jeanette Billing; his son, Robert; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Widmer often worked on highly classified projects, none more secret than his proposed spy plane “Fish” (the letters stood for First Invisible Super Hustler). In a 1999 television interview, Mr. Widmer said an early concept for the plane was to build it in the shape of a disc, a statement that has since reverberated on U.F.O. Web sites. Some of the stealth technology found its way into later airplanes. Mr. Widmer was so valuable to the government that for years the C.I.A. positioned agents in parked cars at each end of the Fort Worth street where he and his family lived, his son said. Mr. Widmer himself told of being instructed to keep a low profile — to make airline reservations under a fake name and to meet agents in half-finished buildings. The ultrasecret projects he worked on were called black projects. “I’m talking about the extreme black,” Mr. Widmer said. “I have lived the extreme black.”The day the legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager shattered the sound barrier in 1947, Robert H. Widmer marched into his boss’s office at the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation in Fort Worth to say he wanted to design the world’s first supersonic bomber. He was told to stick to the contracts the company was already fulfilling.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/technology/04security.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed Says Hacker Used Stolen SecurID Data<date>Published: June 3, 2011</date><text>Lockheed Martin said Friday that it had proof that hackers breached its network two weeks ago partly by using data stolen from a vendor that supplies coded security tokens to tens of millions of computer users.Lockheed’s finding confirmed the fears of security experts about the safety of the SecurID tokens and heightened concerns that other companies or government agencies could be vulnerable to hacking attacks. The tokens, which are used to protect remote access to computer networks, are sold by the RSA Security Division of the EMC Corporation. RSA officials said Friday that they accepted Lockheed’s findings and were working with customers to offset the risks through other measures. RSA disclosed in March that hackers had stolen data that could compromise a company’s SecurID system in a broader attack, and the breach of Lockheed, the nation’s largest defense contractor, is the first time that is known to have occurred. A rash of prominent breaches has brought new attention to an increase in the frequency and sophistication of computer hacking. Google said this week that it believed an effort to steal hundreds of Gmail passwords for accounts of prominent people, including senior American government officials, had originated in China. The Pentagon, which has long been concerned about efforts by China and Russia to obtain military secrets, announced separately that it would soon view serious computer attacks from foreign nations as acts of war that could result in a military response. RSA officials noted that Lockheed said it planned to continue using the SecurID tokens, and they said they believed other customers would as well. But security experts said RSA’s reputation had most likely been seriously damaged, and many of its 25,000 customers, including Fortune 500 companies and government agencies around the world, could face difficult decisions about what to do next. RSA’s prospects for holding on to some of those customers “certainly seems bleak,” said Harry Sverdlove, the chief technology officer at Bit9, a firm that provides other types of security products and does not compete with RSA. He and other experts said RSA might need to reprogram many of its security tokens or create an upgraded version to rebuild confidence in its systems. In response to questions on Friday, Lockheed said in an e-mail that its computer experts had concluded that the breach at RSA in March was “a direct contributing factor” in the attack on its network. Government and industry officials said the hackers had used some of the RSA data and other techniques to piece together the coded password of a Lockheed contractor who had access to Lockheed’s system. Lockheed, which makes fighter planes, spy satellites and other confidential equipment, said it had detected the attack quickly and blocked it before any important data was compromised. Lockheed said it was replacing 45,000 SecurID tokens held by workers who need to log into its system from customer offices, hotels or their homes. It also required its employees to change their passwords, and it added a step to its sign-on process. One top RSA official, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity on Friday because of customer relationships, acknowledged that some customers would lose confidence in the devices. “It’s certainly going to have an initial impact,” he said. He said the company would discuss reprogramming tokens with companies. But, he said, in some cases that may require more work than other measures they could take to beef up different parts of their security systems. RSA, based in Bedford, Mass., has declined to specify what data was stolen in March. It has also said that it detected the attack as the hackers were removing the data and that the attack was only partly successful. But independent security experts have speculated that the hackers obtained at least part of the databases holding serial numbers and other critical data for the tens of millions of tokens, and Lockheed’s confirmation that the stolen data played a role in its attack supported that theory. The RSA tokens provide security beyond a user name or password by requiring users to enter a unique number generated by the token each time they connect to their networks. But to make use of the data stolen from RSA, security experts said, the hackers would also have needed the passwords of one or more users on Lockheed’s network. RSA has said that in its own breach, the hackers accomplished this by sending “phishing” e-mails to small groups of employees, including one worker who opened an attached spreadsheet that contained a previously unknown bug. This let the hacker monitor the worker’s passwords. Security specialists suspect that something similar happened in the Lockheed attack, with the hackers using the data stolen from RSA to predict the security codes that the token would generate. Mr. Sverdlove said that in mounting attacks, many hackers now studied Facebook and other social media for information to personalize their phishing e-mails and increase the odds they will be opened. He said that over the last two years, there had been “an exponential increase” in these attacks. Security experts said that the alternatives to the tokens, including computerized smart cards and biometric tools, tended to be more expensive. They said Northrop, another giant military contractor, was shifting from SecurID tokens to smart cards.Lockheed Martin said Friday that it had proof that hackers breached its network two weeks ago partly by using data stolen from a vendor that supplies coded security tokens to tens of millions of computer users.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/business/30hack.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed Strengthens Network Security After Hacker Attack<date>Published: May 29, 2011</date><text>Lockheed Martin said on Sunday that it had stepped up its investigation into a sophisticated hacking attack on its computer networks and bolstered security measures for gaining remote access to its systems.Lockheed and RSA Security, which supplies coded access tokens to millions of corporate users and government officials, said they were still trying to determine whether the attack had relied on any data that hackers had stolen from RSA in March or if it had exploited another weakness. Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., said on Saturday night that the attack, which occurred on May 21, was “significant and tenacious.” Lockheed officials said they had stopped the attack shortly after hackers got into a system, adding that no customer or company data was compromised. Sondra Barbour, Lockheed’s chief information officer, sent a memo to the company’s employees on Sunday, saying that its systems remained secure. She said Lockheed had quickly shut down remote access to its network after the attack began. Still, the attack was significant enough that it was described in briefing materials provided to President Obama, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said on Sunday. He said the damage was “fairly minimal.” Government officials have said Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, and other military companies face frequent attacks from hackers seeking national security data. Officials at Lockheed and RSA Security, a division of the EMC Corporation that provides the SecurID brand of electronic access tokens, said they were working with federal officials to investigate how the attack occurred and who was behind it. Ms. Barbour said Lockheed also had accelerated a plan to increase network security. The company has upgraded the SecurID tokens supplied by RSA and is resetting all user passwords. Lockheed also switched to eight-digit access codes from four-digit codes, which are randomly generated by the tokens. Lockheed officials said on Friday that the attack on its systems might have been linked to one on the RSA network in March. At the time, RSA said it had sustained a data breach that could have compromised some of its security products. Its announcement shocked computer security experts, particularly because its systems are widely used. Shortly after RSA announced that breach, Lockheed, like many other large companies, said it had added an additional password to the process employees used to connect to its system from remote locations. One Lockheed executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security issues, said on Sunday that investigators “cannot rule out” a connection between the attacks on the RSA and Lockheed networks. EMC said in a statement on Sunday that it was “premature to speculate” on the cause of the Lockheed attack. Some blog items and articles have suggested that customers would back away from using RSA’s SecurID tokens. But Lockheed said it planned to continue using them, and EMC said it remained confident in the tokens.Lockheed Martin said on Sunday that it had stepped up its investigation into a sophisticated hacking attack on its computer networks and bolstered security measures for gaining remote access to its systems.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/28/business/28hack.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">SecurID Breach Suggested in Hacking Attempt at Lockheed<date>Published: May 27, 2011</date><text>Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, has battled disruptions in its computer networks this week that might be tied to a hacking attack on a vendor that supplies coded security tokens to millions of users, security officials said on Friday.The SecurID electronic tokens, which are used to gain access to computer networks by corporate employees and government officials from outside their offices, are supplied by the RSA Security division of the EMC Corporation. RSA acknowledged in March that it had sustained a data breach that could have compromised some of its security products. Executives in the military industry said Friday that Lockheed’s problems appeared to stem from that data breach and could be the first public signs of damage from it. The March intrusion reverberated through the computer security community. The RSA technology is used by most Fortune 500 companies and federal agencies to provide an extra layer of security when employees use their networks from customer offices, hotels or their homes. Many of RSA’s customers have taken extra measures since the intrusion was discovered, either by adding security measures, finding alternative solutions or simply shutting off remote access. Security experts said it was possible that companies other than Lockheed had faced attacks, whether they realized it or not. “The issue is whether all of the security controls are compromised,” said James A. Lewis, a senior fellow and a specialist in computer security issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy group in Washington. “That’s the assumption people are making.” Neither RSA, which is based in Bedford, Mass., nor Lockheed would discuss the problems on Friday. Officials in the military industry, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter, said Lockheed had detected an intruder trying to break into its networks last Sunday. It shut down much of its remote access and has been providing new tokens and passwords to many workers, company employees said. Lockheed makes fighter planes, spy satellites and other confidential equipment. It also sells cybersecurity services to military and intelligence agencies, and some experts said its failure to take greater precautions with its own systems could be embarrassing. “We don’t know what they went after at Lockheed,” Mr. Lewis said, referring to the hackers behind the intrusion attempt. “One possibility is that it’s a state actor, but it could also be criminals who are trying to exploit the company’s customers.” Industry officials said military contractors, who are bombarded daily by hacking attempts, typically do not keep classified data on computers that can be entered remotely. Federal authorities have said that China, Russia and other countries sponsor hackers trying to ferret out American military and corporate secrets. Raytheon, another large military contractor, issued a statement on Friday saying that it took “immediate companywide actions” when the RSA breach was disclosed in March. “As a result of these actions,” the company said, “we prevented a widespread disruption of our network.” General Dynamics said it had not had any problems related to the breach. Other giant military contractors, like Northrop Grumman and Boeing, declined to comment. Jeffery Adams, a spokesman for Lockheed, said the company would not publicly discuss specific threats or its responses. “However, to counter any threats, we regularly take actions to increase the security of our systems and to protect our employee, customer and program data,” he said in a statement. “We have policies and procedures in place to mitigate the cyberthreats to our business, and we remain confident in the integrity of our robust, multilayered information systems security.” Security experts said companies in many industries had increased network monitoring or changed passwords and PINs for the tokens since the RSA breach. But some of the specialists said that until more details were known, it remained possible that the attempted intrusion at Lockheed was not tied to the RSA breach. The RSA tokens provide security beyond a user name or password by requiring users to append a unique number generated by the token each time they connect to their corporate or government networks. Soon after the breach in March, RSA’s chairman, Art Coviello, said the company’s investigation had revealed that the intruder successfully stole digital information from the company that was related to RSA’s SecurID products. He did not give precise details about the nature of the information but said it could potentially reduce the effectiveness of the system in the face of a “broader attack.” The company said then that there was no indication that the information had been used to attack its customers. Some computer security specialists said at the time that the compromised information was a file of master keys — long numbers — that are a part of the RSA encryption system. If the intruder did gain those numbers, it would make it possible to fashion an attack based on independently generating the keys used by individual customers. RSA officials have said that the intrusion was only partly successful. Mr. Lewis, the security specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the intruders had been detected as they were trying to transfer data by security software provided by the NetWitness Corporation, a company that provides network monitoring software. In April, NetWitness was acquired by RSA’s parent company, EMC.Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, has battled disruptions in its computer networks this week that might be tied to a hacking attack on a vendor that supplies coded security tokens to millions of users, security officials said on Friday.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/25plane.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Maker of F-35 Says Costs Can Be Lower<date>Published: May 24, 2011</date><text>CRYSTAL CITY, Va. — A new estimate that 2,400 F-35 fighter jets could cost $1 trillion to operate over 50 years has created more pressure to cut costs in the Pentagon’s largest program.Robert J. Stevens, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, which is building the planes, pledged on Tuesday that the company would reduce its share of the costs. Several senators chastised Lockheed and military officials last week over the rising estimates. Ashton B. Carter, the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer, agreed that the costs were unacceptable. Mr. Carter told the Senate Armed Services committee on Thursday that the plane “has to be affordable.” He added, “At the moment in its projections, it’s not.” The $1 trillion estimate, prepared by the Pentagon, does not include the price of buying the planes, which has been projected at up to $382 billion. It focuses instead on the cost of fuel, maintenance and spare parts for the jets and of the bases needed to house them. The new projections also come at a time when the Pentagon is facing pressure to curtail costs. President Obama recently ordered it to cut $400 billion in planned spending growth over the next 12 years. The Pentagon announced in January that it was overhauling the F-35 program for the second time in a year as delays and cost overruns mounted. The Air Force, Navy and Marines all plan to buy versions of the plane, which can evade radar. Allied nations could buy hundreds more. The plane, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, was originally billed as a Chevrolet of the skies, and it was supposed to provide proof that the Pentagon could build weapons affordably. But problems with parts and the jet’s sophisticated operating software caused delays, and the Pentagon recently slowed its purchases and shifted some of the money to other projects. Christine Fox, the director of the Pentagon’s office of cost assessment and program evaluation, told senators last week that the estimated maintenance and support costs for the F-35 were about 33 percent higher than for the military’s older F-16s and F-18s. The Pentagon has estimated that the average cost of each the planes has risen to $133 million, including the $50 billion it plans to spend on developing them. Mr. Stevens, the Lockheed chief executive, told reporters on Tuesday that the company thought it could build the planes for a significantly lower average price, as well as reduce what it might cost to maintain them. He questioned the validity of the $1 trillion estimate and said that a substantial portion of the future support costs were beyond Lockheed’s control. Mr. Stevens said Lockheed had conducted more test flights than planned so far this year, though government auditors said it had still conducted only a fraction of the overall tests that will be needed.CRYSTAL CITY, Va. — A new estimate that 2,400 F-35 fighter jets could cost $1 trillion to operate over 50 years has created more pressure to cut costs in the Pentagon’s largest program.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/us/12burlington.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Burlington Journal: In a Green Town, Activists See Red Over Lockheed Martin<date>Published: May 11, 2011</date><text>BURLINGTON, Vt. — Car sharing is beloved in this laid-back college town, as are solar panels, rain gardens and most anything designed to fight global warming from the ground up. A bicycle service will pick up your kitchen scraps for composting, and farmers will deliver your vegetables in a biodiesel-fueled truck.Pride in these homegrown efforts runs deep, and so some Burlingtonians were livid when Mayor Bob Kiss announced a partnership late last year with Lockheed Martin, the military contractor, to work on clean-energy projects. Accusations of “greenwashing” have careered about like the fighter jets that Lockheed manufactures, with opponents warning that Burlington should not lend environmental credibility to a company whose products contribute to the military’s carbon footprint. Peace activists, a fixture here for decades, have also deplored the alliance, pointing to Lockheed’s production of bombs and missiles and pointing out that Mr. Kiss, a member of the state’s liberal Progressive Party, was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. “The irony is just overwhelming,” said Anna Guyton, manager of mission and programs for the Peace and Justice Center, a local activist group. “Lockheed is just a really inappropriate partner for this city.” While a letter of cooperation dated Dec. 20 noted possible focal points, like solar and electric car technologies, Lockheed and Burlington have no specific plans yet, and the vagueness has rankled opponents. Mr. Kiss said the partnership came out of a meeting in Vancouver last year sponsored by the Carbon War Room, a nonprofit group founded by the British billionaire Richard Branson to encourage private industry to invest in — and profit from — clean-energy projects. Burlington officials approached Lockheed, Mr. Kiss said, and proposed that the company “test drive” some of its clean-energy technologies. “My perspective on this is we want to include everybody we can in addressing climate change,” he said last month at City Hall. “I would say everybody’s in, nobody’s out, so long as we’re working together.” But critics say that the city has plenty of local experts to help with the kind of projects Mr. Kiss envisions, and that Lockheed stands to benefit far more from the alliance than Burlington does. “I’m deathly afraid of polluting our image with their war machine record,” said Jeffrey C. Frost, executive director of AgRefresh, a bioenergy consulting firm here. “Realistically, why would they be coming here and asking us to partner with them? The only rational answer I can come up with is they want to associate themselves with what Burlington represents.” A spokesman for Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., said in an e-mail that the company wanted to work with Burlington because of its small size, about 42,000 people, and its long commitment to environmental sustainability. Asked about the criticism of Lockheed as a weapons manufacturer, the spokesman, Dean Acosta, said the company could in fact use its evolving clean-energy expertise to help make the world safer. “As we strategically assess future trends,” he said, “we see scarce resources — particularly energy resources — as potential sources of conflict. Through our experience in energy and expertise in complex systems engineering and 120,000 innovating minds, Lockheed Martin is well positioned to address energy security.” The partnership, he said, is a first for Lockheed. Ms. Guyton and Jonathan Leavitt, a community organizer, have sought to rally opposition with leafleting, forums at local colleges and a blog. They are also circulating a petition for a ballot question that would urge the mayor “not to enter into agreements with corporate war profiteers like Lockheed Martin.” Meanwhile, Liza Cowan, a local artist, is circulating an eye-catching series of “No Lockheed” prints to draw attention to the issue. She said she was especially unhappy that the letter of cooperation mentioned “possible support” for Burlington’s public schools. Six years ago, she fought the sponsorship of a reading program by General Dynamics, a military contractor that had a branch here at the time, which distributed pencils and books stamped with its corporate logo at local schools. “It just seems like this was going to be the same thing but on a bigger scale,” she said. Ms. Cowan also raised another common theory: that the partnership was an attempt by Lockheed to win local support for basing its F-35 fighter jets at Burlington International Airport. The Vermont Air Guard already flies F-16s here, and the Air Force has said Burlington is one of two possible bases for the F-35s. But Larry Kupferman, director of the city’s Community and Economic Development Office, said Burlington would have no say in the final decision. Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, a Progressive city councilor, said that opposition to the partnership had “spun out of control” and that residents should reserve judgment until more details emerged. “I have a personal opinion, but I also have a practical opinion,” she said. “We have a pretty aggressive climate action plan, and to even achieve small elements of it will take a lot of financial resources and planning and expertise. All of those things we can’t necessarily come up with on our own.” Noting the recent flooding from Lake Champlain, which reached record levels last week after an unusually wet winter and spring, Ms. Mulvaney-Stanak added, “The clock is ticking on climate change all around us, and we need to be pragmatic.” Under pressure from protesters, the City Council passed a resolution in February calling for any corporate partners to meet community standards. But it has yet to define those standards, which would probably be advisory at best. Mr. Kiss said most residents he had talked to about the partnership “have said, ‘If there’s a benefit then let’s proceed.’ ” “This can be swords into plowshares,” he said. “Someone could look at it and say, ‘If you want Lockheed Martin to look different, this might be one way that it’s allowed to change.’ ”BURLINGTON, Vt. — Car sharing is beloved in this laid-back college town, as are solar panels, rain gardens and most anything designed to fight global warming from the ground up.

The American ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer, who separately announced on Thursday that he would resign from his post for personal reasons, said the United States was “deeply disappointed by this news.” While political and economic relations between India and the United States have been warming for years, American arms makers have struggled to win big contracts here. After decades of frosty relations during the cold war, which pushed India to rely extensively on the Soviet Union for military hardware, many in the Indian defense establishment are still wary of American intentions and United States military aid to Pakistan, India’s main adversary. The American bid to build the fighters came from Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Boeing had offered its F/A -18 jets, and Lockheed Martin pitched its F-16 planes. But India instead narrowed the list to the Rafale fighter from Dassault and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet made by a consortium of European companies. Russian and Swedish bids were also turned down. The 126 planes are meant to replace aging Russian jets. A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said the country hoped to make a final decision by the end of March 2012. Both American companies are also looking to sell other military hardware to India, which unlike much of the Western world has been sharply increasing its defense spending. Some analysts say India could spend $50 billion to $80 billion on equipment in the next five years. One Indian international affairs analyst, C. Raja Mohan, played down the significance of the American companies’ loss of this deal. He said that the Indian government was buying more from United States contractors than ever before. “One deal doesn’t make everything,” said Mr. Mohan, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. “There has been a lot of hype about this deal. We are doing things with the U.S. that we never did before.” But another analyst, Nitin Pai, argued that India’s decision would hurt relations with the United States, at a time when the country needed stronger ties with America to advance its interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the United Nations Security Council, on which India is seeking a permanent seat. “This move will most certainly reduce India’s geopolitical leverage with the U.S. military-industrial complex, at a time when India needs it most,” Mr. Pai wrote on his blog, The Acorn. He added, “Is the United States more likely to be sympathetic to India’s interests after an $11 billion contract — which means much needed jobs for the U.S. economy — is awarded to someone else?” Dinesh Keskar, president of Boeing’s Indian operation, said that while the company was “obviously disappointed” about not making the cut for the fighter jets, it was “quite excited about the opportunities in India.” He added that the company was seeking a meeting with Indian officials to find out why its planes were not selected. Boeing said the company and the Indian Air Force were in the final stages of negotiating a contract for C-17 cargo planes that was announced by Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November. And it is hoping to win orders for attack and heavy-lift helicopters. “We are quite engaged with and will continue our partnership with India,” Mr. Keskar said in a telephone interview.NEW DELHI — The United States lost a hard-fought competition to supply a new generation of fighter jets to India, which has listed two European manufacturers as the finalists for an order estimated to be worth $10 billion.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/business/global/11fighter.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">In Canada, Opposition Grows to Purchase of F-35s<date>Published: March 10, 2011</date><text>OTTAWA — Political opposition to Canada’s plan to buy 65 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin increased on Thursday after the release of a report suggesting that the government had understated their cost by about $12 billion.The purchase has been a festering political issue in Canada since its announcement in July. Despite the size of the deal, the government did not seek competitive offers when it decided to replace its fleet of aging McDonnell Douglas CF-18 fighters. Opposition politicians have criticized the F-35, saying it is too expensive and too sophisticated for Canada’s relatively small air force. Others have questioned the wisdom of using an aircraft with only one engine to patrol Canada’s remote Arctic region. But the deal with Canada helped Lockheed’s F-35 program, which has suffered numerous delays and price increases. When the Canadian government announced its intent to purchase the planes, it estimated the price for the aircraft at 9 billion Canadian dollars ($9.3 billion). Including spare parts and maintenance, the government’s total estimate is just over 17 billion Canadian dollars ($17.5 billion). But a report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer released on Thursday concluded that the final cost would most likely be $29.3 billion. The study’s authors noted that when they asked the government for information about how it analyzed the total cost, they were told that “such analysis has not yet been undertaken.” Despite staging a ceremony to announce the deal last year, Canada has not yet signed any contracts to buy the jets. Marc Garneau, a member of the opposition Liberal Party, accused the government on Thursday of “making up” its cost estimates. His party is promising to quash the deal if it comes to power in an election that could be held this spring. In Toronto, the prime minister, Stephen Harper, stood by the government’s plans. “This is the only fighter available that serves the purposes that our air force needs,” he told reporters. John R. Kent, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin, said the company was reviewing the budget officer’s estimates.OTTAWA — Political opposition to Canada’s plan to buy 65 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin increased on Thursday after the release of a report suggesting that the government had understated their cost by about $12 billion.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/business/12nocera.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">From the Pentagon, a Buy Rating on Contractors - Talking Business<date>Published: February 11, 2011</date><text>At the Cowen &amp; Company military industry investment conference on Wednesday, the breakfast speaker was a man named Ashton B. Carter. A former academic and industry consultant, Dr. Carter, as he likes to call himself — he has a doctorate in theoretical physics, in case you were wondering — is the Defense Department’s under secretary for acquisitions, technology and logistics. That is, he’s the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer.Cowen is a small firm, but its military analyst, Cai von Rumohr, has been on the beat for more than 40 years. Companies tend not to turn him down when he invites them to his conference. W. James McNerney Jr., the chief executive of Boeing, would be making a presentation later in the day, as would executives from Northrop-Grumman and other contractors. Big institutional investors like T. Rowe Price were out in force. As was the Defense Department. In addition to Mr. Carter, a top Naval official was scheduled to present the next afternoon. If you’re wondering what high-ranking Pentagon officials were doing at an investment conference, well, suffice to say that this was not a question on the minds of the people in this room. They’ve gotten used to it. For the last few months, beginning with a secret meeting last October, Defense Department officials have been making the rounds of analysts and investors. Their main message, to put it bluntly, is that even in an era of tighter budgets, the Pentagon is going to make sure the military industry remains profitable. “Taxpayers and shareholders are aligned,” Mr. Carter intoned on Wednesday. Then he laid out a series of reforms that he said would both increase competition and maintain, as he put it, “profitability over the long term” — a phrase he repeated for emphasis. He told the assemblage that the Pentagon would frown on mergers among the five giant military contractors — the so-called primes: Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman and Boeing. However, he added, the Defense Department was going to encourage mergers among smaller military contractors. And, he said, “we will be attentive” to innovative smaller companies that provide services (as opposed to weapons systems) to the Pentagon. If you were an investor in the military industry, would you find this useful information? You bet — this is the stuff that can move markets. Although Mr. Carter made several references to “market forces,” the only market for the military industry is the government, which spends some $400 billion a year on weapons systems and other purchases. In economic terms, the Pentagon is a “ monopsony,” a single buyer with life-or-death power over its vendors. If the Pentagon wants the military industry to be healthy and profitable, it can pretty much ensure that outcome. Not being an industry insider, however, I found myself a little taken aback by Mr. Carter’s “guidance.” Monopsony or not, why should the Pentagon be talking up the stocks, even implicitly, of the companies it buys from? Why was Mr. Carter going out of his way to talk to investors and analysts? Didn’t he have more important things to do? The answer, I eventually learned, has to do with something that happened a very long time ago, and goes under the category of “Be careful what you wish for.” Let’s just say that banking isn’t the only industry where the government has allowed a handful of companies to become too big to fail.  The year was 1993. Bill Clinton was the new president, and Les Aspin was his defense secretary. As recounted later by Norman R. Augustine, then the chief executive of Martin Marietta, Mr. Aspin called together about 15 C.E.O.’s of the prime military contractors for a dinner at the Pentagon. Mr. Augustine would memorably label this dinner the Last Supper. Mr. Aspin and several other high-ranking Pentagon officials (including Mr. Carter, who was then an assistant secretary of defense) had brought the group together to send a tough message. With the Berlin Wall gone, the Soviet Union dissolved — and the Pentagon budget flat-lining — the Defense Department was no longer willing, as Mr. Augustine later recounted, “to pay the ballooning overhead” of all those contractors. In no uncertain terms, Mr. Aspin told the group that they needed to start merging. “The rest is history,” Mr. Augustine later wrote. “General Electric Aerospace merged with Martin Marietta, which combined with Lockheed. McDonnell Douglas joined Boeing. Grumman joined Northrop. When the dust had cleared, there were only a few firms left standing.” Five, to be exact. The Last Supper has become part of the lore of the military industry — though partly that’s because Mr. Aspin’s prediction about tighter Pentagon budgets turned out to be so wrong. “On the day George W. Bush took office,” said Loren B. Thompson, a well-known military consultant, “defense spending was around $300 billion.” Today it is more than double that amount, around $700 billion. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — not to mention the Pentagon’s voracious appetite for expensive weapons systems, and the lack of competition among the remaining contractors — have been a gold mine for the Big Five. Not surprisingly, for most of the first decade of the 21st century, the stocks of these companies soared. But after peaking in 2008, they came crashing back to earth. Which, for the Pentagon, has turned out to be a problem. These companies need access to the capital markets, which is more difficult when their stocks are down. And the Pentagon simply can’t allow them get into serious financial difficulty; there are just too few of them. “What we can’t afford from the defense perspective is a sick industry,” said Jacques S. Gansler, a former procurement official for the Pentagon who teaches at the University of Maryland. 1 2 Next Page »At the Cowen &amp; Company military industry investment conference on Wednesday, the breakfast speaker was a man named Ashton B.

Gerald Hunt, a managing partner of the Quattro Realty Group, a court appointed receiver of the building. Quattro is serving as the developer on a fee basis and has no ownership in the property. To complete the Nokia transaction, which was signed last May, Mr. Hunt had to overcome several obstacles. Many tenants might be wary of leasing a property that was half completed in a region that already had a surplus of vacant finished buildings. And the fact that the building was in receivership might not fill prospective tenants with confidence in the owners. Technically, the project is owned by a venture of RREEF, an institutional investor based in San Francisco, and Sand Hill Property Company of San Mateo, Calif., which ceded control of the property to the courts in 2007. Mr. Hunt would not disclose the lease terms, citing confidentiality. Office space in Silicon Valley has hovered in the mid-$30s per square foot annually for the past year, according to Colliers International, a real estate brokerage. CB Richard Ellis represented Nokia in lease negotiations, while Cassidy Turley/CPS represented Quattro. Equally unusual, at least among the high-tech businesses of Silicon Valley, Nokia decided against creating a stand-alone, enclosed campus, with features like its own commissary and gym. On looking for a location in which to consolidate its offices in Santa Clara County, “there were many vacant buildings, but they tended to be isolated places,” said Karen Lachtanski, a spokeswoman for Nokia. “We wanted to be in an area with amenities, such as being able to go out at lunchtime and have a choice of different places to eat.” The addition of hundreds of Nokia employees to the city’s downtown benefits merchants, particularly those on historic Murphy Avenue, a row of mostly vintage buildings that stands between the Caltrain commuter rail station and the new office building. “Some restaurant owners on Murphy have told us they have already seen an increase in their business” since December, when the Nokia employees began arriving at the Sunnyvale office, said John Pilger, the city’s spokesman. An official ribbon-cutting ceremony is scheduled for Thursday. Sunnyvale, a city of some 140,000 people about 50 miles south of San Francisco, is less well known than other Silicon Valley cities like Palo Alto or Cupertino, but is a major job center. The city says it has a daytime population of 230,000. The history of Sunnyvale mirrors that of Silicon Valley as a whole. The city was a whistle-stop for local farmers until the early 1940s, when the federal government built up the military industry on the West Coast. Sunnyvale and surrounding cities remained the home of major contractors throughout the cold war; Lockheed Martin remains the city’s third-largest employer, Mr. Pilger said. Like many other cities, Sunnyvale has tried to use various redevelopment tools to create a coherent, pedestrian-friendly downtown area. In the late 1970s, following the fashion of the times, the city built a regional downtown mall to compete with suburban shopping centers. But less than 20 years later the mall, called Sunnyvale Town Center, changed hands, began to founder and went into receivership in 2002. After the closing, a revolving cast of developers failed to revive the project. In 2006, a set of owners razed the mall and proposed a mixed-use center with 500,000 square feet of retail, 292 residential units and 275,000 square feet of office space, with more than 5,500 parking spaces. They were unable to find financing, and the project changed hands several more times. The last owners found their financing cut off as real estate crashed in 2007 and the project went into receivership again, this time with Mr. Hunt as the receiver. While lenders are generally wary of extending more money to failed projects, the interest from Nokia was sufficient to induce the current lenders — Bank of America and Wells Fargo — to advance $70 million to complete the building and related infrastructure like streets and sidewalks. “We were given a project that was distressed, and with work and some luck we were able to add value,” Mr. Hunt said. He may need further luck. His next challenge is to find an investor to buy the entire redevelopment area, which has an estimated value of $750 million when all buildings are completed.SUNNYVALE, Calif. — City officials are hoping that Nokia’s new building here, transformed in just six months to a gleaming corporate headquarters from a structural skeleton, will be the catalyst to revive a troubled 36-acre downtown redevelopment project after more than a decade of false starts by one developer after another.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/business/26fighter.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">New Details Released on Troubled F-35 Fighter<date>Published: January 25, 2011</date><text>Shortly before making a final push to ensure that the Marine version of the F-35 fighter was not canceled, the service’s commandant, Gen. James F. Amos, called in a former Marine corporal for a frank talk.The onetime enlisted man, Robert J. Stevens, now heads Lockheed Martin, the giant contractor that has repeatedly run into difficulties in building the plane. And based in part on Mr. Stevens’s assurances that the problems could be fixed, General Amos was able to persuade top Pentagon officials to grant a reprieve — a two-year period to either save the Marine model or forget about it. In announcing that decision this month, the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, said that he was placing the Marine model — one of three versions of the radar-evading plane — on probation. And on Tuesday, the Pentagon’s program managers released new details about some of the parts problems and possible solutions, outlining the latest markers that could determine if, or when, the plane gets back on track. The officials said some parts related to the plane’s high-powered propulsion system were being redesigned and a bulkhead in the fuselage reinforced. They added that a new lift fan that generates the powerful thrust needed for the plane to take off and land in short distances also had some heating issues and problems with vibrating doors. But the officials said in a statement that the problems were “readily solvable through engineering adjustments.” Lockheed Martin officials said they were already making some of the changes. Mr. Gates said on Jan. 6 that the Pentagon expected to spend an additional $4.6 billion to develop and test all the planes, bringing the total for the Air Force, Navy and Marine models to $51 billion by 2016. The changes are the second significant revamping in less than a year for the program, the Pentagon’s most expensive, with projected costs of $382 billion for up to 2,456 planes. And as deficit-reduction efforts gain steam, the stakes continue to rise for everyone involved because the program represents a tempting pot of money if the military is forced to further tighten its spending. The Marines feel particularly vulnerable. They passed up chances to buy other planes, betting heavily on the version of the F-35 that can take off and land almost like a helicopter and stay close to the front lines. It would replace their aging Harrier jets. General Amos said recently that he had told program managers, “I intend to personally track the progress of our airplane over the next two years.” Given the problems, he added: “I will track every pound of weight growth, required engineering fixes and every test point completed.” The F-35, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is likely to be Lockheed Martin’s largest military program for many years. But billions of dollars in revenue will also be delayed by the problems. Mr. Gates said the Pentagon would push back production of 124 of the planes to pay for the corrective work and additional flight tests and to cover some of the reductions in future military spending that the White House recently demanded. Program officials said on Tuesday that in addition to covering the extra costs on the F-35, delaying that many planes would also generate $6.9 billion in savings for the Pentagon. Mr. Gates also has a lot on the line politically. He promoted the coming of the F-35 as a reason to cancel the highflying F-22 in 2009. But some Republicans are questioning that decision again, especially now that China seems to be progressing more quickly than expected on its own fighter with radar-evading capability. In addition to the problems cited on Tuesday, a recent report by Pentagon testing officials raised questions about other systems on the F-35, including whether enough progress was being made on the millions of lines of software that control the plane. Winslow T. Wheeler, a military analyst at the Center for Defense Information, a research group in Washington, said the Marine version was “so problematic that I cannot believe that the two-year probation was anything other than Gates kicking the can to his successor to kill the thing.” But C. T. Burbage, a top Lockheed manager, said most of the difficulties stemmed from building a system that could lift more weight for every pound of thrust than any previous design. He said flight tests showed that parts of the lift system were buffeted by more air turbulence than expected. He said the lift fan’s drive shaft also expanded more than expected from the intense heat, but the company had found ways to ease that problem. Mr. Burbage also said Lockheed was concerned that the slowdown in production could complicate efforts to gain economies of scale and lower the cost of each plane. The Pentagon now estimates that each plane could cost $92 million, up from the $50 million projected in 2002.Shortly before making a final push to ensure that the Marine version of the F-35 fighter was not canceled, the service’s commandant, Gen.

The average price for the ships, including combat equipment furnished by the government and other costs, should be about $440 million, or well below a Congressional cap of $538 million per vessel, said Sean J. Stackley, the Navy’s assistant secretary for acquisition. A week ago, Congress approved the Navy’s plan to use both shipyards instead of buying a smaller number of ships from one of them. The Navy said last month that the bids were surprisingly low and asked the companies to give Congress time to consider the change. Lockheed and Austal are each already working on their second littoral ships under earlier contracts. If the Navy had stuck with its earlier plan, it would have awarded a contract for 10 ships to one of those companies and later invited other shipyards to bid for the additional work. Mr. Stackley said that by sticking with Lockheed and Austal, whose start-up expenses have already been covered, the Navy could save up to $2.9 billion in various procurement costs. The latest developments are a welcome turn for the program, which was nearly canceled after costs soared beyond the $220 million for each ship projected a decade ago. Naval warfare has shifted from the high seas to coastal areas in recent years, and the ships are supposed to be quick enough to run down small patrol craft and diesel submarines. They are highly automated, with crews of 75 people and equipment modules that can be swapped for different missions, like sweeping for mines or gathering intelligence. But the companies’ designs are strikingly different. The Lockheed Martin ship, built in Marinette, Wis., has a steel hull, while the Austal model, built in Mobile, Ala., is an aluminum trimaran, a three-hulled vessel unlike any previous Navy design. Over the long term, the Navy hopes to buy 55 of the ships. The prospect of job gains in both states helped the Navy win Congressional support.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/business/economy/18military.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Second Panel Calls for Cutting Military Spending<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>A bipartisan group of budget experts called Wednesday for steep cuts in future military spending, just as leaders of a presidential debt-reduction commission proposed last week.Taken together, the reports are likely to intensify pressure to reduce Pentagon spending and cancel troubled weapons programs as part of a broad effort to reduce federal budget deficits. But the proposals, which would cut back on expensive planes like the F-35 fighter and the V-22 Osprey, represent only the start of what could be a long debate. And it is already clear that many of the suggestions will be hotly disputed in Congress. The plan released Wednesday included a five-year freeze on Pentagon spending, along with sweeping changes in taxes and other federal programs, to reduce projected deficits by $5.9 trillion through 2020. It was prepared by a group led by former Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, who was the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee for more than a quarter-century, and Alice M. Rivlin, who served both Congress and then-President Bill Clinton as a budget director. Their proposal would freeze the Pentagon’s spending, which tops $700 billion a year, at this year’s levels from fiscal 2012 through 2016. That would mean the Pentagon budget would not even be adjusted for inflation, and the military would lose $431 billion in additional spending that the Congressional Budget Office had projected it would receive during that period. And even if annual inflation adjustments were restored in 2017, the Pentagon would still lose $1.1 trillion in cumulative spending by 2020. “Would this be easy? No,” said Gordon Adams, a professor at American University who led a team that prepared the group’s recommendations on military spending. But given that the Pentagon accounts for more than half of the government’s discretionary spending, “We think it’s a reasonable plan,” he said. Last week, the leaders of a commission created by President Obama proposed cuts in weapons systems and other expenditures that could add up to $100 billion by 2015. Those cuts were part of a larger package of spending reductions and tax increases proposed by the panel’s chairmen, Erskine B. Bowles, who was White House chief of staff under President Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican Senate leader. The recommendations from both groups have come after nearly a decade of rapid increases in military spending, and they are setting up the first serious debate since the terrorist attacks of 2001 about the size and cost of the armed services. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has sought to get ahead of the budget-cutting demands by showing that he can squeeze more efficiency from the Pentagon’s bureaucracy. He has called for the Pentagon’s budget to keep growing at 1 percent a year after inflation, plus the costs of the war in Afghanistan. He is also pushing for 2 or 3 percent in annual savings in the department’s contracting practices. He wants to use the money for other military needs. But both of the debt-reduction reports said any such savings should be used to lower the federal deficits. Speaking at a conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Mr. Gates said that the presidential commission’s proposal to slash the military budget was “math, not strategy.” “If you cut the defense budget by 10 percent, which would be catastrophic in terms of force structure, that’s $55 billion out of a $1.4 trillion deficit,” Mr. Gates said. “We are not the problem.” Mr. Adams said his group believed that the Pentagon could reduce the number of uniformed personnel by 275,000 as the Afghanistan war wound down. The group also recommended canceling all three versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. At a projected cost of $382 billion for 2,457 planes, the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin, is the Pentagon’s most expensive program. Last week, the president’s commission suggested canceling the most complex version of the plane, which can take off almost vertically, while reducing purchases of the conventional and aircraft-carrier variants. Both panels also recommended canceling the V-22, a combination of a winged plane and a helicopter, and the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, an amphibious assault craft.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/business/06ship.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Navy Ship Bidding Might Yield 2 Winners<date>Published: November 5, 2010</date><text>The Navy’s new littoral combat ships are supposed to be quick enough to run down coastal patrol craft and diesel submarines.But first they have to navigate a hairpin turn in Washington. The Navy has been sounding out legislators this week about a sudden change in its plans for buying perhaps $8 billion worth of the light ships, which represent a new approach to fighting close to shore. Instead of picking just one of the two shipyards competing to build the next 10 ships, the Navy said the bids had come in low enough that it now wants to buy 20 vessels — 10 from each yard. As the Pentagon seeks to improve its procurement practices, Navy officials say they have a rare chance to buy the 20 ships for what they had expected to eventually pay for 19. But there is a potential snag. While lawmakers seem likely to support the change, Congress has to authorize it by Dec. 14 or the bids expire. And with the Republicans winning a majority of the House seats last Tuesday, Congress will be in a lame-duck session, with only a few options for attaching the ship measure to a bill that is likely to pass. If Congress acts by the deadline, the vessels will be built by Austal USA, a unit of an Australian company that has a shipyard in Mobile, Ala., and Lockheed Martin, which has teamed up with a shipyard in Marinette, Wis. If lawmakers do not approve the change, the Navy will go ahead and award a single contract for 10 ships. Citing confidentiality of the bids, Navy officials would not say how much each ship would cost. But they said the price would be lower than previous estimates of $480 million a ship, or more than twice the projections in 2001, when the Navy began designing the ships for littoral combat, or near-shore operations. “I am hopeful that the Navy’s new L.C.S. acquisition strategy is workable,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said Friday. “However, I remain concerned that we have yet to see the details and figures supporting it.” Austal and Lockheed Martin make strikingly different versions of the ships. So to judge the new approach, Senator Shelby said, Congress needs data on how much it would cost to run separate training and maintenance operations over the life of the vessels. Capt. Cate Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman, said the service believed the extra costs would be relatively modest. Austal and Lockheed Martin also support splitting the sales. “This option is good for the taxpayers because it enables us to buy more ships for the same money and allows us to lock in a lower price for all 20 ships,” said Ray Mabus, the Navy secretary. He added, “It’s good for the Navy because it gets us more ships faster and increases our flexibility, and it’s good for industry because it maintains and even expands jobs at two shipyards.” The ships are highly automated, with 75-person crews and equipment modules that can be swapped for different missions, like sweeping for mines or gathering intelligence. The Lockheed Martin ship has a steel hull, while the slim Austral model is an aluminum trimaran, a three-hulled vessel unlike any previous Navy design. Each shipyard is now building its second vessel, and over the long term the Navy hopes to buy 55 of the ships. Jacques S. Gansler, a former top Pentagon acquisition official, said that if the bids were so close, it made sense to split the purchase, especially if the Navy required the shipyards to compete for future contracts. Mr. Gansler has contended that the Air Force could save money in the long run by setting up a similar competition for aerial refueling tankers. But the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, has rejected that idea. He has also tried to cancel an alternate engine for the F-35 fighter. Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said the Pentagon could build two versions of the ship because it had already financed the development of both. But he said that building two versions of the tanker or the F-35 engine would require billions in up-front costs that the Pentagon could not afford.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/05defense.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Wealthy and Worried, India Is Rich Arms Market<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>A big item on President Obama’s India to-do list this weekend is securing a $5 billion deal for Boeing to sell 10 of its C-17 cargo planes.The agreement, for which Boeing and American officials have long laid the groundwork, would be part of a flurry of military equipment deals that foreign suppliers are eager to nail down with India. Mr. Obama’s French and Russian counterparts are expected to visit New Delhi this year, with their own military sales contracts in hand. India, flush with new wealth but worried about its national security, is rapidly turning into one of the world’s most lucrative arms markets. In the last several years, as its budget and appetite for more sophisticated weaponry have grown, India has reduced its traditional reliance on Russia for planes, ships and missiles. The White House is backing sales like the C-17s, which India would use to transport its rapid-response forces, to help make India a regional counterweight to China. But there is a big trade motive, too. As the United States and European nations trim military spending, the biggest weapons contractors, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, see India as a sales lifeline. Still, American companies face complex political and bureaucratic obstacles to gaining a large part of India’s business. The president’s trip will be focused in part on trying to cut through some of those problems. Perhaps the biggest concern is Indian leaders’ wariness about relying too much on the United States, which they see as a new, untested military partner, and one that is also arming Pakistan, India’s main adversary. In India, the United States “starts with a handicap” on arms sales, said K. Raja Menon, a retired admiral who is chairman of an Indian government task force that studies security risks. India’s accelerating economy gives it the resources to join Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the biggest arms buyers. And its desire to upgrade its military was spurred by the terror attacks in Mumbai in late 2008, when militants slipped in by sea and killed 160 people. “There’s nothing to galvanize the psyche of the Indian people toward better defense and homeland security than what happened in Mumbai,” said Tom Captain, who leads the aerospace and defense group at Deloitte, the global consultancy. Mr. Captain and other analysts estimate that, as its military budget expands by 7 percent to 8 percent annually, India could spend $50 billion to $80 billion in the next five years on equipment. Besides the Pakistan issue, Indian military officials say that trade sanctions imposed after India conducted nuclear tests in 1998 have also put the United States at a disadvantage. Most of the sanctions, which prohibited military exports to India and exports to Indian companies believed to be involved in the nuclear program, were repealed in 2001. But the sanctions have left concerns about Americans. “There is an entrenched view in bureaucracies in India that these guys will turn off the tap,” said Mr. Menon, the retired admiral. Indian officials are also upset that other technology controls remain in place, including bans on the sale of software that could also be used for weapons. The officials will press Mr. Obama to ease those strictures. Another sticking point could be that India has balked at signing agreements to protect American secrets that are a standard part of any sales. India also uses the lure of big military contracts to require foreign companies to farm out work to Indian companies and create high-paying jobs there. But India’s fledging military industries cannot handle all the work, and American officials want more flexibility in those arrangements. At the same time, American analysts say that India’s military spending process is so chaotic and unfocused that it is proving difficult to complete deals. “India at the moment has the money to buy weapons, but behind this there is not much strategic direction,” said Stephen P. Cohen, an analyst with the Brookings Institution. Still, India’s plan to modernize its military is so sweeping that industry officials say there should be plenty of business to go around. “All I can say is that the market potential here is so significant that there is room for various countries and companies,” said Vivek Lall, the vice president in charge of Boeing’s military business in India. One of the biggest prizes would be a $10 billion contract to replace old Russian fighter planes with 126 new jets. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and four companies from Europe and Russia have bid, and the contract could be awarded next year. Mr. Obama is likely to talk up the American companies during his visit, just as Nicolas Sarkozy of France and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia are expected to make pitches for their manufacturers when they visit India. American companies are also bidding on major contracts involving helicopters and missile systems, while some earlier deals are coming to fruition. Lockheed Martin, for example, is about to deliver the first of six C-130J cargo planes that India ordered for $1 billion in 2007. Boeing, meanwhile, is building maritime surveillance planes under a $2.1 billion contract awarded in early 2009. But American executives say they realize that success in India will depend on how well they can unite with Indian companies, a process that could help them win more political support. Several American contractors have created joint ventures with a government-owned company, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. Boeing signed a 10-year, $1 billion deal with the Indian company in 2007. Hindustan is making parts for Boeing’s 777 commercial jets and for planes it is building for the Pentagon and India. And the Tata Group, India’s largest business conglomerate, is expected to deliver the first Indian-made cabins for the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter in November. Bharat Wakhlu, the resident director of Tata in New Delhi, said labor costs in India were one-eighth or less than in the United States. So even though productivity levels are lower, he said, the American companies can still realize significant savings by moving work there. American officials, however, say that Indian rules limiting foreign contractors to minority stakes in joint ventures, and requiring them to spend 30 percent of any contract money on work in India, are too onerous. But as long as India’s economy is booming, American arms suppliers may still make big gains. The cost of weapons is simply not as much a factor as it was just a few years ago, when India relied mainly on Russia for military equipment, said Gurmeet Kanwal, a retired brigadier and the director of the Center for Land Warfare Studies, a research organization in New Delhi. American technology is seen as the “top of the top,” he said, and “we should aim to pay a little more for the best equipment.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/business/02plane.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Pentagon’s F-35 Fighter Could Face Higher Costs<date>Published: November 1, 2010</date><text>Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the nation’s most expensive arms program, could face additional costs and delays beyond those that prompted the Pentagon to overhaul the effort earlier this year, an industry consultant said Monday.Loren B. Thompson, who advises Lockheed Martin and other contractors, said some Pentagon officials believed that more flight tests would be needed, especially on one version of the plane that recently had suffered from parts failures. More money and engineers will also be needed to finish the millions of lines of software programs that would control the radar-evading plane and its weapons, Mr. Thompson said in an interview. The possible delays were first reported by Bloomberg on Monday. It said projections based on preliminary test data indicated that development of the planes could cost as much as $5 billion more than previously estimated. That comes on top of a $2.8 billion increase in the spring, which brought the total for development alone to $50 billion. Bloomberg said that the versions for the Air Force and the Navy could be delayed by an additional year, while the Marine Corps model, which has had the parts failures, could be delayed by two to three more years. Mr. Thompson said Pentagon officials differed on how many more flight tests would be needed. He said the additional costs and delays could vary depending on how that question was resolved. Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, would be briefed on the concerns as part of a broader discussion of aircraft plans. Pentagon officials said a range of possible cost increases and delays would be discussed at a meeting of an acquisitions review board later this month. As a result, “it’s premature to discuss anything,” said Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman. Lockheed Martin issued a statement saying that it had cooperated with the Pentagon assessment team, but that it would not comment further until the review board released its findings. Still, the latest news tracked recent comments by Lockheed’s chief executive, Robert J. Stevens. He told analysts on Oct. 19 that the review was likely to find that “the development program will need more resources in software development and flight test.” Mr. Gates revamped the program earlier this year and removed the general in charge after lengthy delays had caused the total projected cost of developing the F-35, and buying 2,457 of the fighters, to soar to a total of $382 billion. The plane is meant to be the main fighter for all three services and some allies. The Pentagon had initially said the program would show that it could build affordable weapons without delay. But Mr. Stevens said in July that several parts, like an engine fan and hydraulic devices, were failing on the most complex version, which would allow Marine pilots to take off almost vertically. He said last month that the problems had not been resolved. Mr. Stevens said that while the flight tests had fallen behind schedule on the Marine version, they were proceeding more quickly than expected on a conventional model for the Air Force and a Navy one that can land on aircraft carriers. He also said that once full production begins, the company expects to operate efficiently enough to recoup some of the extra costs.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/20arms.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed Cuts Its Profit Estimates<date>Published: October 19, 2010</date><text>Lockheed Martin on Tuesday cut its earnings forecast for 2010, and said delays in the award of Pentagon programs would hurt its sales growth and leave profits flat in 2011.The company, the world’s largest military contractor, said the percentage growth rate in its sales would slow to the “low single-digit range” next year as a long surge in Pentagon spending came to an end. Lockheed also announced that its third-quarter profit dropped 28 percent, to $571 million, or $1.57 a share, compared with $797 million, or $2.07 a share in the period a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were $565 million, or $1.55 a share, compared with $786 million, or $2.04 a share. The earnings beat the average analyst estimate of $1.53 a share, according to Bloomberg. Sales rose 6 percent, to $11.38 billion, from $10.77 billion. The drop in quarterly profit was partly a result of a $178 million charge for a buyout program for 600 executives. The company said the reduction in its forecast for 2010 earnings also reflected plans to divest units and add more money to its pension funds. Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., said it now expected its full 2010 earnings from continuing operations to be $6.75 to $6.95 a share, down from the previous range of $7.15 to $7.35. Earlier, the average estimate of analysts was $7.11 a share. As the Pentagon moves to save $100 billion through tighter contracting and other measures, Lockheed said it faced further pressures, with some plans for new programs being canceled or delayed. Bruce L. Tanner, Lockheed’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said possible contracts for a Navy ship that could operate in coastal waters and for missile defense systems had been delayed by several months, reducing the amount of new business it expected in early 2011. He said that the company’s expansion into solar energy had also developed more slowly than expected. The company had hoped, Mr. Tanner said in an interview, that this energy business would bring in hundreds of millions in sales by 2011. But with utilities and governments also canceling and delaying projects, “we’re not expecting it to be anywhere near that level,” he said. Mr. Tanner said Lockheed’s aeronautics business should show strong growth next year. It will benefit from production increases for the new F-35 fighter, a radar-evading plane that is expected to become the main fighter for the United States and a number of its allies. But Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, said Tuesday that his government would order fewer of the F-35s than the 140 that his country had previously sought. He also said Britain would buy a version of the F-35 that could be catapulted from an aircraft carrier rather than a more expensive variant that can take off almost vertically. Lockheed’s chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, told analysts that while the company would lose some sales to Britain, it expected to offset the losses through sales to countries in the Middle East and Asia. Shares of Lockheed fell 57 cents, to $69.47, on Tuesday.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/cerberus-said-to-eye-500-million-lockheed-unit/?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Cerberus Said to Eye $500 Million Lockheed Unit<date>September 28, 2010, 6:38 am</date><text>Cerberus Capital Management is among the suitors for a Lockheed Martin division that provides military training services and is being marketed for around $500 million, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Lockheed Martin, which hired Evercore to run the auction, is planning management meetings with the interested parties this week and wants to reach a deal by the end of this year, the people said.

But the response shows how significantly the industry has begun to contract as a long surge in military spending comes to an end. Lockheed had expected only 200 or so executives to apply, the company said. Nonetheless all 600 requests are expected to be honored. The retrenchment at Lockheed, the world’s largest military company, seems likely to heighten concerns about further job cuts in the high-paying aerospace and defense industries at a time when the nation’s unemployment rate remains high. Lockheed has reduced its work force by 10,000, to a total of 136,000, since the beginning of last year. Boeing, another big Pentagon contractor, said Tuesday that it would cut the number of executives in its military aircraft business by 10 percent as part of broader consolidation that will eliminate more than 400 jobs. The company, which also makes commercial jetliners, has already trimmed 1,700 jobs in its military business as part of a reduction of 10,000 jobs across the company. And Northrop Grumman recently announced plans to close troubled shipyards as it considers spinning off its $6 billion shipbuilding business. Northrop announced in late August that it would lay off 642 workers at its shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., by the end of the year. By 2013, it plans to close a shipyard near New Orleans that employs 4,700 people and shift the work to Pascagoula. The loss of jobs comes as the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, has canceled or restructured nearly three dozen weapons programs since last year. And as the growth in military spending slows, Mr. Gates is pushing for more overhead cuts and greater efficiency to free money for the most crucial programs. Pentagon officials have said they are singling out wasteful spending and that the belt-tightening would not necessarily lead to job losses. But top industry executives say that it would be hard to meet Mr. Gates’s goal of saving $100 billion over the next few years without cutting jobs and closing plants, and that could stir Congressional opposition to some of the proposals. “It seems that many senior executives expect the future to be less bright, and some of them may be pretty smart to take the buyout since their next chance to get out could be on far less attractive terms,” said Loren B. Thompson, a Lockheed consultant. He said the buyouts and recent layoffs “are a sure sign that things are deteriorating for the industry.” Lockheed’s chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, said in a statement on Wednesday that the 600 buyouts would “enable us to achieve significant cost savings and a leaner management structure at a time when our customers have an urgent need for more affordable solutions to the global security challenges they face.” Lockheed officials said the buyout offer had been extended to vice presidents as well as directors, a title accorded to many program managers and department heads. The terms were fairly generous. Executives with 20 years at the company could receive a lump sum equal to 1.25 times their annual base pay, as well as $2,000 for each year they had been at the company to help pay for their own health insurance. The company said so many people took the offer that it would have to hire some replacements. It could not immediately say how much the buyouts would save. As part of the Pentagon’s cost-saving plan, Mr. Gates has also proposed closing a major military command and reducing the number of generals and admirals. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer, Ashton B. Carter, has been talking to industry executives about how to reduce cost overruns and make weapons more affordable. Like other big contractors, Lockheed has reorganized some of its operations, and it is planning to divest itself of two units. Most of the companies have also been expanding their international sales and adding jobs in hot new areas, like computer security, to try to maintain their profit margins even if Pentagon sales flatten out or decline.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/business/28fighter.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed Says Several Parts for F-35s Are Failing<date>Published: July 27, 2010</date><text>Lockheed Martin said Tuesday that several parts on the most complex version of its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were failing more often than expected, a problem that is slowing flight testing on a model tailored for the Marines.The company’s chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, told analysts that the problems had occurred on the version that can take off in short distances and land vertically like a helicopter. Mr. Stevens said the defects had reduced the flight tests on that model to 74 so far this year, 21 fewer than planned. He said the company was working with suppliers to fix the problems and thought it could catch up by extending some of the flights. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates recently revamped the F-35 program and removed the general in charge after delays caused projected costs to soar to $382 billion for 2,457 planes. Mr. Stevens said the company’s overall performance was improving, with flight tests on the other two versions of the plane ahead of schedule. He reiterated that the company expected to build the next 32 planes for at least 20 percent less than Pentagon estimates. Mr. Stevens said the parts that had failed on the version for the Marines included a fan that cools the engine and the hydraulic devices that open air-flow panels to provide the vertical thrust. He said valves, switches and power system components had also been unreliable. Company executives said the problems should not delay delivery of the first planes for the Marines next year. The F-35, intended to evade radar, is the Pentagon’s largest program. The other versions are a conventional jet for the Air Force and one that can land on aircraft carriers. Separately, Lockheed, which previously said it was selling two units, reported Tuesday that its second-quarter profit from continuing operations was $727 million, or $1.96 a share, compared with $731 million, or $1.87 a share a year ago. Net income was $825 million, or $2.22 a share, compared with $734 million, or $1.88 a share a year ago. Revenue rose 3 percent, to $11.44 billion. Lockheed increased its forecast for 2010 earnings to $7.15 to $7.35 a share. Lockheed has been cutting overhead costs as the growth in Pentagon spending slows. But like other industry executives, Mr. Stevens said he sees higher growth in foreign sales. Meanwhile, the House defense appropriations subcommittee voted 11 to 5 Tuesday to add $485 million to next year’s military budget to keep developing an alternate engine for the F-35. But, also as expected, it decided not to approve the purchase of more Boeing C-17 cargo planes.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/business/global/20iht-ravblimp.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Craft Is Lighter Than Air — and Doesn’t Pollute It<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>PARIS — Early on July 25, 1909, the French aviator Louis Blériot made the first flight across the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, in an aircraft that he had designed himself.This summer, a group of French students hopes to repeat the epic flight in a self-designed, but very different, aircraft — a solar-powered dirigible. Project Sol’R is an initiative by students from the French engineering university INSA Lyon and the Essec international business school. The team has designed and built the first manned solar airship, intended to demonstrate the possibilities of zero-emission flight. Completed in 2009, their prototype, named Néphélios, is a semi-flexible helium-filled airship measuring 22 meters, or 72 feet, long and 5.5 meters in diameter. It consists of a lightweight aluminum frame with an outer skin of nylon and polyethylene. Stretched along the top of the balloon are 42 thin-film solar cells that produce enough energy to drive an electric motor turning two large propellers. The team originally planned the Channel crossing to coincide with the centenary of the Blériot flight last year, but technical difficulties pushed back the flight. Still, Bastien Lefrançois, the dirigible’s 27-year-old pilot, has now made a dozen short test flights on the Néphélios: “For the moment, it has been quite successful,” Mr. Lefrançois said in an interview this month. “But we had many reliability problems in the beginning.” Early problems related mostly to wiring, components and wind disturbances. But the biggest challenge facing the team now, Mr. Lefrançois said, involves the solar cells. Although the cells work well, energy conversion efficiency is poor. Laid out flat, and in full sunshine, “the theoretical maximum the solar cells can generate is 2.4 kilowatts,” Mr. Lefrançois said. “But because of the curve of the envelope, we can only generate a little less than 2 kilowatts, and for the moment we are getting a third of that.” The issue of conversion efficiency is just one of many that the team has encountered along its learning curve — which is the point of the exercise. With a maximum speed of 40 kilometers per hour, or 25 m.p.h., and lifting capacity of 350 kilograms, or 772 pounds, Néphélios is unlikely to make it in the worlds of commercial transportation or heavy lifting. As a technological test bed, however, it can provide valuable insights for the development of photovoltaic cell technology. As with Solar Impulse, the experimental solar-powered aircraft that completed its first night flight July 8, Néphélios is a concept vehicle for technologies that may lead the way to cleaner, greener future aviation. At the very least, its value is symbolic: calling people’s attention to the possibilities of carbon-free air travel. Silent, ultralong-endurance solar airships, moreover, have enormous commercial and military potential for surveillance and intelligence missions. Lockheed Martin’s High Altitude Airship program is one example of an attempt to develop a commercial applications for dirigible technology. The U.S. defense contractor is working on an unmanned, untethered, solar-powered dirigible to be used as a platform for surveillance and telecommunications equipment. The project was canceled in 2008 because of budgetary constraints, but Lockheed Martin said recently that it had received additional funding in May from the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command to restart the program. A prototype test flight is planned for the summer of next year.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/global/19iht-ravspace.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">New Mission for American Aerospace Giants<date>Published: July 18, 2010</date><text>NEW YORK — For Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the other aerospace giants that have been the backbone of the American space effort for decades, the shift in U.S. space policy announced by President Barack Obama means a major change in mission.After working for decades with largely one customer — the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration — to ferry astronauts and equipment into orbit, major players in the aerospace industry are facing a commercial market with a range of entrepreneurs who say they can do that work for less. Under Mr. Obama’s ambitious initiative, NASA would rely on commercial companies to provide a kind of taxi service to the International Space Station, while focusing its efforts on missions into deep space with international partners. How the aerospace industry establishment will fit into this new plan remains far from clear, analysts say. “I see a certain analogy with what happened when computers went from being room-sized to being on the desktop,” said Louis D. Friedman, executive director for Planetary Society, a space exploration advocacy group. “Some companies barely survived, while others adapted and thrived. I think we are going to see something like this in the aerospace industry.” The most immediate effect of the proposed policy shift will be on jobs. Mr. Obama’s plan to cancel the Constellation program, started five years ago by President George W. Bush to send astronauts back to the moon, could mean the end of nearly 12,600 jobs, according to estimates by aerospace contractors. The cuts would fall most heavily on Alabama, California, Florida, Texas and Utah, and political opposition from those states has been vociferous. The Constellation program has already cost American taxpayers about $9 billion. The end of Constellation would largely stop work on the Ares I rocket, which was to replace the space shuttle for carrying astronauts into orbit and would scale back work on the Orion crew capsule, which was to ride atop the Ares I. Lockheed Martin said more than 2,000 jobs depended on the Orion program, while Boeing said 1,500 jobs would be affected by the retirement of the space shuttle and the canceling of Constellation. Alliant Techsystems, known as ATK, said the ending of Ares I would put 5,000 jobs at risk at its plants and those of its subcontractors. Mr. Obama has said that the changes do not amount to a retreat from manned spaceflight and that adding private entrepreneurs to the mix will create a more vibrant industry with more astronauts in space and more business for established companies and newcomers alike. One established player that appears to accept Mr. Obama’s plan is United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company, whose Atlas and Delta rockets have carried military and commercial satellites into space for decades, said it had no plans to cut any jobs. “Just the opposite,” a U.L.A. spokesman said. “The president’s new plan could have a significant increase in demand coming from NASA and could create new jobs at U.L.A.,” the spokesman said, adding that U.L.A.’s long record of successful launchings made it “very different from new entrants.” One new entrant much on the minds of the aerospace community is Space Exploration Technologies, founded by Elon Musk, the Internet entrepreneur who helped found the payment system PayPal. The company, which did not exist a decade ago, has $2.5 billion in contracts, including $1.6 billion from NASA to provide a minimum of 12 flights to deliver cargo to the space station starting in 2011. The company, known as SpaceX, bolstered the credibility of Mr. Obama’s plan by launching into orbit last month the Falcon 9, a rocket measuring 158 feet, or 48 meters, and weighing 735,000 pounds, or 335,000 kilograms. The rocket, which the company said cost about $50 million, put a model of its Dragon capsule into orbit about 160 miles, or 260 kilometers, above the Earth without a hitch — an unusual development for a maiden flight. SpaceX, which plans to launch a fully operational rocket and capsule this summer before sending one to the International Space Station next year, said the successful June trial was a major victory “for NASA’s plan to use commercial rockets for astronaut transport.” The part of Mr. Obama’s plan that calls for missions that leave the Earth’s orbit to explore deep space will probably not be spelled out for several years. Mr. Obama has said that NASA will start developing a heavy-lift rocket for deep-space missions by 2015. That gap of several years between the planned end of the Constellation program and the start of work on a new heavy-lift vehicle does not please the aerospace contractors, who say they could shift at least some workers who might otherwise be laid off into a new deep-space program. It is also dangerous, some analysts say, because after canceling the Ares I, the United States would have no backup rocket if new commercial companies failed to deliver on their promises. “It’s a risky strategy,” said Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research group financed in part by military contractors. “Our capacity to send man-rated rockets into space is at risk.” In a statement in response to Mr. Obama’s April 15 speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida outlining his new policy, Boeing emphasized the need for immediate development of a heavy-lift vehicle. “We have the technology and the people to commence development of these vehicles now,” Boeing said. Accelerated development of a deep-space launching vehicle and capsule “could achieve maximum benefit for American tax dollars by drawing on the cutting-edge technology already being developed for the Constellation program,” Boeing said. John M. Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said he had no doubt that NASA would contract for a heavy-lift vehicle sometime in the next few years and that the traditional aerospace companies would get the bulk of this work. “But in the short-term, they stand to lose the contracts for Constellation and all that goes with it,” he said “They are trading contracts in hand for some very uncertain contracts in the future.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/business/global/17fighter.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Canada’s Defense Chief Rejects Criticism of F-35 Jet<date>Published: July 16, 2010</date><text>OTTAWA — Canada’s defense minister rejected suggestions on Friday that the F-35 fighter jet was unnecessarily sophisticated and costly for the country’s relatively small air force.After confirming that Canada will spend about 9 billion Canadian dollars, or $8.7 billion, to buy 65 F-35s from Lockheed Martin and to cover deployment costs, Peter MacKay said that the Conservative government would not compromise on military equipment. “This aircraft is the best that we can provide our men and women in uniform and this government is committed to giving them the very best,” Mr. MacKay told a news conference while standing in front of a full-size model of the fighter jet. The announcement of a multibillion-dollar commitment by the Canadian government should bolster a program that has been plagued with delays and substantial price increases. Even before the announcement, the purchase had become the source of political controversy. Aside from its cost, which may reach 16 billion Canadian dollars once maintenance and parts contracts are signed, opposition politicians are angry about the lack of a competitive tender process. On Thursday, the Liberal Party said that it would oppose the purchase. An alliance of opposition parties could stall or block the deal. “I’m not suggesting that this may not be the best fighter aircraft for the Canadian forces,” said Ujjal Dosanjh, a Liberal member of Parliament responsible for military issues. “But we don’t know that without going through a process.” “It’s nice to have the latest and the greatest,” said Jack Harris of the New Democratic Party. “But do we need that to protect our country? We’re not, as we were in the cold war, facing off against the Soviet military.” Canada is one of eight countries helping the United States build the fighter, which will be less detectable by radar than older planes and versatile enough to attack ground targets. The Canadian government has announced that it will phase out its recently updated fleet of CF-18 jets beginning in 2017. Kim M. Testa, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin, said that Canada would complete the procurement in 2014 and begin accepting delivery two years later. Other nations have also debated the necessity of an aircraft as costly and sophisticated as the F-35. Opposition leaders in Denmark and the Netherlands are questioning whether they can afford to buy the plane at a time when their economies are under pressure. Lockheed, however, needs to hold onto the foreign sales to lower the cost of the planes. The American defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, recently revamped the F-35 program and removed the general in charge, after the Pentagon’s projected costs soared 64 percent to $382 billion for 2,457 planes. The eight allies have invested a total of $4 billion in developing the plane and could buy hundreds of the planes through specific orders, most of which remain to be negotiated. But Lockheed Martin’s chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, said in June that the company was cutting its costs and improving the efficiency of its production. Though recent Pentagon estimates have placed the cost of a single F-35 as high as $112 million, Mr. Stevens said Lockheed believed it could lower the cost, by 2014 or 2015, to be comparable to updated and fully loaded versions of older fighters, like Boeing’s F/A-18 and Lockheed’s own F-16. That would reduce the price of each F-35 to about $65 million. During the news conference, Mr. MacKay would not say how much Canada would pay for each jet. Although he did indicate that the 9 billion Canadian dollar figure includes other costs like training, improvements to airbases as well as simulators. A Canadian procurement official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said that the government was assuming that it would pay 90 million Canadian dollars for each F-35 although it anticipated that the final cost would be much lower. Tom Burbage, a top Lockheed manager for the program, said the company expected to sell the planes to Canada for $60 million to $65 million each, not accounting for maintenance, parts or inflation. One factor that may determine the political fate of the deal is Lockheed’s willingness to buy parts from Canadian suppliers. Unlike other major military contracts given to foreign companies by Canada, Lockheed is not required to spend any money in Canada. By agreeing to purchase the planes, however, Canadian aerospace companies, many of which are American owned, can now bid on supplying the global F-35 project. Ms. Testa said that Lockheed would buy about $10 billion of components and parts from Canadian aerospace companies as part of the deal. Canadian officials anticipate that the final amount will be higher. While Canada did not call for tenders, Boeing has been lobbying the Canadian government and opposition politicians to consider the F/A-18, an update of the aircraft that is the basis of the government’s current CF-18s. And a consortium of European manufacturers has been promoting the Eurofighter Typhoon. During the news conference, Rona Ambrose, the minister of public works, said that the government considered asking for bids at one point but rejected the idea after concluding that the F-35 was the only aircraft capable of meeting its needs. She also suggested that the process during the 1990s that ultimately led Lockheed to provide the United States with its next fighter jet was a surrogate for traditional tendering by Canada. Canada, like the other partner nations, had a role in that review. The Canadian military has been remarkably absent from the public debate. While it is believed that its leadership is not opposed to the government’s plan to buy new aircraft, there are indications that some have concerns about the F-35. Canada’s air force rarely flies combat missions, arguably making some of the F-35’s advanced features, like radar-evading stealth, seem like frills. Unlike the twin-engine CF-18, the F-35 has only one engine. Its failure could leave pilots exposed to the harsh Arctic environment as they await rescue. But military officials in a briefing on Friday said they were not seriously concerned about that issue and noted that CF-18s had crashed in the Arctic, if for other reasons.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/business/global/17airshow.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">At Air Show, the Economic View Depends on the Plane<date>Published: July 16, 2010</date><text>FARNBOROUGH, ENGLAND — For the executives arriving Monday at the Farnborough International Airshow, the expectations for this weeklong aerospace bazaar will probably depend on who their customers are.Makers of commercial airliners and their suppliers are undoubtedly encouraged by the accelerating pace of the economic recovery across most of the globe, counting on a renewed surge in demand for air travel to be translated soon into orders for new aircraft. Business jet manufacturers, too, have noted a modest upturn in corporate traffic since the start of the year. But for those who supply the world’s militaries, the environment has grown decidedly more challenging, with governments in the United States and Europe preparing sharp cuts in military spending as they seek to rein in ballooning budget deficits. Some analysts have begun to describe the downsizing of Western military budgets as the “new normal,” a trend that may have manufacturers looking to export more to emerging markets or to branch out into areas like space, security and civil nuclear businesses. “The industry is getting used to the idea that the massive buildup and modernization program for defense across the world for the last 15 years is over,” said Ian Godden, the chairman of ADS, a British aerospace and defense trade body that also owns Farnborough International, host to the biennial show, which takes place about an hour’s journey from London. With most of the industry still struggling to return to profit after a devastating 2009, financial constraints could reduce the number of international trade representatives attending the show. Those representatives traditionally make up about one-third of the total number there. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest military contractor, plans to reduce its presence by half, compared with the level in 2008, citing budget pressures. Yet the show’s organizers say exhibition space is sold out, with the overall number of companies registered this year slightly higher than the 1,400 who took part two years ago. Mr. Godden said he expected about 180,000 people to visit the show, which opens its gates to the public next Saturday and Sunday. “For every Lockheed, there is a China, Russia, Brazil or a Mexico that is sending bigger numbers,” Mr. Godden said, noting that nearly 10 percent of exhibitors will be coming to Farnborough for the first time. The world’s two major commercial jet makers, Airbus and Boeing, will be hoping to tap into renewed optimism about air travel after two years of devastating losses for most of the world’s airlines. Last month, the International Air Transport Association, a trade group based in Geneva, predicted that carriers would report a collective profit of $2.5 billion this year after recording a $9.9 billion loss in 2009 and a $16 billion loss in 2008. Global air transport demand rose above pre-recession levels in May, with a 12 percent increase in passenger traffic from the level of a year earlier and a 34 percent jump in cargo traffic, the I.A.T.A. said. “I think we can declare the recession over, both in terms of order book and production,” Mr. Godden said. “I think we’ll start to see orders rebuilding, starting this quarter, and then continue for the next three years.” Still, many caution that the recovery has been uneven and profit margins at most major carriers remain razor-thin, leaving little cash available for new aircraft purchases in the near term. “The year-to-date traffic statistics are still pretty weak,” said Phil Toy, a managing director at AlixPartners, a consulting firm in New York, noting that European carriers were still expected to lose about $2.8 billion this year. “European economies are still very weak, the U.S. economy is weak,” Mr. Toy said. “And at the end of the day, that is where the majority of travel takes place.” He noted that aircraft deliveries were still down 9 percent in the first quarter from the level of a year earlier, while new orders, which plunged 70 percent in 2009, have only partially recovered. Randy Tinseth, vice president for marketing at Boeing, said the U.S. plane maker would announce some new orders at Farnborough but predicted that airlines would not start looking to rebuild their fleets significantly until 2012. “As this year has gone by, everyone has gotten more positive about the market, but 2010 is still a year of economic recovery,” Mr. Tinseth said. Middle Eastern and Asian airlines have been among the few who have continued to purchase new planes during the recession as they have sought to extend their strategic reach around the globe. Emirates, the carrier based in Dubai, grabbed headlines last month, for example, when it announced a deal for 32 Airbus A380s, bringing its total number of orders for the two-deck superjumbo to 90 planes. “For the moment, we are seeing mainly the same type of airlines placing orders,” said Damien Lasou, a managing director at Accenture in Paris. “When we see airlines in Europe and North America starting to buy aircraft again, that will be for me the real confirmation of an upturn.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/business/global/16fighter.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Canada Plans to Buy F-35s, but Hurdles Remain<date>Published: July 15, 2010</date><text>OTTAWA — The Canadian government is expected to announce on Friday that it will buy 65 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin.The announcement of a multibillion-dollar commitment by a foreign government would be a big boost for the jet program, which has been plagued with delays and substantial price increases. It is also being made without bids from other manufacturers. But long before any announcement was imminent, the purchase became politically controversial in Canada. On Thursday, the Liberal Party said that it would oppose the purchase.

Ms. Testa said that Lockheed would buy about $10 billion of components and parts from Canadian aerospace companies as part of the deal.

Ms. Testa, the Lockheed Martin spokeswoman, said that the final price would be determined through negotiations between Canada and the United States. But she said Lockheed expected to sell planes for around that price or a little more. That could amount to about $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion for the 65 planes, not accounting for inflation, maintenance or parts. Politicians in Canada have repeatedly cited estimates from the Canadian news media ranging from 9 billion Canadian dollars ($8.7 billion) for the basic contract and up to 16 billion Canadian dollars ($15.5 billion) when service costs are included. While Canada did not call for tenders, Boeing has been lobbying the Canadian government and opposition politicians to consider the F/A-18, an update of the aircraft that is the basis of the government’s current CF-18s.

(AP) — The Pentagon said late Monday that it had awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth up to $5 billion to support special operations forces, reinstating a program the company lost last June to a rival military contractor, L-3 Communications.Lockheed was originally awarded the contract in March 2009, but it was terminated in June 2009 over a protest by L-3. L-3’s special support programs division was temporarily barred earlier this month from getting new federal contracts or orders because of an Air Force investigation into whether those employees were inappropriately monitoring and copying e-mail traffic. L-3, based in New York, has said it is cooperating fully with the government and is providing information to the Air Force. L-3 said on Tuesday that the special operations contract represented 3 percent of its 2009 sales, and the loss of it would trim fiscal year net income by 4 cents a share and full-year revenue by $150 million. Lockheed will provide logistics and other support services for the United States Special Operations Command. The contract is expected to run through 2018. Shares of Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., fell 21 cents, to close at $79.86, while shares of L-3 Communications, based in New York, fell $2.59 to close at $78.80. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/business/18lockheed.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed in Talks to Cut Price of F-35 Jets by 20%<date>Published: June 17, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin is negotiating to cut the price for the next group of its new F-35 fighter planes to at least 20 percent less than Pentagon officials projected last fall, Robert J. Stevens, the chief executive, said Thursday.The company, which has been under pressure because of costly delays, is likely to build those planes under a contract with a fixed price, Mr. Stevens said. He said Lockheed could earn bonuses for meeting production milestones. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates recently revamped the F-35 program and removed the general in charge, after long delays caused the Pentagon’s projected costs to soar by 64 percent to $382 billion for 2,457 planes. Mr. Stevens told reporters that the contract would start a transition to fixed prices for the stealth planes two years earlier than planned. He would not say what that price was likely to be for the next group of 32 planes. But he said Lockheed was confident enough that it was regaining control of the F-35 program, the Pentagon’s largest, to start bearing more of the risk instead of leaving the federal government obligated to cover any cost increases. Mr. Stevens also said that Lockheed, the world’s largest military contractor, had begun to trim spending throughout the company in recognition of “the new reality we face,” with military budgets tightening in response to economic woes. To reinforce the need to cut costs, Mr. Stevens said that he would not attend one of the industry’s most lavish promotional events, the Farnborough International Airshow outside London, next month. He said Lockheed would send only half as many people as usual. Bruce L. Tanner, Lockheed’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in an interview that it could save hundreds of millions of dollars through the cost-cutting, which began in February. Last month Mr. Gates also called for cuts in the Pentagon bureaucracy to free more money for troops in the field. The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines are all buying their own versions of the F-35, known as the Joint Strike Fighter. Eight other nations have invested in developing the F-35 and could buy hundreds of the planes. Mr. Stevens said on Thursday that the $382 billion estimate over 25 years “shows the potential” if nothing changed in the program. But, he said, “we’re determined to beat the government cost estimate.” The Pentagon has already ordered 31 of the planes. The contract now being negotiated would cover 32 more. Not counting the research and development costs, the Pentagon recently projected that the 2,457 planes could cost an average of $92.4 million before adjusting for inflation, compared with an estimate of $50 million in 2002. Mr. Stevens said that if the Pentagon kept buying the planes at the planned pace, Lockheed believed it could bring the cost down, by 2014 to 2015, to a level comparable to updated and fully loaded versions of older fighters. That would mean reducing the price of each F-35 to $65 million or less.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/business/07copter.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Boeing Plans to Bid on Presidential Helicopter<date>Published: June 7, 2010</date><text>Boeing plans to announce on Monday that it will enter the bidding to build a fleet of presidential helicopters, adding a major new player to a project the Pentagon is trying to revive after President Obama criticized it last year as contracting “gone amok.”Boeing will buy the rights to build a midsize helicopter from AgustaWestland, a European company, according to Philip J. Dunford, vice president and general manager of Boeing Rotorcraft Systems. AgustaWestland had previously teamed with Lockheed Martin for the project, which the Pentagon canceled in June 2009, citing cost overruns. Boeing said that by building the helicopters itself, it hopes to avoid some of the problems that hampered the previous contractors. And there are signs that the Pentagon might ease some of the arduous requirements that caused the projected cost to double, to $13 billion for just 28 helicopters. Pentagon officials, who are seeking preliminary information from potential bidders this month, now hope to build a fleet of 23 to 28 helicopters at a cost of $6 billion to $10 billion. Their goal is to replace the aging helicopters that carry the president and his aides on short trips with more futuristic craft that could provide some protection against terrorist attacks. Boeing’s involvement is likely to help heighten the competition and could help keep down the cost. The bidding process will probably start next year. Still, in the insular world of military contracting, where there are only a few major manufacturers, the government is likely to end up choosing between two helicopters similar to those in the original contest in 2005, industry officials say. Sikorsky, which lost that competition, recently teamed up with AgustaWestland’s old partner, Lockheed Martin, for the new round of bidding. They plan to offer a helicopter based on Sikorsky’s H-92 medium-lift craft. Under the licensing deal, Boeing will offer its version of AgustaWestland’s AW101, which is similar to the helicopter that won the earlier contest. No one should expect to see the new helicopters alighting on the White House lawn anytime soon. Given the embarrassment over how poorly it managed the previous contract, the Navy, which is in charge because the Marines fly the helicopters, is taking its time in putting together the new competition. And President Obama has said he can make do with the older helicopters, which Sikorsky built in the 1970s and 1980s. So industry officials say they would be surprised if a contract was awarded before the presidential election in late 2012. The Navy does not expect to field any of the new craft before 2017 to 2023. In striking the licensing deal with AgustaWestland, a unit of Finmeccanica of Italy, Boeing will be starting with a larger helicopter than Sikorsky, and one that was selected in 2005 partly because it could seat more people with fewer modifications. Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst for the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said the larger helicopter remained in “kind of a sweet spot” and would retain an advantage if the Navy continued to insist that the new craft seat 14 people, as it did in the previous round. But if it reduces that requirement, the Sikorsky craft could become “a less expensive solution,” he said. Boeing said the licensing deal would give it all the intellectual property, data and production rights for the helicopter, enabling it to build the craft, to be called the Boeing 101, in the United States. “We will have the capability to modify the aircraft any way we want without going back to AgustaWestland,” Mr. Dunford, the Boeing executive, said. Like Sikorsky, Boeing builds other helicopters that are widely used by the military, and it has built the president’s passenger jets, known as Air Force One. Mr. Dunford said the licensing deal was only for the presidential helicopter contest. Government auditors have said that most of the overruns on the earlier contract came not from the basic helicopter but from the modifications that the Bush administration required to make the craft more secure from terrorist attacks. It is not yet clear how many of those requirements — which called for protection against chemical and biological attacks as well as the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast — will change. But the Navy seems to be pulling back in one area in its request for information: it is reducing the maximum distance that the helicopter needs to travel without refueling to 275 nautical miles, from 315. Industry officials say it is hard to build a helicopter that could travel more than 300 miles — presumably to take the president to a bunker — and still be small enough to land without tearing up the White House lawn. The Navy has also asked the manufacturers for information about larger models or combinations of helicopters that could split the day-to-day and emergency missions. But industry officials believe the Navy would prefer to buy just one midsize model. It spent nearly $4 billion on the earlier failed effort. And given the delay, it will have to spend tens of millions to extend the lives of some of the older helicopters until the new ones are ready. Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies, would be the prime contractor in its bid with Lockheed Martin, which had previously played that lead role when it worked with AgustaWestland.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/business/03arms.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed Selling 2 Units and Realigning Others<date>Published: June 2, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Lockheed Martin Corporation said Wednesday that it would sell two businesses and realign others to improve performance and avoid potential problems over new government regulations for military contractors.The company said it would sell the enterprise integration group and the Pacific Architects and Engineers unit. Combined, the two make up about 3 percent of Lockheed’s annual revenue. The chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, said in an interview that the changes were based on Lockheed’s assessment of the market for global security services and the needs of its customers, made up mostly of government agencies like the Pentagon and intelligence services. He added that Lockheed does not yet have a group of prospective buyers and declined to give any details on possible valuations of the two units. Military contracting legislation passed last year includes a provision meant to reduce conflicts of interest for contractors, many of them deeply involved in a broad range of government operation. Lawmakers were concerned that such companies might have access to nonpublic information that could help them win additional contracts. Mr. Stevens said Lockheed concluded the enterprise integration unit could pose conflicts of interest. Lockheed paid an undisclosed sum for Pacific Architects and Engineers in 2006. The company provides services like disaster relief and support of peacekeeping missions for governments. Mr. Stevens said its customers wanted more services, like construction or maintenance, that do not fit in with Lockheed’s plans for the company. Lockheed also said it would combine its readiness and stability operations and Savi Technology units with its simulation, training and support business, and rename them Global Training and Logistics. Shares of Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., rose 63 cents to $79.80.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/energy-environment/22CAULK.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Stimulus Is Slow to Aid Energy-Efficiency Sector<date>Published: April 22, 2010</date><text>FOR companies that specialize in the business of saving energy, these ought to be flush times. Last year’s stimulus package devoted at least $20 billion to efficiency measures, more than any other single law. President Obama regularly preaches the virtues of better insulation and weatherizing homes.Yet the efficiency business has not reaped the benefit that it had hoped to receive. The stimulus dollars — enough to increase the amount of federal money some state energy offices receive by a factor of 100 — are still being distributed. Money being doled out by different government agencies has been delayed by problems like insufficient staff in the Energy Department and pay requirements for contractors in the stimulus law. “It’s happening slower than we would like,” said Jim Davis, the president of Chevron Energy Solutions, a 10-year-old branch of the oil company that is devoted to energy efficiency and renewable power. Assuming the money is eventually disbursed and the push to save energy continues, a handful of big efficiency-oriented companies, including Chevron Energy Solutions, Johnson Controls, Honeywell Building Solutions and Lockheed Martin, could gain substantially. Smaller, more local businesses that perform energy audits and retrofits for individual homes could also benefit. “Energy efficiency” refers, largely, to measures that help buildings save energy. They are numerous and include insulating walls and attics, changing light bulbs, replacing appliances, sealing leaky building ducts and improving the performance of heating and cooling systems. All such measures can be costly initially but should save money long term. A report last year from the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company found that the United States as a whole could save $1.2 trillion through 2020 by investing $520 billion in efficiency. California, where per-capita electricity use has remained essentially stable for three decades, is the nation’s longtime leader in efficiency. Chevron Energy Solutions says the state accounts for about 50 percent of its business. But, even in California, “we believe we’ve only just scratched the surface” of the business possibilities, Mr. Davis said. Another enormous opportunity lies with the federal government, the country’s largest consumer of energy, with its vast, aging web of structures like military bases, postal centers and courthouses. “The seriousness of the feds in attacking this problem is still a relatively new development,” said Thomas P. Grumbly, a vice president of Lockheed Martin, which has a four-year-old efficiency business. Lockheed representatives recently attended a conference in Europe on how to make United States embassies green, he said. Almost any building in the United States is a candidate for energy-efficiency work, if upfront money is available. Such buildings include state and local government structures, like schools and city halls, as well as offices and industrial plants. A $20 million retrofit project at the Empire State Building that Johnson Controls is overseeing is projected to reap 38 percent efficiency savings annually by 2013, at an annual savings of $4.4 million. Stimulus dollars have reached a few projects. In the Santa Ana school district in Southern California, Chevron Energy Solutions is improving the energy efficiency of roofing, heating and ventilation systems. Under the Great Appliance Swap Out, conducted by Lockheed this spring, New Yorkers got rebates — as much as $100 for clothes washers, for example — to trade old appliances for new, energy-efficient models. But in many cases, efficiency companies say, the stimulus money is still awaiting distribution. One exception is a weatherization program for homes, where the dollars have been moving, Mr. Grumbly of Lockheed said. Last year, more than 30,000 homes were weatherized with stimulus funds, and the number is increasing. Seth Kaplan, the clean energy and climate change program director at the Conservation Law Foundation, says that one of several reasons disbursement has been slow is that many localities are not accustomed to a flood of money coming in and do not have the infrastructure to use it. Another challenge, he says, is a shortage of labor in the efficiency business — especially for specialized roles like air sealers. “Finding somebody who needs a job and who is trained and qualified to be an air sealer and who you trust and who is available — that’s the hard part,” Mr. Kaplan said. Credit markets that remain tight continue to be an issue, Mr. Davis at Chevron Energy Solutions said, noting that businesses needed private money to supplement stimulus dollars. But energy prices are creeping up again as the economy bounces back from recession — meaning that the incentive to pay for efficiency work is increasing. Looking ahead, business leaders and entrepreneurs in the efficiency sector are optimistic. On the federal level, President Obama signed an executive order in October requiring increased energy and water efficiency in federal buildings. Some of the stimulus dollars for federal building efficiency are still being awarded by the General Services Administration. “The pipeline is still releasing, so to speak,” and federal agencies are also finding other ways to finance projects, sometimes through contracts where the energy-services company pays the upfront costs and gets paid back gradually, Mr. Grumbly said. For homeowners, innovative methods of financing efficiency improvements have cropped up. One of the most talked-about models is Property-Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE, a state and local program that allows municipalities to pay the upfront costs of retrofitting homes and to be repaid through higher property taxes. The program, which is operating in some California cities, is still in its infancy, but in theory it will let homeowners improve efficiency without paying upfront costs, and allow the payments to be transferred to the next owner if the property is sold. Congress is considering establishing a rebate program, called Home Star or, informally, cash for caulkers, to encourage investment in insulation, efficient appliances and revamped heating and cooling systems. For the efficiency business as a whole, another benefit could come from a federal efficiency standard, a requirement that utilities offset a certain proportion of their growth in demand with energy-saving measures. Some states already have such a requirement, and Congress could wrap it into forthcoming energy legislation. With the prospect of a big effort ahead, the industry says it is determined to make sure quality standards are maintained. Recent concerns over some Chinese drywall in American homes serve to underscore that the building business is not immune from such problems. Matt Golden, the chairman of Efficiency First, an advocacy organization whose members include hundreds of efficiency-oriented businesses, said that quality was something that the Home Star rebate program, which the group supports, would address “pretty aggressively,” adding, “We’re going to set up a national quality insurance infrastructure and start holding contractors accountable,” Mr. Golden said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/22arms.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">3 Manufacturers Post Better-Than-Expected Results<date>Published: April 21, 2010</date><text>Three American manufacturers — Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies — all reported profits on Wednesday that topped expectations. Two, Boeing and Lockheed, reduced their outlooks for the year because of the effect of recently pass health care legislation.The Boeing Company, the military contractor and plane maker, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, but cut its 2010 earnings forecast because of health care legislation. “I’m going to be looking for evidence of the trajectory of the recovery,” said Alex Hamilton, senior managing director at C.K. Cooper &amp; Company. The “sweet spot” of the recovery will come when Boeing starts showing a sustained flow of domestic orders, he said. “We’re not going to see that for a while,” Mr. Hamilton said. “But domestic U.S. airlines have been doing much better.” Boeing and its top rival, Airbus, were dogged in 2009 by fewer orders for airplanes as carriers around the world grappled with falling travel demand in the sagging economy. Boeing said first-quarter net profit fell to $519 million, or 70 cents a share, from $610 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. The results, which include a 20-cent-a-share charge on new health reform law’s elimination of tax deductions that have been available to companies for retiree prescription drug expenses, beat Wall Street’s average estimate of 64 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 7.8 percent to $15.2 billion. The company reported an order backlog amounting to $315 billion. The second military contractor, the Lockheed Martin Corporation, said net earnings fell to $547 million, or $1.45 a share, from $666 million, or $1.68 a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.34 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The results included a charge of about 25 cents a share resulting from the health reform law. Revenue rose about 3 percent to $10.64 billion, compared with $10.62 billion expected by analysts. Shares of military contractors were hurt in 2009 by program cuts and concern that spending growth would slow under the Obama administration. President Obama’s fiscal 2011 military budget calls for a 3.4 percent rise in base spending. While billions are set aside for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon docked Lockheed $614 million in performance fees because performance had not met expectations in recent years. The third manufacturer, United Technologies, reported that its quarterly profit was helped by lower reorganization costs. The company’s revenue missed analysts’ forecasts. The company, which makes elevators, air-conditioners and aircraft engines, recorded a 20 percent rise in earnings, ending four quarters of declines, as heavy cost-cutting that included some 15,000 job cuts last year paid off. Sales were weaker than expected at the company’s Sikorsky helicopter and fire and security equipment businesses, and United Tech’s shares were down slightly in light premarket trading. First-quarter profit attributable to common shareholders came to $866 million, or 93 cents a diluted share, topping the 90 cents a share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters. A year earlier the company earned $722 million, or 78 cents a share. The 2010 result included 5 cents a share of reorganization costs, less than the 9 cents a share recorded a year ago. A Deutsche Bank analyst, Nigel Coe, said that the slide in earnings “was driven entirely” by one-time items. “Revenue performance was soft,” Mr. Coe added. Revenue fell 1.3 percent to $12.09 billion, below the $12.26 billion analysts had expected. United Tech, which also makes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines, bolstered the low end of its 2010 profit forecast, predicting a range of $4.50 to $4.65 a share, up from $4.40 to $4.65.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/science/space/12rocket.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Aerospace Business Has Its Doubts About Plans to Revamp NASA<date>Published: April 11, 2010</date><text>Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giants with decades of experience working on America’s space program, will happily sell rockets to carry astronauts into space, but the companies are leery about taking a leading role in President Obama’s vision for a revamped National Aeronautics and Space Administration.The prospect of NASA relying on smaller companies — unproven upstarts in the view of critics — could create yet another hurdle in convincing an already skeptical Congress of the idea of relying on commercial companies to provide taxi transportation to the International Space Station. “I don’t think there is a business case for us,” John Karas, vice president and general manager of human spaceflight at Lockheed Martin, said about space taxis. Publicly, Boeing has been enthusiastic. “We have a vested interest in the International Space Station,” Brewster H. Shaw, vice president and general manager of Boeing’s NASA Systems business unit, said in February after NASA awarded the company $18 million to draw up a preliminary design of a capsule that could serve as the basis of a commercial crew system. “We want to see I.S.S. live up to its potential by having a robust logistics for the delivery of cargo and crew.” But Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a policy group financed by military contractors, said Boeing is more skeptical in private. In 1995, Boeing began pursuing the commercial space business through an international partnership called Sea Launch; it also developed the Delta IV rocket to launch both military and commercial satellites. The company lost money in both efforts, with Sea Launch filing for bankruptcy in 2009. To stem the Delta IV losses, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which was also losing money with its Atlas V rocket, set up a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance in 2006. “Senior Boeing executives have told me that they are skeptical about new launch opportunities, given the losses they incurred on previous initiatives such as Sea Launch and the Pentagon’s expendable launcher program,” Dr. Thompson said. “They are unlikely to invest large amounts of money on the new NASA vision.” Mr. Obama has called for the cancellation of NASA’s current Constellation program to send astronauts back to the Moon. In its place, the administration would like to spend $6 billion over five years to finance the development of rockets and crew capsules by commercial companies. NASA officials have said the program would be set up to attract new and established companies. The money would most likely be split between two or more companies. In pitching the idea, administration officials have said that commercial companies have always built the rockets and spacecraft that carried American astronauts and that it would not be a radical shift to turn to aerospace companies with decades of experience. They also contend that competition would spur innovation and drive down the launching costs, which, in turn, would open vibrant new markets. NASA has not described details of the planned competition, and the companies said they would take a look at what the agency proposes. “Assuming the business case is right, we’re all in,” said Keith Reiley, program manager for Boeing’s capsule development. The business case depends on how much money NASA will be asking the companies to invest. In traditional “cost plus” development, NASA pays for everything. In that case, Mr. Reilly said, “of course, we’d be happy to do that.” If NASA were to ask the companies to shoulder all of the financial risk, however, Boeing would certainly not participate. The key would be how the $6 billion would be divided. “Hopefully,” Mr. Reilly said, “those issues will get resolved.” Both Boeing and Lockheed were stung during the last burst of optimism for the commercial space business about a decade ago. They invested several billion dollars — Lockheed to develop its Atlas V, Boeing for the Delta IV — in the hopes that the huge market for commercial satellites would supplement their traditional business of launching American military spy satellites. The market did not materialize, and what business there was went to European and Russian rockets that were cheaper. With the United Launch Alliance, Boeing and Lockheed Martin share costs and profits equally. The joint venture now operates in the black, but the companies did not recoup their original investments, and much of the infrastructure they built remains underused. “I think people who have been in the launcher business for many years find it hard to take the president’s plan seriously,” Dr. Thompson said. “They think it sounds like an elaborate wake for the human spaceflight program more than a plan for moving forward.” The hoped-for commercial market for space taxis hinges on one small company, Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas, which is teaming up with Boeing on its capsule design.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/opinion/24wed3.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Fixing Missile Defense<date>Published: March 23, 2010</date><text>It is always encouraging to see a commitment to the Sisyphean task of getting the most out of America’s gargantuan defense budget and reining in costs on expensive, badly managed or poorly performing programs.

Faces New Setback in Computer Overhaul<date>Published: March 18, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation has suspended work on parts of its huge computer overhaul, dealing the agency the latest costly setback in a decade-long effort to develop a modernized information system to combat crime and terrorism. The overhaul was supposed to be completed this fall, but now will not be done until next year at the earliest. The delay could mean at least $30 million in cost overruns on a project considered vital to national security, Congressional officials said. F.B.I. officials said that design changes and “minor” technical problems prompted the suspension of parts of the third and fourth phases of the work, which is intended to allow agents to better navigate investigative files, search databases and communicate with one another. The decision to suspend work on the $305 million program is particularly striking because the current contractor, Lockheed Martin, was announced to great fanfare in 2006 after the collapse of an earlier incarnation of the project with the Science Applications International Corporation. “This is terribly frustrating,” Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who has been a frequent critic of the F.B.I.’s computer systems, said in an interview Thursday. “We’ve been through this song and dance before. Wouldn’t you think after hundreds of millions of dollars being wasted that they’d finally get it right?” Beyond the financial costs are concerns about the F.B.I.’s ability to handle its law enforcement and national security responsibilities with an information system still regarded as sub-par in some crucial areas. In a paper-driven culture, the agency’s computers were so inadequate that many agents until several years ago could not send or receive e-mail messages, and had difficulty getting case histories and linking to other databases. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, agents in Florida had to send photographs of the hijackers by overnight mail to Washington because they could not send e-mail attachments. The current project, known as Sentinel, has fixed some longstanding problems, including difficulties with e-mail and database searching, auditors have found. But in examining recent work, officials realized that mundane problems — like slow response times, awkward display pages and screen print that was too small — were cropping up. Posing added complications were guidelines on F.B.I. operations put in place in 2008 that gave agents more latitude to look at factors like ethnicity and religion in terrorism investigations. That type of data was not typically used by the F.B.I. when the project began, and officials said they were trying to find ways to incorporate the expanded criteria into their investigative files and computer reports. F.B.I. officials said they viewed the issues more as minor kinks than serious problems. They said the problems had not compromised agents’ ability to respond to threats. The officials said the decision to suspend work on other parts of the program reflected the lessons learned from previous setbacks. When Lockheed Martin won the contract, the F.B.I. ended the previous computer overhaul and started over because the problems had grown too big to fix. Robert S. Mueller III, director of the F.B.I., acknowledged problems in the project when he was asked about it at a House appropriations hearing on Wednesday. Mr. Mueller said the F.B.I. wanted to make the needed adjustment in the system now “so that when we roll it out, it would be successful.” He added: “I’m the one who made the decision to delay until we got these issues addressed, and I am comfortable and confident that the system is working. It is a good system and will be beneficial when we are through.” Kimberly Jaindl, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin, said that the company was “committed to our customer’s mission of delivering a flexible and affordable information management system,” adding, “We will continue working diligently toward that goal.” While the F.B.I. described the problems as a minor setback, Congressional officials said they were alarmed. Mr. Grassley and Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, told Mr. Mueller in a letter this week that they viewed the problems as a “serious development” that threatened the entire project. They sought answers about the source of the problems and Lockheed Martin’s work. “This is a red flag,” said a Congressional official briefed by the F.B.I. on the problems this month, “because they’ve failed so many times before.” The work suspension comes at an awkward time, as Congressional committees begin reviewing F.B.I. requests for about a 4 percent budget increase, or an additional $317 million. Mr. Grassley said he wanted a better understanding of what was causing the computer problems before agreeing to budget increases. “It’s just a simple waste of taxpayer money,” he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/business/12plane.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Cost of F-35 Has Risen 60% to 90%, Military Says<date>Published: March 11, 2010</date><text>The projected cost of Lockheed Martin’s new Joint Strike Fighter has increased 60 to 90 percent in real terms since 2001, blowing well past a level requiring the program to be revamped, Pentagon officials said Thursday.And even though the military is trying to deal with the problems, Congressional auditors said the program — the Pentagon’s largest — was likely to continue to increase in cost and suffer more delays. The assessments, released at a Senate hearing in Washington, provided a reminder of the extent of the cost overruns in major weapons programs and showed how hard they can be to resolve. The latest estimates were embarrassing to Lockheed Martin, the largest military contractor, and to the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates. Last summer, Mr. Gates promoted the new jet, called the F-35, when he urged Congress to halt production of the F-22 fighter plane. Some senators now say they might not have made that decision if they had known about the problems with the F-35. Christine H. Fox, the Pentagon’s top cost evaluator, said at Thursday’s hearing that the estimated price of each F-35 had jumped to $80 million to $95 million, as measured in 2002 dollars, from $50 million when Lockheed Martin was awarded the contract in 2001. She said her office was still refining the cost estimate, which equals $95 million to $113 million for each plane in current dollars. Under a 15-year-old law, the Pentagon has to notify Congress when the cost of military equipment exceeds the original projection by more than 25 percent. Ms. Fox’s office warned top Pentagon officials about the problems last fall. Mr. Gates recently fired the general in charge of the program and announced other plans to get it back on track. He added more planes to speed the flight testing and extended the development phase by 13 months. He also pushed back the purchases of 122 planes to help cover the extra $2.8 billion needed for the development work. Ashton B. Carter, the Pentagon’s top acquisition official, said at the hearing that the problems had been building for several years. He said the Pentagon was “beginning a process of aggressive management” to try to head off some of the worst problems. The F-35, a single-engine stealth fighter designed primarily to attack ground targets, is supposed to become a mainstay of American and allied militaries over the next several decades. The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines plan to buy 2,443 of the planes. Eight allied nations have also invested in the program and could buy hundreds of additional planes. Mr. Carter said a substantial part of the cost increases occurred several years ago, when the version for the Marines, which will be able to take off vertically, came in substantially overweight. Lockheed Martin had to make changes to reduce the weight. The company has said that these and other changes caused problems for its suppliers, slowed the construction of the first planes and delayed the flight testing program. Company officials have said that they have been building planes more quickly and cheaply in recent months, and that they believe they can recover some of the lost time over the next year or so. The Obama administration has pledged to improve the Pentagon’s contracting record, and Congress passed a law last year tightening acquisition procedures. But most of those changes focus on how new programs are begun. Mr. Carter said the F-35 was also an example of how the military tended to start building new systems before all the problems were worked out. He said the Marines still expected to begin using the planes in 2012. But the Air Force and Navy versions will probably not be ready for combat until 2016. Michael Sullivan, an analyst at the Government Accountability Office, said the program could eventually cost $323 billion. And while the recent changes could help ease the problems, “further cost growth and schedule extensions are likely,” he said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/opinion/16tue1.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">A Timely Jolt for the F-35<date>Published: February 15, 2010</date><text>Fixing the Pentagon’s dysfunctional procurement system takes more than just killing off anachronistic projects like the now-terminated F-22 jet fighter.

A cost-effective F-35 is critical to the future combat needs of the Air Force, Navy and Marines. The project already is years behind schedule and nearly 50 percent above its originally estimated cost. That is clearly too much, especially with the Pentagon planning to buy almost 2,500 of the planes over the next 25 years. That comes to a total cost of $300 billion  provided nothing else goes wrong. Mr. Gates means to see that it does not. This month, he removed the Marine in charge of the program, Maj. Gen. David Heinz, and said his replacement would be a higher-ranking officer with more authority to keep a tighter rein on private contractors’ performance. Reinforcing that message, Mr. Gates also announced that he would withhold, at least for now, $614 million in progress payments from the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin. The money should not be released until Lockheed has significantly improved its performance. This insistence on accountability would be considered normal in most private businesses. But it is virtually unheard of in the cozy world of military procurement. Mr. Gates clearly wants to get the attention of other Pentagon managers and contractors. We hope he has. The F-35 program was supposed to be the prototype for more effective defense procurement.

But it also is built to support ground combat units in today’s wars, like the Air Force F-16 and A-10 and the Navy F-18 it is intended to replace. And because one basic design underlies the Air Force, Navy and Marine versions, it can be produced far more cheaply. That lower price tag will let the services buy more new planes each year, a military gain as well as a budgetary one. Besides removing General Heinz and penalizing Lockheed, Mr. Gates has wisely added a year to the development phase of the F-35 contract, giving Lockheed time to straighten out as many problems as possible. But as he correctly recognizes, some production  next year’s budget calls for 42 of the planes, 10 less than planned  must go ahead now so the services can begin incorporating F-35s into their fleets. The Air Force, in particular, will need F-35s to replace the canceled F-22. Mr. Gates will have to keep monitoring the performance of Lockheed Martin and General Heinz’s successor and personally intervene again if needed.

Yuri Gripas/Reuters; Maj. Gen. David R. Heinz of the Marine Corps was removed on Monday as head of the Joint Strike Fighter program. But rather than being the Chevrolet of the skies, as it was once billed, the fighter plane, also called the F-35, has turned into the Pentagon’s biggest budget-buster. And with worries growing that the rise in costs could overwhelm other programs, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates fired the general in charge this week and said he would withhold $614 million in fees from the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin. The decision was an embarrassment for Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, which could eventually draw at least a quarter of its sales from the F-35. But Pentagon officials said they wanted to make sure they avoided the kind of death spiral that had caused so many other weapons programs to collapse. The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines are planning to buy more than 2,400 of the planes. But any delays could force them to spend billions of dollars on less advanced fighters to avoid a shortfall. That, in turn, would reduce their orders for the F-35, driving up the price for each plane and forcing them to cut orders further. The main problem, some analysts say, is that even with recent improvements in acquisition practices, the military persists in buying new weapons systems before all the kinks are worked out. At the Pentagon’s behest, Lockheed Martin has already started building production models of the F-35, even though only 2 percent of the flight test program has been completed. “Unless they convert the program to a fly-before-you-buy approach, they will continue to have pain,” said Winslow T. Wheeler, an analyst for the Center for Defense Information in Washington. But Pentagon officials said that given the rapid changes in technology, they could not afford to take such a gradual approach without systems becoming outdated before they rolled off the line. Lockheed Martin executives said that they had gotten the message about picking up the pace, and that they believed they would be able to start delivering the planes faster than the government now projects. “They have been very clear that they intend to hold us to more aggressive standards, and we intend to perform to those,” Daniel J. Crowley, one of Lockheed Martin’s project managers, told reporters on Tuesday. Mr. Crowley acknowledged that the program, which has been adjusted several times, was running six months behind the latest schedule. But he said that after building the first few planes, the company had been able to sharply reduce how much time and money each one required. And that has given it more confidence that it can get back on track. Mr. Gates also said on Monday that he knew of “no insurmountable problems, technological or otherwise, with the F-35.” But he added a year to the development phase of the program, and slowed plans to increase production, to give the company a chance to catch up. Still, that solution is basically a gamble that the company will do better. The program, which is by far the Pentagon’s largest, is expected to cost nearly $300 billion if all of the 2,456 planes are purchased in the next 25 years. Eight allied nations have also invested in the program and could buy hundreds of additional planes. Some senators sounded skeptical in questioning Mr. Gates at a hearing on Tuesday. “I’m still concerned about whether the services will get the J.S.F. when they need them,” said Senator John McCain, Republican from Arizona, referring to the plane. Other senators criticized Mr. Gates, who promoted the coming of the F-35 as a reason to kill the more costly F-22 fighter program last summer, for not having a handle on the problems sooner. Many of the concerns were outlined in a report by a special Pentagon assessment team in late 2008. Mr. Gates said at the hearing on Tuesday that he did not recall that report. He said he had intervened now to try to head off the dire projections in a similar assessment completed in the fall. That study found that the development of the plane could be delayed by two and a half years and cost an extra $16.6 billion if no changes were made. Mr. Gates has also said that he replaced the head of the program, Maj. Gen. David R. Heinz of the Marine Corps, to show that officials would be held accountable “when things go wrong.” When the Pentagon began thinking about the F-35 in the mid-1990s, the Pentagon was building the F-22, the world’s stealthiest fighter, for aerial dogfights, and it expected to buy 650 to 750 of them. The F-35, which also has stealth features to avoid radar, was meant to focus more on attacking ground targets. Creating three versions with a similar core  one each for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines  was supposed to make it more affordable. But while delays and overruns pushed the cost of the F-22 so high that only 187 are being built, the projected costs of the F-35 program have also risen to $298.8 billion from an early estimate of about $200 billion. Counting all the development costs, each F-35 is now projected to cost about $122 million compared with about $350 million for each F-22. Another concern is that additional problems often appear in flight testing. And a recent Navy study concluded that the F-35 could be significantly more expensive to operate than older fighters. But Mr. Crowley, one of Lockheed Martin’s top managers on the project, said the company had greatly reduced the parts shortages that delayed the first planes. He said the company was talking to the Pentagon about adding another plane to the flight test program, and it was much closer to finishing sensitive systems, like the software that operates the plane and its sensors, than it was at a similar stage on the F-22. He added that it was “our intent to outperform” projections for the program, enabling the government to buy more planes than it expected to over the next few years. Other industry officials said they had heard that Mr. Gates was likely to name Vice Adm. David J.

Yuri Gripas/Reuters; Maj. Gen. David R. Heinz of the Marine Corps was removed on Monday as head of the Joint Strike Fighter program. But rather than being the Chevrolet of the skies, as it was once billed, the fighter plane, also called the F-35, has turned into the Pentagon’s biggest budget-buster. And with worries growing that the rise in costs could overwhelm other programs, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates fired the general in charge this week and said he would withhold $614 million in fees from the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin. The decision was an embarrassment for Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, which could eventually draw at least a quarter of its sales from the F-35. But Pentagon officials said they wanted to make sure they avoided the kind of death spiral that had caused so many other weapons programs to collapse. The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines are planning to buy more than 2,400 of the planes. But any delays could force them to spend billions of dollars on less advanced fighters to avoid a shortfall. That, in turn, would reduce their orders for the F-35, driving up the price for each plane and forcing them to cut orders further. The main problem, some analysts say, is that even with recent improvements in acquisition practices, the military persists in buying new weapons systems before all the kinks are worked out. At the Pentagon’s behest, Lockheed Martin has already started building production models of the F-35, even though only 2 percent of the flight test program has been completed. “Unless they convert the program to a fly-before-you-buy approach, they will continue to have pain,” said Winslow T. Wheeler, an analyst for the Center for Defense Information in Washington. But Pentagon officials said that given the rapid changes in technology, they could not afford to take such a gradual approach without systems becoming outdated before they rolled off the line. Lockheed Martin executives said that they had gotten the message about picking up the pace, and that they believed they would be able to start delivering the planes faster than the government now projects. “They have been very clear that they intend to hold us to more aggressive standards, and we intend to perform to those,” Daniel J. Crowley, one of Lockheed Martin’s project managers, told reporters on Tuesday. Mr. Crowley acknowledged that the program, which has been adjusted several times, was running six months behind the latest schedule. But he said that after building the first few planes, the company had been able to sharply reduce how much time and money each one required. And that has given it more confidence that it can get back on track. Mr. Gates also said on Monday that he knew of “no insurmountable problems, technological or otherwise, with the F-35.” But he added a year to the development phase of the program, and slowed plans to increase production, to give the company a chance to catch up. Still, that solution is basically a gamble that the company will do better. The program, which is by far the Pentagon’s largest, is expected to cost nearly $300 billion if all of the 2,456 planes are purchased in the next 25 years. Eight allied nations have also invested in the program and could buy hundreds of additional planes. Some senators sounded skeptical in questioning Mr. Gates at a hearing on Tuesday. “I’m still concerned about whether the services will get the J.S.F. when they need them,” said Senator John McCain, Republican from Arizona, referring to the plane. Other senators criticized Mr. Gates, who promoted the coming of the F-35 as a reason to kill the more costly F-22 fighter program last summer, for not having a handle on the problems sooner. Many of the concerns were outlined in a report by a special Pentagon assessment team in late 2008. Mr. Gates said at the hearing on Tuesday that he did not recall that report. He said he had intervened now to try to head off the dire projections in a similar assessment completed in the fall. That study found that the development of the plane could be delayed by two and a half years and cost an extra $16.6 billion if no changes were made. Mr. Gates has also said that he replaced the head of the program, Maj. Gen. David R. Heinz of the Marine Corps, to show that officials would be held accountable “when things go wrong.” When the Pentagon began thinking about the F-35 in the mid-1990s, the Pentagon was building the F-22, the world’s stealthiest fighter, for aerial dogfights, and it expected to buy 650 to 750 of them. The F-35, which also has stealth features to avoid radar, was meant to focus more on attacking ground targets. Creating three versions with a similar core  one each for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines  was supposed to make it more affordable. But while delays and overruns pushed the cost of the F-22 so high that only 187 are being built, the projected costs of the F-35 program have also risen to $298.8 billion from an early estimate of about $200 billion. Counting all the development costs, each F-35 is now projected to cost about $122 million compared with about $350 million for each F-22. Another concern is that additional problems often appear in flight testing. And a recent Navy study concluded that the F-35 could be significantly more expensive to operate than older fighters. But Mr. Crowley, one of Lockheed Martin’s top managers on the project, said the company had greatly reduced the parts shortages that delayed the first planes. He said the company was talking to the Pentagon about adding another plane to the flight test program, and it was much closer to finishing sensitive systems, like the software that operates the plane and its sensors, than it was at a similar stage on the F-22. He added that it was “our intent to outperform” projections for the program, enabling the government to buy more planes than it expected to over the next few years. Other industry officials said they had heard that Mr. Gates was likely to name Vice Adm. David J. Venlet, commander of the Naval Air Systems Command, to succeed General Heinz in overseeing the program. And given that Mr. Gates has had to backtrack from his praise for the program, he now has even more on the line in holding it together.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/us/politics/02pentagon.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Gates Shakes Up Leadership for F-35<date>Published: February 1, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Monday that he was replacing the general in charge of the Pentagon’s largest weapons program — the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter — and withholding $614 million in award fees from the contractor, Lockheed Martin.The surprise announcement came from a Pentagon chief who has sought to impose accountability across the department’s senior leadership and who himself had promoted plans for the new plane last year in persuading Congress to kill the more expensive F-22 fighter jet. But a special Pentagon review team has since warned of possibly billions of dollars in cost overruns on the plane, and Mr. Gates announced that he was restructuring the program and requiring the company to cover some of the extra costs. Mr. Gates disclosed the reshuffling on the F-35 program as he released the Pentagon’s proposed $708.3 billion spending package for the fiscal year 2011. After a dramatic first year in which the Obama administration killed the F-22 and other expensive weapons programs, the Pentagon presented a new budget that includes a $14.8 billion increase over the current spending totals. Perhaps more important in the long term, the proposed spending plan represents a consolidation of Mr. Gates’s desire to add money to try to win today’s wars rather than spending as much on future weaponry. The proposed increases reflect the rising cost of the war in Afghanistan and a push by military leaders to keep their basic budget growing faster than inflation. Some of the extra money is intended to pay for helicopters needed to transport troops in rugged environments, for unmanned planes to provide surveillance on enemy movements and for more Special Operations forces needed in Afghanistan and a mix of other possible wars. Those spending priorities are explained in a new war-fighting strategy review that the Pentagon also released on Monday. But the increases come at a time when President Obama has frozen spending on many domestic programs, and many Democrats in Congress could find them hard to take politically. And while Mr. Gates said Lockheed Martin had agreed to absorb part of the cost overruns on the Joint Strike Fighter, industry consultants said other military companies were delighted that, once again, a long-expected turndown in military spending had not hit. “The defense industry is pleased but bemused,” said Loren Thompson, the chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, a policy group financed partly by military contractors. “It’s been telling itself for years that when the Democrats got control it would be bad news for weapons programs. But the spending keeps going on.” All told, the administration said Monday that it wanted to increase the Pentagon’s regular spending by 3.4 percent, to $548.9 billion in the 2011 fiscal year from $530.8 billion this year. It also asked Congress to approve $159.3 billion for next year to cover the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The White House said it was also seeking an additional $33 billion now to pay for the 30,000 extra troops being sent to Afghanistan. That would bring the total war spending for this year to $162.6 billion. Mr. Gates said the program manager on the F-35, Maj. Gen. David Heinz of the Marine Corps, would be replaced by a higher-ranking general whose name would be announced soon. “A number of key goals and benchmarks were not met,” he said, adding that “the taxpayer should not have to bear the entire burden of getting the J.S.F. program back on track.” In a statement issued late Monday, Lockheed Martin said it had been working with military officials “on a plan to get the program back on track” and was “committed to stabilizing F-35 cost, affordability and to fielding the aircraft on time.” Mr. Gates said he planned to extend the development phase by a year. Pentagon officials said they would delay the purchase of 122 planes and expand the flight testing to try to avoid much of the $16 billion in cost overruns that the review team had projected. The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines plan to buy 2,400 of the planes over the next 25 years, and eight allied nations have also invested in the project. Mr. Gates also said he would try again to kill two programs — the C-17 cargo plane and an alternate engine for the F-35 — that Congress saved last year. The new Defense Department spending proposal and the strategy reviews, Mr. Gates said, “are shaped by a bracing dose of realism — realism with regard to risk, realism with regard to resources.” “We have, in a sober and clear-eyed way, assessed risk, set priorities, made tradeoffs and identified requirements based on plausible, real-world threats, scenarios and potential adversaries,” he said. To calm critics who might argue that his emphasis on winning today’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan put future American security at risk, Mr. Gates noted that his budget had shifted only 7 percent to 10 percent of spending to today’s missions and needs, and that 40 percent would pay for weapons that can fight all types of wars. That leaves half the budget still devoted to traditional threats. Every four years, Congress requires the Pentagon to produce its Quadrennial Defense Review, an assessment of long-range strategy and the budgets to pay for them. In unveiling the review Monday, Michèle A. Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy, said the strategy document for the first time jettisoned a historic planning requirement that the American military prepare to fight two major conventional wars at the same time. Instead, the Pentagon’s new strategy calls on the military to prepare for a much broader — and more complicated — set of national security requirements, that may include traditional combat against a state adversary, operations against foreign terrorists, counter-insurgency efforts, missions to mitigate natural or terrorist disasters at home and operations in cyberspace. With a record number of veterans projected to use its health care system, the Department of Veterans Affairs has requested a $125 billion budget for 2011, a 10 percent increase. The department proposed creating more than 4,000 new permanent positions to help process a backlog of disability claims. That backlog is expected to increase with new claims not only from Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, but also from Vietnam-era veterans with diseases related to exposure to Agent Orange, the chemical defoliant. The department is also requesting $13.7 billion in one-time spending for the current year to pay retroactive claims for three diseases it now presumes to be caused by Agent Orange: Parkinson’s disease, ischemic heart disease and hairy-cell leukemia.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/business/24plane.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">U.S. Says Lockheed Must Pay Part of F-35 Cost Overruns<date>Published: November 23, 2009</date><text>WASHINGTON  The Pentagon’s top acquisition official said on Monday that Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the new F-35 fighter jet, would have to cover part of the increased costs of the huge program.

The man, Darrol Olsen, a stealth engineer who was fired by Lockheed in 1999, says the company “falsely certified” the coatings from September 1995 to June 1999, saying they had passed stealth tests and concealing results that showed otherwise. Mr. Olsen said in the lawsuit that he was told to “stay out of it” when he complained to his superiors. The whistle-blower suit was originally filed in October 2007 in California and was unsealed this year. It was transferred to federal court last week in Atlanta, near where the jets are assembled at Lockheed’s facility in Marietta. The case comes a month after President Obama signed a measure ending production of the $140 million superfighter, which critics maintain is poorly suited for anti-insurgent battles in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force would not immediately comment on the complaint. Lockheed said in a statement that it “does not believe there is any merit to the allegations and will vigorously defend this matter in court.” Mr. Olsen contends that Lockheed applied more than 600 pounds of extra layers of coatings so the jet could pass the stealth tests required by the Air Force. The layers were needed because the coating rubbed off when exposed to jet oil, fuel and water, the complaint said. It left the supersonic fighters with “extremely thick coatings” that “have proved brittle,” and the coatings designed to be paper-thin have now compromised the superfighter’s velocity and maneuverability, the lawsuit said. It said the process has essentially painted a “bull’s-eye target” on aircraft designed to avoid radar detection. In the lawsuit, Mr. Olsen is asking the judge to order Lockheed to pay the federal government $50 million for each of the 183 F-22’s built or under construction as part of the contract. He is also asking the judge to order Lockheed to pay his legal fees. Mr. Olsen could not be reached for comment and his lawyer did not immediately return calls seeking comment.

Gates’s decision this year to cap production of the F-22, said Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer. Each F-22, a cold-war fighter jet, costs $140 million, and the decision to limit production to 187 jets is part of the Pentagon’s plan to shift military spending to programs more suitable to modern warfare. The Pentagon this year has also terminated Lockheed’s contract to build new helicopters to carry the president, as well as a contract to build a communications satellite. Lockheed said earnings rose nearly 8 percent from the previous quarter, to $797 million, or $2.07 a share, for the period ending Sept. 27. That compares with $782 million, or $1.92 a share, last year. Revenue grew nearly 5 percent to $11.06 billion. Stock in Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., fell $5, or 6.5 percent, to $71.99 a share. The United Technologies Corporation continued to be squeezed by the downturn in aerospace and real estate markets as nearly all its businesses posted declines in the third quarter. The company, which owns Pratt &amp; Whitney, Otis elevator, Sikorsky Aircraft and other businesses, said it earned $1.06 billion, or $1.14 a share, down 17 percent from $1.27 billion, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 11 percent, to $13.38 billion, from $15.09 billion a year ago. The chief financial officer, Greg Hayes, told investors and analysts in a conference call that the company was confident earnings would rise in 2010. The president and chief executive, Louis R. Chênevert, said a strong military backlog and significant repair and servicing businesses were setting up the company for earnings growth in 2010. In addition, he said United Technologies had begun to see improvement in some Asian economies, notably China’s. With the exception of Sikorsky Aircraft, which has benefited from increased military sales for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, operating profit fell at each of United Technologies’ businesses. Sikorsky’s operating profit rose 18 percent from a year ago. Stock in United Technologies, which is based in Hartford, Conn., fell 4 cents, to $65.40 a share.

Each F-22, a cold-war fighter jet, costs $140 million, and the decision to limit production to 187 jets is part of the Pentagon’s plan to shift military spending to programs more suitable to modern warfare. The Pentagon this year has also terminated Lockheed’s contract to build new helicopters to carry the president, as well as a contract to build a communications satellite. Lockheed said earnings rose nearly 8 percent from the previous quarter, to $797 million, or $2.07 a share, for the period ending Sept. 27. That compares with $782 million, or $1.92 a share, last year. Revenue grew nearly 5 percent to $11.06 billion. Stock in Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., fell $5, or 6.5 percent, to $71.99 a share. The United Technologies Corporation continued to be squeezed by the downturn in aerospace and real estate markets as nearly all its businesses posted declines in the third quarter. The company, which owns Pratt &amp; Whitney, Otis elevator, Sikorsky Aircraft and other businesses, said it earned $1.06 billion, or $1.14 a share, down 17 percent from $1.27 billion, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 11 percent, to $13.38 billion, from $15.09 billion a year ago. The chief financial officer, Greg Hayes, told investors and analysts in a conference call that the company was confident earnings would rise in 2010. The president and chief executive, Louis R. Chênevert, said a strong military backlog and significant repair and servicing businesses were setting up the company for earnings growth in 2010. In addition, he said United Technologies had begun to see improvement in some Asian economies, notably China’s. With the exception of Sikorsky Aircraft, which has benefited from increased military sales for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, operating profit fell at each of United Technologies’ businesses. Sikorsky’s operating profit rose 18 percent from a year ago. Stock in United Technologies, which is based in Hartford, Conn., fell 4 cents, to $65.40 a share.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/business/global/20jets.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">In Tough Market, Dassault Finds a Fighter Sale in Brazil<date>Published: October 19, 2009</date><text>MÉRIGNAC, France  On a recent afternoon at the sprawling Dassault Aviation plant, on the perimeter of the Bordeaux airport, the smell of kerosene hung in the air as engineers tested hydraulics and fuel systems on the combat jet Rafale.

The market for such fighters is tightening. Add to Portfolio Lockheed Martin Boeing Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Pascal Rossignol/Reuters The Rafale fighter jet, made by Dassault Aviation, at the Paris Air Show in June. Dassault is trying to expand its military business. Those planes are destined for delivery to the French military, just like the previous 70 to 80 that have rolled off the assembly line. But there is a sense of cautious optimism here that the Rafale is finally within touching distance of a long-sought goal: its first foreign sale. A tentative deal with Brazil worth 5 billion euros ($7.46 billion), announced last month, would go some way toward offsetting the downturn at Dassault’s commercially more important Falcon business jet division. It also would help France recapture some of the glory  and export revenue  lost when the Rafale’s predecessor, the Mirage, ceased production in 2007. With military budgets under pressure and many potential clients tied to American fighters, Dassault has been fighting for the leftovers of contracts with the French companies Thales and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company. Along with market leaders like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Dassault’s competitors include the advanced but expensive pan-European twin-engine Eurofighter, which operates in Europe and Saudi Arabia; the Saab Gripen, in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary and South Africa; and the Russian Sukhoi and MIG. “The market is shrinking, and there are too many players,” said Eugene Kogan, guest researcher at the International Institute for Liberal Policy in Vienna. “And it looks like China may soon start to move into some of the markets once dominated by Russia.” With its modest size  the group employs 12,500  Dassault has retained a reputation for agility not always apparent in French industry. The Brazilians, meanwhile emboldened by their booming economy, are looking for a flexible, twin-engine combat jet to guard their offshore oil deposits and the vast Amazon rain forest. Should the deal go through, they would acquire more than just 36 planes. The sale also includes a total transfer of technology, which would enable Brazil to assemble most of the Rafale jets itself and sell them regionally. The contract might rise to 120 aircraft. The terms illustrate the pressures on Dassault and a handful of other military companies competing in a tightening global market. Not only are advanced new American and European jets coming to market, but also looming on the horizon are the prospect of advanced unmanned fighters and even competition from China, using technology from Israeli and Russian jets. Jean-Paul Hébert, a strategic expert at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris, says Dassault is facing “an appallingly hard decision” as it debates the post-Rafale era. “Long-term research costs are very heavy, and the French arms industry has not been that commercially very successful alone,” he said. The Rafale was conceived in the mid-1980s and first test-flown in 1991 as a successor to a series of aircraft that included the Mirage, which earned its stripes during the Six-Day War in the Middle East. Some 2,800 Mirages were delivered, more than half  57 percent  for export. But the French military wanted new capabilities, and so Dassault turned to the Rafale. The first prototype was built in 1986, and it entered service in 2001. Its sleek twin- or single-seat jets are recognizable by their main Delta wings and mini-canard wings below the cockpit; land and sea versions have been built. Its engine is made by the French company Snecma, and Dassault expects the plane to be enhanced by an upgraded RBE2 radar from Thales, in which Dassault took a 26 percent stake this year. Dassault has come close to exporting the Rafale before, notably to Morocco in 2007 and Singapore and South Korea previously, but those governments chose American hardware instead. The disappointments were blamed on bureaucratic problems in Paris and Washington’s greater clout. The Brazil package would be complex. Six jets would be made in France and 30 assembled in Brazil by Embraer, in which Dassault has a stake of 0.9 percent. The contract might expand to 120 aircraft, and comes alongside sales of other French hardware to the country and planned purchases by France of Brazilian transport planes. “It looks like technology transfer was pretty critical,” said Rebecca Grant, senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, a research body in Arlington, Va. Mrs. Grant also said that the market would become more difficult once the Joint Strike Fighter from Lockheed Martin arrives in the next few years. Also known as the F-35, it appears to be the favored choice among NATO countries like Norway, the Netherlands and Poland, which are tempted by shared production to replace their mainstay F-16s. The F-35, hit by delays, is now projected by the Government Accountability Office to cost Washington $300 billion for 2,440 deliveries, above 2001 estimates. Dassault’s most important product is the Falcon business jet, which has been transporting royalty, pop stars and chief executives for decades. Over the last five years, Falcons represented on average 60 percent of sales and 80 percent of orders; Dassault received 115 orders in 2008, down from 212 a year earlier, and expects even fewer this year. Falcons, which cost $30 million to $50 million each, are finished in Little Rock, Ark., from parts built in France. At Mérignac, workers were assembling a Falcon 7X for NetJets, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Other clients like Royal Bank of Scotland and Citigroup canceled orders last year in the wake of the financial crisis. Olivier Brochet, an analyst at Natixis Securities, said Rafale exports might help offset lower demand for the Falcon. Analysts estimate on average that Dassault will have revenue of 3.5 billion euros in 2009, and profit of 289 million euros, down from revenue of 3.75 billion euros and profit of 373 million euros in 2008.

That comes against a backdrop of a recent prediction by the International Monetary Fund that this year would be the first since the end of World War II to record a drop in global economic activity, with world output falling 1.5 percent — a situation causing major financial problems for both commercial and military aerospace manufacturers. At the Paris Air Show fifty years ago, as the Jet Age was dawning, few participants would have envisioned the state of the industry today. While nothing can effectively replace air transport for both passengers and cargo shippers, until the economy recovers traffic is sure to be severely depressed. In addition, military aerospace orders, often a safety net in past downturns, are constrained now by tight government budgets in nearly all major markets. “From the end of World War II through last year, there was not a single year without some growth in global G.D.P.,” James McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, told shareholders at their annual meeting on April 27. “Recessions in one or two parts of the world were always counter-balanced — and outweighed — by continuing growth in other parts. Until this year, “global businesses have been flying with a favorable tail wind,” Mr. McNerney said. But now “we have gone to flying into the teeth of a fierce head wind.” Airlines worldwide are likely to suffer a 12 percent fall in revenue this year, double the drop experienced after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he said. The International Air Transport Association at its annual meeting this month, gave an even gloomier assessment, forecasting an $80 billion, or 15 percent, decline in member airlines’ revenues this year, to $448 billion, with passenger traffic volume down 8 percent and cargo traffic down 17 percent. I.A.T.A. predicted industrywide losses of $9 billion this year, following losses of $10.4 billion in 2008. The association warned that it saw little prospect of finding financing for much of the $500-billion backlog of new aircraft ordered by airlines and not yet undelivered. Still, the major aircraft builders are unusually well placed to weather their customers’ problems. On the bright side, Mr. McNerney noted, the Boeing order backlog, standing at $352 billion at the end of last year, was the largest it had ever been — twice the size of four years earlier and more than five times the company’s annual revenue. That backlog includes 866 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, destined for 56 customers, included on the order books at a list price of $165 million each, or $140 billion in total. “They’re betting the commercial side of the company,” said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at the Teal Group aviation and aerospace consultancy firm in Fairfax, Virginia. The Dreamliner, he said, “is the key to their product line reinvention. It’s the plane of the decade. It’s going to be the first of a long series of aircraft built with advanced composite materials rather than metal.” That emphasis on innovation however, is cutting both ways in the short term. Boeing has struggled to convert the 787 from dream to reality, partly reflecting technical challenges and partly organizational ones as the plane maker has switched to a broadly dispersed, decentralized global chain of suppliers and subcontractors from its previous reliance on its Seattle-area work force. The 787 is running some two years behind schedule, and now is committed to do its first flight by June 30. Mr. McNerney told an investment conference late last month that he expected that target date would be met, and that the aircraft would be delivered to its first customer, All Nippon Airways, by March 31, 2010 — provided that no more unexpected problems arose during the nine-month test-flight program. At Boeing’s rival, Airbus, Thomas Enders, chief executive, warned on June 2 that the company’s aircraft deliveries would probably fall next year. “We still lack visibility on 2010, and the airlines lack visibility even more,” Mr. Enders said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »The 100th-anniversary Paris Air Show takes place this year against a backdrop of tragedy and economic stress.

At Boeing’s rival, Airbus, Thomas Enders, chief executive, warned on June 2 that the company’s aircraft deliveries would probably fall next year. “We still lack visibility on 2010, and the airlines lack visibility even more,” Mr. Enders said. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/us/31cyber.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Contractors Vie for Plum Work, Hacking for U.S.<date>Published: May 30, 2009</date><text>MELBOURNE, Fla.  The government’s urgent push into cyberwarfare has set off a rush among the biggest military companies for billions of dollars in new defense contracts.

But some defense experts and Congressional leaders who oversee military spending have said it would be cheaper to keep building a basic version of the helicopter than to scrap the project altogether. Congress could potentially overrule the Pentagon’s decision. Ashton B. Carter, the new under secretary of defense for acquisitions, signed a memorandum Friday canceling the program. The Navy, which oversees the project, then issued its own order to the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, to halt work at its plant in Owego in upstate New York, where it has been conducting flight tests on several of the helicopters. Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat from New York who represents Owego and who sits on the House defense appropriations subcommittee, criticized the decision as a waste of the $3.2 billion already been spent on the program. Mr. Hinchey and Representative John P. Murtha, a powerful Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the subcommittee, are expected to question Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates about the decision when he appears before the panel next week. But lawmakers from Connecticut applauded the Pentagon’s move, saying they want Sikorsky Aircraft, which is based in Stratford, Conn., to have another chance to bid for the huge contract. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said the cancellation was “welcome news” and “a recognition of the slate of problems with the helicopter replacement program.” Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies, built the current fleet of aging helicopters used by the president. But it lost out to Lockheed Martin and a European company in 2005 after the Bush administration set out to create a futuristic craft that could fend off terrorist attacks and resist the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast. The plan was to build five basic helicopters and 23 more sophisticated craft. The Pentagon stopped work on the advanced helicopters in late 2007 as the cost overruns mounted on them. Mr. Gates has said that the basic ones, which were scheduled to go into service in 2011, were built to last only 5 to 10 years. But AgustaWestland, the European company that builds the helicopters for Lockheed Martin, disputed his comments and offered to build a fleet of the basic craft for the $6.8 billion originally budgeted for the project. Records show that while the Navy initially certified the helicopters for only 5 to 10 years of use, it had also budgeted money for fatigue tests commonly used to extend the expected lives of aircraft. AgustaWestland has said that other versions of the basic helicopter have been rated for 30 years of use by the Federal Aviation Administration and civil and military authorities in several other countries. Pentagon officials have said they were also concerned that the basic helicopters could fly only 200 miles without refueling, while the Bush administration wanted new helicopters that could fly nearly 300 miles. But military experts say it would be expensive to customize any midsize helicopter to meet that goal. They said that the Bush White House wanted a craft large enough to carry 14 people, compared with 10 on the current helicopters, which date back to 1975, yet still small enough to land on the White House lawn without tearing up the Rose Garden. Pentagon officials have said that they will review the requirements with the Obama administration before seeking new bids.

It was built in 1975! It costs a fortune to operate because of the stupendous maintenance required for its aging innards. Really, it’s kind of like sending your commander in chief whipping around in an airborne Plymouth. New presidential helicopters are being built even as we speak. But Obama wants nothing to do with them, even though we the taxpayers have already spent $3.2 billion on them. This is because he does not want to appear wasteful. Let’s follow this story. After 9/11, the Bush administration ordered up a new generation of presidential helicopters that would be able to whisk the chief executive away from the White House in a crisis. The new choppers were supposed to be less vulnerable to attack, carry more people and have efficient communications with the outside world. All of which seemed supremely reasonable. Lockheed Martin won a $6.8 billion contract to build 23 helicopters, which are known as the VH-71. But as so often happens in these matters, things went badly. There were overruns. Specification changes. The Bush administration wanted a helicopter capable of delivering the president to an unspecified safe retreat a little less than 300 miles from the White House. The ability to fly that far without refueling came in conflict with the need to have a helicopter that’s small enough to land on the White House lawn without knocking down trees. (There had been an experiment with a larger helicopter during the 1970s, with unfortunate consequences to the nation’s First Foliage.) Fast forward to that frugality summit last February. Obama invited questions from members of Congress, and first up was John McCain, who wanted to talk about waste in the Defense Department  like the fact that “your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One.” McCain complains about Defense procurement no matter who is president. However, that “your helicopter” did seem a tad personal. There’s no easier way to get under the president’s skin than to suggest that he’s a wasteful spender. When you’re setting new records for budget deficits on an hourly basis, you don’t want anybody thinking you’re the kind of guy who demands a frilly mode of transportation. So Obama denounced the new helicopters as “the procurement process gone amok” and vowed reform. In April, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates helpfully followed through by recommending that the contract be terminated. At this point, we’re in for nearly $4 billion if the contract is shelved, and we already have five helicopters complete and undergoing testing. Under the original plan, Lockheed is now supposed to start building a second-stage super-duper model that would allow the president to do in-air teleconferencing and have lots of other nifty features. Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat of New York and a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, thinks the administration should just build the other helicopters on the simpler first-stage model. Both he and the manufacturer say this would bring the entire project in at the original budget. (Hinchey would be the first to admit that he is not totally objective on this matter, since his district includes a Lockheed plant that would lose 800 jobs if the contract is canceled. He gets letters from the children of plant employees with pictures of helicopters making sad faces.) The Defense Department wants to deep-six the whole plan and put a new contract out in 2011. This is what has always bothered me about wasteful procurement stories. They end with the Pentagon scrapping a troubled contract and starting over from scratch. We don’t wind up actually saving money. We lose our original investment and spend vast new sums on something that’s theoretically going to be better. The Obama administration completely, totally rejects the theory that the contract is being canceled just because the president doesn’t want to be caught riding in a helicopter that John McCain says is too expensive. But if there’s something deeply wrong with the VH-71s besides their capacity to embarrass the administration, it isn’t immediately apparent. Gates claimed they were “estimated to have only a 5- to 10-year useful life.” But the Federal Aviation Administration rates a commercial version of the helicopters as good for 30 years. My vote is for the president to take the tougher political route, and the bigger, safer helicopters that are already online. But maybe he could reduce the order, and let other people who have helicopter privileges take their chances with the current fleet or take the train. And if you can’t bear to think that the president is doing something stupid, blame it on John McCain.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: N.Y. Metropolitan Transportation Authority In a lawsuit filed Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the contractor, Lockheed Martin Transportation Security Solutions, asked a judge to release it from its contract, claiming that the authority had caused numerous delays and failed to give it access to train tunnels to finish the work. The lawsuit, reported Tuesday in The New York Post, is the latest and most public episode in an ugly spat between the authority and Lockheed over the security camera project, part of a group of projects begun after the Sept. 11 terror attack to protect the authority’s transportation system. It also raised questions about how much progress has been made to increase the safety of the subway and commuter rail systems more than seven years after the attack. Above all, the lawsuit said that much work remained to be done to add security features to under-river tunnels used by the subway and the Long Island Rail Road. The authority said in a written statement on Tuesday that 80 percent of the installation work on the camera project had been done. “Lockheed has not been able to pass the required software system tests,” the statement said. “We have been working with Lockheed to achieve a minimum level of acceptable functionality, but it has taken longer than expected because of Lockheed’s inability to resolve certain critical system issues, pass the needed tests and progress the work to the point where it can be put into operation.” The authority also criticized Lockheed, saying it had disclosed “confidential, security-sensitive information” in the lawsuit. The statement said that the authority had made progress in other areas to improve security, including hardening infrastructure and increasing police presence on the commuter railroads. Authority officials have said before that the high-tech camera system was not living up to its promise. The cameras are linked to software that was supposed to be able to detect an unattended object, like a backpack or briefcase, left on a station platform, and then alert law enforcement. But that ability, and others, failed during tests. In fact, according to a report by the state comptroller’s office last November, 400 of 1,400 software elements in the system failed tests conducted last spring. The lawsuit charged that the authority was responsible for lengthy delays in the project, which began in August 2005, with a completion date of August 2008. But the scope of the project grew, as the authority added more areas of the transit system to the plan. The authority said the contract value had risen to $307 million, up from the $213 million in the original contract. The comptroller’s report put the cost of the project at $453 million, including design and other costs beyond Lockheed’s. Because of the delays, the lawsuit says, large parts of the project are not scheduled to be completed until September 2009. Excluded from that completion date, according to the lawsuit, are parts of the under-river tunnels used by the subway and the Long Island Rail Road; the authority had often failed to shut down tunnels on weekends for Lockheed to install security equipment, it said. Lockheed also said that rooms for camera equipment were not wired for access to a communications network. The authority said that Lockheed had been paid about $250 million so far.

''The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me,'' he said to laughter. On a more serious note, he added, ''I think it is an example of the procurement process gone amok. And we're going to have to fix it.'' But the president is learning that in the world of defense contracting, frugality can be expensive. Some lawmakers and military experts warn that his effort to avoid wasting billions of dollars could end up doing just that. The administration's plan to halt the $13 billion helicopter program, announced this month, will leave the government with little to show for the $3.2 billion it has spent since the Bush administration set out to create a futuristic craft that could fend off terrorist attacks and resist the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast. Critics say the Pentagon would also spend at least $200 million in termination fees and perhaps hundreds of millions to extend the life of today's aging fleet. As a result, several influential lawmakers and defense analysts are now calling for a compromise that would salvage a simpler version of the helicopter that is already being tested. They say it could be a more palatable alternative in tough economic times than seeking new bids for a more advanced craft, which has proved difficult to develop. ''The real question is how much does the president need, and what will it cost to do that,'' said David J. Berteau, who has studied the helicopter program as a member of a Defense Science Board task force. He said he had no doubt that the simpler version of the new helicopter, the VH-71, would be a big improvement over today's 30- to 35-year-old fleet in helping the president ''survive a crisis and operate within it.'' Others say that unless the White House reduces the intricate security requirements that have led to a doubling in the price of the program, there is no assurance that the government will be able to control the costs any better in a new bidding. ''Everyone wants to protect the president, but we are not going to pay $500 million for a single helicopter,'' said Representative John P. Murtha, a Democrat from Pennsylvania and the chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee. Mr. Murtha said he had warned the Obama administration not to cancel the entire program, which includes a first batch of five helicopters with more seating, communications equipment and survivability than the current ones and 23 more sophisticated craft. Mr. Murtha's aides said he might insist on preserving funds for the basic version of the helicopter when Congress takes up next year's budget. But it is also clear that, despite Mr. Obama's comments about sticking with the white-topped helicopters that have alighted on the White House lawn since the 1970s and '80s, his administration still wants new craft with some of the most demanding features that the Bush team envisioned after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the White House, declined to comment on its plans for the helicopters. But John J. Young Jr., who stepped down on Monday as the Pentagon's acquisition chief, said he expected White House and military officials to take another look at the requirements soon. Mr. Young said the basic version of the helicopter -- built by Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland, a European company -- was meant to be used as a transition to the more advanced craft and has only been certified for several years of use. Though the contractors insist the helicopters would last 30 years, Mr. Young said that with the extra weight from armor and other gear, Pentagon experts say they may not be able to count on them for more than 10 to 20 years. Mr. Young said that neither the White House Military Office, which sets the requirements, nor a Marine squadron that operates the helicopters, wanted the more basic ones. All five of them have been built, and after flight testing and installation of sophisticated gear in Owego in upstate New York, they were expected to be ready in the spring of 2011.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/us/politics/22defense.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed Won’t Fight Pentagon on F-22 Plan<date>Published: April 21, 2009</date><text>Lockheed Martin will accept the Pentagon’s plans to phase out the F-22 fighter jet and will not lobby Congress to build more of the expensive planes, a top executive said on Tuesday.

Tanner, the company’s chief financial officer, told stock analysts that the company had received “a full hearing” from Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and top Air Force officials, and “we’ll accept those decisions.” Mr. Tanner made the comments in discussing the company’s first-quarter results. Net income fell nearly 9 percent, to $666 million, or $1.68 a share, compared with $730 million, or $1.75 a share, in the period a year earlier, the company said. Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, said growing pension costs had cut into its profit. But it still beat analysts’ consensus forecast of $1.64 a share. Sales rose 4 percent, to $10.4 billion, just below the analyst forecast of $10.5 billion. Legislators from Georgia, Connecticut and other states with major suppliers are still likely to push for more planes, saying they are concerned about job losses. Mr. Tanner said that under previous contracts, F-22s would be assembled at Lockheed Martin’s plant in Marietta, Ga., until 2012. He added that most of the workers there would be able to shift to expanding production lines for other planes. Mr. Tanner also disputed a report in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that said computer hackers had downloaded “sizable amounts” of data on a program to build another fighter plane, the F-35, from the computer systems of two or three of the contractors. Lockheed Martin is also the prime contractor for that plane. Mr. Tanner said that the company thought the article “was incorrect in its representation of successful cyberattacks on the F-35 program.” “I’ve not heard of that, and to our knowledge there’s never been any classified information breach,” he told the analysts.

Legislators from Georgia, Connecticut and other states with major suppliers are still likely to push for more planes. But it will be much harder for them to succeed if the Air Force is not quietly supporting their efforts, military analysts said. Several industry officials and former Air Force officers said they would not be surprised to see Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor on the plane, pull back from a lobbying campaign emphasizing how many jobs would be lost if production was halted. Under the administration’s plan, the Pentagon would speed up the testing of another Lockheed Martin fighter, the F-35, which it plans to buy in much greater quantities. Industry officials said the company might not want to risk angering the new administration as it already had many other lucrative defense contracts. “This is the first time in the entire history of the F-22 program that Lockheed could not count on its Air Force customer wanting more F-22s,” said Loren Thompson, a consultant who advises Lockheed Martin and other military contractors. “And the company clearly cannot be pushing as hard with Congress as it did in the past because it won’t have the customer on its side,” he said. Douglas A. Birkey, the director of government relations for the Air Force Association, a group that often lobbies for the service, said he also expected to see Lockheed Martin shift its focus from the F-22 to the F-35, which is also called the Joint Strike Fighter. The F-22 was designed for aerial combat while the F-35 would focus more on ground targets and is meant to be cheaper. Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest defense contractor, has said it is reviewing the changes proposed last week by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. Shortly after the announcement by Mr. Gates, Lockheed’s chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, said in a memorandum to employees that while some of the recommendations were disappointing, “I embrace Secretary Gates’s call to put the interests of the United States first  above the interests of agencies, services and contractors  and I will support him in every way.” The shift in thinking about the F-22 was detailed in an op-ed article on Monday in The Washington Post by Michael Donley, the Air Force secretary, and Gen. Norton Schwartz, the service’s chief of staff. Before the announcement by Mr. Gates, both had fought hard for the F-22, saying the Air Force needed it as a hedge against Russia and China and even a possible war with Iran. They had advocated buying 60 more of the planes, which would have brought the Air Force’s fleet to 243. But in their essay, Mr. Donley and General Schwartz wrote that “the time has come to move on.” The two said that as defense spending becomes constrained, and Mr. Gates shifts money to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, budgeting “has increasingly become a zero-sum game.” They said it would cost $13 billion for 60 more F-22’s. Yet, they added: “Much rides on the F-35’s success, and it is critical to keep the Joint Strike Fighter on schedule and on cost. This is the time to make the transition from F-22 to F-35 production.” Mr. Gates had said last week that he supported plans to build more than 2,400 F-35s. Industry officials said the essay laid to rest any doubts about where Mr. Donley and General Schwartz stood. Mr. Gates and his predecessor, Donald H. Rumsfeld, had tried to halt production of the F-22 during the Bush administration, only to find that previous Air Force leaders continued to support it. In fact, the former Air Force secretary, Michael Wynne, who was fired by Mr. Gates in June 2008 amid battles over Air Force programs, said Monday that he still believed that Mr. Gates was taking too many risks in canceling the F-22 and other high-tech weapons programs. He said it would make sense to buy more F-22s in case the F-35 is delayed.

One of his first challenges was to help turn the company from the brink of bankruptcy during the early 1970s. The company’s struggles were connected with those of Rolls-Royce, the British engine maker and a major Lockheed supplier, which itself filed for bankruptcy in 1971. To help Lockheed, the Nixon administration pushed through Congress loan guarantees of up to $250 million. Mr. Kotchian became an energetic salesman for Lockheed’s jets, traveling the world to sell them. Eventually, however, these efforts caught up with him.

Mr. Kotchian also testified that in the early 1960s, Lockheed paid $1.1 million  which he described as a “gift”  to a high Dutch official. That official was identified later as Prince Bernhard, the Dutch armed forces’ inspector general and the husband of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. Under pressure, the prince resigned from his military and business positions in August 1976. He admitted that he had “not been critical enough in my judgment of initiatives presented to me,” but a Dutch government commission found no firm evidence that he had taken bribes. The scandal  also felt in Italy and other countries  continued to ricochet for years in Japan’s political circles.

From Kourou, where 20,000 people, many of them transplanted cosmopolitans, live sandwiched between jungle and ocean, it is easy to see how much Americans, who once dominated the commercial space industry, have been reduced to just another competitor — or, worse, a partner in joint ventures with Russians — on a global field of play. The driving force behind Kourou’s development is Arianespace, a French company that began as a poor cousin to NASA nearly three decades ago. Today, it has edged past Boeing and Lockheed Martin to become the leading player in the $3.2 billion commercial-satellite-launching industry; it accounts for about half of all the tonnage sent into orbit for business purposes each year. That pales, of course, alongside the bigger business of military and government satellite launches, which the United States and Russia still lead. But it does include the launching of commercial satellites that transmit the data for a globalized economy, as well as for satellite broadcast, Internet and Earth-imaging tools. And in that, the Americans are no longer in charge. Kourou seems a bit fantastical to be so important. With jungle on three sides and the Atlantic on the fourth, it is an equatorial one-project town. Yet its post-1960s apartment blocks are neatly tended, its gendarmerie stations staffed by men in French khakis, its food stores stocked with imported pâtés and wine. Imagine it as Los Alamos, built and provisioned by France. Most of the time it seems to sleep. But about half a dozen times a year, in launches that are believed to cost $200 million apiece, Arianespace rockets light up the sky. “Through perseverance and some good luck and timing, we’ve done fine for ourselves,” said Thierry Vallée, an official at France’s space agency, CNES, who has a knack for understatement. He says this while standing in the Guiana Space Center’s control room, under a global map of competing launch sites in places like Alcântara (Brazil), Sriharikota (India), and Xichang (China). The roots of this odd achievement lie deep in the psychological jolt France got when it lost its first launch site, in Algeria, in the 1960s. Determined not merely to follow America, France was desperate to find another way to reach space independently. Since the Equator is the ideal latitude to launch from — the Earth’s rotation is fastest there, thrusting payloads into space like a slingshot — the French looked around at their outposts that were near it and decided on this one, after rejecting French Polynesia and Djibouti. As Americans reached for the Moon, France and its European partners slowly built their commercial launch operations here. Then the Americans began to stumble. The Reagan administration prohibited the space shuttles from carrying most commercial payloads after the Challenger disaster in 1986. And later, NASA gave up on two flawed plans for new vehicles, the National Aerospace Plane and Lockheed Martin’s X-33 unmanned space plane. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, whose mainstay was American military contracts, kept launching commercial satellites from California and Florida in those years. But that business declined drastically when the telecommunications and dot-com bubbles burst at the start of this decade. Meanwhile, Arianespace had tied together CNES with other European stakeholders, building a consortium that could launch here. The Europeans were mainly public entities like CNES, but because they lacked large military programs, commercial launches were the game they could play. “The Europeans had to turn to the commercial sector if they wanted to maintain their independent space capabilities,” said Jeff Foust, a senior analyst with Futron, a Maryland aerospace consulting firm. And they caught some breaks. With the end of the cold war, as NASA pulled back, Russia’s space program went on poverty rations and Russians became available as partners. Today, Frenchmen learn from Russians here and accept business from Mexicans, Koreans and some Americans. “Welcome to the future,” says Boris Dubrovin, the foreman of a crew of some 60 Russian technicians who are scrambling to build a replica of a Soviet-era launch site located in the desert steppes of Central Asia. The project will allow Arianespace, whose specialty is a rocket that can launch two payloads at once, to use Russia’s Soyuz rockets for smaller tasks. Meanwhile, the French look warily at new competitors. “By cooperating with the Russians, we are better positioned to compete with emerging players like the Chinese,” Jean-Yves Le Gall, the chief executive of Arianespace, said in an interview. China, in fact, recently built and launched satellites for Nigeria and Venezuela. And Boeing has partnered with Russian, Ukrainian and Norwegian firms to form Sea Launch, which operates from Pacific Ocean platforms. Another American company, I.L.S., is controlled by Russia’s Khrunichev space center and launches from Kazakhstan’s Baikonur Cosmodrome. One risk for all of these players is the current souring of the global economy. The number of launches is expected to drop next year, and it is anybody’s guess what demand will be beyond that. But if the pattern of the past decade can hold, satellite operators the world over will still flock to Kourou, where they will find the French Foreign Legion protecting the space center, residents sending postcards to mainland France through La Poste — and, on the offshore Îles du Salut, which include Devil’s Island, futuristic tracking stations standing near old corroding prison cells where convicts like Charrière once dreamed of escape. “France found a use for one of the pieces of confetti left over from its empire,” said Peter Redfield, an anthropologist who studies French Guiana, “while the Americans, after the lunar missions, are still asking what to do for an encore.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/us/politics/10jets.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">A Fighter Jet’s Fate Poses a Quandary for Obama<date>Published: December 9, 2008</date><text>Two of President-elect Barack Obama’s stated goals  cutting wasteful spending and saving or creating millions of jobs  are on a collision course in a looming decision over whether to keep building the F-22 fighter jet.

Air Force officials have told Congress that they are hoping to win a $9 billion commitment to produce at least 60 F-22s over a three-year period, which would expand the fleet to 243. But the F-22, a stealthy, supersonic fighter that was designed during the cold war and has never been used in combat, has many critics, and they include Robert M. Gates, who will remain Defense secretary in the Obama administration. Mr. Gates has questioned the relevancy of the F-22, and said the military should focus its resources more on fighting insurgencies like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, supporters of the F-22 program  which has cost more than $65 billion so far  argue that Mr. Obama should extend its production, at least temporarily, to preserve thousands of jobs related to building the jets, which cost $143 million each. “To continue F-22 production would be to continue all the fundamental problems we’ve been having over the last 30 years, where each new weapons system costs so much that we end up with a dwindling inventory of planes, ships and tanks,” said Winslow T. Wheeler, an analyst at the Center for Defense Information, a nonprofit group in Washington. “It’s the first test of whether President Obama is going to go along with business as usual or instead will bring much needed change to the Pentagon,” he added. Defense experts say his decision, expected early next year, could provide the first sign of whether the economic crisis would force the military to make much harder choices about what kind of wars it should be prepared to fight. So far, Mr. Obama has been vague about his defense plans, saying only that he does not intend to cut the recent record spending levels while the nation is at war and that he will review major weapons programs with Pentagon and Congressional leaders. But nearly everyone expects defense spending to tighten over time, and that the military will no longer have enough money to prepare for every contingency. As a result, Mr. Obama’s transition team is already being lobbied by military services seeking to preserve prized programs, from the Army’s plans for advanced combat gear to the ground-based missile defense system. The F-22 program, which the Bush administration wanted to end, may survive only if something else is cut from the Pentagon budget. That means the Obama administration’s decision will set the tone for how tough-minded it will be in balancing competing pressures. Without further spending for the F-22, companies that supply critical components for it would begin shutting down soon. The chairmen and ranking Republicans on both the House and Senate defense appropriations subcommittees recently wrote to Mr. Gates to voice their support for the F-22, cautioning that “the last thing our nation needs is to terminate jobs in this time of such economic uncertainty.” Like many big weapons systems, the plane, which relies on 1,000 parts suppliers in 44 states, has strong support in Congress, which recently provided up to $140 million in bridge financing for some of the suppliers. “I think we’re going to keep the F-22 going, that’s my gut instinct,” said Norman Dicks, a Democrat from Washington who also sits on the House subcommittee that approves money for defense programs. “But it’s going to be a very tight budget environment,” he said. “We’ve still got the $12 billion to $15 billion a month that we’re spending on the war, we’ve got to replenish the troops and the equipment that has been used up, and we’ve still got this whole need to modernize the Air Force, the Army and the Navy. And a lot of people are going to look at the consequences of ending these programs on a further deterioration in the economy.” The plane had far more support in the 1980s, when the Air Force envisioned buying up to 750 of the planes to dominate dogfights with Soviet jets. The F-22 can perform tactical operations at higher altitudes than other fighters, and it can cruise at supersonic speeds without using telltale afterburners. With its stealthy skin that scatters radar detection signals, it can also sneak in and destroy enemy surface-to-air missile defenses, clearing the way for bombers and other planes to follow. Because of complications with some of the technologies, the plane ran into major delays and cost overruns that are typical of many defense projects, and more than 20 years passed before it was ready for military use in 2005. By then, the Pentagon’s focus had shifted to the wars against Islamic insurgents, and many critics, including Mr. Bush’s first Defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, and then Mr. Gates, began slashing spending for the F-22, leading to unusually bitter confrontations with Air Force officials. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on December 10, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.Two of President-elect Barack Obama’s stated goals  cutting wasteful spending and saving or creating millions of jobs  are on a collision course in a looming decision over whether to keep building the F-22 fighter jet.

The ship  the first of a new class of versatile, high-speed combat vessels designed to operate in coastal waters  was indeed bobbing in the river, just four months after the promised launching date. But it was far from finished. In fact, the ship floats there still, work continuing day and night. A project heralded as the dawning of an innovative, low-cost era in Navy shipbuilding has turned into a case study of how not to build a combat ship. The bill for the ship, being built by Lockheed Martin, has soared to $531 million, more than double the original, and by some calculations could be $100 million more. With an alternate General Dynamics prototype similarly struggling at an Alabama shipyard, the Navy last year temporarily suspended the entire program. The program’s tribulations speak to what military experts say are profound shortcomings in the Pentagon’s acquisitions system. Even as spending on new projects has risen to its highest point since the Reagan years, being over budget and behind schedule have become the norm: a recent Government Accountability Office audit found that 95 projects  warships, helicopters and satellites  were delayed 21 months on average and cost 26 percent more than initially projected, a bill of $295 billion. In a narrow sense, the troubled birth of the coastal ships was rooted in the Navy’s misbegotten faith in a feat of maritime alchemy: building a hardened warship by adapting the design of a high-speed commercial ferry. As Representative Gene Taylor, the Mississippi Democrat who leads the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces, put it, “Thinking these ships could be built to commercial specs was a dumb move.” Behind the numbers in the Accountability Office study, experts say, is a dynamic of mutually re-enforcing deficiencies: ever-changing Pentagon design requirements; unrealistic cost estimates and production schedules abetted by companies eager to win contracts, and a fondness for commercial technologies that often, as with the ferry concept, prove unsuitable for specialized military projects. At the same time, a policy of letting contractors take the lead in managing weapons programs has coincided with an acute shortage of government engineers trained to oversee these increasingly complex enterprises. The coastal ships  called littoral combat ships  are especially important to the Navy, which has struggled to retain a central role in American military operations after the cold war. In part, they are a response to the Navy’s own Sept. 11 moment, which came in October 2000, when two terrorists in a bomb-laden rubber dinghy rammed the destroyer Cole, killing 17 sailors and wounding 39 more. An examination of the littoral combat ships by The New York Times, including interviews with many of the principal Navy and industry officials involved, found that the project was hobbled from the outset by the Navy’s zeal to build the ships as fast and inexpensively as possible and the contractors’ desire  driven by competitive pressures  to stay on schedule, even as the ferry designs proved impractical and construction problems multiplied. In their haste to get the ships into the water, the Navy and contractors redesigned and built them at the same time  akin to building an office tower while reworking the blueprints. To meet its deadline, Lockheed abandoned the normal sequence of shipbuilding steps: instead of largely finishing sections and then assembling the ship, much of the work was left to be done after the ship was welded together. That slowed construction and vastly drove up costs. “It’s not good to be building as you’re designing,” said Vice Adm. Paul E. Sullivan, commander of the Navy branch that supervises shipbuilding. A Lockheed executive vice president, Christopher E. Kubasik, said, “We have acknowledged all along our shared responsibility for challenges encountered in the design and construction of the littoral combat ship, which are similar to those typically experienced with first-in-class vessels, including the competing LCS design.” Mr. Kubasik said the company was working toward “realistic cost goals for subsequent ships.” General Dynamics declined to comment. 1 2 3 4 Next Page » More Articles in US »With the crack of a Champagne bottle against its bow, the newly minted Navy warship, bedecked with bunting, slid sideways into the Menominee River in Wisconsin with a titanic splash.

Skip to next paragraph Related Web Links Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page The Mailing List for Visual Satellite Observers Heavens-Above VideoMore Video » But they said precious little about the satellite itself. Such information came instead from Ted Molczan, a hobbyist who tracks satellites from his apartment balcony in Toronto, and fellow satellite spotters around the world. They have grudgingly become accustomed to being seen as “propeller-headed geeks” who “poke their finger in the eye” of the government’s satellite spymasters, Mr. Molczan said, taking no offense. “I have a sense of humor,” he said. Mr. Molczan, a private energy conservation consultant, is the best known of the satellite spotters who, needing little more than a pair of binoculars, a stop watch and star charts, uncover some of the deepest of the government’s expensive secrets and share them on the Internet. Thousands of people form the spotter community. Many look for historical relics of the early space age, working from publicly available orbital information. Others watch for phenomena like the distinctive flare of sunlight glinting off bright solar panels of some telephone satellites. Still others are drawn to the secretive world of spy satellites, with about a dozen hobbyists who do most of the observing, Mr. Molczan said. In the case of the mysterious satellite that is about to plunge back to earth, Mr. Molczan had an early sense of which one it was, identifying it as USA-193, which gave out shortly after reaching space in December 2006. It is said to have been built by the Lockheed Martin Corporation and operated by the secretive National Reconnaissance Office. Another hobbyist, John Locker of Britain, posted photos of the satellite on a Web site, galaxypix.com. John E. Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a private group in Alexandria, Va., that tracks military and space activities, said the hobbyists exemplified fundamental principles of openness and of the power of technology to change the game. “It has been an important demystification of these things,” Mr. Pike said, “because I think there is a tendency on the part of these agencies just to try to pretend that they don’t exist, and that nothing can be known about them.” But the spotters are also pursuing a thoroughly unusual pastime, one that calls for long hours outside, freezing in the winter and sweating in the summer, straining to see a moving light in the sky and hoping that a slip of the finger on the stopwatch does not delete an entire night’s work. And for the adept, there is math. Lots of math. “It’s somewhat time consuming and tedious,” Mr. Molczan said, acknowledging that the precise and methodical activities might seem, to the uninitiated, “a close approximation to work.” When a new spy satellite is launched, the hobbyists will collaborate on sightings around the world to determine its orbit, and even guess at its function, sharing their information through the e-mail network SeeSat-L, which can be found via the Web site satobs.org. From his 23rd-floor balcony, or the roof of his 32-floor building, Mr. Molzcan will peer through his binoculars at a point in the sky he expects the satellite to cross, which he locates with star charts. When the moving dot appears, he determines its direction and the distance it travels across the patch of sky over time, which he can use to calculate its speed. Mr. Molzcan declined a request to visit him in Toronto and to be photographed for this article, saying: “No offense intended, but this is beginning to sound like more of a human interest story than one about the substance of the hobby. My preference is for the latter. Also, I prefer not to have photos of myself published.” Mr. Locker, who favors a telescope for his camerawork, said that people like him and Mr. Molczan were not, as he put it, “nerdy buffs who lie on our backs and look into the sky and try to undermine governments.” Spotting, he said, is simply a hobby. “There are people who look at train timetables and go watch trains,” he said. People are drawn to what interests them, he said, and “it’s what draws people to any hobby.” While recent news coverage has focused on the current satellite’s threat to people when it falls from above, that threat is, statistically, very small. Even when the space shuttle Columbia broke up over Texas five years ago and rained debris over two states, no one on the ground was injured. Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council, noted that 328 satellites had come down in the past five years without injury to anyone. While Mr. Johndroe declined to divulge much about the current satellite aside from the fact that it carries no nuclear material, he said that the government would take responsibility in the remote chance of damage or injury. The government’s relationship with the hobbyists is not a comfortable one. Spokesmen for the National Reconnaissance Office have stated that they would prefer the hobbyists not publish their information, and suggest that foreign countries try to hide their activities when they know an eye in the sky will be passing overhead. The satellite spotters acknowledge that this may be so, though they doubt that such tactics are effective. Mr. Molczan said he believed that the hobbyists hurt no one but that “you can’t say with absolute certainty what effect you’re having.” Mr. Pike said the officials who complained about the hobbyists “don’t like it, but they’ve got to lump it.” Despite the many clever ways that the spy agencies try to minimize the likelihood that their satellites will be spotted, he said, they will be. And that, he said, is a valuable warning: a world with so many eyes on the skies renders deep secrets shallow. “If Ted can track all these satellites,” Mr. Pike said, “so can the Chinese.” More Articles in Science »When the government announced last month that a top-secret spy satellite would, in the next few months, come falling out of the sky, American officials said there was little risk to people because satellites fall out of orbit fairly frequently and much of the planet is covered by oceans. Skip to next paragraph Related Web Links Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page The Mailing List for Visual Satellite Observers Heavens-Above VideoMore Video » But they said precious little about the satellite itself. Such information came instead from Ted Molczan, a hobbyist who tracks satellites from his apartment balcony in Toronto, and fellow satellite spotters around the world. They have grudgingly become accustomed to being seen as “propeller-headed geeks” who “poke their finger in the eye” of the government’s satellite spymasters, Mr. Molczan said, taking no offense. “I have a sense of humor,” he said. Mr. Molczan, a private energy conservation consultant, is the best known of the satellite spotters who, needing little more than a pair of binoculars, a stop watch and star charts, uncover some of the deepest of the government’s expensive secrets and share them on the Internet. Thousands of people form the spotter community. Many look for historical relics of the early space age, working from publicly available orbital information. Others watch for phenomena like the distinctive flare of sunlight glinting off bright solar panels of some telephone satellites. Still others are drawn to the secretive world of spy satellites, with about a dozen hobbyists who do most of the observing, Mr. Molczan said. In the case of the mysterious satellite that is about to plunge back to earth, Mr. Molczan had an early sense of which one it was, identifying it as USA-193, which gave out shortly after reaching space in December 2006. It is said to have been built by the Lockheed Martin Corporation and operated by the secretive National Reconnaissance Office. Another hobbyist, John Locker of Britain, posted photos of the satellite on a Web site, galaxypix.com. John E. Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a private group in Alexandria, Va., that tracks military and space activities, said the hobbyists exemplified fundamental principles of openness and of the power of technology to change the game. “It has been an important demystification of these things,” Mr. Pike said, “because I think there is a tendency on the part of these agencies just to try to pretend that they don’t exist, and that nothing can be known about them.” But the spotters are also pursuing a thoroughly unusual pastime, one that calls for long hours outside, freezing in the winter and sweating in the summer, straining to see a moving light in the sky and hoping that a slip of the finger on the stopwatch does not delete an entire night’s work. And for the adept, there is math. Lots of math. “It’s somewhat time consuming and tedious,” Mr. Molczan said, acknowledging that the precise and methodical activities might seem, to the uninitiated, “a close approximation to work.” When a new spy satellite is launched, the hobbyists will collaborate on sightings around the world to determine its orbit, and even guess at its function, sharing their information through the e-mail network SeeSat-L, which can be found via the Web site satobs.org. From his 23rd-floor balcony, or the roof of his 32-floor building, Mr. Molzcan will peer through his binoculars at a point in the sky he expects the satellite to cross, which he locates with star charts. When the moving dot appears, he determines its direction and the distance it travels across the patch of sky over time, which he can use to calculate its speed. Mr. Molzcan declined a request to visit him in Toronto and to be photographed for this article, saying: “No offense intended, but this is beginning to sound like more of a human interest story than one about the substance of the hobby. My preference is for the latter. Also, I prefer not to have photos of myself published.” Mr. Locker, who favors a telescope for his camerawork, said that people like him and Mr. Molczan were not, as he put it, “nerdy buffs who lie on our backs and look into the sky and try to undermine governments.” Spotting, he said, is simply a hobby. “There are people who look at train timetables and go watch trains,” he said. People are drawn to what interests them, he said, and “it’s what draws people to any hobby.” While recent news coverage has focused on the current satellite’s threat to people when it falls from above, that threat is, statistically, very small. Even when the space shuttle Columbia broke up over Texas five years ago and rained debris over two states, no one on the ground was injured. Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council, noted that 328 satellites had come down in the past five years without injury to anyone. While Mr. Johndroe declined to divulge much about the current satellite aside from the fact that it carries no nuclear material, he said that the government would take responsibility in the remote chance of damage or injury. The government’s relationship with the hobbyists is not a comfortable one. Spokesmen for the National Reconnaissance Office have stated that they would prefer the hobbyists not publish their information, and suggest that foreign countries try to hide their activities when they know an eye in the sky will be passing overhead. The satellite spotters acknowledge that this may be so, though they doubt that such tactics are effective.

Officials said that they had no control over the nonfunctioning satellite and that it was unknown where the debris might land. “Appropriate government agencies are monitoring the situation,” Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement. “Numerous satellites over the years have come out of orbit and fallen harmlessly. We are looking at potential options to mitigate any possible damage this satellite may cause.” Specialists who follow spy satellite operations suspect it is an experimental imagery satellite built by Lockheed Martin and launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in December 2006 aboard a Delta II rocket. Shortly after the satellite reached orbit, ground controllers lost the ability to control it and were never able to regain communication. “It’s not necessarily dead, but deaf,” said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and an analyst of various government space programs. It is fairly common for satellites to drop out of orbit and enter Earth’s atmosphere, but most break up before they reach the surface, Mr. McDowell said. Such incidents occur every few months, and it is often difficult to control the satellite’s trajectory or its re-entry into the atmosphere. The debris, if any survives the fiery descent, typically lands in remote areas and causes little or no harm. “For the most part,” Mr. McDowell said, “re-entering space hardware isn’t a threat because so much of the Earth is empty. But one could say we’ve been lucky so far.” Of particular concern in this case, however, is that the debris from the satellite may include hydrazine fuel, which is typically used for rocket maneuvers in space. Much of the fuel on the experimental satellite may not have been used and, should the tank survive re-entry into the atmosphere, the remaining fuel would be hazardous to anyone on the ground. It is likely, however, that the tank may rupture on re-entry, and that the fuel would burn off in a fiery plume that would be visible to the naked eye. John E. Pike, the director of Globalsecurity.org in Alexandria, Va., said that if the satellite in question was a spy satellite, it was unlikely to have any kind of nuclear fuel, but that it could contain toxins, including beryllium, which is often used as a rigid frame for optical components. Since it was launched, the experimental satellite has been in a slowly decaying orbit. As of Jan. 22, it was moving in a circular orbit at about 275 kilometers above the Earth, Mr. McDowell said. In the last month, its orbit has declined by 15 to 20 kilometers. “If you plot the curve, it’s now just a matter of weeks before it falls out of orbit,” he said. The largest uncontrolled re-entry by a NASA spacecraft was that of Skylab, the 78-ton abandoned space station that fell from orbit in 1979.

The announcement  the first formal estimate of the financial effect of delays in the A400M program  proved to be a fresh blow to investor confidence in the company, which is still struggling to emerge from the upheaval wrought by last years A380 crisis. The stock slid nearly 4 percent in Paris trading, closing at 22.01 euros, down 0.8 euro. EADS said it expected to record additional expenses related to the delay of its four-engine A400M turboprop craft of 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion euros for the three months that ended Sept. 30. More than 1 billion euros of those cost overruns would be charged to the Airbus division, the company said. EADS has acknowledged since July that deliveries of the plane are at least six months behind schedule. Yet few analysts had expected the added costs to exceed 1 billion euros. Historically, cost overruns always seem to be bigger than you think, said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Evolution Securities in London. This is a surprise on the downside, but in reality nobody really knew what those costs would be. EADS admitted last month that slow progress in developing the A400Ms engines had forced Airbus to postpone deliveries of the plane to European governments by at least six months, with a risk of a further slippage of up to a half year. That means that the planes first customer, the French military, is unlikely to receive its first A400M before early 2010. EADS said its pretax profit forecast for 2007 of about 400 million euros would also have to be revised. The company said it would provide a revised estimate on Thursday, when it announces third-quarter results. An EADS spokesman declined to comment on whether the charges for the A400M would push the company into a full-year loss. Analysts said the news served as yet another reminder to investors that the process of developing new aircraft is often fraught with delays. The A380 superjumbo entered commercial service last month, two years behind schedule because of problems with the design and installation of electrical cabin wiring. Airbuss chief rival, Boeing, was recently forced to push back deliveries of its hot-selling 787 Dreamliner by six months because of snags in the assembly process. The A400M is a four-engine turboprop plane designed to replace the aging C-130 Hercules, made by Lockheed Martin, and the French-German C-160 Transall, which make up the bulk of European military transport aircraft. Airbus received its first order for the plane in 2003: a huge joint purchase of 180 planes from Germany, France, Spain, Britain, Turkey, Belgium and Luxembourg. The contract was structured so that the seven governments would pay a lump sum of 18 billion euros, meant to cover both the development and the production costs of the planes. The arrangement means that any cost overruns linked to the development of the plane will either have to be offset by more efficient production methods or come out of Airbus profit.

The problems with the electronics in the $640 million, 418-foot ship include design flaws and improper installation of cables for its classified communications systems, according to a written summary of a Coast Guard review of the program. When our communications systems are vulnerable to eavesdropping, I consider that a major problem, said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the Coast Guard. Coast Guard officials and executives at Lockheed Martin, the contractor responsible for the ship electronics, said the shortcomings are to be expected because they turned up in what they said was an unusually early inspection as the equipment was still being installed. This early check, they added, shows that the project managers had learned from earlier problems with the $24 billion fleet rebuilding program known as Deepwater. We want to make sure we are catching everything, said Troy Scully, a spokesman for Lockheed, which is building the ship in a partnership with Northrop Grumman. This is exactly why we test. Brendan McPherson, a Coast Guard spokesman, said officials had expected that the inspection would find flaws. It is almost impossible not to find problems because you are looking even before the work is done, he said, adding that before the ship is delivered, the Coast Guard fully expects our industry counterparts to meet their contractual obligations. The first ships produced by the Deepwater program  eight 123-foot patrol boats  were pulled from service late last year, after they suffered repeated hull cracks, mechanical problems and similar flaws in their electronics networks. The much larger and more expensive national security cutters are unlike any other vessel ever commissioned by the Coast Guard. With its millions of dollars of high-tech communications and surveillance equipment, the cutter is designed to go far beyond traditional agency missions like drug interdiction and off-shore patrols. It is supposed to be able to help prevent or respond to terror attacks and be ready, on short notice, to join Department of Defense convoys, which means its classified communications equipment is essential to its mission. An internal agency report late last month by Rear Adm. Ronald J. Rábago, the head of the Deepwater project, said there was a high probability that the ship, at the time of delivery, will be unable to process classified information because of the deficiencies. The problems with the electronics networks were first reported Wednesday on the Internet site of Wired magazine. The delivery date for the first national security cutter has already been pushed back from this past August to February 2008. The price tag for the ship is also now double the $322 million estimate first provided in 2002. Earlier this year, the Coast Guard announced that it would assume the lead role as project manager and reserve the right to put out to open bidding contracts for any new ships or aircraft that are built. The Coast Guard is also working on a plan to structurally reinforce the national security cutters hull, after determining that design flaws would probably mean that it would develop significant cracks long before reaching its planned 30-year service life. A report by the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security blamed the Coast Guard for not properly overseeing work by its contractors.

This early check, they added, shows that the project managers had learned from earlier problems with the $24 billion fleet rebuilding program known as Deepwater. We want to make sure we are catching everything, said Troy Scully, a spokesman for Lockheed, which is building the ship in a partnership with Northrop Grumman. This is exactly why we test. Brendan McPherson, a Coast Guard spokesman, said officials had expected that the inspection would find flaws. It is almost impossible not to find problems because you are looking even before the work is done, he said, adding that before the ship is delivered, the Coast Guard fully expects our industry counterparts to meet their contractual obligations. The first ships produced by the Deepwater program  eight 123-foot patrol boats  were pulled from service late last year, after they suffered repeated hull cracks, mechanical problems and similar flaws in their electronics networks. The much larger and more expensive national security cutters are unlike any other vessel ever commissioned by the Coast Guard. With its millions of dollars of high-tech communications and surveillance equipment, the cutter is designed to go far beyond traditional agency missions like drug interdiction and off-shore patrols. It is supposed to be able to help prevent or respond to terror attacks and be ready, on short notice, to join Department of Defense convoys, which means its classified communications equipment is essential to its mission. An internal agency report late last month by Rear Adm. Ronald J. Rábago, the head of the Deepwater project, said there was a high probability that the ship, at the time of delivery, will be unable to process classified information because of the deficiencies. The problems with the electronics networks were first reported Wednesday on the Internet site of Wired magazine. The delivery date for the first national security cutter has already been pushed back from this past August to February 2008. The price tag for the ship is also now double the $322 million estimate first provided in 2002. Earlier this year, the Coast Guard announced that it would assume the lead role as project manager and reserve the right to put out to open bidding contracts for any new ships or aircraft that are built. The Coast Guard is also working on a plan to structurally reinforce the national security cutters hull, after determining that design flaws would probably mean that it would develop significant cracks long before reaching its planned 30-year service life. A report by the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security blamed the Coast Guard for not properly overseeing work by its contractors.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/business/worldbusiness/31indiaarms.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Building a Modern Arsenal in India<date>Published: August 31, 2007</date><text>NEW DELHI, Aug. 30  India is developing a military appetite to match its growing economic power. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Dibyangshu Sarkar/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images Aircraft manufacturers readying their high-price wares for exhibition near Bangalore. Over the next five years, military analysts expect the country to spend as much as $40 billion on weapons procurement alone, more than its entire annual armaments budget today  upgrading systems as diverse as jet fighters, artillery, submarines and tanks in its largely Soviet-era arsenal. As a result, India will become one of the largest military markets in the world. For American contractors, which had been shut out of India for decades, the surge in demand comes just as relations between Washington and New Delhi reach a new level of warmth. In terms of potential for growth, India is our top market,  said Richard G. Kirkland, Lockheed Martins president for South Asia. But whether United States companies can turn that potential into profits will depend on more than warm relations between officials in their capitals; it will depend on how they finesse the particular challenges of the new market  especially, competition from their Russian counterparts. The stakes of the contest were underscored this week when the Indian defense ministry called for bids to fill an order for 126 fighter jets, a contract that could be worth $10.2 billion. Determined to build a domestic arms industry, India is requiring foreign suppliers to make a sizable portion of any military goods in this country. In the case of the jet fighter contract, the successful bidder must produce goods worth half the contracts value in India. So, the American companies have been busily pairing up with locals. So far, most partnerships are little more than agreements to collaborate on future projects. In February, Raytheon and the electronics division of the Indian giant Tata Power signed such an agreement. The same month, Boeing signed an accord with an Indian engineering firm, Larsen &amp; Toubro, to develop new projects. And Northrop Grumman has signed on with Bharat Electronics and Dynamatic Technologies, both of Bangalore, to investigate joint opportunities. The Americans interest in India goes beyond weapons. This country has booming markets in commercial aviation, shipping and infrastructure projects, which means opportunities for the logistics and security units of the big American contractors. Walter F. Doran, the president of Raytheon Asia, and a former commander of the Navys Pacific fleet, predicts that India may be one of our largest, if not our largest, growth partner over the next decade or so. The hefty increase in military spending reflects the countrys changing view of itself. India, like all aspiring nations, is seeking its place on the worlds stage, Adm. Sureesh Mehta, chief of staff of the Indian Navy, told thousands of white-suited officers at a naval conference in New Delhi in July. In particular, India is positioning itself as a policeman of nearby waterways, especially the Indian Ocean. A spokesman for the defense ministry, Sitanshu Kar, said: If you look at the rim from west Asia to Asia-Pacific, that entire area accounts for over 70 percent of the traffic of the petroleum products for the whole world. We have a role to play to ensure that these sea lanes are secure. An American carrier, the Trenton, which the Indian Navy bought and renamed the Jalashva, can, for example, carry 450 soldiers and half a dozen helicopters, and be used to evacuate Indian nationals, deliver aid or intervene in conflict areas. Yet India is virgin territory for American armaments makers. Decades of cold war-era distrust, when India aligned itself much of the time with the Soviet Union; followed by sanctions that President Clinton imposed after India tested nuclear weapons in 1998, made India a sort of no-go area for American companies. Under the Bush administration, sanctions have been lifted and military ties have deepened. In July, the two governments announced a commercial nuclear energy agreement. Under the accord, the United States will share nuclear technology with India, including fuel. The deal requires a radical, India-specific exception to American law and underscores the Bush administrations commitment, made two years ago, to help India become a major world power. But many arms industry analysts say that winning big orders in India will still be a challenge for Americans. In many cases, companies will be competing directly against Indias traditional supplier, Russia, which has manufacturing agreements in place and is still the largest supplier. Though relations unraveled after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they were repaired in the late 90s and the two countries are negotiating some $10 billion in contracts, including an Indian air defense system. The Russians are going to get quite a bit of this business, Andrew Brookes, an aerospace analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, predicted. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »NEW DELHI, Aug. 30  India is developing a military appetite to match its growing economic power.

But attending Brentwood Methodist Church in Nashville that night, Tony Thompson ran into the departing incumbent senator, Harlan Mathews, a Democrat. Mr. Mathews invited Tony to join him in a Nashville lobbying business, a job that would let him capitalize on his fathers new position. I dont just believe in the tooth fairy, Mr. Mathews said. A lot of people were seeking access  not necessarily unfair access, but seeking access  so Tony was employed in a number of areas where his father had made a reputation or his fathers advice or whatever was going to be valuable one of these days. Now the elder Mr. Thompson, who also worked as a lobbyist before and after his eight years in the Senate, is aiming for an even higher post, preparing a run for the Republican presidential nomination. In the folksy drawl that built him a lucrative sideline as a screen actor, Mr. Thompson is presenting himself as a reform-minded outsider taking on Washington, just as he did when he campaigned for the Senate as Ol Fred the real live country lawyer, and cruised Tennessee in a rented red pickup truck. But the lobbying work that Tony Thompson and another son, Daniel, did after their father won his Senate seat suggests how far the family has traveled from Fred Thompsons early career. Not only has he parlayed his own political background into a lobbying business  a fact his opponents have seized on to challenge his outsider image  but his sons have also made lobbying a family affair. Mr. Thompson and his advisers declined to comment. Although clients valued Tony Thompsons service because of the perception that he had access to his father, Mr. Mathews said, Senator Thompson was sensitive to the potential appearance of favoritism to his sons clients and sought to keep a distance. Rather than relying on his father, Tony Thompson relied mainly on political contacts in Tennessee he had made campaigning for his father, Mr. Mathews said. Tony Thompson said he lobbied mainly in Nashville and registered for only one Washington client, Lockheed Martin. He said he never lobbied the Senate or discussed clients with his father. Daniel Thompson was registered as a lobbyist only at the state level, where he worked as executive director of a statewide business group, the Tennessee Business Roundtable. He was later also a paid consultant to his fathers political action committee. Daniel, too, declined to comment. Paul C. Light, a professor of government at New York University who worked closely with Senator Thompson on campaign finance and ethics proposals, said that lobbying by a family member was an ugly practice no matter who the senator is, because it creates the appearance that his family is exploiting his stature and position. Mr. Thompson was hardly the only lawmaker with relatives in similar positions. As money pouring into lobbying firms has soared in recent years, many lawmakers have watched family members get into the business. But ethics experts say the case is all the more striking when the relatives, like Tony and Daniel Thompson, have scant qualifications other than their family ties. And the elder Mr. Thompson was one of the Senates most outspoken advocates of tighter ethics and campaign finance rules. Some groups whose interests and causes the elder Mr. Thompson supported in the Senate also hired his sons. In 1998, for example, Lockheed Martin hired Tony Thompson and his partner, Mr. Mathews, to lobby the federal government to maintain contracts to manage federal nuclear facilities in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Lockheed had been a major source of money for Mr. Thompsons Senate campaigns; around the same time he had hired a former Lockheed lobbyist, Powell A. Moore, as his chief of staff. In November that year, Mr. Thompson and Tennessees other senator, Bill Frist, invited Bill Richardson, then the energy secretary, for a tour of the facility to make the case for retaining Lockheed. The next month, Mr. Richardson deferred a decision about the fate of the contracts for 15 months. Secretary Richardson is to be commended for making a thoughtful decision, Mr. Thompson said at the time. 1 2 Next Page » E.

This required the countries to share sensitive technologies, invest large sums of money and act in the best interest of the group, not their own nation. The sums of money involved are staggering, and growing.

Government officials and defense experts said that the official, Mike McConnell, director of national intelligence, would cancel the next generation of a highly classified stealth satellite program, known publicly as the Misty system, because he had determined that the system was not worth the cost. Mr. McConnell said at an intelligence conference this week that he had decided to scrap a large intelligence program, joking that it was a way to flex his bureaucratic clout. The position of spy chief has long been criticized as lacking enough authority over the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies. Mr. McConnell gave no details about the program, but officials confirmed on Thursday that it was the Misty system, a satellite fleet built principally by Lockheed Martin. Spy agencies have long hoped to develop smaller, stealthier satellites in part because other nations are improving their capabilities to detect and destroy satellites. During a test in January, the Chinese government fired a medium-range missile from a mobile launcher and smashed a target satellite into more than 1,000 pieces. Some military experts said new technologies could one day make imagery satellites obsolete, a possible explanation for Mr. McConnell’s decision. Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a defense policy institute, said the Air Force was developing a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that could travel up to Mach 6. “An aircraft, assuming it could survive hostile airspace, would probably be the best way to do imagery,” Mr. Thompson said. “What the aircraft gives you is much closer proximity to the target.” The price of satellite programs, which are often plagued by mismanagement and cost overruns, has also become harder to justify in recent years as the Pentagon and spy agencies shift their focus from tracking large armies to hunting terrorists. Officials said Mr. McConnell made his decision after consulting the Pentagon, which had long advocated it. The program has also had detractors in Congress, including Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Because the budget is already being debated, Congressional officials said the White House could offer an amendment if the administration wanted to end financing. Alternately, Congress could cancel the program. John Pike, an expert on satellites at GlobalSecurity.org, a research group, said the Misty program had encountered problems in part because its satellites were far smaller than traditional satellites. The smaller size is designed to evade tracking systems better, but it is more difficult to fit with sophisticated imagery equipment. Mr. Pike said the cancellation suggested that Mr. McConnell was comfortable with other classified technologies designed to steal secrets from the sky. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs magazine, Mr. McConnell lamented the state of the American satellite industry, comparing it unfavorably with the way Europe builds cheaper systems faster. “By contrast, a U.S. spy satellite system, although admittedly more complex than a European equivalent, can take more than 10 years and cost billions of dollars to develop,” he wrote.

Government officials and defense experts said that the official, Mike McConnell, director of national intelligence, would cancel the next generation of a highly classified stealth satellite program, known publicly as the Misty system, because he had determined that the system was not worth the cost. Mr. McConnell said at an intelligence conference this week that he had decided to scrap a large intelligence program, joking that it was a way to flex his bureaucratic clout. The position of spy chief has long been criticized as lacking enough authority over the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies. Mr. McConnell gave no details about the program, but officials confirmed on Thursday that it was the Misty system, a satellite fleet built principally by Lockheed Martin. Spy agencies have long hoped to develop smaller, stealthier satellites in part because other nations are improving their capabilities to detect and destroy satellites. During a test in January, the Chinese government fired a medium-range missile from a mobile launcher and smashed a target satellite into more than 1,000 pieces. Some military experts said new technologies could one day make imagery satellites obsolete, a possible explanation for Mr. McConnell’s decision. Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a defense policy institute, said the Air Force was developing a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that could travel up to Mach 6. “An aircraft, assuming it could survive hostile airspace, would probably be the best way to do imagery,” Mr. Thompson said. “What the aircraft gives you is much closer proximity to the target.” The price of satellite programs, which are often plagued by mismanagement and cost overruns, has also become harder to justify in recent years as the Pentagon and spy agencies shift their focus from tracking large armies to hunting terrorists. Officials said Mr. McConnell made his decision after consulting the Pentagon, which had long advocated it. The program has also had detractors in Congress, including Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Because the budget is already being debated, Congressional officials said the White House could offer an amendment if the administration wanted to end financing. Alternately, Congress could cancel the program. John Pike, an expert on satellites at GlobalSecurity.org, a research group, said the Misty program had encountered problems in part because its satellites were far smaller than traditional satellites. The smaller size is designed to evade tracking systems better, but it is more difficult to fit with sophisticated imagery equipment. Mr. Pike said the cancellation suggested that Mr. McConnell was comfortable with other classified technologies designed to steal secrets from the sky. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs magazine, Mr. McConnell lamented the state of the American satellite industry, comparing it unfavorably with the way Europe builds cheaper systems faster. “By contrast, a U.S. spy satellite system, although admittedly more complex than a European equivalent, can take more than 10 years and cost billions of dollars to develop,” he wrote.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/business/25arms.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed First-Quarter Earnings Increase 17%<date>Published: April 25, 2007</date><text>BETHESDA, Md., April 24 (AP)  The Lockheed Martin Corporation said Tuesday that first-quarter earnings rose 17 percent because of higher sales at its technology unit and one-time gains. The company, which makes F-16 fighter jets, Patriot missiles and military information-technology systems, also raised its 2007 financial goals to reflect recent acquisitions, operational improvements and the first-quarter performance. Lockheed earned $690 million, or $1.60 a share, in the quarter, up from $591 million, or $1.34 a share, a year earlier. The latest results included gains totaling 21 cents a share from the sale of land holdings, the reversal of a legal settlement and a tax benefit. Excluding the gains, the earnings per share were better than the $1.37 expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Sales increased 1 percent to $9.28 billion but trailed Wall Street estimates of $9.57 billion. Investors focused on the sales miss, sending the companys shares down $2.25, to $94.82. A Prudential Securities analyst, Byron Callan, blamed the companys electronics systems for the lower sales figure. A 9 percent decline in space systems sales was expected after Lockheed changed its accounting for its launch business. Lockheeds information systems unit, which provides information technology systems for federal agencies, posted a sales gain of 9 percent, helped by acquisitions. Lockheed has acquired several information technology providers to expand its customer base beyond the Defense Department to other federal agencies.

Related Failure to Navigate: Security Effort by Coast Guard Is Falling Short (December 30, 2006) Failure to Navigate: Billions Later, Plan to Remake the Coast Guard Fleet Stumbles (December 9, 2006) The move by Adm. Thad W. Allen, the Coast Guard commandant, is a major embarrassment for the contractors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which had formed a partnership to oversee the delivery of 91 new ships and more than 240 new or rebuilt aircraft. All three major classes of ships that Lockheed and Northrop have worked on since winning the contract in 2002 have had serious problems. Admiral Allen said Tuesday that eight renovated 123-foot patrol boats were so unseaworthy they would be permanently retired. The setbacks have undermined earlier assertions that private contractors, not the government, are best suited to manage such a complex project. Lockheed and Northrop will still play a major role in the program, known as Deepwater, with the Coast Guard serving as what Admiral Allen described as the “system integrator.” The Coast Guard will no longer presume that Northrop and Lockheed, and subcontractors they hire, will be in charge of designing and building the new ships and planes under the 25-year program, Admiral Allen said. Instead, the Coast Guard will consider hiring the contractors directly and will play a much more substantial role in reviewing the design for each new class of ships and planes, he said. The Coast Guard also plans to hire outside experts to review the planned designs in an effort to identify flaws before the ships and planes are built. The Coast Guard will also now be in charge of maintaining the fleet once it is built. Admiral Allen said Deepwater had stumbled because the Coast Guard and its contractors put more emphasis on trying to honor a construction schedule than on worrying about the cost and performance of the ships being built. “We understand all too well what has been ailing us within Deepwater for the past five years,” he said Tuesday. “We’ve relied too much on contractors to do the work of government as a result of tightening budgets.” Margaret Mitchell-Jones, a spokeswoman for Integrated Coast Guard Systems, the partnership formed by Lockheed and Northrop, said she did not believe that the announcement by Admiral Allen represented a significant change in the relationship between the Coast Guard and the companies. The Coast Guard has always been in charge of the program, Ms. Mitchell-Jones said. “We look forward to continuing to build ships and aircraft, communication systems and to provide logistics support as determined by the Coast Guard," she said. The chairmen of the House and Senate subcommittees that oversee the Coast Guard praised the move by Admiral Allen. “Today, the Coast Guard has moved decisively to take back the helm of the Deepwater contract and to right this floundering procurement program,” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. Legislation had already been introduced in Congress to require the Coast Guard to take steps similar to those Admiral Allen announced Tuesday. Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said in a statement that she would continue to push for passage of the bill. “The Coast Guard can’t pick and choose elements from this bill and ignore others that many government reports have called essential,” Ms. Cantwell said. The announcement came a day before a hearing at which a House panel was scheduled to take testimony from officials involved in the failed patrol boat project. Michael DeKort, a former Lockheed system engineer on the 123-foot patrol boat project, will testify that he spent three years trying to get company officials to address serious flaws with electronics equipment that left the boats vulnerable to failure in bad weather. Soon after the first rebuilt patrol boats were launched, cracks formed in their decks and hulls, and then a series of mechanical problems appeared. The Coast Guard pulled the renovated ships from service late last year but has decided to permanently retire them because repairs would cost another $50 million, on top of the $100 million spent on renovations. Admiral Allen said the Coast Guard would seek to recoup some of the loss from the contractors.

Skip to next paragraph Related Failure to Navigate: Security Effort by Coast Guard Is Falling Short (December 30, 2006) Failure to Navigate: Billions Later, Plan to Remake the Coast Guard Fleet Stumbles (December 9, 2006) The deal that the Coast Guard pulled out of Wednesday, involving a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, is to develop a 120- to 160-foot “fast-response cutter,” which is to be armed with .50-caliber machine guns, travel at 28 knots or more and be suitable for tasks ranging from patrols of fishing lanes to military operations. Development of the cutter is part of the service’s $24 billion, 25-year modernization program, which is replacing or rebuilding most of the Coast Guard’s vessels, airplanes and helicopters. The program, called Deepwater, has already been hit with cost overruns and construction problems that have embarrassed the Coast Guard and stoked criticism from legislators. Adm. Thad Allen, the Coast Guard commandant, said the decision to end the joint-venture contract was made to “achieve the best value for taxpayers and the government” and provide the Coast Guard with the best possible equipment. The government can cancel or modify contracts far more easily than can parties to private contracts, and Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are not precluded from other roles in the Deepwater program. Margaret Mitchell-Jones, a spokeswoman for the contractors’ joint venture, said in a statement Wednesday night that the Coast Guard’s decision had always been an option under the terms of the original Deepwater contract. “We will continue to provide any support we can to our Coast Guard customer as they further refine their requirements moving forward,” she added. Rear Adm. Gary Blore, executive officer in charge of the Deepwater program, said the decision Wednesday was “about business” and reflected the service’s growing self-sufficiency in acquiring the equipment it needed without a middle design layer. Admiral Blore said the service would soon seek proposals for a proven patrol boat design that would require “minimal modifications” to meet Coast Guard needs. The first 12 fast-response cutters are expected to be delivered in the spring of 2010, the Coast Guard said. The service has been under increasing pressure from Capitol Hill as its efforts to remake itself have grown more expensive and been plagued by construction and mechanical problems. “We need a comprehensive fix for Deepwater’s problems before any more taxpayer dollars go down the drain,” Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said Wednesday. She is chairwoman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee that oversees the Coast Guard. The subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Senator Olympia J.

In a rare decision that could overturn Boeings victory, the G.A.O. said on Monday that the Air Force should reopen the competition, and, if Boeings bid no longer represents the best value to the government, the Air Force should terminate the contract. The G.A.O. said the Air Force had violated its own cost-analysis rules when it picked Boeing, and even said that Lockheed and Sikorsky should be reimbursed for their legal expenses in lodging the complaint. We promised to take a look at a number of things, and ultimately the cost evaluation pulled up short, said Michael R. Golden, a procurement lawyer in the G.A.O.s general counsels office. Its a large-dollar program. Its a major weapon system, and its a lot of helicopters. It is also a stunning reversal of fortune for Boeing, as well as an embarrassment for both the Air Force and the company. For years, the Air Force and Boeing have been accused of having a cozy relationship  so cozy that the two became enmeshed in a conflict-of-interest scandal that ended last year after Boeing lost billions in Pentagon contracts, paid over $600 million to the government in fines and top Boeing and Air Force officials were sent to prison. At the heart of the scandal was a former Air Force official who was found to have been steering billions of dollars in contracts to Boeing  some of them now being bid again  while negotiating for employment at Boeing for herself and her family. Some say the helicopter selection shows that little has changed in the relationship. By not enforcing the rules, the Air Force is showing an innate bias to one company, said Keith Ashdown, who wrote about the Air Force-Boeing scandal for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit group that follows government spending. The helicopter program is one of the Air Forces highest priorities, and the impression of a pro-Boeing bias was further reinforced last Wednesday when the secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, went before a Congressional committee and endorsed the Boeing helicopter. Id like to stay with what weve got and get this program going as fast as possible, said Mr. Wynne, when talking to reporters outside the committee room, according to Dow Jones Newswires. On top of that, the Air Force issued a statement after the G.A.O. decision saying it believed that it could comply with the intent of the opinion narrowly. The Air Force and Mr. Wynnes comments carry weight beyond the helicopter program, especially with an even bigger and more politically charged competition on the horizon. The Air Force is about to accept bids for a far more complex program  a potentially $100 billion program for a new fleet of aerial refueling tankers that was at the center of the scandal. A previous attempt by the Air Force to award the tanker contract to Boeing collapsed when members of Congress, mainly Senator John McCain, raised questions and it became clear that Boeing had the inside track  and a helping hand from a corrupt official. Now, two years later, the Air Force is taking up the tanker contract once gain. This time, it has pledged to play fair as it considers bids from Boeing and from a competing team using a tanker from Boeings archrival, Airbus, which is seeking to gain Pentagon business. Having just exited from a procurement scandal, the Air Force needs to look like it knows what it is doing, said Loren B. Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a military policy research group in northern Virginia. While the G.A.O. recommendation is nonbinding, it is rare that a government agency ignores its findings. Maj. Brenda Campbell, an Air Force spokeswoman, said she was unable to provide more clarification on what the Air Force meant when it said it would narrowly interpret the G.A.O. findings. The G.A.O. criticized only the financial analysis used to award Boeing the contract and did not comment on the relative merits of the different helicopters. The new rescue helicopters would not go into service until 2012. We have to map out where we go from here, Major Campbell said. Joseph LaMarca, a Boeing spokesman, said that the G.A.O. looked at many elements of the selection process and criticized only one aspect. He also said the company believed that the Boeing helicopter would still be picked when all is said and done. The losers are not so sure. Mr. Caires, the Lockheed spokesman, asserted that his companys helicopter, the US 101, would win in the end. We are confident, when fairly evaluated, the US 101 will be selected as the best choice and best value, he said. Sikorskys president, Jeffrey Pino, said in a statement that he has confidence his companys Superhawk, the successor to the current Pave Hawk, will prove to be the best platform for the Air Forces current and future needs. As for the Air Force, it says it just needs a combat search-and-rescue helicopter, and soon. We need a helicopter that will fly higher, farther and is a more defensive system, said Major Campbell. We fly in bad weather. We fly at night. We do things the other services wont do. More Articles in Business »When the Boeing Company won a $15 billion contract last November to provide the Air Force with the next generation of search-and-rescue helicopters, Boeing officials were not the only ones surprised.

The helicopter program is one of the Air Forces highest priorities, and the impression of a pro-Boeing bias was further reinforced last Wednesday when the secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, went before a Congressional committee and endorsed the Boeing helicopter. Id like to stay with what weve got and get this program going as fast as possible, said Mr. Wynne, when talking to reporters outside the committee room, according to Dow Jones Newswires. On top of that, the Air Force issued a statement after the G.A.O. decision saying it believed that it could comply with the intent of the opinion narrowly. The Air Force and Mr. Wynnes comments carry weight beyond the helicopter program, especially with an even bigger and more politically charged competition on the horizon. The Air Force is about to accept bids for a far more complex program  a potentially $100 billion program for a new fleet of aerial refueling tankers that was at the center of the scandal. A previous attempt by the Air Force to award the tanker contract to Boeing collapsed when members of Congress, mainly Senator John McCain, raised questions and it became clear that Boeing had the inside track  and a helping hand from a corrupt official. Now, two years later, the Air Force is taking up the tanker contract once gain. This time, it has pledged to play fair as it considers bids from Boeing and from a competing team using a tanker from Boeings archrival, Airbus, which is seeking to gain Pentagon business. Having just exited from a procurement scandal, the Air Force needs to look like it knows what it is doing, said Loren B. Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a military policy research group in northern Virginia. While the G.A.O. recommendation is nonbinding, it is rare that a government agency ignores its findings. Maj. Brenda Campbell, an Air Force spokeswoman, said she was unable to provide more clarification on what the Air Force meant when it said it would narrowly interpret the G.A.O. findings. The G.A.O. criticized only the financial analysis used to award Boeing the contract and did not comment on the relative merits of the different helicopters. The new rescue helicopters would not go into service until 2012. We have to map out where we go from here, Major Campbell said. Joseph LaMarca, a Boeing spokesman, said that the G.A.O. looked at many elements of the selection process and criticized only one aspect. He also said the company believed that the Boeing helicopter would still be picked when all is said and done. The losers are not so sure. Mr. Caires, the Lockheed spokesman, asserted that his companys helicopter, the US 101, would win in the end. We are confident, when fairly evaluated, the US 101 will be selected as the best choice and best value, he said. Sikorskys president, Jeffrey Pino, said in a statement that he has confidence his companys Superhawk, the successor to the current Pave Hawk, will prove to be the best platform for the Air Forces current and future needs. As for the Air Force, it says it just needs a combat search-and-rescue helicopter, and soon. We need a helicopter that will fly higher, farther and is a more defensive system, said Major Campbell. We fly in bad weather. We fly at night. We do things the other services wont do.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/washington/14coast.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Coast Guard Chief Announces Plans to Overhaul the Service<date>Published: February 14, 2007</date><text>WASHINGTON, Feb. 13  Acknowledging that the Coast Guard has failed to keep up with changing times, its commandant, Adm. Thad Allen, unveiled a plan Tuesday to restructure its management radically and expand its surveillance efforts along the nation’s coasts. Skip to next paragraph Threats &amp; ResponsesGo to Complete Coverage » Related Failure to Navigate: Billions Later, Plan to Remake the Coast Guard Fleet Stumbles (December 9, 2006) Failure to Navigate: Security Effort by Coast Guard Is Falling Short (December 30, 2006) The overhaul is intended to address mounting criticism of a $24 billion equipment program known as Deepwater, which is replacing or rebuilding most of the service’s large ships, planes and helicopters. But it is much broader, including revamping the way the Coast Guard manages its response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks, supervises its Atlantic and Pacific fleets, maintains its aircraft and ships and handles its payroll and financial systems. Some of Admiral Allen’s proposals could be felt by boat owners. He is advocating the mandatory use of devices like the automated identification beacons that are on large ships on smaller commercial fishing vessels and at least some pleasure boats. The plan reflects changes that have already taken place at the service since 2001 when it assumed a broader antiterrorism mission and has had its budget grow by 50 percent, to $8.6 billion this year. “We have been running some parts of the Coast Guard like a small business when we are a Fortune 500 company,” Admiral Allen said in a speech on Tuesday to several hundred Coast Guard officials. “We need to evolve with changing times.” Instead of operating separate Pacific and Atlantic fleets, Admiral Allen said, all 35,000 active duty Coast Guard personnel on the service’s nearly 250 large ships, 1,700 smaller boats, 200 aircraft and 750 shore-side units will now report to a single commander. A hundred-person operations group will coordinate how specially trained Coast Guard units respond to terror attacks, natural disasters, chemical or oil spills and its war-time assignments with the Department of Defense. A new deputy commandant for mission support will oversee the design, acquisition and construction of new ships and aircraft and the maintenance of the fleet once they are built, functions that are now managed separately. That will allow the Coast Guard to avoid giving so much authority for design and construction choices to contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which renovated the first eight trouble-plagued ships in the Deepwater program. The speech by Admiral Allen was in advance of the release of another scathing report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general on the Coast Guard’s management of its ship procurement program. The newest report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, confirmed safety complaints that had been filed by a former Lockheed employee, who was so frustrated that his observations had gone unheeded that he posted a Web video to detail them. The report says that as the former employee, Michael DeKort, had asserted, Coast Guard contractors installed hundreds of cables on 123-foot patrol boats that could cause toxic smoke if they caught fire. The ships are now out of service because of hull breaches. The contractors also installed electronics equipment that was prone to failure in open-sea conditions. Since 2001, the Coast Guard has become much more of an extension of the military, instead of a service that primarily focuses on safety, with law enforcement playing a secondary role. “This is not my father’s Coast Guard,” Admiral Allen said. “And my father is in the room.” Admiral Allen’s father, Clyde Allen, served in the Coast Guard and was in the hotel ballroom to hear his son’s speech. It will be several years before all the changes are made, officials said, but the plan won early praise Tuesday. James L. Hested, the former commanding officer of the Coast Guard yard, said the service needed to go on a bureaucrat diet. “You will have fewer fiefdoms,” Mr. Hested said. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the House panel that oversees Coast Guard operations, said he hoped that Admiral Allen had time to complete the work before his four-year tour of duty ended in 2010. “He has laid out for himself a very tall order,” said Mr. Cummings, who attended the speech. “But I think he can do it.” More Articles in Washington »WASHINGTON, Feb. 13  Acknowledging that the Coast Guard has failed to keep up with changing times, its commandant, Adm.

The report, by the Defense Acquisition University, does not explicitly recommend terminating the five-year-old deal with the contractors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. But it says that if the arrangement is extended  negotiations are already under way  it should be redrafted so that it is no longer presumed that Lockheed and Northrop will play dual roles as program manager and primary builder. The prime contractor should be directed to consider the products and services of companies other than those made by Lockheed and Northrop, said the report, a copy of which was given to The New York Times. The project, known as Deepwater, is running way over budget. At the same time, all four major classes of ships that are planned or are in production have had significant problems, the report notes. Under the current deal, the Coast Guard buys ships and planes from Lockheed and Northrop from a preset menu, with prices already negotiated. That approach should be discontinued, the report recommends, and instead, the Coast Guard should rely on a government run, full and open competition for purchases of at least some ships.

On the eve of Indias air show, which is held every two years, 52 American companies ranging from the largest contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Electric to smaller companies are showcasing their products and lobbying government officials. The five-day air show opens Wednesday in the suburbs of Bangalore, just as India and the United States are gradually relaxing policies governing military collaboration between the countries. There is no opportunity or market outside of India that is bigger than India for both commercial aircraft and defense products, said Mark Kronenberg, vice president for integrated defense systems for the Asia-Pacific region at Boeing. Boeing said it projected a market of $15 billion for its own products in India over the next 10 to 15 years. Mr. Kronenberg said this estimate was conservative. Boeing and its competitors are angling for potential orders that include 126 fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force, costing an estimated $11 billion; heavy-lift helicopters; carrier jet trainers; and anti-ship missiles. One of the hotly contested contracts will be for a combat aircraft that executives for the visiting companies said would entail the fiercest competition in the last 15 years. Boeing will go head-to-head with a rival American contractor, Lockheed Martin, along with French, Swedish and Russian competitors. As part of its marketing effort, Boeing has brought in two multirole combat F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft, a Chinook helicopter and the C-17 transport aircraft to show potential buyers. Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., brought one of its F-16 multirole combat aircraft and is also showing its P-3C surveillance aircraft and its strike missiles to the Indian military. We are tickled pink to be here, said Dennis D. Cavin, the vice president for international air and missile defense strategic initiatives at Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin will have the opportunity to showcase its F-16 combat jet on a flight this week. The pilot will be one of Indias best-known businessmen, Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group, an industrial conglomerate. Mr. Tata, who is a trained pilot, has been in the news lately after his steel company, Tata Steel, moved ahead last week with its acquisition of the Corus Group, a much larger British-Dutch steel maker. We look forward to putting him in the pilots seat, said Robert H. Trice, senior vice president for business development at Lockheed Martin. Lockheed said it was in the running to sell six C-130J Hercules transport planes to the Indian military, with the possibility of another six by the end of the year. The American contingent at the Bangalore air show this year is the largest ever and illustrates the dramatic ramp-up in their commitment to the Indian market, said Ron Somers, president of the Washington-based United States-India Business Council of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Over the years, Indias cool relations with the United States resulted in a conspicuous absence of American military products in its armed forces. Indias previous alignment with the former Soviet Union created a military weaponry dominated by Russian MIG jets, as well as French and British products. Other military contractors from Europe and South America are also vying for contracts at the air show. With the rush of foreign company executives to this city already known for expensive hotel rooms, Bangalore finds itself facing an acute shortage.

The plane was designed and assembled at a plant here during World War II by the Glenn L.

If the Mars returns, it will make a water landing on Chesapeake Bay, taxi into the Middle River and eventually be moved onto dry ground, where it will become the centerpiece of a small aviation museum at Martin State Airport. But the group, led by the Glenn L. Martin Maryland Aviation Museum, must first raise the money to buy the plane. It is one of two put up for sale in November by the TimberWest Forest Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia, which has been using them to fight forest fires. The prospect of returning the Mars to its birthplace has set off a scramble to raise money. In the first three weeks, $52,000 in donations came in, many from former factory workers who helped build the seaplanes. Its the mother of all acquisitions, said Stan Piet, archivist at the aviation museum, where the Mars would be exhibited. This plane is an icon. Mr. Piet said the Glenn L. Martin Company, now part of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, built seven Mars planes for the Navy beginning in the early 1940s. The Mars is the largest operational seaplane ever built, according to a museum flier, with a wingspan of 200 feet, wider than that of a standard Boeing 747. During World War II and the Korean War, the 10,000-horsepower Mars  with its 13,200-gallon fuel tank  transported supplies and wounded soldiers on long hauls over the Pacific. Over the years, three of the planes crashed, one was destroyed in a typhoon and one was scrapped. The remaining two planes are kept on Sproat Lake near Port Alberni on Vancouver Island. Steve Lorimer, a spokesman for TimberWest, said the company put them up for sale because of the enormous cost to maintain and operate them. They are expensive and are not a core part of our business, Mr. Lorimer said. The company has received about 20 inquiries and expects to complete the sale by late March, he said. Such a timetable motivates and intimidates the group at the aviation museum here. Competition for the Mars includes the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Fla., where Bob Rasmussen, the museums director, said he had met with a third party interested in buying a Mars and donating it to the museum. Members of the Maryland group are soliciting donations from individuals and businesses. The local government may donate money as well, said James T.

Sort of. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company, the world's biggest military contractor, said it would no longer pay its executives' annual fees at country or social clubs after Jan. 1. Nor will it pay for cars and drivers for personal use, tickets to sporting events and concerts, or financial advice and tax preparation. Executives hired after Jan. 1 will not be eligible for the ''postretirement'' death benefits promised to their predecessors, nor will they be reimbursed for initiation fees at country clubs. Don't worry. Lockheed Martin is not just putting coal in executives' stockings. In the filing, it said it would give raises to make up for the lost perks. The chairman and chief executive, Robert J.

A long-term modernization program to replace nearly all of the Coast Guards ships, planes and helicopters  begun four years ago in the wake of 9/11  is foundering while its projected costs are skyrocketing.

The misjudgments and slipshod work would be grist for slapstick comedy if the consequences, in cost and weakened defenses, were not so serious. As described by Mr. Lipton, the estimated costs of the project, known as Deepwater, have ballooned from $17 billion when it started in 2002 to $24 billion today. The plans call for 91 new ships, 124 small boats, 195 new or rebuilt helicopters and 49 unmanned aerial vehicles. But dont count on any of the new vehicles working.

In other cases, they might have put their own interests ahead of the nations, as when they adopted a risky hull material that had never been tried on a large American military ship but was pushed by Northrop, which had just opened a new plant to manufacture the hulls. No wonder the contractors are ducking for cover as the scandal reverberates, and are leaving all comment to the hapless Coast Guard.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Nicole LaCour Young for The New York Times The Bertholf, the first of the Coast Guards National Security Cutters. The lack of full disclosure about that and other problems in the Coast Guards $24 billion modernization effort, known as Deepwater, has created a credibility gap that some members of Congress say now jeopardizes the endeavor. The Coast Guard clearly does not understand that transparency and accountability are essential to a program of this magnitude, said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, the chairwoman of the Senate panel that oversees the services operations. Ms. Snowe and other Congressional leaders said they were unaware until this past week that the Coast Guards chief engineer, Rear Adm. Erroll Brown, had written in March 2004 to the Coast Guard official in charge of the Deepwater program, Rear Adm. Patrick M. Stillman, to warn him that the design for the National Security Cutter had significant flaws and that construction should not begin until they were addressed. Importantly, several of these problems compromise the safety and viability of the hull, possibly resulting in structural failure, said the letter, a copy of which was posted on The New York Times Web site last Saturday as part of reporting on the Deepwater project. Admiral Stillman, who has since resigned, declined to comment. Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, who heads the House panel that oversees the Coast Guard budget, said the lack of full disclosure was distressing. Withholding information leads to poor decisions for the nation, as we are witnessing now with this cutter modernization initiative, Mr. Rogers said. Coast Guard officials said Wednesday that they have tried to keep Congress fully informed about progress on the Deepwater project, which is replacing or rebuilding almost all of the services ships, planes and helicopters. The Coast Guard takes very seriously its obligation to keep its authorizers and appropriators informed, a spokesman, Cmdr. Jeffrey Carter, said. Representative Bob Filner, Democrat of California, said the shortcomings in the Deepwater program are so severe that the contract should be terminated. Two military contractors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, were hired in 2002 to design the ships, build them and oversee most of the other project details. This has now threatened our national security, said Mr. Filner, the ranking Democrat on the House panel that oversees the Coast Guard. After four years and billions of dollars, we have nothing to show for it. A spokeswoman for Lockheed and Northrop declined to comment. The uproar over the National Security Cutter follows the suspension of two earlier projects under the Deepwater modernization: a plan to renovate 49 of the Coast Guards 110-foot patrol boats, and construction of a new class of ship called the Fast Response Cutter. Details about the problems with the two earlier programs had been provided to Congress, but the leaders of the subcommittees that oversee the Coast Guard budget and operations said they should have also been informed, more than a year ago, that the design questions extended to the National Security Cutter. Construction of the first new National Security Cutter, a 425-foot vessel slated to be the flagship of the Coast Guard fleet, started in September 2004, before most of the issues identified by Admiral Brown were addressed, Coast Guard engineers said in interviews this month. The admiral has since retired. Unless structural modifications are made, the ship will be susceptible to buckling of its superstructure, premature cracks in its hull and decks, and, in an extreme case, the possible failure of the hull girder, which is a ships backbone, said Chris Cleary, a senior naval architect at the Coast Guard. An independent analysis by Navy engineers early this year has confirmed that the ship, as designed, may be susceptible to premature fatigue cracking, although top Coast Guard officials said they had been assured that the problems would not present a safety hazard for the ship, which is to start sailing next year. Coast Guard officials in the last year did tell some Congressional committees that the service was addressing contractual issues with Northrop that might require additional work to the first ship, staff members on the House and Senate committees said. During a June 2006 hearing on the Deepwater program, the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Thad Allen, briefly mentioned the difficulties, telling a House panel that there are some technical issues associated with the construction that we will address in subsequent hulls. The Coast Guard intends to reinforce the first two versions of the National Security Cutter and to change the design of the remaining six versions, a plan it notified Congress of last week. The service has not disclosed how much the repairs to the first two ships will cost or who will be responsible for the bill. Coast Guard leaders said in interviews that any new class of ship has design challenges that must be resolved. Given that the start of the National Security Cutter construction had already been planned in 2004  and that any delays would add to the ships cost  they decided to allow the first ship to be built, while continuing to investigate their engineers reports of design flaws.

At the end of four years with the military, Mr. Henriquez found work inspecting similar vehicles as they rolled off an assembly line at a General Motors of Canada plant in London, Ontario. That is, until he was laid off with 172 co-workers in 2002. Mr. Henriquez said G.M. had told them that the United States government, one of the plants major customers, had decided that their dual citizenship made them security risks. This summer, Mr. Henriquez, a citizen of both El Salvador and Canada, reached a confidential settlement with G.M. over his dismissal. But the case involving him ripples far beyond the London plant. Arms makers who export to the United States are in a squeeze, thanks to a complex set of State Department rules known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or ITAR. The unusually strict rules that govern who can work on military projects for the United States government are in stark conflict with Canadian laws against discrimination. The rule that tripped up Mr. Henriquez bans nationals of about 20 countries from working on Pentagon contracts  period  or having any access to related plans and materials. Not only does it complicate management-employee relations, it makes it hard for American military contractors to bid competitively on Canadas military expansion program, which is worth about 15 billion Canadian dollars ($13 billion). Next month, General Motors will face an Ontario Human Rights Tribunal hearing over some of the London plant layoffs. That is a reminder for G.M. that to meet State Department rules, foreign-based military contractors often have to break, or at least challenge, local human rights and employment laws. Mr. Henriquez, who left El Salvador in 1989 to escape civil strife, said he never imagined himself in a civil rights dispute in North America. Im Canadian enough to fight for my fellow citizens but not Canadian enough to work for G.M., said Mr. Henriquez, 47, a father of two who has since found work at an auto parts supplier. They cant step on our laws just because they create jobs. Patty Faith, a spokeswoman for General Motors of Canada, which sold the London factory to General Dynamics in 2003, declined to comment. Ken Yamashita, a spokesman for General Dynamics in Canada, which is under separate investigation by the Ontario Human Rights Commission because of more recent citizenship-related complaints from the plant, also declined to respond. The ITAR citizenship rules affect all of the United States allies, but the conflict with local laws has become most public in Canada. By industry estimates, about half of the countrys seven billion Canadian dollars in annual military production involves contracts from the United States. Officials from the State Department and Canadas departments of foreign affairs and defense said the two governments were discussing the problem, which senior Canadian politicians have raised with their American counterparts. While these officials would not provide any details about those negotiations, Elizabeth Hodges, a spokeswoman for Canadas Department of National Defense, said Canada regards discrimination against workers based on citizenship or country of origin as a violation of the countrys charter of rights and freedoms. Although her colleagues in areas like procurement are required to follow ITAR guidelines, Ms. Hodges said Canadas defense department would never discriminate against a worker to meet the United States rules. As a government department, absolutely not, she said. We are obliged to uphold the law. Nevertheless, Ms. Hodges acknowledged that stance had led to conflicts with the United States. She said such cases were handled individually. While she declined to offer any details about how they are resolved, Ms. Hodges said that we havent run into any absolute roadblocks to date. The main purpose of the ITAR is to keep American military technology out of the hands of hostile nations. Ms. Hodges said the rules had been enforced more vigorously since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

The initial venture  converting rusting 110-foot patrol boats, the workhorses of the Coast Guard, into more versatile 123-foot cutters  has been canceled after hull cracks and engine failures made the first eight boats unseaworthy. Plans to build a new class of 147-foot ships with an innovative hull have been halted after the design was found to be flawed. And the first completed new ship  a $564 million behemoth christened last month  has structural weaknesses that some Coast Guard engineers believe may threaten its safety and limit its life span, unless costly repairs are made. The problems have helped swell the costs of the fleet-building program to a projected $24 billion, from $17 billion, and delayed the arrival of any new ships or aircraft. That has compromised the Coast Guards ability to fulfill its mission, which greatly expanded after the 2001 attacks to include guarding the nations shores against terrorists. The service has been forced to cut back on patrols and, at times, ignore tips from other federal agencies about drug smugglers. The difficulties will only grow more acute in the next few years as old boats fail and replacements are not ready. Adm. Thad W. Allen, who took over as Coast Guard commandant in May, acknowledged that the program had been troubled and said that he had begun to address the problems. You will see changes shortly in the Coast Guard in our acquisition organization, Admiral Allen said. It will be significantly different than we have done in the past. The modernization effort was a bold experiment, called Deepwater, to build the equivalent of a modest navy  91 new ships, 124 small boats, 195 new or rebuilt helicopters and planes and 49 unmanned aerial vehicles. Instead of doing it piecemeal, the Coast Guard decided to package everything, in hopes that the fleet would be better integrated and its multibillion price would command attention from a Congress and White House traditionally more focused on other military branches. And instead of managing the project itself, the Coast Guard hired Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, two of the nations largest military contractors, to plan, supervise and deliver the new vessels and helicopters. Many retired Coast Guard officials, former company executives and government auditors fault that privatization model, saying it allowed the contractors at times to put their interests ahead of the Guards. This is the fleecing of America, said Anthony DArmiento, a systems engineer who has worked for Northrop and the Coast Guard on the project. It is the worst contract arrangement Ive seen in all my 20 plus years in naval engineering. Insufficient oversight by the Coast Guard resulted in the service buying some equipment it did not want and ignoring repeated warnings from its own engineers that the boats and ships were poorly designed and perhaps unsafe, the agency acknowledged. The Deepwater programs few Congressional skeptics were outmatched by lawmakers who became enthusiastic supporters, mobilized by an aggressive lobbying campaign financed by Lockheed and Northrop. And the contractors failed to fulfill their obligation to make sure the government got the best price, frequently steering work to their subsidiaries or business partners instead of competitors, according to government auditors and people affiliated with the program. Even some of the smaller Deepwater projects raise questions about management. The radios placed in small, open boats were not waterproof and immediately shorted out, for example. Electronics equipment costing millions of dollars is still being installed in the new cutter, even though it will be ripped out because the Coast Guard does not want it. An order of eight small, inflatable boats cost an extra half-million dollars because the purchase passed through four layers of contractors. 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page » Correction: February 7, 2007 An article on Dec. 9 about the problems of a Coast Guard modernization project called Deepwater and its management by the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin incorrectly described a campaign in mid-2005 by the Navy League, a nonprofit group, in support of the project. The organization wrote letters to lawmakers urging them to restore funds for the program; the group says it did not remind them that hundreds of contractors across the country were working as suppliers on the project. The error was pointed out by the Navy League shortly after the article appeared, and again on Jan. 2.

The service has been forced to cut back on patrols and, at times, ignore tips from other federal agencies about drug smugglers. The difficulties will only grow more acute in the next few years as old boats fail and replacements are not ready. Adm. Thad W. Allen, who took over as Coast Guard commandant in May, acknowledged that the program had been troubled and said that he had begun to address the problems. You will see changes shortly in the Coast Guard in our acquisition organization, Admiral Allen said. It will be significantly different than we have done in the past. The modernization effort was a bold experiment, called Deepwater, to build the equivalent of a modest navy  91 new ships, 124 small boats, 195 new or rebuilt helicopters and planes and 49 unmanned aerial vehicles. Instead of doing it piecemeal, the Coast Guard decided to package everything, in hopes that the fleet would be better integrated and its multibillion price would command attention from a Congress and White House traditionally more focused on other military branches. And instead of managing the project itself, the Coast Guard hired Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, two of the nations largest military contractors, to plan, supervise and deliver the new vessels and helicopters. Many retired Coast Guard officials, former company executives and government auditors fault that privatization model, saying it allowed the contractors at times to put their interests ahead of the Guards. This is the fleecing of America, said Anthony DArmiento, a systems engineer who has worked for Northrop and the Coast Guard on the project. It is the worst contract arrangement Ive seen in all my 20 plus years in naval engineering. Insufficient oversight by the Coast Guard resulted in the service buying some equipment it did not want and ignoring repeated warnings from its own engineers that the boats and ships were poorly designed and perhaps unsafe, the agency acknowledged. The Deepwater programs few Congressional skeptics were outmatched by lawmakers who became enthusiastic supporters, mobilized by an aggressive lobbying campaign financed by Lockheed and Northrop. And the contractors failed to fulfill their obligation to make sure the government got the best price, frequently steering work to their subsidiaries or business partners instead of competitors, according to government auditors and people affiliated with the program. Even some of the smaller Deepwater projects raise questions about management. The radios placed in small, open boats were not waterproof and immediately shorted out, for example. Electronics equipment costing millions of dollars is still being installed in the new cutter, even though it will be ripped out because the Coast Guard does not want it. An order of eight small, inflatable boats cost an extra half-million dollars because the purchase passed through four layers of contractors. 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page » Correction: February 7, 2007 An article on Dec. 9 about the problems of a Coast Guard modernization project called Deepwater and its management by the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin incorrectly described a campaign in mid-2005 by the Navy League, a nonprofit group, in support of the project. The organization wrote letters to lawmakers urging them to restore funds for the program; the group says it did not remind them that hundreds of contractors across the country were working as suppliers on the project. The error was pointed out by the Navy League shortly after the article appeared, and again on Jan. 2. This correction was delayed because those responsible initially decided no correction was warranted and were slow to follow up on additional complaints.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/washington/10brfs-BOEINGISAWAR_BRF.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Boeing Is Awarded Air Force Contract<date>Published: November 10, 2006</date><text>The Air Force awarded a lucrative contract for search-and-rescue combat helicopters to a team led by Boeing.

Both companies expected further strong growth in 2007 based on Congressional military spending priorities. Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., earned $629 million, or $1.46 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $427 million, or 96 cents a share, in the same period of 2005. Quarterly revenue rose 4 percent to $9.6 billion from $9.2 billion.

The one-time events added $71 million, or 16 cents a share, to the third-quarter results. The earnings surpassed the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial, who expected the company to make $1.24 a share excluding the one-time gains. Northrop Grumman, which is based in Los Angeles, reported that net income rose to $302 million, or 86 cents a share, from $293 million, or 81 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The latest period included a charge of $112.5 million, or 20 cents a share, related to a proposed legal settlement with the Justice Department. It also included a loss of 1 cent a share from discontinued operations. The results were in line with the expectations of analysts, who on average anticipated earnings of $1.07 a share, according to Thomson Financial. Analysts estimates typically exclude one-time charges. Revenue increased 2 percent, to $7.43 billion, from $7.29 billion in the year-ago period.

Advance applications are now being taken for Registered Traveler programs at four additional airports, including Kennedy Airport in New York. As many as 20 airports in all may set aside Registered Traveler lanes by the end of the year. There is nothing wrong with the overall goal of making security checks a bit easier and more predictable for business travelers and other frequent fliers. The airlines would be in truly dire straits if they stopped flying. But there are qualifications: It is imperative that registered travelers not be allowed to get by with less intense security screening. The expedited service should not be allowed to further inconvenience the ordinary traveler. And government money should not be used to subsidize the faster service. These are principles that the government itself has for the most part espoused. Travelers who want to take part in these programs would voluntarily submit personal information, allow fingerprints and iris scans to be taken, and pass a government background check. They would then be given cards identifying them as registered travelers eligible for fast-lane treatment. There was originally a widespread expectation that these certified-as-safe travelers would get less rigorous security screening. But on sober second thought, experts recognized that terrorist groups could easily qualify members with clean backgrounds as registered travelers. The screening of registered travelers must be identical to, or every bit as rigorous as, the screening accorded ordinary folk. At Orlando International Airport, a pilot program has been operated for the past year by a company founded by Steven Brill and working in collaboration with General Electric and Lockheed Martin. More than 27,000 people have signed up and paid fees of $79.95 a year, a measure of their frustration with long and uncertain waits in security lines. What they get in return is a designated lane that leads directly to one set of the airports metal detectors and X-ray scanners. In effect, Mr. Brills customers get preferred treatment similar to what some airlines in other major airports grant their first-class passengers or highest-mileage frequent fliers. The Orlando project claims registered travelers go through its lines and pass through airport screening machines in five minutes or less. Airport officials believe the program has reduced waiting times for regular passengers as well. The screening machines are operated by regular government-supervised inspectors, and the Transportation Security Administration has announced that it expects to levy a fee  probably $30 per enrollment  to cover its vetting and administrative costs. The government must keep monitoring to make sure it is charging enough. For the future, Mr. Brill hopes to gain government approval for new screening technologies that would let his customers keep their shoes and jackets on, thus eliminating the annoying and time-consuming ritual of removing the items for X-ray screening. That would be fine, as long as any approved technology his group develops could also be bought for the lines processing regular customers. Air travelers have long since become used to the fact that they receive different levels of service depending on how much they pay and how often they fly. If Mr. Brill or other entrepreneurs can find a business plan that allows them to make a profit by providing registered travelers with faster lines, without compromising security or adding to the inconvenience of other passengers, it would be a welcome development. But the best option would still be a broader program to improve screening for all passengers, thus rendering the designated fast lanes superfluous.

Before the announcement, many analysts had said the deal was the Boeing teams to lose. A leader in building unmanned rockets and spacecraft, Lockheed has little experience with human spaceflight; by contrast, Northrop, Boeing and their subsidiaries built not only the space shuttle fleet but the Apollo vehicles that took men to the moon in the 1960s and 70s. In a late-afternoon news conference to announce the decision, NASA was tight-lipped about the reasons, saying the details of the two competing bids were proprietary. Doug Cooke, a deputy associate administrator who led the selection team, said both proposals were sound and carefully prepared. Mr. Cooke said the Lockheed Martin design looked achievable, an indication that it relied more heavily on known technologies than developing new ones. This is a design that is based on known capabilities, he said. The NASA decision is likely to change the dynamics of the space business, setting Lockheed up to be the dominant player in space exploration and perhaps forcing Boeing to rethink its role. For both companies, this was a make-it-or-break-it award to stay in the manned space business, said Brett Lambert, managing director of the Densmore Group, an aerospace consulting firm, adding, This decision defines who will continue to be a major player in space for the next 10 years. The plan calls for building a space capsule with an emergency escape tower similar to the Apollo capsule that ferried men to and from the moon. Orion, though, would be much larger than Apollo. The NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, who did not speak at the news conference, has called the new ship Apollo on steroids. Orion is to carry up to six astronauts to the International Space Station; a later version would take four astronauts to the moon, where they would use a separate lander ship to reach the surface. Still later versions could serve as crew-return vehicles for ships that one day may take humans to Mars, NASA officials said. The shuttle fleet is to be retired in 2010. Orion is to make its first human flight by 2014, but at Congresss urging NASA hopes to fly at least a year earlier to minimize a gap in the nations ability to send people into space. The agency is also developing new booster rockets, based on space shuttle technology, to launch Orion and cargo to the moon. The rocket to launch Orion is set to make its first flight in 2009. The Orion contract calls for Lockheed Martin to get $3.9 billion through 2013 for designing, developing, testing and evaluating the new craft and building two for initial flights into space. A second stage, from 2009 to 2019, provides $3.5 billion for building an unspecified number of manned ships to go to the space station and the moon, and some cargo-only versions for supplying the station. The contract also includes $750 million for engineering work to modify or improve the ships. But some experts say that these numbers are conservative and that NASA projects typically run 50 percent above initial estimates, in part because there is little incentive to stay within budget once a contract has been awarded. Howard McCurdy, a space policy expert at American University in Washington, said that once Boeings subsidiary Rockwell got the contract to build the space shuttle, they had NASA over a barrel  they were like a monopoly supplier. This will be the first time that Lockheed has been given a lead role in manned space flight. It comes after the company failed in a 1996 attempt to design the X-33 space plane, which was to be a replacement for the quarter-century-old shuttle fleet but was abandoned because of technical problems after NASA spent more than $900 million on it.

And to head off Congressional criticism, Boeing also announced that it would not take the settlement as a tax deduction. Skip to next paragraph Maya Vidon/European Pressphoto Agency W. James McNerney Jr., chief executive of Boeing, is scheduled to appear before a Senate committee next week. Related Boeing Second-Quarter Results (pdf) The decision not to seek the tax deduction  even though the company maintained that it could  comes as Boeing is trying to improve its standing in Washington and as the companys chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., is to appear on Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee to face questions about the companys behavior. The $160 million loss, or 21 cents a share, came on revenue of $14.99 billion. In the second quarter of 2005, Boeing had earnings of $566 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $14.68 billion. The quarterly loss for 2006 reflects a $1.1 billion charge for the ethics settlement as well as $496 million for delays in a military surveillance program. Boeings shares fell by 4.6 percent, or $3.85, to close at $79.90 yesterday. Since becoming chief executive last year, Mr. McNerney has made ethics and integrity top priorities. Two previous chief executives resigned amid ethics scandals. Boeing agreed in May to pay $615 million to end a three-year investigation and avoid criminal charges over allegations that it had improperly acquired proprietary documents from its rival, Lockheed Martin, and illegally recruited a top Air Force weapons buyer who was overseeing Boeing contracts. Shortly after the government settlement was announced, it ran into sharp criticism from some prominent senators, who wrote to the Justice Department expressing concern that Boeing could use the settlement to reduce its tax bill. These senators included Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; John Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; and John McCain, an Arizona Republican and a longtime Boeing critic who is leading new investigations into weapons spending. Mr. McNerney, in a conference call yesterday, said that while the decision not to deduct the $615 million would be costly in the short run, it was an important long-term move to improve Boeings reputation and move the company in a new direction. Without question, the short-term impact of the tax issue is significant, Mr. McNerney said. However, the long-term value of Boeings reputation is even more significant. I feel strongly that the right thing for Boeing to do is not to seek tax deductibility for the settlement charges. Mr. McNerney added, Simply speaking, my intent is to focus on the future and put this behind us. Boeings decision was immediately hailed by Senator Grassley, who said that its good but who continued to criticize Justice Department lawyers who negotiated the Boeing settlement for being asleep at the switch. We cant depend on having klieg lights from Congress for the right thing to happen, Mr. Grassley said. In a letter sent this month to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, Mr. Grassley and the other two senators wrote that allowing Boeing to claim the settlement as a tax deduction would result in leaving the American taxpayer to effectively subsidize its misconduct. Loren Thompson, an industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research organization in Arlington, Va., that promotes free-market economics, said Boeing could afford to pass up the tax break because of a corporate turnaround that has strengthened the companys finances. Boeings strategy is to keep its nose to the grindstone and avoid anything that looks controversial and hope that the anger of Senator McCain will move on to other companies, Mr. Thompson said. Besides the government settlement payment, the other charge came because of delays in a $4 billion military surveillance aircraft program for Australia and Turkey. Known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, the program outfits Boeing 737-700s with advanced radar systems. The $1.1 billion write-off was somewhat offset by a strong performance by Boeings commercial aviation division, where profits rose by 51 percent, to $719 million on revenue of $7.11 billion. Boeing reported a record $142 billion backlog in orders, which represents 487 planes. One big hit is the companys coming 787 Dreamliner, a midsize fuel-efficient craft. So far it, has 364 orders from 25 air carriers, and is sold out until 2011. Orders have been so strong that Mr. McNerney said the company was even considering expanding its production plants. First deliveries of the plane are expected in the fall of 2008. On the military side, where Boeing is the No. 2 contractor after Lockheed Martin, revenues remained flat at $7.8 billion for the quarter, compared with the same quarter in 2005. Profits were $309 million, compared with $821 million in the second quarter of last year, as a result of the charges. In response to questions about the new Airbus A350 Extra Wide Bodyplane that was introduced at the Farnborough International Air Show last week to compete with Boeings 787 and 777, Mr. McNerney said: They seem to be trying to cover two of our planes with one plane, which is a tough putt. We dont see it has a plane that can compete with our 777, and its a little big and a little heavy to do the mission the 787 can do. So, in summary, theyve got a single plane trying to cover two of the most successful planes we have. More Articles in Business »The Boeing Company reported yesterday a $160 million loss in the second quarter resulting, in large part, from a $615 million settlement with the government over ethics charges.

I feel strongly that the right thing for Boeing to do is not to seek tax deductibility for the settlement charges. Mr. McNerney added, Simply speaking, my intent is to focus on the future and put this behind us. Boeings decision was immediately hailed by Senator Grassley, who said that its good but who continued to criticize Justice Department lawyers who negotiated the Boeing settlement for being asleep at the switch. We cant depend on having klieg lights from Congress for the right thing to happen, Mr. Grassley said. In a letter sent this month to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, Mr. Grassley and the other two senators wrote that allowing Boeing to claim the settlement as a tax deduction would result in leaving the American taxpayer to effectively subsidize its misconduct. Loren Thompson, an industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research organization in Arlington, Va., that promotes free-market economics, said Boeing could afford to pass up the tax break because of a corporate turnaround that has strengthened the companys finances. Boeings strategy is to keep its nose to the grindstone and avoid anything that looks controversial and hope that the anger of Senator McCain will move on to other companies, Mr. Thompson said. Besides the government settlement payment, the other charge came because of delays in a $4 billion military surveillance aircraft program for Australia and Turkey. Known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, the program outfits Boeing 737-700s with advanced radar systems. The $1.1 billion write-off was somewhat offset by a strong performance by Boeings commercial aviation division, where profits rose by 51 percent, to $719 million on revenue of $7.11 billion. Boeing reported a record $142 billion backlog in orders, which represents 487 planes. One big hit is the companys coming 787 Dreamliner, a midsize fuel-efficient craft. So far it, has 364 orders from 25 air carriers, and is sold out until 2011. Orders have been so strong that Mr. McNerney said the company was even considering expanding its production plants. First deliveries of the plane are expected in the fall of 2008. On the military side, where Boeing is the No. 2 contractor after Lockheed Martin, revenues remained flat at $7.8 billion for the quarter, compared with the same quarter in 2005. Profits were $309 million, compared with $821 million in the second quarter of last year, as a result of the charges. In response to questions about the new Airbus A350 Extra Wide Bodyplane that was introduced at the Farnborough International Air Show last week to compete with Boeings 787 and 777, Mr. McNerney said: They seem to be trying to cover two of our planes with one plane, which is a tough putt. We dont see it has a plane that can compete with our 777, and its a little big and a little heavy to do the mission the 787 can do. So, in summary, theyve got a single plane trying to cover two of the most successful planes we have.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/business/26arms.html?ref=lockheedmartincorporation">Lockheed Profit Up 26%<date>Published: July 26, 2006</date><text>The military contractor Lockheed Martin said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings increased 26 percent on higher sales of information technology and satellites, beating Wall Streets expectations and prompting the company to raise its outlook for the year.

Gonzales to express concern that Boeing may be allowed to take a tax deduction for a $615 million settlement reached last week with the government. The three senators  Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; John McCain of Arizona, a longtime critic of Boeing; and John W. Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee  said in the letter that allowing Boeing to deduct payments to settle government ethics charges "would be unacceptable." Boeing and the Justice Department reached an agreement on Friday in which the company agreed to pay $615 million to avoid criminal charges and settle claims arising from its improper hiring of a Pentagon official and its obtaining of proprietary documents from the Lockheed Martin Corporation relating to government rocket launchings. Allowing the Boeing settlement to be tax deductible, the senators said in the letter, would result in "leaving the American taxpayer to effectively subsidize its misconduct." "We are not interested in settlements that are designed to look good in newspapers, but fail to bring real accountability," the letter stated; a copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times. Mr. McCain first raised questions about Boeing's relationship with the Pentagon a couple of years ago. Hearings he called ultimately led to the cancellation of a $23 billion deal for aerial refueling tankers between Boeing and the Air Force as well as to the ethical investigations that resulted in the $615 million settlement, one of the largest ever imposed on a military contractor. A Boeing spokesman, Tim Neale, said the settlement with the Justice Department did not address the tax status of the payment. Mr. Neale said that $50 million of the settlement represented a penalty to resolve criminal charges and was not deductible. But, he said, the tax status of the remaining $565 million, which was to settle civil charges, was unclear. "We have outside tax counsel looking into this question," Mr. Neale said. "They are trying to determine the tax issues of the settlement. There is a question mark in our mind on how this should be treated for tax purposes and we are in the process of trying to determine the answer to that question." Boeing does not have insurance to cover the payment, Mr. Neale said. Mr. Grassley, in a statement, said he was "very troubled" that the Justice Department did not resolve the tax issue when it drafted the settlement. "If Boeing is able to deduct the settlement," Mr. Grassley said, "the real penalty to Boeing could be millions and millions less than advertised. If the Justice Department failed to take into account the tax implications of the $615 settlement, that's inexcusable." Penalties that corporations pay to settle government charges of wrongdoing are not tax deductible. But, portions of settlements that are classified as compensatory damages can be, according to Boeing and government lawyers. In addition, there are a variety of other ways that settlements could be classified for tax purposes to allow them to be deductible. The Justice Department would not comment on the senators' letter. The letter also asked that the agency provide an analysis of the tax treatment of the $615 million settlement. In addition, the senators said they might hold hearings on the issue, depending on the agency's response. Mr. McCain and Mr. Grassley had raised similar concerns about a $1.4 billion settlement in 2003 with several Wall Street firms involving biased reports by research departments. In that case, some of the settlement was tax deductible  for instance, $432.5 million that went to finance independent research as well as an $80 million investor education program. A Government Accountability Office study in September found that four large federal agencies, including the Justice Department, do not negotiate with companies over whether settlement payments are tax deductible. Instead, the G.A.O. said, the agencies generally said it was the role of the Internal Revenue Service to determine deductibility. Last week's settlement ended a three-year inquiry. One case involved the hiring of a former Air Force official who oversaw Boeing contracts at the Pentagon. The other case involved the theft of data from Lockheed and resulted in Boeing's being stripped of $1 billion in government rocket-launching business.

One exception, besides stock prices, was the dollar, which continued to lose value against other currencies  including China's yuan, which is all but pegged to the dollar. PRICE SURPRISE Just a day after a barometer of wholesale prices suggested that inflation was under control, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices jumped unexpectedly fast in April, led by clothing, medical costs and air fares, as well as energy. The Consumer Price Index leapt 0.6 percent, the biggest monthly rise since January, an increase from 0.4 percent in March and higher than analysts had expected. Without volatile food and energy costs, prices still rose 0.3 percent in the month. Since January, so-called core prices  which exclude food and energy  have risen at a 3 percent annual rate, faster than the 2.2 percent rise for all of last year. The Federal Reserve's open market committee has been raising interest rates for almost two years, seeking to curb inflation without stifling economic growth. After the Fed lifted its benchmark rate to 5 percent this month, some investors anticipated it might pause. That seems less likely now. Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet next at the end of June. HUNTER IS HUNTED Federal prosecutors charged a leading class-action securities law firm and two of its partners with illegally paying people to serve as plaintiffs in more than 150 lawsuits. A federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted the firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad &amp; Schulman, for racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. The charges are based on government accusations that the firm paid clients more than $11 million to be named in lawsuits, a practice that gave Milberg Weiss a better chance of being named lead counsel in class actions and reaping more in fees. Melvyn I. Weiss, one of the firm's co-founders, denied all of the charges, as did lawyers for the two partners who were indicted individually, David J. Bershad and Steven G. Schulman. The indictment could open the door to a class-action suit against Milberg Weiss or to the reconsideration of settlements made decades ago. RECORD FINE Seeking to resolve a pair of problems that had tarnished its reputation and endangered billions in federal contracts, Boeing agreed to pay a record $615 million in penalties to resolve a civil lawsuit and avoid a criminal indictment. In addition to paying a fine  the biggest ever levied on a military contractor, prosecutors said  Boeing agreed to "accept responsibility" for the actions of its employees in two widely publicized cases of corrupt practices. In the first, Boeing workers stole proprietary data from a rival, Lockheed Martin. In the other, Boeing agreed to hire an Air Force official who was still overseeing Boeing contracts at the Pentagon. J. Michael Luttig, a former judge on the United States Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., will succeed Douglas G. Bain as Boeing's general counsel in July. PATENT DEPENDING The Supreme Court unanimously agreed that inventors were entitled to benefit from their ingenuity even if they did not use their patented ideas themselves, but added that courts should not automatically handcuff companies that infringe those patents. In a widely anticipated ruling sought to clarify the rules of patent law, the justices told lower courts to reconsider the particular facts in this case before deciding if it should bar eBay from continuing to use the "Buy It Now" feature of its online auction business. The matter returns to the district court to decide whether this case warrants an injunction against eBay while it negotiates a licensing agreement with MercExchange. FUNGUS'S TOLL Bausch &amp; Lomb issued a worldwide recall for its ReNu With MoistureLoc cleaner for soft contact lenses after health officials in the United States linked the product to potentially blinding fungal infections. Bausch said it had no basis to think that the problems extended to other ReNu products, but skeptics said 19 of the 122 cases of infection had been linked to ReNu MultiUse  five times the rate for products from Alcon or Advanced Medical Optics, Bausch's main competitors. The controversy appears to have hurt Bausch's sales. FTN Midwest Securities estimated that Bausch's share of the domestic lens care market was 43 percent at the end of March, but had tumbled to 26 percent recently. Analysts said it was too soon to know what Bausch's legal liability could be, although numerous lawsuits have already been filed. RULES OF THE GAME As some Republican members of Congress introduced a bill to weaken audit rules adopted after a rush of corporate scandals earlier in the decade, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would begin applying the rules to more and smaller companies. The S.E.C. also moved to make the rules easier and less expensive to apply. The law, called the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after its principal sponsors, was passed after the Enron and WorldCom scandals. It established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to regulate the auditing profession, and it required corporate executives to report to shareholders on the adequacy of internal financial controls. Jurors in the trial of the two former Enron chief executives, Kenneth W. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, began deliberating about whether they defrauded investors by lying about Enron's financial condition. A verdict could come as early as next week. CHINA RISING The Chinese currency, the yuan, crept up in value by one-tenth of a percent against the dollar  a small change on its face, but symbolically huge because it meant that for the first time it took fewer than eight yuan to buy a dollar. China let its currency strengthen days after the United States Treasury stopped short of accusing China of manipulating the value of the currency. China has controlled the exchange rate of its currency since 1994, when it set the official rate at 8.7 to the dollar. Allowing the yuan to appreciate may help China keep inflation in check because it will make gasoline, diesel fuel and other commodities priced in dollars less expensive in yuan.

But to really patch up the broken border, President Bush is preparing to turn to a familiar administration partner: the nation's giant military contractors. Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, three of the largest, are among the companies that said they would submit bids within two weeks for a multibillion-dollar federal contract to build what the administration calls a "virtual fence" along the nation's land borders. Using some of the same high-priced, high-tech tools these companies have already put to work in Iraq and Afghanistan  like unmanned aerial vehicles, ground surveillance satellites and motion-detection video equipment  the military contractors are zeroing in on the rivers, deserts, mountains and settled areas that separate Mexico and Canada from the United States. It is a humbling acknowledgment that despite more than a decade of initiatives with macho-sounding names, like Operation Hold the Line in El Paso or Operation Gate Keeper in San Diego, the federal government has repeatedly failed on its own to gain control of the land borders. Through its Secure Border Initiative, the Bush administration intends to not simply buy an amalgam of high-tech equipment to help it patrol the borders  a tactic it has also already tried, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, with extremely limited success. It is also asking the contractors to devise and build a whole new border strategy that ties together the personnel, technology and physical barriers. "This is an unusual invitation," the deputy secretary of homeland security, Michael Jackson, told contractors this year at an industry briefing, just before the bidding period for this new contract started. "We're asking you to come back and tell us how to do our business." The effort comes as the Senate voted Wednesday to add hundreds of miles of fencing along the border with Mexico. The measure would also prohibit illegal immigrants convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors from any chance at citizenship. The high-tech plan being bid now has many skeptics, who say they have heard a similar refrain from the government before. "We've been presented with expensive proposals for elaborate border technology that eventually have proven to be ineffective and wasteful," Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, said at a hearing on the Secure Border Initiative program last month. "How is the S.B.I. not just another three-letter acronym for failure?" President Bush, among others, said he was convinced that the government could get it right this time. "We are launching the most technologically advanced border security initiative in American history," Mr. Bush said in his speech from the Oval Office on Monday. Under the initiative, the Department of Homeland Security and its Customs and Border Protection division will still be charged with patrolling the 6,000 miles of land borders. The equipment these Border Patrol agents use, how and when they are dispatched to spots along the border, where the agents assemble the captured immigrants, how they process them and transport them  all these steps will now be scripted by the winning contractor, who could earn an estimated $2 billion over the next three to six years on the Secure Border job. More Border Patrol agents are part of the answer. The Bush administration has committed to increasing the force from 11,500 to about 18,500 by the time the president leaves office in 2008. But simply spreading this army of agents out evenly along the border or extending fences in and around urban areas is not sufficient, officials said. "Boots on the ground is not really enough," Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Tuesday at a news conference that followed Mr. Bush's announcement to send as many as 6,000 National Guard troops to the border. The tools of modern warfare must be brought to bear. That means devices like the Tethered Aerostat Radar, a helium-filled airship made for the Air Force by Lockheed Martin that is twice the size of the Goodyear Blimp. Attached to the ground by a cable, the airship can hover overhead and automatically monitor any movement night or day. (One downside: it cannot operate in high winds.) 1 2Next Page » Correction: May 20, 2006 A front-page article on Thursday about a federal plan to use contractors to help secure the borders of the United States misstated the amount that Lockheed Martin made in federal government sales in 2005.

Through its Secure Border Initiative, the Bush administration intends to not simply buy an amalgam of high-tech equipment to help it patrol the borders  a tactic it has also already tried, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, with extremely limited success. It is also asking the contractors to devise and build a whole new border strategy that ties together the personnel, technology and physical barriers. "This is an unusual invitation," the deputy secretary of homeland security, Michael Jackson, told contractors this year at an industry briefing, just before the bidding period for this new contract started. "We're asking you to come back and tell us how to do our business." The effort comes as the Senate voted Wednesday to add hundreds of miles of fencing along the border with Mexico. The measure would also prohibit illegal immigrants convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors from any chance at citizenship. The high-tech plan being bid now has many skeptics, who say they have heard a similar refrain from the government before. "We've been presented with expensive proposals for elaborate border technology that eventually have proven to be ineffective and wasteful," Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, said at a hearing on the Secure Border Initiative program last month. "How is the S.B.I. not just another three-letter acronym for failure?" President Bush, among others, said he was convinced that the government could get it right this time. "We are launching the most technologically advanced border security initiative in American history," Mr. Bush said in his speech from the Oval Office on Monday. Under the initiative, the Department of Homeland Security and its Customs and Border Protection division will still be charged with patrolling the 6,000 miles of land borders. The equipment these Border Patrol agents use, how and when they are dispatched to spots along the border, where the agents assemble the captured immigrants, how they process them and transport them  all these steps will now be scripted by the winning contractor, who could earn an estimated $2 billion over the next three to six years on the Secure Border job. More Border Patrol agents are part of the answer. The Bush administration has committed to increasing the force from 11,500 to about 18,500 by the time the president leaves office in 2008. But simply spreading this army of agents out evenly along the border or extending fences in and around urban areas is not sufficient, officials said. "Boots on the ground is not really enough," Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Tuesday at a news conference that followed Mr. Bush's announcement to send as many as 6,000 National Guard troops to the border. The tools of modern warfare must be brought to bear. That means devices like the Tethered Aerostat Radar, a helium-filled airship made for the Air Force by Lockheed Martin that is twice the size of the Goodyear Blimp. Attached to the ground by a cable, the airship can hover overhead and automatically monitor any movement night or day. (One downside: it cannot operate in high winds.) 1 2Next Page » Correction: May 20, 2006 A front-page article on Thursday about a federal plan to use contractors to help secure the borders of the United States misstated the amount that Lockheed Martin made in federal government sales in 2005.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge this Image Olivier Laban-Mattei/Agence France-Presse {mdash} Getty Images W. James McNerney Jr., the chief executive, moved quickly to resolve civil and criminal cases against Boeing after he was hired last year. The agreement, which is expected to become final in a few weeks, would end a three-year investigation into wrongdoing by Boeing employees and would require the company to pay $565 million to cover civil claims and $50 million to end a criminal inquiry. Senior Justice Department officials, who asked on a telephone news conference not to be identified, said they believed this was the largest fine ever imposed on a military contractor. While avoiding criminal charges, Boeing will agree to "accept responsibility," the Justice officials said, for the actions of its employees. One case involved the theft of proprietary data from a rival, the Lockheed Martin Corporation. The other involved Boeing's hiring of a former Air Force official who oversaw Boeing contracts at the Pentagon. Boeing will also be monitored by the Justice Department for two years and be required to maintain a federal ethics and compliance program as well as to cooperate with federal investigators in any future investigations. Should Boeing violate these provisions, it could be prosecuted and fined up to $10 million, according to the settlement. "Boeing does accept responsibility for the actions of its employees," said the senior Justice Department official, who added that the $615 million figure reflected "money that was lost to the government due to Boeing's illicit activities." Boeing declined to comment, but said in a statement that "Boeing will accept responsibility for the conduct of its employees and make additional commitments regarding ongoing compliance." News of the settlement was first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. Analysts estimate that the settlement will depress Boeing's 2006 earnings by 59 cents to 75 cents a share, but say the agreement will lift a taint of corruption from Boeing and better position it to bid on Pentagon business. Boeing's stock, which had been rising for two years, closed at $85.86 yesterday, down $1.15. "This is a heck of a penalty," said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst with Jefferies &amp; Company. "But it has eliminated the 'bad citizenship' knock from being on the company. It pushes into the past things that were done in the past. And it gets rid of the uncertainty that a defense contractor could have been convicted of fraud or a felony." Settlement of the charges also reflects efforts by the chief executive of Boeing, W. James McNerney Jr., who was hired last year after the two previous Boeing chief executives resigned under fire. Mr. McNerney responded to the ethical controversies by reorganizing the company's military business, putting a new emphasis on training and pressing for a resolution of the investigations. "McNerney inherited a company in crisis," said Loren B. Thompson, a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area research group. "There was a danger that all these controversies would distract the company from getting business. His top goal was to eliminate these distractions. To announce that this controversy is behind them would be a major breakthrough." The settlement grew out of two investigations into the company. In one, Boeing employees were found to have stolen thousands of pages of proprietary documents from Lockheed in the late 1990's and used them to help bid for government rocket-launch business. To penalize the company, the Pentagon stripped Boeing of $1 billion in Pentagon rocket-launch business in 2004. In March, it was allowed to bid for rocket-launch business after a 20-month suspension, the longest for any major military contractor. In the other case, Boeing was found to have improperly recruited an Air Force contracting official, Darleen A. Druyun, while she was still at the Pentagon, where she was overseeing billions of dollars in Boeing business. Ms. Druyun later admitted to steering contracts to Boeing to help her get a job with the company. Ms. Druyun was fired from Boeing, and then pleaded guilty to conflict-of-interest charges and was sentenced to a nine-month prison term. Michael M. Sears, Boeing's former chief financial officer who had met with Ms. Druyun to recruit her, was also fired, and later jailed. Those scandals also led to the resignation of Philip M. Condit, then Boeing chief executive. His successor, Harry C. Stonecipher, was fired last year after an extramarital affair with a Boeing employee. Mr. McNerney has taken several steps to clean up the company. He allowed Boeing's in-house counsel, Douglas G. Bain, to make a blistering presentation to Boeing executives at a meeting in Orlando, Fla., this year about unethical behavior. He reorganized Boeing's military division to provide for greater accountability. He has brought in J. Michael Luttig, who resigned last week from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, based in Richmond, Va., to replace Mr. Bain, who is retiring. Mr. Luttig's name had surfaced as a possible candidate for the Supreme Court. In addition, the Boeing board recently altered the company's executive compensation plan to put more emphasis on ethical behavior. "One by one, McNerney has addressed all the issues getting in the way of running the company smoothly," Mr. Thompson of the Lexington Institute said.

Northrop Grumman reported that its quarterly profit fell amid delays at its shipyards. Lockheed, the nation's largest military contractor, said profit rose 60 percent, to $591 million, on sales of government satellites and computer systems. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have driven up demand for military contractors' communications, computer, satellite and maintenance services. "We've got a very high tempo of activity related to the war on terror, and that requires a lot of support and services," said Peter Arment of JSA Research in Newport, R.I. Lockheed's profit increased to $1.34 a share, from 83 cents a share, or $369 million, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 8.6 percent, to $9.21 billion, helped by asset sales. The profit beat analysts' forecasts. The company, which is based in Bethesda, Md., raised its full-year profit forecast to $4.65 to $4.85 a share, from $4.50 to $4.75. The company, however, raised its forecast less than some investors had anticipated, and Lockheed shares declined $1.39, or 1.8 percent, to close at $76.20. Northrop Grumman, the world's largest warship builder, said profit fell 12 percent as damage from Hurricane Katrina led to more delays at its shipyards off the Gulf of Mexico. Net income fell to $358 million, or $1.02 a share, from $409 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. Overall sales dropped 3.6 percent, to $7.18 billion, with sales at the ship unit declining 25 percent, to $1.13 billion, Northrop said. Operating profit declined to $68 million, from $107 million, because of delays and cost increases from the hurricane. Northrop's aerospace group posted the largest revenue gain of the quarter, rising 6.6 percent, to $2.29 billion, on increased sales of E-2C Advanced Hawkeye surveillance aircraft. Operating profit gained 5.3 percent, to $220 million. Northrop shares fell $2.17, or 3 percent, to close at $69.06.

Skip to next paragraph David Maxwell for The New York Times Robert Rist, left, and Brian Martin with the prototype of their airship. "Maybe it's because I've lived in Akron my whole life," said Mr. Eskesen, 23, "but I'm just really into dirigibles." People in Akron love blimps. They love the enormousness of them, the way the huge sacks of helium, shaped like brine-fattened pickles, float gracefully through the air. "When I was 7 years old, I remember everyone running into the backyard and yelling, 'Look at the blimps!' " said Joe Meister, 64, a lifelong resident. "Every time you saw a blimp it was something special." Akron may be the only place in the world where the fate of the city and the fate of airships are so intertwined. America's blimp industry was born here, and the city and the industry peaked in the 1920's, when Akron was an unchallenged manufacturing power and blimps were the transport of the future. But the passenger blimp industry died May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg exploded over Lakehurst, N.J. And Akron watched its major tire and rubber plants close starting in the 1980's. The Goodyear company faltered, but its three-blimp fleet remains on the outskirts of Akron in an oversized metal shed. "We don't make tires in Akron anymore, we don't make toys in Akron anymore," said Joe Huber, who worked on blimp projects at Lockheed Martin here for 42 years. "But the blimps never left." The city's underdog status became part of its humor, its fashion and its art. Mr. Eskesen has a tattoo of a blimp on his left bicep. His friends thought it was so cool they made it the logo for their company, Rubber City Clothing, which prints Akron-themed T-shirts. One top-selling shirt reads "Big Blimpin." On another, a blimp looms above the Akron skyline beside the words "Bright Lights, Blimp City." "The blimp is Akron's Empire State Building," Mr. Eskesen said. "It's something we can claim as our own." The Akron punk band CD Truth recorded the song "We Got the Blimp" in 1998. "You think your city's better because you've got art, maybe a Picasso?" goes one lyric. "Well, we got the blimp." Akronites have always dreamed of proving their city and their blimps to a skeptical world. "Someday, all communications will go through blimps," said Dave Osterland, a member of the city's Lighter Than Air Society. "Everyone will look back and wonder why we ever bothered with cellphone towers." Six years ago, Robert Rist sketched his blimp-inspired dream on a dry-erase board and showed it to his friend Brian Martin. Half blimp, half airplane, it would be three football fields long, able to carry M1 tanks in a cargo hold larger than a basketball court. "I know, that sounds ridiculously enormous," Mr. Martin, 32, said. Mr. Rist, 45, and Mr. Martin quit their jobs fixing computers at nearby Mount Union College. They raised half a million dollars, mostly from friends. They erected a hangar beside a grass airstrip 30 miles southeast of Akron and started work. Mr. Rist and Mr. Martin get a little touchy when someone calls their project a blimp. "This is absolutely not a blimp," said Mr. Martin, whose mother used to herd him into the family station wagon to chase blimps whenever one flew over his childhood home. "It's the world's first practical airship." The prototype is 120 feet long and weighs as much as a Honda Civic. Its translucent skin is made of ship sails held together with clear tape and Velcro. This spring, Mr. Rist and Mr. Martin will drag it outside, attach the wings, and try their first test flight. Mr. Rist and Mr. Martin work through the winter in their unheated hut. "To us, this is really obvious," Mr. Martin said. "Within 10 years, these vehicles will be as common as automobiles." Lockheed Martin has a similarly audacious airship under way. In December, the company won a $149 million contract from the Space and Missile Defense Command of the Army to build a High Altitude Airship, 25 times larger than the Goodyear blimp. "At first I thought it was the dumbest thing I ever heard of," said Mayor Donald L. Plusquellic of Akron. But the mayor soon became a supporter when he learned the ships would conduct surveillance from 12 miles above earth, out of range of most missiles Lockheed Martin won the contract largely because it owns the Akron Airdock, built in 1929 and still the largest hangar in the country. It also convened the Council of Legends, 12 Akron men with decades of blimp experience, to consult with Lockheed engineers on the airship project. "We want to honor them," said Ron Browning, the program's business development director. "Being able to talk to people who have experience with a vehicle of this size is really unique." The airship's first flight is scheduled for 2009, late at night, when winds are calmest. "Even if it's 3 o'clock in the morning, thousands of people will be standing at the gate, waiting for a glimpse of that airship," said Mr. Huber. "Akron is synonymous with blimps. We're very optimistic."
