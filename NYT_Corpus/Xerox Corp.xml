What were some early lessons for you? A. I come from a family of nine kids — six boys and three girls. Because it was a large family, we didn’t have a lot. One of the things that we did every Christmas was that my parents would say we had to earn our Christmas money. And so they were the venture capitalists.  They’d give us $5, and then we would go buy wholesale wrapping paper and take orders and resell them and turn that $5 into $25.    It was a great thing, because you learned about customers, learned about keeping your word, getting the orders delivered on time.  Q. What about your first kind of formal management role?  A. We worked for my parents, and I did kind of supervisory things there, and then worked for the company that bought my parents’ business and actually ended up running that business.    Q. What was the company? A. My parents started a computer business back in the ’60s and grew that into a nice little regional business.  There’s a story behind that. Earlier, my mother worked for the phone company and worked at night, and she had a baby daughter, her seventh child — her name was Nancy. When she was four months old, her heart stopped. And I was 10 years old. I grabbed her and went to my brother, who was 12, and we got her to this clinic and they got her heart started again.  But she had a lot of brain damage from that, so she had to have somebody taking care of her and feeding her all of the time. [She died at 13 from cardiac arrest.]   My mother wanted to work, but she needed to be at home, and so she leased a key punch machine, put it in my sister’s bedroom and started to do data entry, and that’s where many of the principles that we operate on today were formed — how to compensate people, data controls and process control.  All the kids in our family learned data-entry key punching in my sister’s bedroom, literally at my mom’s knee.  We grew up on a computer farm, as my parents called it, because it was back in the ’60s and it was one of those rare moments when, as key punch machines evolved into computers and our business grew, we were able to associate with these brilliant people from M.I.T. and Harvard . It was a wonderful education.  Q. You mentioned that you ran your parents’ business after it was sold. How old were you, and how many employees did you have? A. I was 27, and we had close to 1,000.  Q. How did you handle that big leap into management? A. You know, I just used a lot of the stuff we really kind of formulated back in my sister’s bedroom.  We eventually had a key punch machine in each of our bedrooms, so the trick question was, well, how do you pay the kids?  Because if you pay hourly, you’re going to have to have a lot of verification and that kind of thing.  So they came up with an incentive system that was essentially self-policing.  I believe that a really important management principle is that if you get the incentives aligned, people will motivate themselves far better than you’ll ever motivate them. But, again, you have to get the incentives right.    Q. Just the financial incentives?  A. It’s not only financial.  It’s being able to feel like they have a level of control over their destiny, that they are valued in what they do, that they’re being successful, that they’re contributing.  Those things are actually probably more important than the money.  But you’ve got to get the money right, too.    Q. So how did it work in your house with the key punch machines? A. I was terrible. I’ve never been a good typist. But all my brothers and one of my sisters were exceptional.  So my brothers resented me for getting paid the same as they did even though they did three times as much. Pretty soon my mom and dad both said: “Well, we have to make this more fair. We have to tie it more to what you do.” And because it’s a computer, it can provide all the evidence of the work — productivity and quality — that’s accomplished.  What happened with that incentive program was that I learned very quickly that that was not for me. I was never going to make any money doing that job. And so this notion of self-nominating is crucial in management. If you can get a person to self-select, that’s a lot better than a supervisor having to come and say “You know, Lynn, you’re just not good.”  1 2 Next Page »This interview with Lynn Blodgett, president and C.E.O. of ACS, a Xerox company, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/business/at-xerox-profit-jumps-28.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">At Xerox, Profit Jumps 28%<date>Published: October 25, 2011</date><text>The Xerox Corporation on Tuesday posted a 28 percent surge in profit for its third quarter, after winning more long-term deals to provide business services to companies, affirming a strategic shift and easing investors’ fears about a slowing European economy.Signings for services — or estimated future revenue from contracts signed during the period — rose 33 percent, to $3.9 billion. Wall Street has been urging Xerox to expand more aggressively in services for companies, like managing payrolls and performing data analytics. To that end, it bought the business outsourcing company ACS last year for $6.4 billion — the biggest takeover in Xerox’s 105-year history. The services market offers stability to offset a more volatile copier and printer business that, while profitable, is struggling to grow as companies worldwide tighten their budgets. Once known for its office copiers, Xerox now makes just 45 percent of its revenue from such products, and that area is growing more slowly than Xerox’s services business. Xerox reported earnings of 22 cents a share, up from 17 cents a year earlier, with net income of $320 million, up from $250 million. Adjusting for various charges, Xerox said it earned 26 cents a share, beating analysts’ average forecast by a penny. Total revenue rose 3 percent, to $5.58 billion, slightly ahead of estimates of $5.57 billion. Xerox said it now expects fourth-quarter earnings of 32 to 35 cents a share, in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters. It projected full-year earnings of $1.08 to $1.11 a share, also in the range of forecasts. The company, which manages the E-ZPass electronic tolling system in several states, is signing more business that provides recurring revenue.The Xerox Corporation on Tuesday posted a 28 percent surge in profit for its third quarter, after winning more long-term deals to provide business services to companies, affirming a strategic shift and easing investors’ fears about a slowing European economy.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/business/22xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Xerox Reports Rise in Profit and Revenue<date>Published: April 21, 2011</date><text>The Xerox Corporation swung to a first-quarter profit on Thursday as revenue climbed and the company cut costs related to its acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services.Net income was $281 million, or 19 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $42 million, or 4 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding some costs, profit was 23 cents a share. Analysts estimated 21 cents on average. Sales climbed 16 percent, to $5.47 billion, led by services, which gained 27 percent. Sales from equipment and supplies was little changed, which may have disappointed some investors, said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “It’s uninspiring,” Mr. Bachman said. “It’s a reasonable report, but it doesn’t give anybody a reason to go out and buy the stock.” Shares of Xerox fell 63 cents, or 5.81 percent, to $10.22. The company, based in Norwalk, Conn., has been reducing costs, including 5,000 job cuts last year, as it integrates Affiliated Computer Services. The company may save more than $375 million in three years as a result of the takeover, Xerox has said. Xerox said profit this quarter, excluding some costs, will be 23 cents to 26 cents a share, a larger range than the company typically gives for its quarterly forecasts as it assesses its business in Japan. That compares with analysts’ estimates of 25 cents. The company, whose Fuji Xerox joint venture manufactures and distributes copiers and printers for Japan, China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, said it expects last month’s earthquake in Japan to affect its equity income this quarter and the third quarter. While Fuji Xerox factories were not damaged, several of its suppliers were affected by the earthquake, the chief executive, Ursula M. Burns, said. The company is making alternate plans for supplies and expects to have increased supply chain costs, she said.The Xerox Corporation swung to a first-quarter profit on Thursday as revenue climbed and the company cut costs related to its acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/business/23gundlach.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Robert W. Gundlach, Inventor at Xerox, Dies at 84<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>Robert W. Gundlach, a prodigious inventor who played a crucial role in developing the technology that made Xerox synonymous with photocopying, died on Aug. 18 in Rochester, N.Y. He was 84.His son Eric R. Gundlach confirmed his death. The cause was aspiration pneumonia. Mr. Gundlach was a 26-year-old physicist in 1952 when he joined the Haloid Company, the business that would become Xerox. There, he worked with Chester Carlson, known as the inventor of xerography, the basic technology behind photocopying. In his first year on the job, Mr. Gundlach produced three inventions that garnered patents, including an innovation in offset duplicating that had evaded a team of other scientists for several years. By 1959, in part because of Mr. Gundlach’s research, Haloid Xerox unleashed what it billed as the world’s first automatic plain-paper copier. By the time he retired from the company in 1995, Mr. Gundlach had 155 patents to his name on behalf of Xerox. His final contribution was an inkjet process that produced glossy images akin to a photograph on plain paper. Mr. Gundlach’s inventions earned him a trove of professional distinctions, particularly induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2005. In 1966, Xerox selected him as its first research fellow, the highest nonmanagerial post occupied by a company scientist. In 1994, Mr. Gundlach was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. Born in Buffalo on Sept. 7, 1926, Robert W. Gundlach was the youngest of three boys. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Buffalo in 1949, then pursued graduate studies there. Besides his son Eric, Mr. Gundlach is survived by his wife of 60 years, Audrey B. Gundlach; his brother, Arthur Gundlach; two sons, Gregory E. Gundlach and Kurt B. Gundlach; and 10 grandchildren. Though inventing filled his working hours, Mr. Gundlach was enthralled with canoeing, hiking, skiing — activities he pursued avidly most of his lifetime. When he was in his 50s, feeling the need for a new hobby, he took up windsurfing. He also made sure to be home from work in time to play ball or build a bicycle jump, his children recalled. “He had what we would call today a work-life balance,” said Eric Gundlach. “He was the kind of man who left work behind.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/technology/24xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Helped by Acquisition, Xerox Posts Revenue Growth<date>Published: April 23, 2010</date><text>The Xerox Corporation posted its first quarter of revenue growth in more than a year on Friday, helped by its foray into the services business and an upswing in corporate spending on printer and copier supplies. The company also offered a second-quarter earnings forecast that topped Wall Street expectations. Shares of Xerox rose 87 cents, or 8.3 percent, Friday to close at $11.32, after hitting a new 52-week high of $11.72 earlier in the day. The results came about 10 weeks after Xerox closed its $6.4 billion acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services and provided more evidence that companies were increasing spending as the recession eases. Xerox posted a loss of $42 million, or 4 cents a share, for the first three months of the year, compared with a profit of $42 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings were dragged down in the most recent quarter by one-time expenses related to layoffs and the acquisition of A.C.S. Excluding one-time costs, however, Xerox said it earned 18 cents a share, beating the average forecast from analysts of 13 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 33 percent to $4.7 billion, primarily because of the A.C.S. acquisition. Had the deal gone through a year ago, revenue would be up 5 percent, Xerox said. The increase in revenue came mainly from the addition of the A.C.S. business-outsourcing segment, which takes on back-office functions for other companies. Xerox was already doing some outsourcing, handling the flow of documents and printer systems for other companies. But the acquisition helped Xerox more than double its first-quarter services revenue. Had the deal gone through last year, services revenue would have been up 3 percent to $1.8 billion. Sales of copier and printer supplies also picked up as corporate spending rebounded from the depths of the recession last year, climbing 15 percent.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/business/31xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Mulcahy to Retire From Board of Xerox<date>Published: March 30, 2010</date><text>NORWALK, Conn.

They worked together closely for years and built what both call a true partnership. HUNDREDS of Xerox sales reps have flown here from around the country for an annual pump-up-the-troops meeting. The main attraction during a marathon day is a face both familiar and new: Ursula Burns. She’s an old friend to many of them, and there are plenty of hugs to go around for the people she’s grown up with during her 30 years at the company. But there is also a new distance, a new curiosity about what she will do, given that she is no longer just Ursula. She is Ursula M. Burns, the C.E.O. And even though she became chief executive in July, taking the baton from Anne M. Mulcahy, she has been keeping a low profile, spending months working on the details of a huge Xerox bet, the $6.4 billion acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services, an outsourcing company. So her speeches and drop-ins on breakout sessions here are a mix of state-of-the-union messages and coming-out parties. At a meeting with some high-potential managers, she’s asked about the legacy she hopes to leave at Xerox. “It’s all about growth,” she says. “It’s all about getting bigger.” Asked what has surprised her about her new job, she mentions the flood of attention when she was promoted. Her elevation marked two milestones: the first time an African-American woman was named C.E.O. of a major American corporation, and the first time a woman succeeded another woman in the top job at a company of this size. She tells the group that she briefly enjoyed the spotlight but grew to like it significantly less. “The accolades that I get for doing absolutely nothing are amazing  I’ve been named to every list, literally, since I became the C.E.O.,” Ms. Burns says. Apart from working on the Affiliated Computer acquisition, she asks, “What have I done? In the first 30 days, I was named to a list of the most impressive XYZ. The accolades are good for five minutes, but then it takes kind of a shine off the real story. The real story is not Ursula Burns. I just happen to be the person standing up at this point representing Xerox.” It’s a fair point, and one that might be true at many other big corporations, where the mission is set and the C.E.O. is more of a caretaker. But the story line at Xerox has always had a little more depth and texture  the bedrock American company whose name became an everyday verb; the convulsive drama after the board’s decision to bring in an outsider to take over as C.E.O. in the late ‘90s; the five-alarm rescue by Ms. Mulcahy, another Xerox lifer, to stabilize the company and to heal the wounds in the “Xerox family.” And so, while the Xerox story is not all about Ursula Burns, it is still a lot about her, particularly because there are few visible seams between who she is as a person, her life story and how she plans to lead Xerox. She is taking over at a time when investors are eager to see Xerox build both revenue and earnings. She wants its 130,000 employees to get over the past, take more initiative, become more fearless and be more frank and impatient with one another to ratchet up performance. “Terminal niceness,” is how she describes an aspect of Xerox’s culture, during her all-hands speech. “We are really, really, really nice.” Maybe the “Xerox family,” she says, should act a bit more like a real family. “When we’re in the family, you don’t have to be as nice as when you’re outside of the family,” she says. “I want us to stay civil and kind, but we have to be frank  and the reason we can be frank is because we are all in the same family.” Nods of recognition ripple across the audience. “We know it. We know what we do,” she continues, describing meetings where some people present and others just listen. “And then the meeting ends, and we leave and go, ‘Man, that wasn’t true.’ I’m like, ‘Why didn’t you say that in the meeting?’ ” BY all accounts, Ms. Burns, who is 51, has never been shy about speaking her mind. It’s how she wound up working alongside Xerox’s top leaders at an early age. She studied mechanical engineering both in college and in graduate school and joined Xerox as a summer intern in 1980. Through her 20s, she worked in various roles in product development and planning. In 1989, she was invited to a work-life discussion. Diversity initiatives came up, and somebody asked whether such initiatives lowered hiring standards. Wayland Hicks, a senior Xerox executive running the meeting, patiently explained that that was not true. 1 2 3 4 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 21, 2010, on page BU1 of the New York edition.Orlando, Fla.

Aide Is Charged in Violent Family Fight<date>Published: January 8, 2010</date><text>By all appearances, John Michael Farren and his wife, Mary Margaret Farren, had the life many can only dream about: a $4 million house in an affluent Connecticut suburb; two daughters; and high-powered legal careers, hers in the energy practice of Skadden, Arps, and his as a top aide in three Republican administrations along with a stint as general counsel of Xerox. Skip to next paragraph Kerry Sherck/Stamford Advocate, via Associated Press John Michael Farren being arraigned Thursday in Norwalk. Kerry Sherck/Stamford Advocate, via Associated Press Mary Farren But that facade shattered this week, shortly after Mrs. Farren had her husband served with divorce papers on Monday. By Thursday, their stately house in New Canaan had become a bloody crime scene, Mrs. Farren was hospitalized with a broken jaw, nose and other injuries, and Mr. Farren had been charged in Norwalk Superior Court with attempted murder. In affidavits, the New Canaan police said the episode unfolded in the couple’s bedroom on Wednesday night. Mr. Farren, who had last served as the deputy counsel in the White House under President George W. Bush, exploded in rage after Mrs. Farren would not rethink the divorce, the police said. According to the affidavits, Mrs. Farren told the police that her husband pulled out “gobs” of her hair, threw her to the floor and hit her repeatedly with a metal flashlight, until she passed out. She said he also choked her with his hands and threatened to hurt himself. Shouting, “Daddy’s trying to kill me,” she said, she fled the house with their daughters, a 7-year-old and a 4-month-old. Bleeding heavily and disoriented, she turned up at the door of neighbors she had never met, and collapsed. The police were already heading to the Farren house, having responded to a home alarm Mrs. Farren said she activated before leaving. The police said they entered the gated property using a code Mr. Farren gave them and apprehended him. Prosecutors asked for a $3 million bond, an amount Mr. Farren’s lawyer, Eugene J. Riccio, called “ridiculous,” given that Mr. Farren had never before been arrested and had “worked for 30 years at high levels of government, high levels of corporate America.” The bail commissioner proposed $1 million. After hearing about the severity of Mrs. Farren’s injuries and her lawyer’s assertion that she remains “terrified” of her husband, Judge Bruce P. Hudock set bail at $2 million, which Mr. Farren had not posted as of Friday night. The judge also ordered the defendant to keep away from his wife and children and turn in any firearms; a shotgun was mentioned in the police report. He is expected to enter a plea on Jan. 21 in Stamford. The case has left many who know the couple stunned and perplexed. A woman who crossed paths with Mr. Farren in the workplace, one of many acquaintances who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous to avoid becoming entangled in the litigation, said Mr. Farren had a proclivity to lose his temper, but no more than anyone in a pressure-filled job. A neighbor on their street said the couple had moved in about six years ago, decamped briefly for Washington, and “kept to themselves.” “Everybody is shocked,” said a colleague in the recent Bush administration, who recalled seeing the couple at a Fourth of July picnic at the White House. “He was not sharp-elbowed, he was low-key,” the colleague said of Mr. Farren. “If he had a temper, I never saw it.” Born in Waterbury 57 years ago, Mr. Farren attended Fairfield University and earned a master’s degree in public policy at Trinity College in Hartford and a law degree at the University of Connecticut. His father was a police captain in Naugatuck. Besides practicing law in the private sector, Mr. Farren held jobs in both Bush White Houses and the Reagan administration, including stints in the Commerce Department. He also worked on Republican campaigns. Most recently, he was summoned back to government service in June 2007 by Fred F. Fielding, the White House counsel, to serve as his deputy, at a time when the Bush administration was under fire from Congress on several fronts and Mr. Fielding wanted to expand the counsel’s office. Lawyers familiar with the office say Mr. Fielding knew Mr. Farren from the Reagan administration and that Mr. Fielding’s law firm represented Xerox when Mr. Farren was its general counsel. They said Mr. Farren was brought in to oversee administrative issues and free Mr. Fielding to deal with more important hot-button issues. That chapter of Mr. Farren’s government career came to what seemed like an abrupt end. He left the job suddenly a few weeks before the 2008 presidential election, although the White House had expected top aides to stay until the end. At the time, Mr. Farren had told an acquaintance that he wanted to leave before the administration turned over, to get a jump on the job market. If so, his plans might have changed; he has not worked full time since. On Thursday, the bail commissioner reported to the court that Mr. Farren was “retired.” In the account she gave the police from Norwalk Hospital, Mrs. Farren said her husband had hit her only one time previously but abused her emotionally. Barbara Gray and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

After hearing about the severity of Mrs. Farren’s injuries and her lawyer’s assertion that she remains “terrified” of her husband, Judge Bruce P. Hudock set bail at $2 million, which Mr. Farren had not posted as of Friday night. The judge also ordered the defendant to keep away from his wife and children and turn in any firearms; a shotgun was mentioned in the police report. He is expected to enter a plea on Jan. 21 in Stamford. The case has left many who know the couple stunned and perplexed. A woman who crossed paths with Mr. Farren in the workplace, one of many acquaintances who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous to avoid becoming entangled in the litigation, said Mr. Farren had a proclivity to lose his temper, but no more than anyone in a pressure-filled job. A neighbor on their street said the couple had moved in about six years ago, decamped briefly for Washington, and “kept to themselves.” “Everybody is shocked,” said a colleague in the recent Bush administration, who recalled seeing the couple at a Fourth of July picnic at the White House. “He was not sharp-elbowed, he was low-key,” the colleague said of Mr. Farren. “If he had a temper, I never saw it.” Born in Waterbury 57 years ago, Mr. Farren attended Fairfield University and earned a master’s degree in public policy at Trinity College in Hartford and a law degree at the University of Connecticut. His father was a police captain in Naugatuck. Besides practicing law in the private sector, Mr. Farren held jobs in both Bush White Houses and the Reagan administration, including stints in the Commerce Department. He also worked on Republican campaigns. Most recently, he was summoned back to government service in June 2007 by Fred F. Fielding, the White House counsel, to serve as his deputy, at a time when the Bush administration was under fire from Congress on several fronts and Mr. Fielding wanted to expand the counsel’s office. Lawyers familiar with the office say Mr. Fielding knew Mr. Farren from the Reagan administration and that Mr. Fielding’s law firm represented Xerox when Mr. Farren was its general counsel. They said Mr. Farren was brought in to oversee administrative issues and free Mr. Fielding to deal with more important hot-button issues. That chapter of Mr. Farren’s government career came to what seemed like an abrupt end. He left the job suddenly a few weeks before the 2008 presidential election, although the White House had expected top aides to stay until the end. At the time, Mr. Farren had told an acquaintance that he wanted to leave before the administration turned over, to get a jump on the job market. If so, his plans might have changed; he has not worked full time since. On Thursday, the bail commissioner reported to the court that Mr. Farren was “retired.” In the account she gave the police from Norwalk Hospital, Mrs. Farren said her husband had hit her only one time previously but abused her emotionally.

Burns, the chief executive of Xerox, declared on Monday that the company’s plan to buy Affiliated Computer Services, an outsourcing services company, for $6.4 billion would be “a game-changer” for Xerox. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Video Xerox Chief on ACS Deal (CNBC) That could be standard business hyperbole, of course, and only time will tell whether the deal proves to be a winner for Xerox. But the game is indeed changing for big technology suppliers catering to corporate customers as they shift to depend less on products and more on services. And technology companies, like Xerox, are often buying services companies to accelerate the transition. Only last week, for example, Dell announced that it would buy Perot Systems for $3.9 billion. Last year, Hewlett-Packard bought another large technology services company, Electronic Data Systems, for $13.9 billion. The shift to services is being fueled by financial and strategic considerations and by the evolution of technology itself. Services businesses tend to be steadier sources of revenue and profit than product businesses, which are more susceptible to peaks and valleys of economic cycles. Services businesses also foster closer relations with corporate customers and often yield higher profit margins. The cost and complexity of computing, analysts say, has led many corporate customers to conclude that owning and operating their own hardware and software is an expensive, distracting burden. So customers are pressing suppliers to not just sell them technology but to make it work for them to streamline business tasks like procurement, customer tracking, record handling and product design. “For a lot of these companies, there is a real blurring between what is a product and what is a service,” said Christine Ferrusi Ross, an analyst at Forrester Research. “The concept of what a product company is anymore really has to be rethought.” Xerox and other technology companies that are expanding their reach in services are following a model that I.B.M. pursued more than a decade ago and General Electric even earlier. They recognized that to compete in an increasingly competitive global marketplace, companies needed to move into higher-value services, which are less vulnerable than product businesses to being undercut by low-cost manufacturers abroad. Technology advances are making it easier for suppliers to provide computing as a service, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers in the so-called cloud computing model. Software can move off desktop personal computers to become a Web-based service, like Google’s e-mail, word processing and spreadsheets, and the online customer-relationship management software of Salesforce.com. The digitization of all kinds of business records and documents also opens the door to automating business tasks and mining business data for everything from customer-service problems to sales opportunities. The share of corporate technology budgets spent on hardware and software, which are capital expenditures, has been declining in recent years. That percentage fell to 28 percent this year, from 36 percent in 2004, according to estimates from Gartner, a research firm. The rest is spent on operational expenses, including services. The trend is not a matter of rising labor costs at corporate technology departments, because headcounts have not increased, said Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president in charge of research at Gartner. “The shift toward external services is quite pronounced,” Mr. Sondergaard said. Analysts say the weak economy promises to accelerate the tilt toward spending on services as companies resist bigger capital budgets or adding workers to their payrolls. In an interview, Ms. Burns said the Affiliated Computer deal was largely a matter of following her customers. “They want us to intelligently knit together all this stuff  the information that makes their businesses run,” said Ms. Burns, who took over in July with the retirement of Anne M. Mulcahy. Xerox said that the combined company would have $22 billion in revenue and that nearly 80 percent of that total would be recurring revenue based on services and equipment contracts. The company’s services business would triple, to $10 billion. In an interview, Lynn Blodgett, chief executive of Affiliated Computer, said that his company would certainly benefit from tapping into the Xerox worldwide sales force. But he also emphasized that it would benefit from the Xerox research in imaging and text-recognition technology. Affiliated Computer handles and processes back-office documents like loan-processing papers for banks and Medicaid claims for health care providers and states. Xerox, Mr. Blodgett said, has technology that can begin to scan patient claims, for example, searching for patterns in the data that could suggest the best therapies for managing chronic diseases like diabetes. “It allows you to look at claims and reach conclusions,” he said. “It’s technology we just don’t have.” The Xerox cash-and-stock offer was valued at $63.11 a share, based on the closing price of Xerox shares on Friday. Shares of Affiliated Computer, which closed at $47.25 on Friday, rose 14 percent on Monday, to $53.86. Xerox shares fell 14 percent, to $7.68. Affiliated Computer, based in Dallas, was founded in 1988 to handle data-processing chores for banks and has grown steadily since. Today it has $6.5 billion in revenue and 74,000 employees. Indeed, the company is sizable, with 20,000 more employees than Xerox, and analysts say the challenge of integrating the two companies may have contributed to the fall in Xerox shares. “Xerox has not done a lot of big merger deals, so one concern is that A.C.S. may not be easily digestible,” said Peter Falvey, managing director of Revolution Partners, a small investment bank that specializes in technology companies. Affiliated Computer has also been a subject of inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and grand jury proceedings in recent years, focusing on stock option grants and the accuracy of some customer records. The inquiries and repeated changes of chief executives and chief financial officers over the last five years prompted Disclosure Insight, an independent research firm, to rate the company a high risk. There are no current investigations, said Kevin Lightfoot, a spokesman for Affiliated Computer. “It’s all been put behind us,” he said. Analysts say other services companies that might be takeover candidates in the wake of the Xerox-Affiliated Computer deal include Computer Sciences Corporation, CGI in Canada and a few Indian outsourcing companies like WNS and Patni. Several of the largest remaining independent technology services companies like Accenture or the leading Indian outsourcers like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, analysts say, are probably too costly and unwilling to be acquired. “The merger trend isn’t over, but you are running out of companies that are small enough to reasonably acquire and yet large enough to make a difference,” said Rod Bourgeois, an analyst at Bernstein Research.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Norm Betts/Bloomberg News John Chambers, chief of Cisco Systems, says the company will be making acquisitions. Add to Portfolio Abbott Laboratories Xerox Corp Cisco Systems Inc Affiliated Computer Services Incorporated Warner Chilcott Ltd Go to your Portfolio » While investors have been bidding up shares in the stock market for months, many chief executives and boards had privately remained skittish about their own businesses  until recently. In a signal that confidence  and perhaps a bit of executive swagger  may be returning to the business world, two large mergers were announced on Monday, adding to a flurry of deals in the last month. First, Abbott Laboratories, the drug maker, agreed to acquire a unit of Solvay of Belgium for $6.6 billion, and then Xerox agreed to buy Affiliated Computer Services, an outsourcer, for $6.4 billion. Neither merger compares in size to the double-digit billion-dollar deals that took place just two years ago at the height of the buyout boom. But taken in the context of what has been a merger drought  in the wake of the financial crisis, deal-making is still off by more than 50 percent from last year  the transactions suggest that the most senior ranks of corporate America may now have a more optimistic outlook on the economy than some people thought. “Will you see us move with a lot of acquisitions over this next year? You betcha,” John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, said in a recent meeting. “Especially if it plays out economically the way that I think.” For nearly two years, mergers plunged along with the markets as executives grappled with trying to understand how best to survive. At this time in 2007, $1.28 trillion in takeovers in the United States had been announced; so far this year, only $491.8 billion have been announced, according to Thomson Reuters. And with stock prices fluctuating sharply after falling for many months until the spring, buyers were anxious about overpaying and sellers were nervous about shortchanging themselves. But as the markets have rebounded and leveled off, companies are more confident about their prospects, so they are dipping their toes into the deal waters. The takeovers, in turn, helped lift the stock market on Monday, which had stalled recently. “The psychology has changed. This is sign that things have stabilized,” said Boon Sim, Credit Suisse’s head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, who suggested that deals were a lagging indicator to the stock market. “I don’t think the floodgates are opening up,” he continued, “but C.E.O.’s are now beginning to say, ‘If I don’t buy it now, it’s only going to get more expensive in the next 12 or 18 months.’ ” What Wall Street hasn’t seen, of course, is the return of the biggest buyers in recent years  the private equity firms that propelled much of the merger mania during the debt-fueled bubble. And that may be good news. The big deals announced recently are strategic deals, in which one company buys another to make it an integral part of its business, and they do not require the buyer to take on mounds of new borrowing to pay for the acquisition. In contrast, many of the takeovers for the last five years were based on little more than financial engineering, with lax lenders providing low-interest debt to help private equity firms buy companies that they often planned to resell quickly in hopes of pocketing a fast profit. That has left many companies struggling to make interest payments, making it harder for them to invest in new products or more efficient manufacturing methods. A number of those takeovers are already underwater and some have turned sour. Just one example: Simmons, the mattress maker, was bought by the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, or THL, in 2003, largely with borrowed money. Last week, THL said that Simmons  whose immense debt burden from the takeover was hampering its prospects  would be put into bankruptcy proceedings and sold. But the sale price for Simmons is so low that bond investors will lose around $500 million. At Xerox, Ursula M. Burns, the company’s chief executive, said that she pursued the deal for Affiliated Computer Services only because she finally felt more comfortable with the performance of her own business. “We’re confident that our base business will rebound when the economy does  and in Q2 saw the right trends in this direction,” she said. “So, all factors played to our favor. At the end of the day, in tough times, strong companies look to invest in their future.” While the recent mergers may represent a positive sign for the economy, Alexander Roos, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, is less inclined to believe that we are about to see a burst of activity. In a study to be published on Tuesday, he said, his analysis of a sample of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index shows that about 20 percent are “predators,” ready to take on the risks of a deal, while another 20 percent are “prey.” “We expect a window of opportunity offering attractive takeover prospects to open soon,” Mr. Roos said. “We have already seen some of our smarter clients making preparations in recent months.” The greatest concentration of deal-making appears to be in the health care and technology sectors. Warner Chilcott made a $3.1 billion deal for Procter &amp; Gamble’s drug business last month, for example, and Dell bought Perot Systems, a technology services company, for $3.9 billion. But deals are also being made in other sectors, like food; Kraft’s $16.7 billion unsolicited bid for Cadbury, which was rejected but remains a possibility, is the largest outstanding offer to date. “If you’re healthy, it’s a great time to acquire inexpensively,” adds Ted Rouse, a head of Bain &amp; Company’s global mergers and acquisitions practice. “But it’s an awful time for two weak companies to merge.” While the return of corporate mergers may be a good sign for the economy, a bigger question may be whether it is such a good thing for companies. Most deals sound great at the time, but in the end, not all of them work out as well as planned. Mr. Rouse said, “Before the recession, Bain’s research on M.&amp;A. showed that approximately 55 percent of acquisitions failed to deliver expected shareholder returns after one year  worse than flipping a coin. The odds only get worse as the size of the acquisition increases and the target is further from the acquirer’s core business.” Let’s hope the odds are better this time around.

Spinrad, a computer designer who carried out pioneering work in scientific automation at Brookhaven National Laboratory and who later was director of Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center while the personal computing technology invented there in the 1970s was commercialized, died on Wednesday in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 77. Skip to next paragraph Xerox Robert J. Spinrad with the Xerox 8010 Information System, which was introduced by the Xerox Corporation in 1981. The cause was Lou Gehrig’s disease, his wife, Verna, said. Trained in electrical engineering before computer science was a widely taught discipline, Dr. Spinrad built his own computer from discarded telephone switching equipment while he was a student at Columbia. He said that while he was proud of his creation, at the time most people had no interest in the machines. “I may as well have been talking about the study of Kwakiutl Indians, for all my friends knew,” he told a reporter for The New York Times in 1983. At Brookhaven he would design a room-size, tube-based computer he named Merlin, as part of an early generation of computer systems used to automate scientific experimentation. He referred to the machine, which was built before transistors were widely used in computers, as “the last of the dinosaurs.” After arriving at Brookhaven, Dr. Spinrad spent a summer at Los Alamos National Laboratories, where he learned about scientific computer design by studying an early machine known as Maniac, designed by Nicholas Metropolis, a physicist. Dr. Spinrad’s group at Brookhaven developed techniques for using computers to run experiments and to analyze and display data as well as to control experiments interactively in response to earlier measurements. Later, while serving as the head of the Computer Systems Group at Brookhaven, Dr. Spinrad wrote a cover article on laboratory automation for the Oct. 6, 1967, issue of Science magazine. “He was really the father of modern laboratory automation,” said Joel Birnbaum, a physicist who designed computers at both I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. “He had a lot of great ideas about how you connected computers to instruments. He realized that it wasn’t enough to just build a loop between the computer and the apparatus, but that the most important piece of the apparatus was the scientist.” After leaving Brookhaven, Dr. Spinrad joined Scientific Data Systems in Los Angeles as a computer designer and manager. When the company was bought by the Xerox Corporation in an effort to compete with I.B.M., he participated in Xerox’s decision to put a research laboratory next to the campus of Stanford. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center pioneered the technology that led directly to the modern personal computer and office data networks. Taking over as director of the laboratory in 1978, Dr. Spinrad oversaw a period when the laboratory’s technology was commercialized, including the first modern personal computer, the ethernet local area network and the laser printer. However, as a copier company, Xerox was never a comfortable fit for the emerging computing world, and many of the laboratory researchers left Xerox, often taking their innovations with them. At the center, Dr. Spinrad became adept at bridging the cultural gulf between the lab’s button-down East Coast corporations and its unruly and innovative West Coast researchers. Robert Spinrad was born in Manhattan on March 20, 1932. He received an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Columbia and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition to his wife, Verna, he is survived by two children, Paul, of San Francisco, and Susan Spinrad Esterly, of Palo Alto, and three grandchildren. Flying between Norwalk, Conn., and Palo Alto frequently, Dr. Spinrad once recalled how he felt like Superman in reverse because he would invariably step into the airplane’s lavatory to change into a suit for his visit to the company headquarters.

Spinrad, a computer designer who carried out pioneering work in scientific automation at Brookhaven National Laboratory and who later was director of Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center while the personal computing technology invented there in the 1970s was commercialized, died on Wednesday in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 77. Skip to next paragraph Xerox Robert J. Spinrad with the Xerox 8010 Information System, which was introduced by the Xerox Corporation in 1981. The cause was Lou Gehrig’s disease, his wife, Verna, said. Trained in electrical engineering before computer science was a widely taught discipline, Dr. Spinrad built his own computer from discarded telephone switching equipment while he was a student at Columbia. He said that while he was proud of his creation, at the time most people had no interest in the machines. “I may as well have been talking about the study of Kwakiutl Indians, for all my friends knew,” he told a reporter for The New York Times in 1983. At Brookhaven he would design a room-size, tube-based computer he named Merlin, as part of an early generation of computer systems used to automate scientific experimentation. He referred to the machine, which was built before transistors were widely used in computers, as “the last of the dinosaurs.” After arriving at Brookhaven, Dr. Spinrad spent a summer at Los Alamos National Laboratories, where he learned about scientific computer design by studying an early machine known as Maniac, designed by Nicholas Metropolis, a physicist. Dr. Spinrad’s group at Brookhaven developed techniques for using computers to run experiments and to analyze and display data as well as to control experiments interactively in response to earlier measurements. Later, while serving as the head of the Computer Systems Group at Brookhaven, Dr. Spinrad wrote a cover article on laboratory automation for the Oct. 6, 1967, issue of Science magazine. “He was really the father of modern laboratory automation,” said Joel Birnbaum, a physicist who designed computers at both I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. “He had a lot of great ideas about how you connected computers to instruments. He realized that it wasn’t enough to just build a loop between the computer and the apparatus, but that the most important piece of the apparatus was the scientist.” After leaving Brookhaven, Dr. Spinrad joined Scientific Data Systems in Los Angeles as a computer designer and manager. When the company was bought by the Xerox Corporation in an effort to compete with I.B.M., he participated in Xerox’s decision to put a research laboratory next to the campus of Stanford. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center pioneered the technology that led directly to the modern personal computer and office data networks. Taking over as director of the laboratory in 1978, Dr. Spinrad oversaw a period when the laboratory’s technology was commercialized, including the first modern personal computer, the ethernet local area network and the laser printer. However, as a copier company, Xerox was never a comfortable fit for the emerging computing world, and many of the laboratory researchers left Xerox, often taking their innovations with them. At the center, Dr. Spinrad became adept at bridging the cultural gulf between the lab’s button-down East Coast corporations and its unruly and innovative West Coast researchers. Robert Spinrad was born in Manhattan on March 20, 1932. He received an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Columbia and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition to his wife, Verna, he is survived by two children, Paul, of San Francisco, and Susan Spinrad Esterly, of Palo Alto, and three grandchildren.

During a shareholders’ meeting on Thursday, Ms. Mulcahy revealed that she would retire as chief executive in July but remain chairwoman. Her handpicked successor is Ursula M. Burns, the president of the company. The management change had been predicted for years, making it one of the least tumultuous power changes in Xerox’s recent history. “For the better part of the past decade, she has been at my side helping to turn Xerox around and more importantly transform Xerox for a new era,” Ms. Mulcahy told the company’s shareholders about Ms. Burns. According to Xerox, this is the first time a female chief executive has replaced another female chief executive at a Fortune 500 company. In addition, Ms. Burns is the first African-American woman to run a company this large. Xerox reported revenue of $17.6 billion in 2008. Xerox declined to make either executive available for interviews. Tapped to head Xerox in mid-2001, Ms. Mulcahy took over a lethargic company that had lost ground to Japanese rivals like Canon and Ricoh. Abrupt management changes and a bungled reorganization of the sales force intensified the company’s woes to the point that analysts speculated it might have to file for bankruptcy. In addition, Xerox had endured an extensive investigation of its accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As the chief executive, Ms. Mulcahy negotiated a settlement that put the accounting issues to rest. Observers credit Ms. Mulcahy with helping Xerox recover by bringing its costs into line and strengthening its products. Xerox has created printers that compete better on cost and size, including the introduction this month of copiers that lower the cost of printing color documents. It has also continued to build services and technology for managing documents within large corporations. “She has really completed a remarkable turnaround,” said Shannon Cross, the managing director of Cross Research, an equities research firm. Ms. Mulcahy, 56, has spent 33 years at Xerox, working in roles that spanned sales, marketing and human resources. Ms. Burns, 50, is also a longtime Xerox veteran, having started as an engineering intern in 1980. “They’re both insiders that sort of bleed toner, as it were,” said Steve Reynolds, an analyst with Lyra Research, which follows the printing and imaging industries. As president, Ms. Burns has most recently been overseeing a large swath of Xerox’s operations. She has conducted meetings with investors and Wall Street analysts alongside Ms. Mulcahy as well. Given such close ties, it is expected that Xerox will move forward with a similar strategy. “I don’t really see this signaling any kind of change in direction for Xerox,” Mr. Reynolds said. “Ursula will continue to execute the things Xerox has put in place for some time.” Ms. Burns takes the job as businesses around the globe are reducing their equipment purchases because of the global recession. Last year, as Xerox faced suddenly falling sales, it cut thousands of jobs to lower costs. “They’re in the midst of another major restructuring,” Ms. Cross said. “So Ursula has to get through that, but it’s nothing new for her. She’s been in charge of that effort.” Shares of Xerox closed down 8 cents at $6.82 a share. More Articles in Technology »After eight years of hard work turning around a company in disarray, Anne M.

After years of research, Xerox will release the first in a new series of large machines this month that it claims will change the economics of printing large volumes of color documents at offices. Unlike traditional laser printers that use cartridges of powdery, sometimes messy toner, the revamped products rely on hunks of ink that remain solid at room temperature and then melt when heated. Xerox, based in Norwalk, Conn., bills the solid ink technology, which lets it create machines with fewer parts, as the biggest shift in the industry since it sold the first laser printer in 1977. “This is something they have been working on for forever and a day,” said Brian Bissett, the editor of the MFP Report, a publication about office printers and copiers. “It does have the potential to be fairly important.” Traditionally, printer makers have charged big corporate customers a per-page fee for printing services: up to 8 cents a page for a color document and less than 2 cents a page for black-and-white. Xerox and its main competitors, Canon and Ricoh, typically bill customers for a color page if there is any pigment on it, whether it’s a full-color replica of a slide from a presentation or a page that just has a colorful company logo and mostly black text. Because of the higher cost, only about 15 percent of the more than two trillion documents printed every year in offices worldwide use color. “This isn’t because people don’t like color but because there have been lots of barriers to color,” said Ursula M. Burns, the president of Xerox. “The last barrier is that it’s expensive.” With its new ColorQube solid ink systems, Xerox says it can pull the average cost of color documents down to about 3 cents a page. A portion of the price break comes from better tracking of how much color is used on a page. But the principal breakthrough with the solid ink technology stems from the overall simplicity of the machine’s innards. Solid ink machines need about one-third as many parts as laser printers, which require various mechanisms to fuse toner onto paper that must be replaced over time, adding materials and services costs. And instead of putting clunky cartridges of toner into the printers, customers just pop in the sticks of ink. Once that ink runs out, another stick goes in, and there’s nothing that needs to be thrown away or recycled. Over all, Xerox claims that it takes about 272 pounds of material to produce one million pages with a solid ink machine versus 965 pounds of material with a competing laser product. Hewlett-Packard has tried to disrupt the high-volume printer market with a different type of innovation: its Edgeline machines run on liquid ink instead of toner. Software and hardware tracking systems within the Edgeline products also make it possible to offer customers different prices per page based on how much color ink is actually consumed. However, analysts say that H.P. is at a disadvantage because the technology is unfamiliar and because H.P. lacks the sales reach of Xerox in this category.

You led a turnaround at Xerox earlier this decade. What lessons did you learn from that experience? A. I think the whole management team would say that when you have that window of opportunity called a crisis, move as quickly as you can, get as much done as you can. There’s a momentum for change that’s very compelling. I think we took good advantage of it, but I think we would have loved to have done even more during that window. We also learned a lot about identifying failure quickly. And as much as it’s sometimes hard to make choices about where you invest, it’s equally hard to make choices about where you don’t invest and what you eliminate. Q. What’s it like to be in a meeting run by you? A. I’m not formal and I’m impatient. So I think my team would say that when she starts tapping her pen and the leg starts moving quickly, that it’s time to move on. I’m not good at long, drawn-out kinds of sessions. I want to get to the point and not waste time on something that’s not meaningful for the senior team. Q. So beware the tapping of the pen. A. Absolutely. When that starts, you know things are not going well. Q. When you’re assessing a job candidate, do you have one or two acid-test questions? A. They have more to do with behavior and culture than they do with competence and expertise. Generally speaking, the people you talk to have the competence and expertise. That’s how they got to the interview. So then the most important aspect is whether it’s a good fit. And so I always ask the question, why are they choosing us, not so much why we should choose them. I really want to hear about what they could do for the company and why they think it would be a place they could be successful. It’s a little bit of a test. Have they done their homework? Do they understand the place? Do they aspire to the kind of value system and culture we have here? I’ve learned that it’s probably the biggest success or failure indication, as well, about whether people are a good fit with the culture. Q. Do you find yourself looking for certain qualities in a candidate more than you did several years ago? A. Adaptability and flexibility. One of the things that is mind-boggling right now is how much we have to change all the time. For anybody who’s into comfort and structure, it gets harder and harder to feel satisfied in the company. It’s almost like you have to embrace a lot of ambiguity and be adaptable and not get into the rigidness or expectation-setting that I think there used to be 10 years ago, when you could kind of plot it out and define where you were going to go. I think it’s a lot more fluid right now. It has to be. The people who really do the best are those who actually sense it, enjoy it almost, that lack of definition around their roles and what they can contribute. Q. And how do you get a sense of whether a person has that quality? A. Part of it’s from their experience. I think seeing how much breadth someone’s had, and their appetite for not just vertical career ladders, but their appetite for what I call the horizontal experiences, where it wasn’t always just about a title or the next layer up. And that there was this desire to learn new things, to kind of grab onto things that were maybe even somewhat nontraditional. Those kinds of experiences I think bode well for someone who’s going to be open and adaptive in this job environment. Q. Looking back over your career, do you recall a certain insight that put your career on a different trajectory? A. A couple of things. I had come up through the sales organization and I was very much a product of that — you know, the next level of upward mobility. I reached a point where I felt like I was just running out of steam, and I knew that you can always get bigger and bigger budgets and sales assignments. But I chose to go into human resources. I didn’t do it so much because of leadership development or career aspirations. I did it just simply because I thought it was really interesting. I’d always believed that human resources could be a very powerful part of an organization and often wasn’t. So I kind of threw my hat in that ring, wound up running human resources for Xerox worldwide. That was a decision that certainly changed my career path and reinforced the power of leadership for me. Q. What did you learn from running human resources? A. One was that you discover quickly how little honest feedback people get in companies, and how important it is for people to have a sense of candid assessment. It became very much a mantra for me, to kind of influence a culture that assessed people accurately and really dealt with people fairly. The other piece is the importance of talent development. Not everybody is created equal, and it’s important for companies to identify those high potentials and treat them differently, accelerate their development and pay them more. That process is so incredibly important to developing first-class leadership in a company.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/technology/companies/24xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Xerox 4th-Quarter Profit Falls to Nearly Nothing<date>Published: January 23, 2009</date><text>The Xerox Corporation said fourth-quarter profit shrank to nearly nothing, hurt by restructuring costs and a decline in demand from Russia. Higher manufacturing costs resulting from an increase in the value of the Japanese yen also caused the company, a leading provider of digital printers and document management services, to forecast a first-quarter profit short of analysts’ targets. Revenue from developing markets fell 14 percent, in contrast to growth of 17 percent in those markets in the first three quarters of the year.

Xerox said fourth-quarter net income was $1 million, or nil per share, down from $382 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, including litigation charges, profit was 32 cents a share, a penny below the average Wall Street forecast. Late last year, Xerox announced a restructuring plan, including the elimination of about 3,000 jobs, aimed at saving $200 million in 2009. In the fourth quarter, restructuring charges were 27 cents a share. Revenue fell 10 percent, to $4.37 billion, from $4.88 billion. Revenue from sales of supplies and services fell 8 percent, to $3.1 billion. Equipment sale revenue declined 15 percent, to $1.3 billion, reflecting “weakened economic conditions around the world,” Xerox said. Xerox predicted first-quarter earnings of 16 to 20 cents a share, below the 24 cents analysts said they expected.

Xerox, which said last month it planned to pare about 3,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force, said it expects a profit of $1 to $1.25 a share in 2009. Analysts on average expect the company to post a profit of $1.20.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/technology/25xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Restructuring Costs Reduce Xerox Earnings<date>Published: July 25, 2008</date><text>Second-quarter profit at Xerox skidded 19 percent on reorganization charges, but the company matched Wall Street’s forecast as its supplies and services business hummed along smoothly. The company, based in Norwalk, Conn., makes most of its money from selling ink and other supplies to companies that have already bought or leased Xerox printers, copiers and other machinery, a reliable business that grew 10 percent in the April-to-June period compared with last year. The consistency of that business, coupled with the growing demand for expensive color ink and technical support to help companies manage their ever-expanding hoards of digital documents, helped Xerox expand in line with analyst expectations. Xerox said Thursday that net income in the second quarter was $215 million, or 24 cents a share, in line with analysts’ estimates. That figure was down from $266 million, or 28 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Were it not for previously announced overhaul charges, however, Xerox’s profit would have been 5 cents a share higher, topping last year’s figure by a penny a share. Xerox continues to cut costs as it looks for ways to improve its profitability. The reorganization charges were mostly to account for job cuts in the second quarter. Xerox eliminated roughly 1,000 employees, most of them in North America, ending the quarter with 58,000 workers. Sales were $4.53 billion, an 8 percent improvement over last year and exactly in line with analysts’ average estimate. Equipment sales, which are more vulnerable to economic pressures and swings in discretionary technology spending, grew just 2 percent, to $1.16 billion, a sharp decline from the double-digit increases in recent quarters. Installation of color digital printers at commercial printing companies declined 12 percent in the second quarter, which Xerox’s chief executive, Anne M. Mulcahy, said was “way off” historical trends. Shares fell 76 cents, to $13.27.

Skip to next paragraph Jay Premack/Bloomberg News Representative Nydia Velazquez; Earl E. Devaney, the Interior Departments inspector general, center; and Senator John Kerry, bottom. Stephen J. Boitano/Bloomberg News Haraz N. Ghanbari/Associated Press In one report, the inspector general for the Interior Department found that contracts listed as going to small businesses went to a dozen Fortune 500 corporations, including the Xerox Corporation and the John Deere Company. The report, based on a sampling of the department’s small business contract awards in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, uncovered no fraud but found that large businesses received the contracts because of data entry errors, incorrect data and failure by contracting officials to verify the actual size of the business. The report also said that in several cases, corporations appeared to have misrepresented themselves as small businesses on the federal contractor data base. Xerox and John Deere said they were moving to correct those errors, and Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, called for all federal agencies to audit their small business contracting practices. The second report, by the Government Accountability Office, found that numerous private firms had tapped into the Small Business Administration’s set-aside program for small businesses in economically distressed areas by falsely claiming they were located in a Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or HUBZone. Ten randomly selected companies in the Washington area, according to the agency, had set up virtual offices or rented mail boxes in poor communities solely to obtain a HUBZone business address. Over two years, those companies and others won more than $100 million in HUBZone contracts, according to the report presented to the House Committee on Small Business last week. “You have to wonder about a system that lets individuals self-qualify for a program of this size,” said Nydia M. Velazquez, the New York Democrat who heads the committee. In response, the S.B.A. released a statement that outlined the steps it planned to take to correct the problems and verify that companies are eligible. Officials at the Interior Department said the inspector general’s report uncovered only $5.7 million in misdirected contracts. That was a small fraction of the agency’s overall small business contract awards, which totaled $1.39 billion in fiscal year 2006 and $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2007. But Earl E. Devaney, the department’s inspector general, said what his audit team uncovered “was the tip of the iceberg” because it was based on a review of three-tenths of a percent of contracts from a cross-section of offices  ranging from Indian affairs to surface mining  in the huge department. “These are not just clerical mistakes that can be tagged on two little clerks,” Mr. Devaney said. “This is not one single report, but our fourth in the contracting area.” P. Lynn Scarlett, the Interior Department’s deputy secretary, said the department was “working to correct these issues.” Her office did not return further calls, and her statement was included in a response to the report by the S.B.A., which also monitors how well the federal government meets its small business contracting goals. Congress has required that 23 percent of all federal contracts, which total more than $400 billion annually, be set aside for small businesses. Agencies are required to state whether they have met their annual contracting goals. But several inquiries, including one by the G.A.O. in 2003, have raised questions about the accuracy of the S.B.A.’s reporting. The inspector general’s report “is the latest maddening evidence that big businesses are being handed federal contracts that should be going to small businesses,” Mr. Kerry said. He added that he would “be sending letters to every federal agency asking them to audit their small business contracts and report back to the committee.” Steven C. Preston, the former administrator of the agency, adopted rules last year that small businesses recertify their size when they merge with a larger business or are at the five-year point in a contract. The American Small Business League, a small business association, said the problems with small business contracts went far deeper than even the inspector general found. The league’s president, Lloyd Chapman, said large companies were getting the contracts not simply because of errors but because of “the intentional diversion of federal small business contract dollars to Fortune 500 firms.” Two years ago, the Interior Department said it had awarded more than 55 percent of its contract dollars to small businesses. But the inspector general’s evaluation said that contracting officers acknowledged that some of the companies were not small and “were incorrectly coded as small.” One of the companies cited, John Deere, won more than $617,000 in small business contracts from the Interior Department in 2006 and 2007. The company, with 52,000 employees and revenue nearing $23 billion last year, said that it was moving to correct the errors in the government database that listed it as having $2 million in annual revenue and under 500 employees. The government defines a small business as one with fewer than 500 employees. “A marketing unit of Deere had correctly listed the number of employees in that small business unit on a government form, and this number has been used by government agencies to define the entire Deere enterprise as a small business,” said Ken Golden, a company spokesman. The Interior Department report also found that contracting officers “failed to consistently check” the central contractors registry to determine the company’s true size. A spokesman for Xerox, William McKee, said the company’s review of the central registry revealed “several errors where business size was entered incorrectly” from such agents, and said the company was going to correct the mistaken data. “Xerox is not a small business, and has never attempted to portray itself as one,” he said.

Xerox said its board also approved an additional $1 billion for its stock buyback plan, on top of the $370 million remaining under the existing plan. Its shares climbed $1.08, to $14.33. The company had net income of $382 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $214 million, or 22 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue rose to $4.88 billion, from $4.38 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial on average expected earnings of 41 cents a share on revenue of $4.83 billion. Net income in 2007 was $1.14 billion, or $1.19 a share, down from $1.21 billion, or $1.22 a share, in 2006, and matching analysts’ expectations of $1.19 a share, according to Thomson Financial. For the year, Xerox reported revenue of $17.2 billion, up more than 8 percent from $15.9 billion the previous year, and slightly above Wall Street expectations of $17.17 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial. For the first quarter, Xerox forecast earnings per share of 25 cents to 28 cents. Analysts expected earnings per share of 28 cents. The chief executive, Anne M. Mulcahy, told investors that the number of pages printed on Xerox color systems  a crucial measurement of business because it provides post-sale revenue from color ink and supplies  was up 30 percent last year over 2006. Asked about the slowing economy, Ms. Mulcahy said that she saw “some mixed signals,” but that the company’s recurring sources of revenue give it “the opportunity to weather volatility in equipment sales much more than other companies.” Jeff Embersits, chief investment officer at Shareholder Value Management, said the quarterly results were “pretty solid,” but he was worried about the possible impact of an economic slowdown on the printer and copier industry. “I’m not real comfortable with the industry right now,” he said. “I’m not jumping in as a buy with both feet.” More Articles in Technology »The Xerox Corporation, the office equipment maker, reported on Thursday that profit rose 79 percent in the fourth quarter, mostly because of cost controls and growth in equipment financing and services.

Skip to next paragraph The New York Times Add to Portfolio Xerox Corp Go to your Portfolio » The company knows that you do. And it is sick of it. After all, Xerox doesn’t even make standalone copiers anymore. These days, Xerox gets most of its revenue from machines that both print and copy and that can be plugged into networks for use in offices and high-speed publishing. It has introduced 100 products in the last three years. But it doesn’t want the Xerox name to conjure them up, either, given that services  like managing a company’s document flow  are a fast-growing part of the product mix, too. So on Monday, Xerox introduced what it says is the most sweeping transformation of its corporate identity since it dropped “Haloid” from the Haloid Xerox name in 1961. In a presentation to employees, it announced that it would retire the red capital X that has dominated its logo for 40 years in favor of what Richard Wergan, vice president for advertising, calls “a brand identity that reflects the Xerox of today.” The new logo consists of a bright red lower-case “xerox” that sits alongside a red sphere sketched with lines that link to form a stylized X. According to Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox’s chief, that little piece of art represents the connection to customers, partners, industry and innovation. Ms. Mulcahy insists that the Xerox brand stands for all those things already, of course. But clearly she is counting on the new look to drive home the point  perhaps subliminally  that Xerox is, as she put it, “engaging and approachable” as well as “technologically savvy and eager to lead in the 21st century.” That’s a tall task for a ball-and-X to accomplish. But Xerox points to a lot of research that says it is up to it.  Xerox and Interbrand, a brand consultant unit of Omnicom Group, spent more than 18 months interviewing some 5,000 people around the world about their associations with the Xerox name. Then they set about figuring how they could best retain the nice things it stands for (dependability and stability), jettison the not-so-nice (formal, somewhat stodgy)  and, most important, add attributes like modern, innovative and flexible. They wanted a logo that would work as well on the Internet and on a fast-moving motorcycle as it does in print or on television. (Xerox is a sponsor of the Ducati Xerox World Superbike Team.) “The Internet, sponsorships, all kinds of 3-D icons  none of that existed when Xerox adopted its old logo,” said Maryann J. Stump, senior director of brand strategy for Interbrand. “And you can do animation with a symbol that you just can’t do with a word-mark.” The Xerox/Interbrand team settled on lowercase letters because they seemed friendlier, and on a deeper red and a thicker font, to stand out better on the Web and on high-definition television. They chose a ball to suggest forward movement and “a holistic company,” Ms. Stump said. They also devised a series of variously colored “connectors”  swirled lines, reminiscent of the ribbons used to connote support for research on AIDS and breast cancer  that Xerox will etch on conference rooms at its new headquarters in Norwalk, Conn., and that it will use to connect images and text in broadcast commercials and print advertisements. Not everything about the logo is new. The research showed that people strongly associated Xerox with the color red, so that stayed. There was a bonus reason for keeping the color: Xerox sells heavily overseas, and “in the Asia/Pacific regions, the red resonates as good luck, prosperity and good will,” Ms. Stump said.  Xerox plans to display its new identity in a lot more places than it did the old. The ball, Ms. Stump said, is designed to be animated easily for use in multimedia formats, particularly in messages that can be beamed to hand-held devices. A couple of these animated treatments are ready to roll: one has the new logo zooming backward and another shows a red background with a pattern of stripes that rotates as it recedes to form the new logo. Mr. Wergan said that the new brand identity will be the basis for a “multimillion-dollar campaign” in 2008; he would not give a specific figure. Michael Moeller, a Xerox spokesman, was a bit more revealing, saying that the company had budgeted for a “double-digit percentage increase” in its spending on interactive and online media this year and a reduction in more traditional media like television and print. The new branding was introduced on the Xerox Web site Monday but Xerox said it expected that it would take as long as two years to finish converting all of its packaging, marketing materials, office stationery and signs to the new look. Outside experts were divided on whether Xerox had hit on a brilliant plan or whether it was throwing good money after bad. Simon Williams, president of the consulting firm Sterling Brands, said he thought the new logo was a home run. “Xerox just isn’t an old, fusty copier company anymore, but I’ll bet it is often still seen that way,” he said. “The lower-case name will be less intimidating, more about dialog than about being authoritative. And the logoptic”  meaning the ball  “adds energy, youthfulness and dynamism.” But Michael Watras, president of the brand consultancy Straightline International, said nothing short of a name change would wrest Xerox from the grasp of its copier reputation. “They should have kept the Xerox brand on some products, but renamed the company.” he said. “Without that, this is money poorly spent. If I were a shareholder, I’d be outraged.” Mr. Wergan disagrees. The new logo “is one of the most significant changes we could make to disrupt the mental model of our being a copier brand,” he insisted. But, he conceded, the new logo is not enough on its own. “Everything about the brand has got to reflect the modern Xerox,” he said. “So the changes to the visual identity are just part of a comprehensive brand evolution that will take place over the course of the next one, two, three years and beyond.” More Articles in Business »STILL think copier when you hear the name Xerox?

Not everything about the logo is new. The research showed that people strongly associated Xerox with the color red, so that stayed. There was a bonus reason for keeping the color: Xerox sells heavily overseas, and “in the Asia/Pacific regions, the red resonates as good luck, prosperity and good will,” Ms. Stump said.  Xerox plans to display its new identity in a lot more places than it did the old. The ball, Ms. Stump said, is designed to be animated easily for use in multimedia formats, particularly in messages that can be beamed to hand-held devices. A couple of these animated treatments are ready to roll: one has the new logo zooming backward and another shows a red background with a pattern of stripes that rotates as it recedes to form the new logo. Mr. Wergan said that the new brand identity will be the basis for a “multimillion-dollar campaign” in 2008; he would not give a specific figure. Michael Moeller, a Xerox spokesman, was a bit more revealing, saying that the company had budgeted for a “double-digit percentage increase” in its spending on interactive and online media this year and a reduction in more traditional media like television and print. The new branding was introduced on the Xerox Web site Monday but Xerox said it expected that it would take as long as two years to finish converting all of its packaging, marketing materials, office stationery and signs to the new look. Outside experts were divided on whether Xerox had hit on a brilliant plan or whether it was throwing good money after bad. Simon Williams, president of the consulting firm Sterling Brands, said he thought the new logo was a home run. “Xerox just isn’t an old, fusty copier company anymore, but I’ll bet it is often still seen that way,” he said. “The lower-case name will be less intimidating, more about dialog than about being authoritative. And the logoptic”  meaning the ball  “adds energy, youthfulness and dynamism.” But Michael Watras, president of the brand consultancy Straightline International, said nothing short of a name change would wrest Xerox from the grasp of its copier reputation. “They should have kept the Xerox brand on some products, but renamed the company.” he said. “Without that, this is money poorly spent. If I were a shareholder, I’d be outraged.” Mr. Wergan disagrees. The new logo “is one of the most significant changes we could make to disrupt the mental model of our being a copier brand,” he insisted. But, he conceded, the new logo is not enough on its own. “Everything about the brand has got to reflect the modern Xerox,” he said. “So the changes to the visual identity are just part of a comprehensive brand evolution that will take place over the course of the next one, two, three years and beyond.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E1DF1738F933A15752C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=xeroxcorporation">A Dividend at Xerox<date>Published: November 20, 2007</date><text>Xerox announced its first quarterly cash dividend in six years on Monday and predicted double-digit earnings growth in the coming years, citing new products and a stronger balance sheet.

One is a brash risk-taker who bootstrapped his way from an Alabama cotton farm to one of Wall Street's largest brokerage firms. The other made his mark as a consensus builder who leveraged ties to one of America's most powerful families to eventually lead the world's largest media company. E. Stanley O'Neal, 56, at Merrill Lynch and Richard D. Parsons, 59, at Time Warner, have nevertheless inhabited the public imagination as two executives who helped rewrite history by breaking down cultural barriers and rising to lead Fortune 500 companies. But Mr. O'Neal retired under pressure this week after an unauthorized merger approach to a rival bank and an $8.4 billion write-down that resulted in an overall loss of $2.3 billion for the quarter. And Mr. Parsons has announced that he planned to retire by March at the latest. He has been under pressure to turn the reins over to Time Warner's president, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, whom analysts say is likely to accelerate a shake-up by spinning off business units like AOL and Time Warner Cable. Along with ruminations on their legacies, their situations have led to a debate over whether their accomplishments have helped break down barriers facing a younger generation of black executives angling for the corner office. Industry observers and civil rights leaders say Mr. O'Neal's ouster has shed much-needed light on the dearth of African-Americans in so-called C-level positions in corporations, while underscoring the extent to which executive suites and boardrooms remain white male bastions. The subject of race has proven to be delicate for African-American executives, many of whom prefer to view themselves as -- at least publicly -- an ''an executive who happens to be black.'' They have earned the right through hard work, they say, to be judged on their merits. ''We have demonstrated that we can not only run companies and in many cases, run them quite well,'' says Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, a nonprofit civil rights organization. ''There is an abundance of African-American talent out there. My hope is that they will get their chance to rise up and pick up the mantle.'' The chief executive of StarCom, Renatta McCann, said, ''The victories of leaders like Stanley O'Neal and Richard Parsons are both symbolic and transformational.'' That said, she added. ''we have yet to reach a tipping point where the pipeline organically regenerates. We have to achieve momentum and velocity, and it has to achieve scale to make it sustainable.'' To be sure, African-American chief executives preside over several large companies, including American Express (Kenneth I. Chenault), Aetna (Ronald A. Williams), Darden Restaurants (Clarence Otis Jr.), Sears (Aylwin B. Lewis) and Symantec (John W. Thompson). Several African-Americans also run or hold senior roles in major subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies like General Electric (Lloyd G. Trotter), McDonald's (Don Thompson), the Boeing Company (James A. Bell) and Xerox (Ursula Burns). While some critics this week raised questions of race in Mr. O'Neal's ouster, analysts and those with knowledge of Merrill's actions, say that was not the case. Mr. O'Neal was judged, they said, by the same standards of others in his position -- the company's performance and his relationship to the board. Mr. O'Neal could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Merrill, Jason H. Wright, said: ''During the years Stan was here, as an organization we very much embraced a meritocracy and inclusiveness that has translated into a more diverse work force that we're proud of. The board has been very engaged in those initiatives and has no intention of changing, regardless of who is C.E.O.'' Alfred Edmond Jr., editor in chief of Black Enterprise magazine, said, ''One of the biggest lessons is that being C.E.O. doesn't make you bulletproof.'' ''First we had to learn what it takes to get into that top spot,'' Mr. Edmond said, ''and now we're learning what it's like to live in it.''</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E4DA1531F937A1575AC0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=xeroxcorporation">In a Switch, Charging More for Printers and Less for Ink<date>Published: September 24, 2007</date><text>Is the printer industry abandoning the give-away-the-razor-to-make-money-on-the-blades model? In February, Eastman Kodak introduced a line of consumer ink-jet printers that sell for about $50 more than competitive models but use much cheaper ink. And today Xerox is unveiling a costly solid-ink printer for businesses that will print color pages at the same price as black and white. The printer, which can handle 30 pages a minute, will cost $2,499, about $900 more than laser printers that operate at similar speeds. The cost of ink to print 14,000 black-and-white ink pages is about $216, in line with the price for a page from laser printers using toner. But the cost of printing in color will be the same, $72 each for the three ink sticks needed for a wide-color spectrum. Laser toner to print the same number of color pages could cost five times as much. ''That model, pricing color sticks at one-third of black, is going to be disruptive in this industry,'' predicted David R. Spencer, president of Spencer &amp; Associates Publishing, which consults for printers and helped Xerox test the new product. There is no question about which industry behemoth Xerox hopes to disrupt. According to IDC, the market consultants who track industry sales, Hewlett-Packard commanded almost 40 percent of the global market for color laser printers last year, up from 33 percent in 2005. Xerox's share held steady at 10 percent in that period. And Angele Boyd, an IDC vice president who specializes in imaging and printing, doubts Xerox will gain much ground. ''The bulk of the market still wants low-cost hardware, so it's not like this will catapult Xerox ahead of H.P., or even help it nip harder at H.P.'s heels,'' she said. ''But it could help Xerox sustain its position.'' Xerox insists it will not settle for status quo. ''We know that lots of customers just don't consider anyone but H.P.,'' said James Rise, the vice president in charge of the solid ink business at Xerox. ''But we are offering such a compelling value proposition that a lot of those customers are going to consider Xerox.'' Hewlett's executives are not quaking at the prospect. Vincent L. Ferraro, vice president for worldwide marketing for Hewlett's laser printing business, said Hewlett has explored solid ink, too, but decided against it. ''Sure, cost per page is important, but it's not more important than print quality or ease of use,'' he said. ''And we still think that laser delivers a higher quality image in a faster amount of time.'' Solid-ink technology involves molding ink into crayonlike forms, which are then melted onto the paper by the printer. Xerox has been tinkering with solid ink since 2000, when it obtained the technology as part of its purchase of the color printing and imaging division of Tektronix. The print from solid ink scratches more easily than liquid inks or powdered toners, but ''if you know what you're doing, that's really not a problem,'' said Joseph Balla, director of information technology for Watson Realty, a Florida firm that was part of Xerox's test for the product. Evidence continues to mount that people will print more if costs come down. Kodak, which has been selling its latest printers since April, is on track to meet its goal of selling 500,000 units this year, said David Lanzillo, a Kodak spokesman. But more important, he said, users of the new printers buy, on average, nine ink cartridges a year, compared with an industry average of four. ''Consumers told us all along that they were limiting printing because of high ink costs, and that's what we sought to address,'' Mr. Lanzillo said. Printing is not as discretionary for businesses, but color printing is. Watson Realty, which sends myriad color brochures and postcards to prospective buyers and sellers, was considering centralizing its printing operations at its Jacksonville headquarters to control costs. Instead, when Xerox invited Watson to join tests of its new printers last year, Watson bought 95 of them and distributed them to its 45 offices. Mr. Balla said that Watson's annual printing costs formerly topped $1 million; this year, they will be about $200,000. ''Those printers paid for themselves in a couple of months,'' he said.

Not coincidentally, the editorial theme of the issue is the growing personalization of all things in cyberspace, and the headline over the photo is You are here. Wired, which is owned by Condé Nast, publicized the promotion to its subscribers via e-mail, magazine inserts and on its Web site. And while the Xerox name is not on the covers themselves, the promotions and Web site made clear that the project depended on software from Xerox and the companys iGen3 110 digital production press. Neither Xerox nor Condé Nast would disclose costs, but since neither had to farm tasks out to third parties, both say it was not very expensive. We didnt make money on this, but it really didnt cost anything, said Drew Schutte, vice president and publishing director of Wired Media. Which was probably a good thing, since neither company expects to get an immediate rush of sales from the do-it-yourself cover. Wired aimed its promotion entirely at people who already subscribe. And those people tend to be younger, male and affluent, according to Mr. Schutte, which means they have probably not risen high enough in the corporate ranks to where they can authorize purchases of expensive equipment. But new sales were not the immediate goal for either Wired or Xerox. Both companies are looking to update their images. In Wireds case, that meant integrating  or rather, re-integrating  the way it markets itself. In 1998, five years after Wired first started publishing, Condé Nast bought the magazine and Lycos bought the Web site. Lycos, and thus Wired.com, has been through a series of ownership changes since then. Last July, Condé Nast bought the Web site from Daum Communications, its last owner. It created Wired Media and gave Mr. Schutte responsibility for integrating all of Wireds offerings. Wired will sponsor a science show on public television this fall, and it is working with a homebuilder in Los Angeles to build a green wired home. And, of course, it is trying to draw more traffic to its Web site. Were going to give our advertisers the integrated, turnkey solutions that they want, Mr. Schutte said. But if were going to create buzz for an advertiser, we want to create buzz for ourselves as well. So the Wired marketers suggested the collaboration to Xerox. Xerox had done 70,000 personalized covers for the December 2006 issue of Graphic Arts Monthly, in which it printed subscribers first names as stars against a night sky, and their companies names on a rocket ship. But that cover used the Graphic Arts database; a reader-generated cover represented uncharted territory. We jumped at it, we loved it, it clicked immediately, said Joanna Havlin, a partner in Media Edge: Cia, the media planning and buying unit of WPP that represents Xerox. It was a way to showcase Xerox as an innovator, a technology leader and a document solutions provider. It could also help Xerox bury a stereotype. What was once its greatest blessing is now a lingering curse  the name Xerox was so linked to stand-alone copier machines that a whole generation of people used it as a lowercase verb. These days Xerox sells all sorts of copiers and printers that can be connected to networks, as well as software and services that allow publishers to print books on demand, banks to personalize bills inserts  or, of course, magazines with personalized covers. But the Xerox name is not at all synonymous with those activities. With this promotion, Xerox will get to demonstrative an inventive, fresh technology, and it will get a halo effect just by linking itself to a young, edgy brand like Wired, said Allen P. Adamson, managing director for the brand consulting firm Landor Associates. Granted, few Wired subscribers are likely customers for an iGen3 production printer, a heavy-duty piece of business equipment. But that does not bother Xerox. Indeed, Xerox has been a regular advertiser on Wired.com for more than two years and for even longer in the magazine. For the July issue, it bought the back cover on all the issues; in the 5,000 customized ones, it took the inside front and inside back covers, too. The Wired audience is savvy and forward thinking, and even if they are not yet buyers, they are influencers, said Barbara Basney, director of global advertising at Xerox. Xerox and Wired are also doing some direct influencing themselves. At the March convention of TED  the annual Technology, Entertainment and Design conference attended by high-ranking executives in the advertising and printing world  they set up a booth at which attendees could have their pictures taken. Each will receive a personalized July issue of Wired. They also printed covers for David Letterman, Katie Couric and other television celebrities who could possible mention it on their shows. And, of course, they reached out to reporters at business publications that reach a wider audience than Wired. One reason to do an inventive campaign is to get the press interested, since they will write stories that reach the people who make the buying decisions, said Ran Kivetz, a professor of marketing at the Columbia Business School. Nor is the promotion over when the last July issue is sent. For another two months, anyone can upload a photo to Wired.com, write a headline, and print a personalized cover at home (or e-mail it to friends or post it on blogs or MySpace pages). Xerox, meanwhile, is already working out details with Time magazines Canadian edition to gives its subscribers a chance to get their September issue with a personalized cover wrapped around the regular one.

Skip to next paragraph Kevin Rivoli for the Xerox Corporation Adjusting color on printers should be simpler, Geoffrey Woolfe says. Related More on Color Language Research (xerox.com) But when software tells a printer to reproduce that image, it uses a long, unwieldy set of numbers and letters to describe those colors  and a totally different set of characters to describe shades that are a tad lighter, or a bit darker, or a whole lot brighter. The upshot is that most laymen would have to attend the computer equivalent of Berlitz to learn how to get the shades they want. But if Xerox has its way, that will not be true much longer. This week the company introduced the software equivalent of a translator that can turn plain color speech into fluent computerese. Type the command, Make the sun a brighter yellow, and the printer will read, Go with color CIELAB[88, -3, 64]. You shouldnt have to be a color expert to make the sky a deeper blue or add a bit of yellow to a sunset, said Geoffrey Woolfe, a principal scientist in the Xerox Innovation Group, who is based in Webster, N.Y., near Rochester. So were providing that middle layer that turns plain speech into mathematical code. Color experts are already impressed. Theyve taken common words and modifiers and transformed them into mathematical directions, said Roy S. Berns, a professor of color science at the Rochester Institute of Technology, which has just inaugurated a doctoral program in color science. There are still problems to be ironed out, of course. For now, the software does not differentiate between colors in different parts of an image  in other words, it can tell the printer to make all the blues darker, but it cannot yet tell it to darken the sky but lighten the ocean and leave the blue dress alone. And it is still working on a lexicon of languages  after all, a brighter color to one person is a crisper color to another and a sharper color to a third. To understand what someone means when he says the pinks need to be brighter, the software must know what pink means and what brighter means. Professor Berns said. And there are individual, cultural and regional differences in the way people use those words. Mr. Woolfe readily acknowledges the problems, and he concedes that the product is a couple of years away from commercialization. He envisions the final version as having the capability to learn. Say particular users keep typing, no, darker when they ask for chartreuse. The machine will respond with a color chart that shows what it views as chartreuse, and then will let the user show what he means by the word, Mr. Woolfe said. If it turns out the user thinks chartreuse is forest green, the software will act accordingly from then on. Xerox also expects to display a preview version on the screen to show how the colors in the print might differ from the image on the monitor, so that the user can modify the colors before printing. Mr. Woolfe said later versions might include voice recognition, so users could literally tell the printer what colors they wanted. The important thing, he said, is that people without technical skills will finally have an easy way to get the colors they want. More Articles in Technology »To the human eye, that flower in the photo is reddish orange, that sky is light blue, that sun shines brilliant yellow.

Type the command, Make the sun a brighter yellow, and the printer will read, Go with color CIELAB[88, -3, 64]. You shouldnt have to be a color expert to make the sky a deeper blue or add a bit of yellow to a sunset, said Geoffrey Woolfe, a principal scientist in the Xerox Innovation Group, who is based in Webster, N.Y., near Rochester. So were providing that middle layer that turns plain speech into mathematical code. Color experts are already impressed. Theyve taken common words and modifiers and transformed them into mathematical directions, said Roy S. Berns, a professor of color science at the Rochester Institute of Technology, which has just inaugurated a doctoral program in color science. There are still problems to be ironed out, of course. For now, the software does not differentiate between colors in different parts of an image  in other words, it can tell the printer to make all the blues darker, but it cannot yet tell it to darken the sky but lighten the ocean and leave the blue dress alone. And it is still working on a lexicon of languages  after all, a brighter color to one person is a crisper color to another and a sharper color to a third. To understand what someone means when he says the pinks need to be brighter, the software must know what pink means and what brighter means. Professor Berns said. And there are individual, cultural and regional differences in the way people use those words. Mr. Woolfe readily acknowledges the problems, and he concedes that the product is a couple of years away from commercialization. He envisions the final version as having the capability to learn. Say particular users keep typing, no, darker when they ask for chartreuse. The machine will respond with a color chart that shows what it views as chartreuse, and then will let the user show what he means by the word, Mr. Woolfe said. If it turns out the user thinks chartreuse is forest green, the software will act accordingly from then on. Xerox also expects to display a preview version on the screen to show how the colors in the print might differ from the image on the monitor, so that the user can modify the colors before printing. Mr. Woolfe said later versions might include voice recognition, so users could literally tell the printer what colors they wanted. The important thing, he said, is that people without technical skills will finally have an easy way to get the colors they want.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/business/21xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Prices Are Lower, but Profit Is Up at Xerox<date>Published: April 21, 2007</date><text>Sometimes, low revenues portend good news. Take the Xerox Corporation. For the fifth quarter in a row, its revenues from copiers and printers have gone down. But ask Anne M. Mulcahy, the chief executive, what she plans to do about that, and her answer is, absolutely nothing. Dollars from equipment sales may be down but Xerox is placing a lot of machines. And that, Ms. Mulcahy insists, is what counts. “We will not sacrifice profitability to grow equipment revenues,” she said in an interview yesterday. “But we will sacrifice equipment revenues to drive profitability.” In the document-processing world, that makes total sense. Printer and copier companies make the most money from sales of toners, inks and services. And those sales, of course, are directly proportional to the number of machines being used. Xerox has always known that, but it is finally acting on it. Since January it has introduced 19 new products, more than all of last year. And it has been sharply cutting prices for its machines  hence the revenue declines  to sell more of them. “For 30 years, Xerox raised prices so it wouldn’t have to worry about costs,” noted Ulysses S. Yannas, a broker at Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid. “Now it is doing the opposite.” The new approach is working. According to Infotrends, a research firm, Xerox accounts for half of the pages produced on high-speed digital color presses. Black and white printing is not doing nearly as well, but analysts note that color printing offers about five times the profit of monochrome for Xerox. “Xerox really has a strong, wide portfolio, and they’ve put in place the engines to drive top-line growth,” said Angèle Boyd, a vice president of the research firm IDC. Xerox’s quarterly numbers reflect the favorable skew. Revenue for the first three months of 2007 was $3.8 billion, up 4 percent from last year. About 70 percent came from supplies and services. Xerox earned $233 million, a 17 percent rise from the comparable quarter in 2006. That came out to 24 cents a share, which beat analysts’ estimates by 4 cents. Costs are down, and will soon go down more  Xerox is leaving its lush headquarters in Stamford, Conn., for sparser space in Norwalk. Xerox said it would earn $1.12 to $1.16 a share for the year  and expected it would be closer to the high end. Investors applauded, sending Xerox shares up 52 cents, to $18.60. Still, some investors remain concerned that Xerox has not proved that it can deliver brisk growth. “The good quarter was driven by the cost structure, and we aren’t convinced that the revenue situation has been resolved,” said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. Neither is Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. Mr. Ghriskey agrees with all of Ms. Mulcahy’s strategies  but he is not buying Xerox shares. “The competition Xerox is facing for sales is just formidable,” he said. Indeed it is. Xerox remains the dominant player in the market for high-speed printers, for example, but others are nipping at its heels. “Xerox has been in the lead, but Kodak and Canon and Ricoh have been coming up fast,” said Patricia Sorce, co-director of the Printing Industry Center at the Rochester Institute of Technology. So has the Dutch company Oce. This week, Oce introduced a high-speed continuous feed printer  the paper goes through on rolls rather than cut sheets  that it plans to market to book publishers. And last year it introduced a high-speed cut-sheet machine that can simultaneously print on both sides of a sheet. Jan Hull, an Oce senior vice president, insisted that Oce is “already ahead of plan” to grab at least a 20 percent share of the high-speed market in the next four to five years. Ricoh, meanwhile, already commands a large share of the market for office printers, and has new high-speed printers coming out next year. Ricoh is also in the process of buying I.B.M.’s printing operations. “I.B.M. is really strong in the market for mission-critical applications like printing bills or checks,” said Ron Potesky, vice president for corporate product marketing at the Ricoh Americas Corporation. Ms. Mulcahy seems unworried. “Yes, there are a lot of people with aspirations, but we have a tremendous head start,” she said. Xerox has been on a buying spree of its own. This month it announced it was spending $1.5 billion to buy Global Imaging, a major distributor of office equipment to small and medium-size businesses. Until now, Global sold almost all brands except Xerox, but analysts expect that its 200,000 customers will be easily persuaded to switch brands. “Global has always offered great service, and its customers care more about that than the brand of machine,” said Shannon S. Cross, an analyst at Cross Research who rates Xerox shares a buy. Ms. Mulcahy points straight at Global when anyone questions her commitment to growth. “Buying Global was all about growing revenues,” she said. “So you could say we just invested $1.5 billion in a big catalyst for growth.” More Articles in Business »Sometimes, low revenues portend good news.

The creation of the organization, the Service Research and Innovation Initiative, will be officially announced today. It represents the latest step by technology companies and some universities to promote an emerging field that is being called service science. The early academic programs are a blend of computing, social sciences, engineering and management. The aim of service science is to try to improve productivity and accelerate the development of new offerings in services, which account for about 80 percent of the United States economy and similarly large shares of other Western economies. In the last couple of years, more than three dozen universities in several countries have added service science courses, and the National Science Foundation has begun financing a few service research projects. Among corporations, I.B.M. has been a leader in promoting service science programs in universities, and it has reoriented its own research laboratories to focus more on services. We need a professional organization to help promote service science, said James C. Spohrer, director of service research at the I.B.M.

But with the technology bubble bursting, the price that investors were willing to pay for a piece of PARC, as the center is known, kept going down. So in 2002, Xerox switched to Plan B: it spun off the center into an independent subsidiary and sought to prove that it could sustain itself by licensing technology and forming partnerships with outside companies. On Friday, PARC is announcing a deal that underscores that strategy. It is licensing a broad portfolio of patents and technology to a well-financed start-up with an ambitious and potentially lucrative goal: to build a search engine that could some day rival Google. The start-up, Powerset, is licensing PARCs natural language technology  the art of making computers understand and process languages like English or French. Powerset hopes the technology will be the basis of a new search engine that allows users to type queries in plain English, rather than using keywords. In the fall, Powerset raised $12.5 million in its first round of financing from venture-capital firms and individual investors. The challenges facing it are immense, and the odds of success are low. But the PARC technology, which is a result of 30 years of research, is certain to lend it an aura of credibility. PARCs natural-language technology is among the most comprehensive in existence, said Fernando Pereira, an expert in natural language and the chairman of the department of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. But by itself, it will not guarantee Powersets success, Mr. Pereira said. The question of whether this technology is adequate to any application, whether search or anything else, is an empirical question that has to be tested, Mr. Pereira added. As part of the deal, a leading natural-language researcher at PARC, Ronald M. Kaplan, will join Powersets staff of about 40 as chief technology and scientific officer. PARC will also receive an equity stake in Powerset and earn royalties from the company. Additionally, Powerset will sponsor a handful of researchers at PARC. The specific financial terms of the agreement are not being disclosed. But Mark Bernstein, president and center director of PARC, said: Its one of the biggest deals that we have done, and we hope that it grows into the biggest in terms of the length of the relationship and the amount of value we can create together. It represents a commitment of some of the intellectual crown jewels that PARC has created. As part of the business model forged when it was spun off, PARC has struck various business relationships with outside firms and organizations. About half of its research is still sponsored by Xerox, Mr. Bernstein said. But the lab is also conducting paid research for Fujitsu, Dai Nippon Printing and others. Some of its researchers work on federally financed projects, and the lab is working with ipValue, a intellectual-property licensing firm, to commercialize some of its research. PARC has also formed a partnership with the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego to develop a system that uses laser printing technology to detect cancer cells. And in the deal that most closely mirrors the alliance with Powerset, PARC has helped incubate SolFocus, a start-up that is developing solar power technology. PARC now has about 220 employees, including 160 researchers, down from its peak of 318 employees and 100 contractors and temporary workers in 1995. Mr. Bernstein said PARC, which has an annual budget of $55 million to $60 million, is profitable. We are very pleased with where it is today, Anne M. Mulcahy, Xeroxs chief executive, said about PARC. Ms. Mulcahy said she did not rule out the possibility of selling an equity stake in PARC in the future, but added, We are very comfortable with continued ownership. In Silicon Valley and beyond, PARC has often been called the lab of missed opportunities. It has been credited with many breakthroughs, including the graphical user interface and the Ethernet networking technology, that have revolutionized the computer industry, but that were commercialized by others. Theres no way anyone can top what they did in the past in terms of dramatic research developments, said the futurist Paul Saffo, a fellow at the Institute for the Future. But Mr. Saffo praised PARC for finding a business model that has allowed it to survive at a time when many research groups at American corporations are being cut. This is an organization that has done well at keeping researchers, and spinning out a steady stream of little products, Mr. Saffo said. PARC has been a very quiet success. The success of its bet on Powerset is another matter. Over the past year, PARC researchers have worked with Powerset engineers to build a prototype, but the company does not expect to release its search engine to the public until the end of this year. Meanwhile, other start-ups and several of the search giants are also working to develop natural-language search technology. The appeal is clear. A successful natural-language search engine could, in theory, answer real questions  for example, what companies did I.B.M. acquire in the last five years?  that existing search engines are not equipped to handle. And it could turn the process of finding information on the Web into a conversation between the search engine and the user. For a lot of things, keyword search works well, said Barney Pell, chief executive of Powerset. But I think we are going to look back in 10 years and say, remember when we used to search using keywords. Researchers have predicted breakthrough applications for natural languages for years, but the technology has proved usable in only limited contexts, turning many experts into skeptics about its potential, at least in the short term. My general feeling about natural-language processing in search is that Im a bit of a skeptic in the sense that even the best systems, and I include there the systems from PARC, make many mistakes, said Mr. Pereira of the University of Pennsylvania. In a November interview, Marissa Mayer, Googles vice president for search and user experience, said: Natural language is really hard. I dont think it will happen in the next five years. More Articles in Technology »SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8  Early in the decade, a struggling Xerox Corporation was trying to sell off a stake in its Palo Alto Research Center, which it could no longer afford to support.

And it could turn the process of finding information on the Web into a conversation between the search engine and the user. For a lot of things, keyword search works well, said Barney Pell, chief executive of Powerset. But I think we are going to look back in 10 years and say, remember when we used to search using keywords. Researchers have predicted breakthrough applications for natural languages for years, but the technology has proved usable in only limited contexts, turning many experts into skeptics about its potential, at least in the short term. My general feeling about natural-language processing in search is that Im a bit of a skeptic in the sense that even the best systems, and I include there the systems from PARC, make many mistakes, said Mr. Pereira of the University of Pennsylvania. In a November interview, Marissa Mayer, Googles vice president for search and user experience, said: Natural language is really hard. I dont think it will happen in the next five years.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/business/24xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Profit at Xerox Declines<date>Published: January 24, 2007</date><text>The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit dropped 24 percent, pulled down by a higher revamping charge, but it still beat analysts’ expectations.

The technique allowed the automatic reuse of blocks of memory that were storing unused programs and data. Today an anthropologist at the center, Brinda Dalal, has become a self-styled garbologist to assist in a joint effort with chemists at the Xerox Research Center of Canada to develop an erasable paper system. The goal is to recycle paper documents produced by the companys copiers  potentially an unlimited number of times. What she has discovered is a notable change in the role of paper in modern offices, where it is increasingly used as a medium of display rather than storage. Documents are stored on central servers and personal computers and printed only as needed; for meetings, editing or reviewing information. The pieces of paper spewed from copiers frequently end up back in the recycling bin on the same day they are printed, she noted. Of the 1,200 pages the average office worker prints per month, 44.5 percent are for daily use  assignments, drafts or e-mail. In her research, scouring the waste produced by office workers, she found that 21 percent of black-and-white copier documents were returned to the recycling bin on the same day they were produced. We were surprised by our results, she said. Nobody looks at the ephemeral information going through peoples waste baskets. Her research is part of a three-year-old technology development effort to design an add-on system for an office copier to produce transient documents that can be easily reused. The researchers now have a prototype system that will produce documents on a specially coated paper with a light yellow tint. Currently, the process works without toner and produces a low-resolution document that appears to be printed with purple ink. The printed information on the document disappears within 16 hours. The documents can be reused more quickly by simply placing them in the copier paper tray. The researchers said that individual pieces of paper had been printed on up to 50 times, and the only current limit in the process appears to be paper life. People really like paper, said Eric J. Shrader, a computer scientist who is area manager for printing systems at the Hardware Systems Laboratory of the research center, which is known as PARC. They like the way it feels. The project is still very much in a laboratory phase, he said. The researchers are still trying to refine the process, both to increase contrast and to extend control over the lifespan of the print process. During the 1990s, the Japanese office equipment maker Ricoh developed a commercial system that made it possible to remove toner from paper to make recycling possible, he said. It was possible to recycle individual pieces of paper up to 10 times, according to Ricoh, but that system is no longer commercially available. Xerox has not yet decided whether it will commercialize its technology, Mr. Shrader said, but the goal is to create a system where the specially coated paper costs between two and three times standard copier paper, making the total cost of the system substantially less than conventional paper when paper is reused repeatedly. The company said the precise nature of the technology was proprietary and that Xerox had applied for a number of related patents covering the invention. The researchers describe the invention as being based on compounds that can change color when they absorb a certain wavelength of light, but can then gradually revert to their original appearance. The compounds currently self-erase in about 16 to 24 hours, or can be erased immediately when heated. The challenge Xerox faces is to find a market for a new paper printing technology in an era when information is increasingly being viewed and read on electronic displays of all types. For example, PARC itself has done extensive research on the idea of electronic paper. Its researchers separately developed an electronic reusable paper system called Gyricon. A Gyricon sheet is a thin layer of transparent plastic composed of small beads similar to toner particles. The beads are bichromal, with light and dark sides. When a voltage is applied at different positions on the sheet, the beads rotate to create an image. Xerox tried unsuccessfully to commercialize the technology. The Sony Reader, introduced this year, is based on a similar technology developed by the E Ink Corporation of Cambridge, Mass. I worry that this would be like coming out with Super 8 just before the video camera, said Paul Saffo, a Silicon Valley researcher who has been a consultant to Xerox. This would have been a bigger deal 10 years ago. These days theres so much getting read online I wonder if time hasnt passed this by. More Articles in Technology »PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 21  During the 1970s, researchers at Xeroxs Palo Alto Research Center explored a software technique called garbage collection used for recycling computer memory.

Correction Appended The Xerox Corporation, still struggling to become as much an undisputed leader in digital imaging machines as it was in old-style copiers, said yesterday that high training costs, pricing pressures and slow sales had combined to drive its earnings below analysts' expectations. Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said it earned $200 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $210 million, also 20 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2004. Revenue was $3.69 billion, compared with $3.77 billion in the year-earlier period. Analysts had expected Xerox to earn 21 cents. The company's shares fell 80 cents, or 5.4 percent, to close at $14 yesterday. "It was definitely a disappointing quarter," said Shannon S. Cross, an analyst with Cross Research/Soleil Investments who rates Xerox shares a buy. "They made all the right decisions for making customers happy, but it really impacted their costs." The quarter did have bright spots. Xerox sold more service contracts and supplies like ink and paper than it did last year. And the number of color pages made on Xerox equipment was up 41 percent in the quarter  a significant number, analysts say, because color printing is the most lucrative part of the imaging market. Still, Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox's chief executive, made no attempt to sugarcoat the quarter. "Clearly, I am disappointed in our gross profit decline," she told analysts on a conference call yesterday. Several factors contributed to the shortfall. Xerox sharply cut prices on some black and white copiers, which increased sales but hurt margins. Gross margins were 40.2 percent for the quarter, a drop of 1.6 percentage points from last year. In addition, many senior maintenance people took voluntary buyouts last year, and Xerox invested heavily in training less experienced workers to service high-end equipment. Xerox also signed several contracts to manage document flow for other companies. The revenue from those contracts will start coming in next quarter, but Xerox has already incurred the costs of hiring workers to fulfill the contracts. Nuvera, a printer that Xerox introduced last year that can print 144 pages a minute, got off to a slow start, in part because it did not have the binding, stapling and other finishing abilities that book publishers normally require. Xerox has just introduced the finishing ability, and expects its sales to increase accordingly. Ms. Mulcahy reassured analysts that Xerox will meet earnings expectations of $1 to $1.10 for the year. But investors may be a hard sell. "The sales aren't there, and there are just too many moving parts on the cost side," said Ulysses A. Yannas, who follows Xerox for Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid and is avoiding Xerox shares. Xerox was helped in the first quarter by a lower tax rate than expected, and several analysts said they worried that Xerox would meet its numbers for the year through low taxes and share repurchases rather than increased sales. "Xerox is operating in a competitive environment that is not just intense, but intensifying," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, who is steering clear of Xerox shares. "Maybe they will make their numbers for the year, but it may not be with quality earnings." The big unknown is whether customers will step up their purchases of office equipment. A growing number of companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Kodak and Canon, are actively looking for slices of the printing and copying pie, yet the pie as a whole is not getting bigger. "The office equipment market doesn't seem to be getting a big share of the recovery in capital spending," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman Sachs who is neutral on Xerox shares. "So it's not like the other guys are hitting the cover off the ball, either." Correction: April 26, 2006 The Market Place column in Business Day on Tuesday about first quarter earnings for the Xerox Corporation misstated its estimate for how much it would earn for the year.

In addition, many senior maintenance people took voluntary buyouts last year, and Xerox invested heavily in training less experienced workers to service high-end equipment. Xerox also signed several contracts to manage document flow for other companies. The revenue from those contracts will start coming in next quarter, but Xerox has already incurred the costs of hiring workers to fulfill the contracts. Nuvera, a printer that Xerox introduced last year that can print 144 pages a minute, got off to a slow start, in part because it did not have the binding, stapling and other finishing abilities that book publishers normally require. Xerox has just introduced the finishing ability, and expects its sales to increase accordingly. Ms. Mulcahy reassured analysts that Xerox will meet earnings expectations of $1 to $1.10 for the year. But investors may be a hard sell. "The sales aren't there, and there are just too many moving parts on the cost side," said Ulysses A. Yannas, who follows Xerox for Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid and is avoiding Xerox shares. Xerox was helped in the first quarter by a lower tax rate than expected, and several analysts said they worried that Xerox would meet its numbers for the year through low taxes and share repurchases rather than increased sales. "Xerox is operating in a competitive environment that is not just intense, but intensifying," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, who is steering clear of Xerox shares. "Maybe they will make their numbers for the year, but it may not be with quality earnings." The big unknown is whether customers will step up their purchases of office equipment. A growing number of companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Kodak and Canon, are actively looking for slices of the printing and copying pie, yet the pie as a whole is not getting bigger. "The office equipment market doesn't seem to be getting a big share of the recovery in capital spending," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman Sachs who is neutral on Xerox shares. "So it's not like the other guys are hitting the cover off the ball, either." Correction: April 26, 2006 The Market Place column in Business Day on Tuesday about first quarter earnings for the Xerox Corporation misstated its estimate for how much it would earn for the year. It is $1 to $1.07 a share, not $1 to $1.10 a share.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/23/business/23audit.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">KPMG Auditors Settle S.E.C. Case Over Inflated Xerox Profits<date>Published: February 23, 2006</date><text>Four auditors from KPMG who were involved in its audits of the Xerox Corporation settled suits yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with two of them agreeing to pay the largest fines ever levied by the commission against individual auditors. Michael A. Conway, formerly the top technical accounting partner at the firm and the senior partner in the Xerox audit of 2000, and Ronald A. Safran, who was the senior partner in the Xerox audits of 1998 and 1999, each agreed to pay $150,000 fines. A third partner, Anthony P. Dolanski, who supervised the 1997 audit, agreed to pay $100,000. The fines are insignificant in relation to the total of about $55 million already assessed in penalties as a result of the audits, which the S.E.C. said allowed Xerox to engage in fraudulent manipulations of leases for its equipment, inflating profits. A fourth partner, Thomas Yoho, who reviewed all four audits before KPMG certified the statements, accepted a censure by the S.E.C. but was not part of the consent decree filed in federal court. Another KPMG partner settled earlier by agreeing to pay $100,000. Previously, the commission had obtained fines against seven individual auditors in four cases, none of more than $85,000. Linda Chatman Thomsen, the commission's director of enforcement, said, "This case represents the S.E.C.'s willingness to litigate important accounting fraud allegations against major accounting firms and their audit partners, even where the accounting was complex." And Paul R. Berger, associate director of enforcement for investigations, added: "The Xerox fraud was a wide-ranging four-year scheme to defraud investors. Investors and the marketplace are the victims and deserve better from their corporate executives and auditor gatekeepers." The settlements brought an end to one of the most contentious fights between the S.E.C. and an auditing firm. Even after Xerox restated its results and accepted a fine of $10 million, KPMG insisted that it had acted properly and that the S.E.C. was pursuing the case to justify its large expenses in the investigation. An additional $22 million was paid by six former senior executives of Xerox. KPMG argued that it forced Xerox to restate earlier financial results in 2000, although not by as much as it eventually did, and that much of the argument over other issues dealt with complicated accounting questions that had no clear answer. The commission, though, said the record showed that KPMG repeatedly fought with Xerox but gave in and allowed bad accounting. KPMG settled with the S.E.C. in April 2005, as new leadership at the firm sought to put the legal issues behind it. The firm paid $22.5 million in penalties, interest and forfeiture of auditing fees from Xerox. It also agreed to change its business practices. The partners sought to have the charges dismissed after extensive discovery proceedings. But in December, a United States District Court judge in Manhattan, Denise L. Cote, ruled that the case could go to trial though she dismissed some charges. That appeared to lead to the settlement negotiations. In addition to the fines, the three partners who accepted consent decrees were suspended from practicing before the S.E.C., which means that they cannot audit public companies. Mr. Safran can reapply in three years, Mr. Conway in two and Mr. Dolanski in one. Mr. Yoho and Mr. Safran remain KPMG partners. Mr. Dolanski left the firm in 1998 to take another job and Mr. Conway retired in 2004. A lawyer for Mr. Yoho said his client was pleased to have put the matter behind him. Lawyers for the other partners either could not be reached or had no comment.

The former partner, Joseph T. Boyle, 62, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and accepted an injunction barring him from violating a section of the securities laws in the future. The S.E.C. also barred him from auditing public companies for a year. He neither admitted nor denied the accusations. The $100,000 fine was the largest ever imposed on an individual auditor by the S.E.C., said James A. Kidney, the assistant chief litigation counsel of the S.E.C. KPMG paid $22.5 million in August to settle its part of the case. Mr. Boyle was KPMG's relationship partner with Xerox in 1999 and 2000, at a time when KPMG auditors were concerned over what some saw as violations of accounting rules by the company. The S.E.C. later charged Xerox with abusing accounting rules to continue reporting strong profits even as competition in the copier market intensified. The S.E.C., in a suit filed in federal court in New York in 2003, claimed that Ronald A. Safran, a KPMG partner who was the lead engagement partner on the Xerox account in 1998 and 1999, told Mr. Boyle that Xerox was engaging in improper conduct and that KPMG had an obligation to tell the company's audit committee. The board was not told, and KPMG did not force Xerox to change the accounting procedures the S.E.C. concluded were improper. "Auditors, including relationship partners, are gatekeepers who bear special responsibilities in the financial reporting process," said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement. "Auditors who fail to perform those legal duties risk meaningful sanctions." Mr. Boyle retired from KPMG in 2003, after the S.E.C. suit was filed. His lawyer, Samuel J. Winer of Foley &amp; Lardner in Washington, said, "Mr. Boyle, who has been retired for nearly two years, is pleased that the S.E.C. dropped all but one of the charges against him and looks forward to continuing his retirement without the distraction of litigation." After Xerox complained about Mr. Safran, KPMG removed him as the lead partner on the account, transferring him to Houston from New York after he turned down a move to Finland. Mr. Safran is one of the KPMG partners still facing S.E.C. civil action. The commission contends that he acted wrongly in signing off on the Xerox audits even after he voiced concerns. A trial is scheduled for March 6. Deloitte Audits Examined By Bloomberg News The auditing firm Deloitte &amp; Touche had deficiencies on about 6 percent of audits reviewed last year by the agency created to oversee the accounting industry, according to a report issued yesterday.

Media Stocks Seem to Be Neither<date>Published: August 1, 2005</date><text>Is it time for media companies to finally grow up? Movie theater attendance is caught in a two-year downward spiral. Sales of DVD's, once the growth engine for the entertainment business, are slowing. And worse, more advertising is going to the Web, where companies can better quantify consumer reaction to commercials. This is more than just the summer of the industry's discontent. Media companies, once hot growth stocks, are facing a long-term future of slower revenue growth that may make them more appealing to value and income investors. But some industry observers argue that they are not behaving enough like value or income stocks, which are often characterized by robust dividends and stock buyback programs. "We have seen it in other industries over time," said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. "What happens is that companies need to adjust their own behavior to recognize that their base is changing." As a result, investors unhappy with the industry's prospects have generally fled the sector. But they have not yet been replaced by investors searching for value and income. "We call this growth purgatory," he said. "Investors looking for more growth trade out of their media holdings, and investors looking for cheapness or value are not on board. That is partly because the attributes of value companies, like dividends and stock repurchases, are not yet a big enough part of those companies' capital plans." The average dividend rate for stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index is 2 percent, but no top media company matches that. For example, the News Corporation, with a stock that closed Friday at $17.34 a share, pays a 10-cent dividend. Disney pays 24 cents on a stock trading at $25.64 a share. Time Warner pays 20 cents a share with its stock trading at $17.02 a share, and Viacom pays 0.9 percent, or 28 cents a share, on a stock that closed Friday at $33.49 a share. As for buybacks, major media companies are increasing their share repurchase programs. For example, the News Corporation just announced a $3 billion share repurchase, which is twice as large as its 2001 program, and Viacom's current $8 billion buyback plan dwarfs former programs. So far this year, Disney has announced $15.4 billion in stock repurchases. Only Time Warner has no plan, though its chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, has said it is something the company will consider. When those stocks were on a tear, investors did not care. Mario J. Gabelli, whose family of mutual funds and hedge funds has long been a major investor in media companies, said, however, that "in a world of uncertainty of the last two or three years, the dividend portion of the total return has taken on greater importance." Some investors compare today's media companies to the "Nifty Fifty" in the early 1970's. That was a group of hot growth stocks like Xerox, Polaroid and Avon that had led the market for some time. But after the market weakened during that decade, they all underperformed. Time Warner, Viacom, the News Corporation, Disney and some smaller entertainment companies have the glamour of big-time, brand-name film and television properties that audiences love, from Superman to Harry Potter. Children still flock to Nickelodeon while teenagers and young adults continue to devour People and In Style. But investors no longer find the stocks of the parent companies as sexy as they once did. Three years ago, the big media companies traded at a premium to the market of 25 times earnings when the S.&amp; P. was at 23 times earnings. Today they are trading at 14 times earnings, below the market average of 16 times earnings, said Richard A. Bilotti, a veteran media analyst at Morgan Stanley. And the glory days - when media companies simply added subscribers and revenue as millions of homes signed up for MTV, the Disney Channel and Home Box Office - are over. "The industry has delivered on two promises," said Leo J. Hindery Jr., the former chief executive of AT&amp;T Broadband, who now heads InterMedia Partners. "Most homes in America have access to all the digital services, and the amount of programming has boomed." From 1993 to 2004, Mr. Nathanson estimates, revenue of the top four media companies grew 10 percent to 23 percent annually. He is forecasting annual revenue growth over the next five years of 5 percent to 6 percent for those same companies. To be sure, that earlier torrid performance was not all organic growth. It was also the result of mergers, many of which did not pay off. Anthony Noto, a Goldman Sachs media analyst, points out that for most media companies, the return on invested capital is lower than the cost of capital, because they made acquisitions that failed to generate sufficient returns to cover the costs of the equity and the debt used for the purchases. "If your returns are below your cost of capital, the best thing to do with your money is to give it to shareholders, because that is a direct return without risk," Mr. Noto said. "The acquisitions were either too expensive or the hoped-for synergies did not materialize." Whether or not the media companies choose to do that, they are all attempting to focus on their faster-growing businesses, or to strengthen their relationship to the Internet, in an effort to benefit from advertisers' growing enthusiasm for that medium. And analysts have differing views about who is best positioned for the future. Some believe that the News Corporation, which has promising international properties like Sky Italia and StarTV, with the potential for foreign expansion, will benefit. Two weeks ago, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, agreed to pay $580 million for Intermix, the parent company of MySpace.com, a social networking site that has more than 16 million users. The purchase reflects Mr. Murdoch's edict that his top staff get serious about the Internet. Meanwhile, Time Warner is attempting to transform its America Online service into a free Internet portal that is compelling enough to attract traffic and advertising, as its rivals, Yahoo and Google, have done. If the transformation is a success, it will make Time Warner the only old media company with a major growing and well-integrated Internet holding. Viacom is splitting itself into two companies in its own effort to distinguish its faster-growing cable network unit from the slower-growth television businesses. And it is tweaking its core businesses in an effort to expand their online presence. For example, in an effort to revive CBSNews.com, it is introducing a Web log to provide commentary on CBS newscasts. Disney, meanwhile, is betting on better attendance at its theme parks and a turnaround at ABC. But as the stocks of Google and Yahoo soar, the media behemoths will come under increasing pressure to behave more like the grown-up companies that they are. And they have little choice other than to strengthen their relationship to the Internet. "You have to make sure you are where your consumer is," said Gail Stein, the client communications director at OMD, an advertising agency.

Xerox also forecast profit for the third quarter that was below current Wall Street forecasts, but said it would meet its full-year guidance. "We're very bullish on market demand," Anne M. Mulcahy, the chief executive, told analysts. Xerox shares fell 85 cents, or 6 percent, to close at $13.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which makes copiers, printers, scanners and fax machines, said earnings were $408 million, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30, up from $187 million, or 21 cents a share, a year ago. Those figures exclude preferred dividend payments. Excluding items like a tax gain and revamping charges, earnings from continuing operations were about $210 million, or 20 cents a share, Xerox said. Revenue edged up 2 percent, to $3.92 billion, mostly because of higher overall equipment sales and favorable exchange rates. Sales of equipment grew 4 percent as sales of color products rose 17 percent. Revenue from digital systems and services offset declines from an older, light-lens technology, Xerox said. On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 23 cents a share on revenue of $3.68 billion. Second-quarter gross margins came in below expectations at 39 percent of profits, the company said. Xerox attributed this to a shift toward lower-margin desktop office products along with light production and color systems. While concerned about the lower margins, analysts said they were not worried about wider issues. Xerox, which has become profitable in recent years after an accounting scandal and a loss of market share, has strong cash flow and is improving its balance sheet, analysts said. Earlier in the year, Xerox cut 1,100 jobs, bringing total job cuts for 2005 to 3,700. The company, which has already made some of the newest cuts, now has about 57,300 employees. Ms. Mulcahy said Xerox expected to meet its full-year profit guidance of $1.04 to $1.14 a share.

Those figures exclude preferred dividend payments. Excluding items like a tax gain and revamping charges, earnings from continuing operations were about $210 million, or 20 cents a share, Xerox said. Revenue edged up 2 percent, to $3.92 billion, mostly because of higher overall equipment sales and favorable exchange rates. Sales of equipment grew 4 percent as sales of color products rose 17 percent. Revenue from digital systems and services offset declines from an older, light-lens technology, Xerox said. On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 23 cents a share on revenue of $3.68 billion. Second-quarter gross margins came in below expectations at 39 percent of profits, the company said. Xerox attributed this to a shift toward lower-margin desktop office products along with light production and color systems. While concerned about the lower margins, analysts said they were not worried about wider issues. Xerox, which has become profitable in recent years after an accounting scandal and a loss of market share, has strong cash flow and is improving its balance sheet, analysts said. Earlier in the year, Xerox cut 1,100 jobs, bringing total job cuts for 2005 to 3,700. The company, which has already made some of the newest cuts, now has about 57,300 employees. Ms. Mulcahy said Xerox expected to meet its full-year profit guidance of $1.04 to $1.14 a share.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/business/26stox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Xerox Misses an Estimate, and Major Indexes Falter<date>Published: July 26, 2005</date><text>By Bloomberg News Stocks declined yesterday as Xerox reported second-quarter profit that trailed analysts' estimates and as oil prices increased.

KPMG, which settled the case with regulators, also agreed to make extensive changes to its business practices to prevent future securities law violations. One measure requires the chairman of KPMG to certify to the S.E.C. that the mandated overhaul has been put in place and to provide the commission with evidence that the firm is conforming to the changes. KPMG also said that it would pay almost $22.5 million in the settlement, including a $10 million civil penalty, repayment of the $9.8 million it earned by auditing Xerox's books during the period, and $2.7 million in interest. KPMG neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in settling the case. Regulators said that accounting fraud began at Xerox in 1997, and allowed the company to overstate its financial results by $1.5 billion over four years. Xerox shares lost 80 percent of their value after the fraud was disclosed in 2000. "This is a case about gatekeepers and the failure to do the job that the investing public expects auditors to do," said Paul R. Berger, an associate director of enforcement at the commission. He said the S.E.C. was continuing litigation against five KPMG partners involved in the audits. George Ledwith, KPMG's spokesman, said in a statement: "The settlement, which represents events from an earlier period - in some cases as much as eight years ago - does not involve findings that KPMG's conduct was fraudulent or reckless. "Our success as a professional services firm is inextricably linked to our performance, our reputation and our commitment to leadership and integrity. This settlement is reflective of the firm's efforts to work with our regulators in a cooperative way in order to help strengthen public confidence in the capital markets." KPMG was Xerox's auditor for 40 years, regulators said. The enduring relationship contributed to a lax approach to Xerox's bookkeeping, they said, as well as a willingness on the part of the firm to remove from the Xerox assignment a partner who had raised concerns about the company's accounting to its management. The partner was reassigned after Xerox complained to KPMG's chairman about the partner's actions in 1999. The S.E.C. found that KPMG allowed Xerox to manipulate its accounting practices to close a $3 billion gap between its actual results and those it reported publicly from 1997 through 2000. Xerox increased its equipment revenues and earnings through the use of special reserves and other methods that violated generally accepted accounting principles, the commission said. During that period, KPMG issued audit reports stating that Xerox's accounting was consistent with accounting rules and that its books were a fair representation of the company's financial condition. But, regulators said, the firm let Xerox use accounting techniques that did not comply with established rules and that allowed the company to falsify its results. KPMG was "intimately familiar" with the accounting used by Xerox, the S.E.C. said. The firm's audit partners were warned many times by other KPMG employees in offices around the world that Xerox's accounting was not based on reality. But KPMG ignored these warnings and failed to ask for evidence from Xerox to support its accounting practices. The S.E.C. also said that KPMG violated its duty to advise Xerox when it discovered illegal acts in its audits. And even though KPMG at times suggested that Xerox test its accounting assumptions and adjustments for accuracy, KPMG never pressed the company to do so. Among the changes KPMG agreed to were a review and documentation of circumstances surrounding any reassignment or replacement of an engagement partner from an audit; an examination of an audit client's justification for any accounting practices that do not adhere to the industry's rules; and the creation of a method for whistle-blowers to express anonymously their concerns about audit practices. Two years after KPMG's chairman certifies that these changes have been put in place, the firm must hire a consultant to examine its compliance with the changes. The consultant may also recommend other improvements KPMG should make to its practices. KPMG said its agreement to make the changes was "consistent with the firm's commitment to continuously improving audit quality." Mr. Berger of the S.E.C. said that the changes were uncommon in their specificity. "It is a bit unusual to require a number of undertakings like this," he said. The $22.5 million that KPMG agreed to pay in yesterday's settlement will be deposited in a restitution fund for distribution to investors who lost money in Xerox stock when the fraud was disclosed. That fund already holds $22 million paid by six senior executives at Xerox in 2003 when they settled the S.E.C.'s allegations of accounting fraud. As is customary, none of those executives admitted or denied wrongdoing in the matter. The five KPMG partners on the Xerox audit that remain subject to the S.E.C.'s civil suit are Michael A. Conway, a senior official at the firm; Anthony P. Dolanski, who was the lead partner on the Xerox account from 1995 to 1997; Ronald A. Safran, who was head of the company's audits in 1998 and 1999; Joseph T. Boyle, who was involved in the audits in 1999 and 2000; and Thomas Yoho, a concurring review partner on the Xerox audits. Only Mr. Safran and Mr. Yoho remain at KPMG. Mr. Dolanski left in 1998 and Mr. Boyle and Mr. Conway have retired. Frank Wohl, a lawyer at Lankler, Siffert &amp; Wohl who represents Mr. Yoho, said yesterday that his client "believes that he properly fulfilled all of his professional responsibilities on the audits." None of the other lawyers representing KPMG employees returned phone calls seeking comment.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/19/obituaries/19linowitz.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Sol M. Linowitz Dies at 91; Businessman and Diplomat<date>Published: March 19, 2005</date><text>Correction Appended Sol M. Linowitz, a confidant of Democratic presidents who became renowned for his achievements in each of his three careers - lawyer, businessman and diplomat - died yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 91. His death was reported by his family. A courtly and graceful figure on the Washington scene for nearly four decades, Mr. Linowitz was one of the handful of people who truly fit the description "wise man," applied to those in Washington whose counsel was regularly sought by presidents, senators and others in power. Among the complex jobs he filled were negotiator for the Panama Canal treaties and special presidential envoy for the Middle East. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com When he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998, President Bill Clinton told the White House audience that getting "advice from Sol Linowitz on international diplomacy is like getting trumpet lessons from the angel Gabriel." As a young lawyer and businessman he achieved acclaim as a principal developer of the Xerox Corporation and he became its chairman. His first call from the White House seeking advice came from President John F. Kennedy. Senator Robert F. Kennedy also consulted Mr. Linowitz and once urged him to run for governor of New York. Mr. Linowitz later said that he did not like the idea of asking people to vote for him, especially since he had no great quarrel with the state's leadership under the incumbent Republican he would have to challenge, Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Linowitz over the years became a trusted counsel to Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter before he served in that role for Mr. Clinton. Although most of his years in Washington were as a private lawyer, he was often called upon to take on delicate diplomatic tasks. He served in the government as a lawyer in the Office of Price Administration during World War II, but he was first lured to a senior policy post by President Johnson who made him the United States representative to the Organization of American States, the international organization that was the principal conclave for Washington to deal with Latin America. For Mr. Linowitz, his term at the O.A.S. from 1966 to 1969 was the beginning of an involvement for the remainder of his life with the region's political and economic issues and its relations with the United States. His autobiography, "The Making of a Public Man" (Little Brown, 1985), recounted several anecdotes of President Johnson at his cajoling and bullying best. He noted that when Mr. Johnson obliquely criticized him in front of several cabinet members early in his tenure, he sought a private conversation in which he told the president that he would resign if that happened again. Mr. Linowitz wrote that he had determined that the best way to do his government job was to always believe and let others know that he could "pick up his marbles and go home." He wrote that President Johnson replied: "Hell, boy, you're getting upset over nothing." After that the president was generally solicitous of him, except for one occasion when Mr. Linowitz told him he thought the Vietnam War was going badly and Mr. Johnson snapped, "I don't want you to talk to me about that subject." In 1977, President Carter asked Mr. Linowitz to be one of the two negotiators for the Panama Canal treaties with Ellsworth Bunker, who had been ambassador to Vietnam. It was a long political fight and one that earned Mr. Linowitz the unending enmity of many conservatives, notably Jesse Helms, then a Republican senator from North Carolina who led the opposition to turning the canal back to Panama. Once driving down Constitution Avenue, Mr. Linowitz saw himself hanging in effigy as part of a protest by conservative opponents of the treaty. He said that to get through what was a particularly painful time he lived by a phrase from "The Aeneid" by Virgil, translated as: "One day it will please us to remember even this." In 1979 he was named special ambassador to the Middle East by President Carter and found himself embroiled in the complex issues, notably Palestinian autonomy, that followed the Camp David peace accords. When he was asked to take the job, he told President Carter that he was uncertain if his heavy involvement in Jewish organizations and causes would be an obstacle.

Imagine discreetly photographing contracts, notes jotted on a whiteboard or other handwritten information while on a research mission or a sales call, and later converting them into a format for processing, either in hard copy or on your computer. That's what scientists at Xerox Research Center Europe in Grenoble, France, envisioned when they developed mobile document imaging software, which should reach the market later this year. The technology works with camera phones that have a resolution of at least one megapixel to create digital images of documents or presentations. It checks and corrects for blurriness and shadows, then compresses the image into a file that can be transmitted to a fax machine, to another phone or to a computer via a multimedia messaging service - MMS - or Bluetooth wireless technology. The images can be printed later. "When we give it to test users, they appreciate it easily," said Christopher Dance, senior scientist and image processing manager for Xerox Research Center Europe. "Even the simplest of applications, just sharing the documents and storing the documents you have captured. You could even handwrite a message and send it to someone's phone." Xerox is talking with potential licensees through its licensing agent, IPValue Management, and the technology, which is patented, could find its way into users' hands by midyear. Among potential licensees are handset manufacturers, wireless carriers and developers of document-management software. The Xerox software works in a four-step process. To create an image of an 81/2-by-11-inch piece of paper, you have to hold the camera roughly one foot away from the document and photograph it. Mr. Dance said it is difficult to capture smaller documents - a business card, for example - because the lenses in most phones don't focus well at closer distances. Once an image is captured, you can fix blurriness and convert it to black and white. Next you might need to adjust contrast and eliminate shadows or reflections caused by certain types of papers or document surfaces. Finally the image is compressed using a format known as Fax Group 4, or G4. An image that started as 200 kilobytes in size, for example, could be squeezed down to 20 kilobytes. Mr. Dance said that with such compression, a phone could store about 10 page images in the space that it would take to store one digital photo. Xerox researchers believe the technology will be useful for just about anyone with a job that requires research in the field. The theory is that someone attending a trade show or conference, for example, could capture and store pertinent documents in their cellphone. Mr. Dance reasoned that most people are unlikely to want to view those images on the tiny screen, and will instead transfer them to a computer, where they could be converted into editable text using optical character recognition software, which is often included with desktop scanners. Others might want to send a document image as an MMS message to a business associate or family member. Paul Withington, a manager with the research firm IDC who has seen the technology in use, envisions both personal and business applications, especially in professions still dependent on paper. An architect visiting a construction site, for example, could jot notes on a blueprint, photograph them and send the image to colleagues as an e-mail attachment, or directly to a fax machine. An insurance agent could document a contract in the field and download it later to a computer for archiving. "To my mind, any mobile professional who spends a lot of time on the road would have an application," Mr. Withington said. "It's one of those products that doesn't need a critical mass of users to become useful," he added. "That's because the image is independent of any particular phone or software application." Xerox researchers are also working on complementary technology for cataloging these and other digital images. Although it's part of a different research project that hasn't come to fruition, the technology will sort through and group images using histograms, which chart the pixels associated with a particular part of a digital photograph. In some instances, text descriptions will be tied to these histograms. One possible use might be field research: a student could take a picture of an object or animal, and then check the compressed image against a search engine for more information about its identity. The Xerox mobile document imaging projects were actually born a half-dozen years ago as an offshoot of work the company's scientists were doing with videoconferencing cameras. Several factors made it difficult to apply the technology to mobile applications, including the amount of memory available in cellular phones. The most serious limitation was the resolution of available digital cameras. Analysts believe, however, that this will be a breakthrough year. Alex Slawsby, senior analyst for mobile devices at IDC, estimated that roughly 89 million mobile phones with cameras will be sold this year in the United States. About 40 percent will have a resolution of one megapixel or greater, he said. "The Xerox technology will actually be important in coming up with solutions that really utilize camera phones," he said. Mr. Dance has been using the software on the job to capture brainstorming notes from whiteboards. He also found himself reaching for his phone to photograph notices and schedules on the bulletin boards at his son's school, which he promptly e-mailed to his wife to check against their master calendar, and to make a copy of a sales proposal drafted in his office.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DB163BF935A15752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=xeroxcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; XEROX PROFIT RISES 14.7% ON HIGHER SALES<date>Published: January 26, 2005</date><text>The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that fourth-quarter profit increased 14.7 percent.

A Verb? TiVo Says It's Neither<date>Published: December 13, 2004</date><text>hile I'm eating a slice of pizza, my boyfriend is home taping my favorite TV show," Miranda, a character from "Sex and the City," said in an episode last year. "And to which boyfriend are we referring?" asked Carrie. "My boyfriend, TiVo," Miranda replied. It may have seemed a proud moment for marketers of TiVo, the digital recording device and service - not least because, even in the playful transmutation of TiVo from inanimate object to object of affection, it remained a noun. Advertisement However, the company has recently stepped up efforts to police just how its trademark is used in a sentence. Using TiVo as a verb, for instance - as in "to TiVo" or "I TiVoed 'The Apprentice' last night" - is forbidden. The company has begun sending letters to news organizations whenever it sees the term misused. "We've gotten more aggressive," said Kathryn Kelly, a TiVo spokeswoman. "It's a much more talked-about subject now." Running a close second among uses the company frowns on is "TiVo-like." "We do aggressively protect our trademark," Ms. Kelly said, adding that with competing digital video recorders entering the market, TiVo wants to keep its name from going the way of Xerox or Kleenex. On its Web site, TiVo suggests that even last year's welcome bit of name-dropping on "Sex and the City" - part of a separate campaign by the company to get the product written into film and television scripts - may have been a trademark faux pas. "Trademarks are always proper adjectives," the legal pedagogy at TiVo.com instructs. They are also "always singular." "Correct: I want two TiVo DVR's," the site dictates. "Incorrect: I want two TiVos." Which implies that TiVo, in addition to not being a verb, must never be a noun. Or a boyfriend.

I recently read a magazine article about the man who invented the Xerox machine. The article mentioned that he lived in Astoria, Queens, and I wondered if his laboratory is still there. A. The building, at least, is still around. Chester F. Carlson (1906-68), who officially invented xerography in 1938 in Queens, conducted his initial experiments in his wife's kitchen, but the apartment made a poor lab. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com According to Marcia DeMinco of Xerox, in the fall of 1938 Mr. Carlson rented a room on the second floor of a house owned by his in-laws, at 32-05 37th Street in Astoria. There, he made what would later be called the first Xerox copy on Oct. 22, 1938, on a sulfur-coated metal plate he had rubbed with a pocket handkerchief to give it an electric charge. Today, the building's main address is given as 37-02 Broadway. A plaque, since disappeared, was placed there in 1968 by the city and dedicated by Mr. Carlson's wife, Dorris. Bob Singleton, president of the Greater Astoria Historical Society, said the lab was in a room behind the beauty parlor run by Mr. Carlson's mother-in-law. The first floor, formerly a restaurant, is now a Boston Pizza outlet. "Our community's name is on the first page of the information age," Mr. Singleton said. As it turns out, the space occupied by the beauty parlor was later occupied, until about 15 years ago, by Mr. Singleton's dentist. "I remember getting dental work in the same room the first photocopy was invented," he said. His Lady Luck Wore Red Q. In reading a book about theater design, I came across a reference to "David Merrick red." Did the producer get a color named after him? A. Think blood. Think about the eyeballs of an irate producer whose show has been panned by every critic in town. Merrick, who died in 2000, was convinced that a particular shade of blood red was a key to success, and his set designs, posters and advertising displays used it almost as a trademark, notably in "Hello, Dolly!," which opened in 1964. He decorated his office in it, high above the St. James Theater on West 44th Street. "Merrick's private office was not luxurious," Howard Kissel wrote in "Merrick: The Unauthorized Biography." "What it was was red. There was a red fake Empire couch. The walls were red. There were some posters of Merrick's shows, which were invariably red. There were a few paintings, noteworthy less for their quality or subject matter than the fact that they too had important touches of red." Tenements Adorned Q. What's the story behind the lavish facade decoration - stars of David, a Moses-like figure - on the tenement at 375 Broome Street in Little Italy? I saw a photo of the facade at www.thing.net/~lina/oddends/375broome.html, and I became curious. A. The story goes back to the days of great immigration to the Lower East Side. Oscar Israelowitz, author of "Oscar Israelowitz's Guide to the Lower East Side," explained that the tenement, which is between Mott and Mulberry Streets, is one of three downtown that were built about 1890 by Peter and Francis Herter, specialists in tenement design, to serve Jewish immigrants. The Herters, not to be confused with the Herter Brothers interior design firm that fulfilled lavish commissions during the Gilded Age, decorated those tenements with Jewish symbols like stars of David and busts of biblical patriarchs.

In ''Copies in Seconds,'' his very readable, wonderfully factual history of the inventor Chester Carlson (1906-68) and the decade-long birthing of the Xerox machine (the Haloid name and that flourish of the second capitalized X would soon disappear), David Owen reports that his son, born in 1988, asked him what carbon paper was. He had never heard of it or seen any in use. He also ''doesn't really know what an original is. . . . He never really produces a first draft, a revised draft, a final draft or a copy in the antique sense.'' His school papers exist ''in a fluid succession of related states.'' ''Copies in Seconds'' is an interlocking biography of man, company and machine: of Chester Carlson's conception of xerography and his long, long struggle to find someone to develop it; of the willingness, despite grave divisions within the company, of Haloid, a small Rochester manufacturer of photography paper, to bet the farm on making Carlson's idea work; and of an invention that now seems indispensable. Xerography, the transfer of an image from one surface to another, a term coined from the Greek words for dry and writing, is a unique invention. It is not related to conventional photography; did not, unlike most inventions of its time, derive from an existing technology or from a team effort; and, unlike most inventions in history, was not something a number of people were scrambling to find, something someone else would have come up with eventually. Carlson conceived his idea while copying by hand the law books he could not afford to buy. In 1938, he produced his first crude xerography copy, then spent the next 20 years being turned away by dozens of companies -- I.B.M., General Electric, Bell &amp; Howell -- many whose size and profitability Xerox would outstrip in the 1960's. Carlson was not a forceful presenter. The xerography process was complicated, involving many difficult steps and operations, and there was never any working model. Even after Haloid licensed Carlson's patents in 1947 and invested more and more of the company's resources -- eventually more than its total earnings for the 1950's -- a working ''desktop'' office copier proved devilishly hard to build. The heart of Owen's story is Haloid and Carlson's 12-year struggle to fit all xerography's complex movements and suboperations -- charging, exposure, development, transfer, fusing, cleaning and, most devilish of all, moving cut rather than continuous sheets of paper -- inside one office machine. One prototype was 12 feet high, while market surveys repeatedly showed little interest in a large office machine and little demand for office copying, anyway. (Those years as a patent attorney would prove immensely valuable, however, especially when some of the same companies that earlier turned Carlson down thought about filching Haloid's discoveries; even selenium, a key element in the toner, was protected.) The world will make 2 trillion copies this year, compared to 20 million in 1955. Copying has become so pervasive that Owen can only speculate what our world would be without it: ''fewer lawyers, larger forests, smaller landfills, no Pentagon Papers, no laser printers, more (fewer?) bureaucrats, shorter (longer?) meetings, better memories, more secrets, fewer cartoons on our refrigerators.'' Owen, a staff writer at The New Yorker, tells the story with a great deal of heart, grace and enthusiasm. ''Truly epochal technology shifts are sometimes incomprehensible until after they've occurred,'' he writes. ''As with Xerox machines, the technology itself created the demand that ultimately sustained it. Invention was the mother of necessity.''

Executives need to understand which groups to work with and which ones to fight, says David A. Nadler, chairman and chief executive of Mercer Delta Consulting, a management consulting firm based in New York. Following are excerpts from a conversation with him: Advertisement Q. Chief executives seem to be coming under fire from lots of new and different directions. Do you agree? A. Yes, in working with chief executives, I've found that a major issue in front of them is, "How do I deal with all the constituencies who want something from the company or from me personally when many of them are increasingly hostile?" There were always traditional constituencies, including the financial markets, customers, suppliers and your own people. But now, more and more time is being spent with regulators, prosecutors, legislators, the press, various communities and various special interest groups. Q. They are dealing with more lawyers, too, right? A. The chief executive of a major financial services firm told me recently that he was talking with peers in the industry and they discovered that, on average, each of them faces six governmental investigations related to shareholder lawsuits. Most of that has little to do with serving the customer. But it's a fact of life. Juggling all those constituencies and trying to figure out which ones are most critical, which ones you have to pay attention to, is difficult. Q. In general, do you tell your clients to work with activists and disgruntled shareholders or to stonewall them? A. The advice I'd give is, identify which constituencies can be worked with. There are some elements of the plaintiffs' bar with whom there are no common interests. But in other cases, you can find common ground. Q. Home Depot is one company trying to get out ahead, in this case on the question of where it gets its lumber, right? A. Yes. Staples has done the same thing on the environment. There are a number of companies that have done it. If there is an issue arising, get out ahead of it. That's what social capital is all about. By his or her actions, a chief executive can build up social capital, or positive feelings about the company. Johnson &amp; Johnson had positive social capital so that when it ran into the Tylenol crisis, it had a positive reservoir of feelings. Q. Who else uses their social capital well? A. There are also companies that have worked their way back from a situation where every constituency was critical of them to the point that they re-established credibility. Anne Mulcahy at Xerox, for example, has been working on that the last couple of years, reaching out to groups, to customers, to constituencies. She's been credible and delivered on her promises. Q. Are more nongovernmental organizations and activist groups attacking companies? A. Yes, we're seeing a rise of interest groups. As a consequence of what's happened in the economy and the business scandals, there's a more negative view of corporations. They have become more attractive targets. Q. Can you think of a company or an industry whose top executives are not handling the new climate well? A. The mutual fund industry is on the receiving end of this. If you're in that industry, you have to reflect on what's happened. Q. And how do you think the oil industry is handling the pressures it is facing? A. Another industry where you'd expect there would be a lot of negatives about the environment or price increases would be the oil industry. But BP, whose chief executive is John Browne, has positioned itself well with a commitment to alternative fuel research and the environment. Q. But BP's highly publicized relationship with Greenpeace fell apart. A. But still, BP has clearly been active in doing things to position themselves and show that they recognize the problems. Q. Do you see this adversarial climate for chief executives as permanent? A. I think it's going to be here for some time. The accessibility of information has improved dramatically, thanks in part to the Internet. Interest groups can form much more easily and can communicate across time zones. I think it's a fact of life that's going to continue to be part of a chief executive's job. The really tough part of this is that the boundaries between internal and external constituencies have blurred. In the Wal-Mart situation, these are their employees who are pressing their cases. Managers have both internal and external challenges. Q. What's the biggest mistake chief executives make in handling these pressures? A. When they go back into the C.E.O. cave and don't engage. Q. So a smart chief executive builds a coalition to respond to those putting pressure on the company? A. Absolutely. Building social capital means that you have other people who feel positive about what you've actually done over time. It's the job of chief executives to orchestrate that and build that coalition of support to deal with the attacks that are going to happen. William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7DD1239F932A1575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;ref=xeroxcorporation">Citigroup Adds 2 to Board<date>Published: September 21, 2004</date><text>Correction Appended Citigroup Inc. named Anne Mulcahy, Xerox chief executive, and Judith Rodin, Rockefeller Foundation president, to its board.

Ten years ago, Xerox, recognizing that its long distinction as the King of Copiers was a major liability in the digital age, trumpeted a new identity to the world. Henceforth, its logo would feature, above its iconic name and in big bold print, the rubric "The Document Company." And it would feature, in even bigger, bolder red, a huge digital-looking X, to signify that it would lead customers into that digital world. Well, now the view around the Xerox headquarters in Stamford, Conn., has changed to: been there, done that. Or, maybe more accurately: are there, doing that. "All of our research shows that we already own the document space, and that everyone knows we are digital,'' said Diane E. McGarry, chief marketing officer of Xerox. "Now it is time to define for our customers what our capabilities really are." So today, Xerox is bidding "The Document Company" and the broken-armed X a grateful goodbye. In their place will be a new, cleaner-looking logo, featuring the Xerox name over the signature "Technology/Document Management/Consulting Services." Industry experts applaud the change. "A good tagline has to reflect not just what the company is, but what it wants to be, and 'The Document Company' was limiting the definition of Xerox," said Andrew Johnson, a vice president at the research firm Gartner, also based in Stamford, Conn. Angèle Boyd, a vice president at IDC, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass., concurred: "This industry has shifted away from selling boxes to selling solutions, which include services around the box, and this branding change is right in line with that." There is no question that Xerox has jumped feet first into the digital arena. Nearly three-quarters of its revenues come from digital products and services. Even more telling, two-thirds of its equipment sales stem from digital products it has introduced in the last two years. The company has built a thriving business in managing document-related services for other companies. And those companies have heaped public praise on Xerox - in the last two years, it has run 140 testimonial ads featuring how it helped Continental Airlines, Dow Chemical and other big companies reduce costs, increase productivity, do all those things that are guaranteed to make their shareholders smile. In fact, for the last three years Xerox has been reducing the size of "The Document Company" in many of its ads and commercials, and omitting the big X entirely. " 'The Document Company' is an intellectual idea, but the brand is an emotional promise that you can get people to rally around," said Barry Hoffman, executive creative director at Young &amp; Rubicam, Xerox's longtime ad agency. "Now, it's time to just let the brand speak for itself." Xerox has no plans to appreciably change its ad campaign. Ms. McGarry, citing company policy, will not divulge the advertising budget. But for some time, it has run print ads in prominent newspapers and business magazines and commercials on cable and broadcast networks alike. The print ads feature testimonials, with an invitation to go to www.Xerox.com - or call a toll-free number - to get more detail. The commercials use humor to illustrate Xerox's capabilities. For example, one shows a family dinner in which a crusty old father berates his son Skip for squandering the family business's money on color printing, only to be told by the daughter that color printing has become cheap, so "Skip is ahead of the curve." Another shows a professor telling his writing class that money will be the roadblock to their ever getting anything published - only to be told by a student that on-demand printing has made publishing affordable for almost anyone. A recent commercial, for a new color printer, features the fastest dancer under the age of 12, the fastest motorcycle race on ice, the fastest bird underwater - and the fastest color printer under $1,000. It is capped off with the Fastest Snack: a frog scoffing up a fly from the paper the printer spews forth. The campaign has yielded mixed results. According to Gartner, Xerox's sales of color copiers have grown faster than those of any of its competitors, bringing its market share to nearly 23 percent, up from about 14 percent a year ago. But it still lags far behind Hewlett-Packard in office printers. More importantly, the Xerox executives know full well that the name Xerox does not yet elicit "consulting services" as a first response in any free association test. And since services are always more lucrative for manufacturing companies than equipment sales, that is the association that Xerox hopes its new signature line will reinforce. Still, branding mavens are not 100 percent sure the company is right to kill a signature that has served them so well. " 'The Document Company' spoke to clear benefits they were aspiring to deliver, and it's the source of their authority," said Judy Hopelain, managing partner at Prophet Brand Strategy, a San Francisco brand consultancy. "I'm O.K. with adding technology, but the idea of 'consulting services' sounds really Me-Too, like they are trying to be I.B.M. or Accenture." Ms. Hopelain is somewhat mollified by the fact that document management remains, if not prominent, at least visible. "It's right there between technology and services," she said, "and maybe people will see it as a bridge from one to the other." There is also probably an aspect of semantic psychology behind sandwiching the D-word between phrases that are clearly not paper related. The strategy behind Xerox's marketing over the last decade has been built around getting customers to define document the way Xerox has come to define it: Not as a piece of paper, but as any medium, be it e-mail or video or icon on a desktop, that moves information around. But even Ms. McGarry concedes that the "average person still thinks paper when they hear document." Giving technology and consulting services equal prominence in the tagline can counteract that Luddite response. "It shows that Xerox's idea of document management means managing the whole life cycle of information flow," Ms. Boyd said. The reason behind jettisoning the digital X, though, is a lot less clear. After all, Xerox wants to suggest that it can be the premier provider of digital services, so why not keep that in-your-face digital sign? The answer, apparently, is that, while it did not hurt, it did not help all that much. "There are an awful lot of X's out there,'' Ms. McGarry said, pointing to Microsoft's Xbox as the obvious example. "People really didn't associate the digital X with Xerox as much as you might think."</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/17/business/world-business-briefing-europe-software-review-extended.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">World Business Briefing | Europe: Software Review Extended<date>Published: August 17, 2004</date><text>The European Commission has extended its review of a joint initiative by Microsoft and Time Warner to develop antipiracy software, a spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said.

The company raised its 2004 forecast.Net income rose to $208 million, or 21 cents a share, from $86 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 1.7 percent, to $3.85 billion, the company said. Equipment sales rose 3.7 percent, to $1.76 billion.About two-thirds of equipment sales in the quarter came from products introduced in the last two years, the company said. The cost-cutting by the chief executive, Anne M. Mulcahy, allowed the company to sell new products at lower prices, like the Phaser 6100 office color printer, which starts at $699. That helps Xerox compete with Canon, Ricoh and Hewlett-Packard for the more profitable sales of ink, paper and services.The company, based in Stamford, Conn., was expected to earn 17 cents a share in the quarter, according to the average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Xerox raised its 2004 outlook to 80 to 84 cents a share, from its previous forecast of 67 to 72 cents.Third-quarter profit will be 11 to 15 cents a share, the company said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson estimated third-quarter profit would be 15 cents a share and full-year profit 73 cents.Xerox shares rose 49 cents, or 3.68 percent, to $13.80.Sales of digital products increased 4 percent in the quarter and now represent about 73 percent of the company's revenue, Xerox said.Revenue from color machines, which are more profitable than black and white, rose 17 percent in the quarter and represents about 25 percent of total revenue, the company said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/technology/state-of-the-art-scanning-a-paperless-horizon.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">STATE OF THE ART; Scanning A Paperless Horizon<date>Published: July 15, 2004</date><text>Correction AppendedMYTHOLOGY can be hours of fun for the whole family. Remember the one about the guy who flew too close to the sun with his waxen wings? Or the one about the loving couple that Zeus changed into intertwined trees? How about the one about the lady who tried to dry off her little dog by sticking him in the microwave?But myths don't begin life as myths; in the beginning, people actually believe them. As recently as a few decades ago, for example, you could still hear predictions that computers would one day create a paperless office. Of course, that turned out to be total bunk; the amount of paper consumed in the e-mail age has exploded.We may never eliminate our file cabinets completely, but it's too soon to give up on that dream altogether. New scanners from Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and Xerox/Visioneer can scan stacks of paper, unattended, with marching-band precision -- both sides at once, in fact -- and convert them into PDF files on your computer, ready for searching, sorting or sending.(PDF stands for Portable Document Format. It's also known as an Adobe Acrobat format, which you may have encountered in the form of CD-based user manuals or downloadable white papers. Like a photograph, a PDF file maintains the original paper document's fonts, page layout and even pictures, yet you can search for text inside it and copy text out of it. And, of course, you can print it. Maybe Adobe ought to adopt a slogan like ''PDF files: The Official Format of the Paperless-Office Myth.'')People in law offices and other paper-heavy enterprises worship the PDF format because it lets them call up a specific page in a specific contract on their hard drive in seconds without having to comb through file cabinets and get paper cuts. Now the same perk is available to anyone.The Fujitsu ScanSnap FI-5110EOX (about $400 online, or $300 after a rebate that's available through September), for example, sits on your desk looking for all the world like a tiny inkjet printer (it's only 5.9 by 11.2 by 5.7 inches). Yet its closest ancestor wasn't a printer but a shredder: you just shove stacks of paper, 50 pages at a time, into the top slot. The machine instantly turns on and begins slurping in pages with astonishing speed. (Fujitsu claims the scanner can process 15 pages per minute, but it lies. You actually get 16 pages per minute.) It spits the pages out the bottom, where, if you're really going for paperless nirvana, you've positioned a wastebasket.Correction: July 19, 2004, Monday The State of the Art column in Circuits on Thursday, about scanners that convert documents into Portable Document Format files, misstated a brand name at one point. As noted elsewhere in the column, it is the Fujitsu ScanSnap, not SnapScan.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/25/business/technology-briefing-software-palmone-wins-patent-dispute-with-xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Technology Briefing | Software: Palmone Wins Patent Dispute With Xerox<date>Published: May 25, 2004</date><text>PalmOne, the maker of hand-held computers, won a 1997 lawsuit filed by Xerox over handwriting-recognition technology after a federal judge said the patent covering the software was invalid.

Three of them, brushed by the company's accounting scandal during the late 1990's, should spare themselves the embarrassment and back down.Xerox, in case you've forgotten, settled a huge and ugly civil accounting fraud case last year with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Regulators said six of its executives, who have all since left the company, orchestrated a fraud from 1997 to 2000 that misled investors about its earnings. Xerox improperly recognized equipment sales of $3 billion, regulators concluded, ''to polish its reputation on Wall Street and boost the company's stock price.''The company restated its financial results for the period, paid $10 million and agreed to a special review of its accounting controls.The six men who regulators say concocted the plan included the chief executive and the chief financial officer. They may be gone, but the three members of the audit committee who were charged with overseeing the company's accounting during the years the misstatements were made remain on the board.They are Hilmar Kopper, former chief executive of Deutsche Bank and a Xerox director since 1991; N.J. Nicholas Jr., a director since 1987 and a former president of Time Warner; and John E. Pepper, former chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble and vice president for finance and administration at Yale University. Mr. Pepper, a Xerox director since 1990, is the audit committee's chairman.Long-suffering Xerox shareholders paid twice for this calamity. When the scandal broke, the plummeting share price exacted a cost, of course. But even more disturbing, Xerox shareholders paid almost $20 million in penalties levied by the S.E.C. in the settlement: $19.4 million in disgorgement and interest and $557,764 in fees, according to this year's proxy. The executives paid $3 million.Xerox said its bylaws require it to pay penalties when executives settle with regulators and neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.Xerox is incorporated in New York, which allows corporate indemnifications only on the determination, case by case, that the director to be indemnified met required standards of fiduciary duty.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/business/strong-sales-help-xerox-top-forecasts-in-quarter.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Strong Sales Help Xerox Top Forecasts in Quarter<date>Published: April 24, 2004</date><text>The Xerox Corporation yesterday posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on strong sales of copiers and printers, but pressure on profit margins sent the document management company's shares down 8.5 percent. Analysts said Xerox scored with its plan to increase sales of new machines, which now represent 71 percent of total revenue.But they expressed concern about the company's margins amid competition from rivals like the Ricoh Company and Canon Inc.''There is some pressure on pricing, especially in the office'' segment, Ulysses Yannas, an analyst at Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid, said. ''They got aggressive about pricing and managed to get some very good contracts because of it. But the question is, what will be the response of the Japanese?''Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., posted first-quarter net income of $224 million, or 25 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $75 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a gain of 8 cents a share from the sale of a stake in digital rights management technology provider ContentGuard.Excluding special items, earnings rose to 17 cents a share from 15 cents. Analysts had forecast 15 cents a share, according to Reuters Research, a unit of Reuters Group.Gross profit margin fell to 39.8 percent from 41.9 percent, below most Wall Street estimates of about 41.5 percent. Xerox blamed a high proportion of sales of lower-cost desktop office and light-production equipment.For the year Xerox is targeting gross profit margin of 41 percent to 42 percent, ''so you have three quarters you have to do very well to get to there,'' said a Standard &amp; Poor's analyst, Richard Stice. ''Maybe some people are a little too bullish in expecting them to grow rapidly, but it is difficult since revenues are still anemic.''Overall revenue rose 2 percent, to $3.83 billion from $3.76 billion.Shares of Xerox declined $1.23, to close at $13.18.Lawrence A. Zimmerman, the chief financial officer, said in an interview that Xerox ''met every goal that anybody could have had for us.''Weaker margins should not overshadow the benefit of equipment sales, which fuel more profitable sales of services and supplies, he said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/19/business/center-uses-laser-method-to-see-cancer.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Center Uses Laser Method To See Cancer<date>Published: April 19, 2004</date><text>The Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, which developed some of the standard techniques now used in personal computing, is moving into biotechnology.The research center, known as PARC, quietly formed a partnership two years ago with the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. Now, the Scripps-PARC Institute for Advanced Biomedical Sciences, as the partnership is known, is announcing its first potential product: a system based on laser printer technology to detect cancer cells.PARC is not the first high-technology organization to seek new, and possibly greener, pastures in the life sciences, which increasingly rely on computers and sophisticated electronic instruments. Agilent Technologies, Corning and Motorola, for instance, made forays into the market for DNA chips, which measure gene activity and can be made using semiconductor or ink jet printing technology.Richard H. Bruce, who runs biomedical research at PARC, said that because his organization did not have people trained in life sciences, it relied on Scripps, a well-known medical research center in San Diego, to define the problems to which PARC's technology could be applied.''We asked them to tell us 10 problems that if we solved would have a big impact,'' said Dr. Bruce, a physicist who is in charge of PARC's computer science laboratory.One problem was to search the bloodstream for cells that slough off tumors. Detecting such cells could allow doctors to detect cancer early or to monitor the success of therapy. But such cells exist, Dr. Bruce said, in concentrations of one in a million or one in 10 million blood cells, meaning that 50 million or more cells in the blood might have to be checked to find them.The technique developed by PARC and Scripps involves tagging cancer cells with a fluorescent marker and then scanning the blood cells with a laser looking for fluorescence. ''It's basically like scanning paper,'' Dr. Bruce said. He said it could narrow 50 million cells to 500 possible cancer cells in minutes. Existing techniques, he said, can take 30 hours.The developers will present details of the system at a cancer conference today in Brussels. Dr. Bruce said that if further testing proves the device works as expected, PARC would try to commercialize the device, either by licensing it to a company or by starting a company.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/16/business/technology-briefing-hardware-xerox-to-report-on-plastic-electronics.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Technology Briefing | Hardware: Xerox To Report On Plastic Electronics<date>Published: April 16, 2004</date><text>Xerox said that it would present a report today outlining what it said is major progress toward creating electronics out of inexpensive, flexible plastic. The report, which will be presented at the spring meeting of the Materials Research Society in San Francisco, will detail advances in its development of conductive, semiconductive and insulating inks. Xerox will also describe its ability to fashion them into an electronic circuit using an inkjet printer in normal atmospheric conditions, according to Beng Ong, a fellow at Xerox's Canadian research center. Organic electronics will never match silicon for processing speed, but such plastic devices would not have to be made in expensive clean rooms as today's chips are. Xerox and others are racing to develop them for less demanding applications like electronic displays and radio identification tags. Barnaby J.

Mulcahy, is tired of defending Xerox's long-term viability. ''Our market share, our balance sheet, all show a strong company winning against competition, not one that's just coming back from the brink,'' she said.Now, after four consecutive quarters of rising sales and profits and dropping costs and debt, investors, analysts, even competitors, are finally agreeing it is so.''Their cost structure is good, their debt-to-capital ratio is down, they've got a plethora of new products -- they've clearly benefited from all their restructuring and operational change,'' said Jay Vleeschhouwer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who put Xerox on his buy list in November.Even holdouts are warming up. Ghriskey Capital Partners sold its Xerox stock several years ago, but Timothy M. Ghriskey said he is again considering buying shares. Why? ''They are finally showing momentum on sales,'' he said. Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid, thinks Xerox shares are overpriced at their current mid-teens level, but he is relenting a bit. ''Last year I said I'd only buy it under $8,'' he said. ''Now, I'd buy it up to $10.''But all is not up, up and away for Xerox. It may be a vibrant competitor, but it is also up against the strongest competition it has ever faced.Xerox has gained ground on Canon and Ricoh, but analysts say those two still rule much of the market for document processing equipment. Konica and Minolta, minor players on their own, have merged to form Konica Minolta, a more heavily muscled competitor.And now Hewlett-Packard, as dominant in printers as Xerox once was in copiers, is using Konica Minolta's copier engines in a new set of multifunction devices -- products that serve as printers and copiers -- that will compete with a lot of Xerox offerings. Many dealers, including the distribution giant Ikon Office Solutions, have agreed to sell the products.''This industry has changed radically since Xerox dominated it 10 years ago,'' the chairman of Ikon, Matthew J. Espe, said. ''Xerox will always be a player, but it will never again be the sole dominant player.''The competition promises to get hotter. Hewlett does not yet have a super-high-speed production printer than can compete with Xerox's top-line models, but Konica Minolta is poised to introduce one soon, and most analysts expect that Hewlett will also draw on that technology.</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/29/nyregion/c-corrections-160245.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Corrections<date>Published: January 29, 2004</date><text>Two reports in the Technology Briefing column of Business Day yesterday, about quarterly results for Xerox and SBC Communications, carried incorrect credits.

Total debt is expected to drop to $12.5 billion this year and $10.6 billion in 2004, from $15.7 billion in 2002, Moody's said. Equipment revenue will continue to rise and will help increase sales of ink, paper and other products and services, the ratings agency said. The chief executive of Xerox, Anne M. Mulcahy, has reduced costs and introduced lower-priced products to regain sales lost to rivals like Canon Inc. and the Ricoh Company. Xerox is expected to continue to use cash flow for debt reduction, Moody's said. Moody's has a B1 rating on Xerox debt. The stable outlook means that it is inclined to leave the current ratings on Xerox unchanged. Moody's said the change in its ratings outlook affects about $8 billion of debt.

Xerox said it would not have to contribute additional money to the plan to cover the payout until at least 2005.Xerox reported earlier this year that it had taken a pretax charge of $300 million to cover possible damages owed in the case. In August, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit made a different calculation showing that the company owed the retirees about $256 million.Xerox had said it might appeal the case to the Supreme Court but acknowledged with the settlement that it had abandoned that idea. A spokeswoman, Christa Carone, said the company wanted ''to avoid any further uncertainty or legal expenses'' stemming from the dispute.Ms. Carone also said that Xerox would put $61 million back into its pretax earnings, either in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2004, depending on when the settlement is made final.The dispute centered on Xerox's cash-balance pension plan, a type of plan that became controversial in the late 1990's. Cash-balance plans first appeared in the late 1980's and proliferated in the 1990's, billed as a modern, worker-friendly arrangement that combined certain features of traditional pension plans with other features of 401(k) plans.Typically, employees who participate in cash-balance pension plans receive regular statements showing their benefit as a hypothetical sum of money that grows over time. Workers covered by traditional plans do not receive such statements because their benefits are calculated differently, usually as a percentage of their pay just before they retire. Such pensions are usually paid as an annuity, a stream of monthly checks from retirement to death.The controversy started when some workers discovered, after their companies switched to cash-balance plans, that they had been stripped of their ability to earn valuable benefits that the earlier pension plan had offered. Such losses were mostly among older workers, who had been poised to earn the biggest share of their benefit because they were approaching retirement.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/jobs/in-many-recruitment-efforts-health-benefits-act-as-lure.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">In Many Recruitment Efforts, Health Benefits Act as Lure<date>Published: November 09, 2003</date><text>Correction AppendedWhen Maggie Mateer was offered a job last July as an accountant for the Xerox Corporation, she hesitated. It wasn't that she did not want the job, or that the salary was too low. Ms. Mateer, who had five years of experience as a certified public accountant, wanted to pore over the details of the company's health plan before she signed on.Only after grilling a Xerox human resources representative for more than half an hour -- and finding out that she would be paying $100 less a month out of pocket for health coverage than she had been -- did Ms. Mateer, 26, accept the job. She is now based at the company's headquarters in Rochester.''Good benefits were very important to me,'' Ms. Mateer said. ''I wasn't going to take any job without doing my homework.''With the ranks of uninsured Americans rising sharply -- the number of Americans without health insurance increased by 2.4 million last year, according to the Census Bureau -- and with health care costs for employers rising at double-digit rates, more job seekers are taking a keen interest in the benefit packages offered by potential employers. It is a striking change from the late 1990's, said Emmett Seaborn, a principal at Towers Perrin, a benefit consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn.''A few years ago, the only thing people were looking at were salary and potential for career advancement,'' he said. ''Employees weren't asking about benefit plans at all, other than maybe saying, 'Oh, do you have medical benefits?' as they're walking out the door. Now, many start with, 'Tell me about your health plan,' and ask about salary later.''A survey of 865 workers conducted this summer by Center for Survey Research at the State University of New York at Stony Brook reveals strong concerns about health benefits. When asked whether they would prefer a job with health coverage and a lower salary or a job with no health coverage and a higher salary, 71 percent of the respondents opted for the lower salary with benefits.In addition, 20 percent of those who responded said that they were dissatisfied with the health benefits their company offered, and 50 percent said that they were worried that their health benefits would be cut back in the coming year.Correction: November 13, 2003, Thursday An article in the Job Market section on Sunday about companies' use of health benefit plans to attract workers misstated the headquarters location of the Xerox Corporation.

The Delta pilots have a pension fund, too, but theirs is now in the red.''One of my friends called me up and said: 'We've got to think about retiring, don't we? These people could just bankrupt the company and leave us alone,' '' recalled Capt. Dave Davis, who is 56.After thinking it over, he told Delta that he would retire on Sept. 1, a little more than three years early, and take as much of his pension as possible in cash immediately.Some pilots at American Airlines are also weighing whether to forgo the promise of larger benefits in the future to take what they can now.''They're faced with the decision, Is it best for them to cut and run or not?'' said Stan Spiewak, a financial planner in Downers Grove, Ill., who specializes in advising pilots who work for American.Though little chronicled, a rush by individuals to pull cash out of a weakened fund represents a hidden risk to pensions. Their accelerating withdrawals can work like a bank run, draining so many assets that the plan's solvency can be threatened.If sudden withdrawals reduce the plan's finances below a certain level, the company can be required to make large catch-up contributions in a short time. In the worst case, the plan could fail and, even with government insurance, workers and retirees could lose benefits.This threat is increasing as plans become underfunded and more companies than in the past allow employees to be paid in a lump sum at retirement. Polaroid experienced a run on its pension fund before the fund failed last year.Officials of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government agency that insures the plans, say they are monitoring the pension funds of two companies where worried employees are withdrawing their benefits, further eroding weakened plans. A spokesman for the insurance agency declined to identify the companies, citing concerns about the possible effect on their stock prices.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/business/business-people-other-women-in-the-news.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">BUSINESS PEOPLE; Other Women in the News<date>Published: August 03, 2003</date><text>Mary Meeker.

Xerox recorded expenses of $183 million, or 25 cents a share, in the first quarter in anticipation of losing its appeal. The company still needs to assess yesterday's ruling, a spokeswoman, Christa Carone, said. Xerox was sued by retirees in 2000 over the methods it used to determine payments to 25,000 employees. The United States District Court in Illinois ruled in favor of the retirees in October, and Xerox appealed.

''The chapter is closed on our turnaround story,'' Anne M. Mulcahy, its chief executive, said.Xerox said that it had ample cash on hand and access to plenty more; that operating income and equipment sales had risen nicely; that gross margins were high; and that overall sales were poised to grow again, after 10 consecutive quarters of decline.''Without a lot of help from the economy, we delivered on all fronts,'' Ms. Mulcahy told analysts during a conference call.But while many on Wall Street applauded the quarter's performance, no analyst was recommending that investors buy Xerox shares.''Analysts are still saying, 'Show me this is sustainable before I'll step up to the plate,' '' said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call.There was ample reason for worry. Net income, including one-time charges, was 9 cents a share, down 2 cents from the period last year. The number of pages copied or printed declined, as companies continued to switch from stand-alone copiers to digital systems that can ship and store data electronically as well as on paper. Thus, sales of high-margin services and supplies like ink and paper again declined, albeit by only 1 percent -- the smallest percentage decline in more than two years.Analysts even saw a downside to the rise in equipment sales. They worried that Xerox competitors -- particularly Canon and Ricoh -- would fight back with price cuts, forcing Xerox's gross margins back down.''Canon has never quietly accepted a loss of market share,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid who has a hold rating on Xerox shares.In the quarter ended June 30, Xerox earned $86 million, on revenue of $3.92 billion; in the period last year, it earned $87 million, or 11 cents, on revenue of $3.95 billion. Operating earnings of $131 million, or 14 cents a share, beat analysts' expectations by 2 cents. Ms. Mulcahy confirmed Xerox's forecast of 50 cents to 55 cents a share for the full year.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/08/us/foundation-to-keep-leader-accused-of-fraud-at-xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Foundation to Keep Leader Accused of Fraud at Xerox<date>Published: July 08, 2003</date><text>The board of the Ford Foundation, one of the country's largest private charitable foundations, has decided to keep its chairman despite accusations by federal regulators that he participated in accounting fraud when he was chairman and chief executive of the Xerox Corporation.The decision came after the chairman, Paul A. Allaire, agreed to pay a $1 million penalty and forfeit $7.6 million in bonus pay and the proceeds from stock sales at Xerox and interest on those sums. He was also barred from serving as a director of a public corporation for five years as part of the settlement reached in June with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said he and five other Xerox executives allowed the company to overstate its profits by $1.4 billion over four years. Under the settlement, the officials neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.After the settlement, four members of the board's executive committee, which makes decisions on behalf of the board between its meetings, discussed what Mr. Allaire's future role at the foundation should be, and after consulting 12 other board members, they concluded that no changes were necessary.''We were committed to doing what we considered and consider the right thing, and that is what is best for the foundation, which is to stay with a man who has been an exemplary leader,'' said Kathryn S. Fuller, president and chief executive of the World Wildlife Fund and a member of the executive committee. (Mr. Allaire is a member of the committee but did not take part in the discussion.)Though its tax exemption is effectively a public subsidy and its assets are for the benefit of the public, Ford, like many other foundations, does not consider itself a public entity. Its board explained its decision by making that distinction.''As the terms of that settlement do not relate to Mr. Allaire's service with private organizations and having considered the matter carefully, the board strongly reaffirms his role as its chairman,'' the board said in a statement read by Alex Wilde, Ford's spokesman.Mr. Allaire could not be reached for comment, and a spokeswoman for Xerox said the company no longer handled his press relations.The decision has raised questions among some of the foundation's staff members and comes at a time when the governance and accountability practices of the nonprofit world are attracting greater scrutiny.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/12/business/company-news-xerox-plans-3.1-billion-recapitalization.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; XEROX PLANS $3.1 BILLION RECAPITALIZATION<date>Published: June 12, 2003</date><text>The Xerox Corporation plans a $3.1 billion recapitalization to strengthen its balance sheet and to repay and terminate its current bank facility.

That's when the company said its shareholders would pay most of the $22 million in penalties levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission against six former executives in settling the case.Only $3 million of the penalties, classified by regulators as a fine, would be paid by the executives named in the case. Xerox also disclosed that its long-suffering shareholders would pay the legal fees of the individuals who had settled the case without admitting or denying guilt.The $19 million and undisclosed legal fees may be chump change compared with the billions in losses that Xerox shareholders have incurred since reports appeared of accounting irregularities at the company. But requiring shareholders to pay regulators' penalties certainly adds insult to injury. It illuminates yet another failing in corporate governance, one that shareholders must pick up their pitchforks to correct.Unfortunately, Xerox shareholders are not alone in being required to pay such a bill. Because of so-called indemnification provisions in most companies' bylaws, shareholders almost always end up paying the penalties to which company officials agree when they settle with regulators. But the provisions can also mean that shareholders cover these costs when companies choose to litigate such cases rather than settle without admitting or denying guilt.S.E.C. rules say the existence of such provisions must be disclosed annually by companies. In a speech on Thursday, William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the commission, said he was no fan of state laws that allow shareholders to pay penalties ordered in legal cases involving corporate officers and directors. But it is unlikely that the S.E.C. would move to force companies to eliminate the policies; that would be outside its normal purview.A state legislature could ban indemnity provisions for all companies that choose to be domiciled within its boundaries. Delaware is officially home to most American corporations, but New York, where Xerox is incorporated, and California also have their share. Alas, quick action on this matter by the states is unlikely as well.Of course, companies that care about shareholders could change their bylaws to make their officials culpable in such cases. Then again, hell might freeze over first.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/06/business/6-from-xerox-to-pay-sec-22-million.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">6 From Xerox To Pay S.E.C. $22 Million<date>Published: June 06, 2003</date><text>Six former top officials at the Xerox Corporation agreed yesterday to pay more than $22 million to settle accusations by securities regulators that they participated in a large accounting fraud that allowed the company to overstate its profits by $1.4 billion over four years.In a civil lawsuit filed yesterday in Federal District Court in New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the executives of taking part in a scheme that misled investors about the financial results of Xerox from 1997 to 2000. Under the settlement, the officials neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.The penalties included profits the executives made from selling Xerox shares during the period, as well as parts of their bonuses that the S.E.C. said were based on profits that should not have been reported.But the effect on the executives will be far smaller than those numbers would indicate. Xerox said that it would reimburse the executives for all but $3 million of the money they are paying and would also pay for their legal fees. The $3 million was classified as a fine by the S.E.C. and cannot be reimbursed under its rules.''Since these individuals were not found guilty of any wrongdoing, under the bylaws of the company, Xerox is required to indemnify them for legal fees and disgorgement,'' said Christa Carone, a spokeswoman for Xerox. ''We are now in discussions with our insurance carriers to file claims for these settlement-related expenses.''William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the S.E.C., expressed concern in a speech last night, though he did not specifically name Xerox. ''The fight against corporate fraud requires resolve in the boardroom and at all levels of government,'' he told the New York Financial Writers' Association.''I'm concerned about companies that, under permissive state laws, indemnify their officers and directors against disgorgement and penalties ordered in law-enforcement actions, including those brought by the commission.''In my mind, this just isn't good, sound public policy,'' he said. ''This is an area in which we may need to consider ways to bring about reform.''S.E.C. officials said that the money paid by the officials would go into a fund that could be used to reimburse investors who lost money because of what the S.E.C. views as the fraud perpetrated by the executives.Ms. Carone said the important issue was that the men had not been convicted of a crime.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/business/responsible-party-bill-loughlin-changing-cues-for-copiers.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">RESPONSIBLE PARTY: BILL LOUGHLIN; Changing Cues For Copiers<date>Published: May 11, 2003</date><text>THE evolution of copier controls -- toward touch screens, and away from hard buttons that can be labeled with Braille -- has made it almost impossible for the blind and visually impaired to use features like stapling and collating that others take for granted.But a new software program, the Xerox Copier Assistant, may reopen a door that technological advancements closed. The text-to-speech software, which ''reads'' what is on screen to the user, is embedded in a standard PC attached to a copier.Bill Loughlin, a product and program marketing manager at Xerox who led the team of designers and engineers on the project, recalled, though, that the road from idea to final product was sometimes rough.Last fall, some employees from the Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired-Goodwill in Rochester were invited to the offices of Xerox to try the prototype. After some tire-kicking, Mr. Loughlin asked the group whether the software should be put on sale.''They universally said, 'Absolutely not,''' he remembered, laughing.The designers had incorporated terminology that was confusing to the test group -- in the context of a copier. Did ''zoom,'' for example, mean to enlarge or to shrink? And the program was modeled on a touch screen navigation system, which was unfamiliar to the group and thus almost impossible to maneuver.''We were approaching it as sighted persons saying, 'Hey, it's all there,''' he said. ''But we didn't realize we were using our eyes as well.''Mr. Loughlin and his team retooled the Copier Assistant to the specifications of the testers, who then gave it a thumbs up.The Copier Assistant, which costs $495, can now be used only with the Document Center 500 series Digital Copiers, but it will be adapted for other copiers shortly. Mr. Loughlin said there are plans to build the software into the copiers eventually.Mr. Loughlin, 60, began his career at Xerox in the sales department more than 30 years ago. He started thinking about the project early last year as part of a company effort to make Xerox products comply with new federal regulations requiring all information technology bought by the government to be accessible to people with disabilities.Gidget Hopf, the president of A.B.V.I.-Goodwill and the leader of the test group, said she hopes that the software will level ''the playing field so that they don't need to rely on someone else.''

They described the plans as a significant extension of a strategy first introduced last summer with new higher-end color copiers that have been selling strongly.''Xerox is moving toward refreshing products annually, like car companies, and they have gotten much more aggressive on pricing and packaging,'' said James W. Lundy, a former Xerox executive who now follows the office equipment industry for Gartner, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn.The new strategy could eat into Xerox's profits in the short term, particularly if competitors respond with price cuts of their own. But analysts said it was necessary for Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox's chairwoman and chief executive, to demonstrate to Wall Street that after two years of drastic measures to reduce losses and stabilize the company, she now has a strategy to make it grow.Last week, Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., reported that its revenue in the first quarter fell 2.6 percent from a year earlier to $3.76 billion, the 12th quarter in a row of year-over-year declines. Xerox shares ended trading yesterday at $9.86, more than double their low of last November but still far short of the $64 level they touched in 1999.A big challenge for Xerox is to counter the image it had developed as a vendor of highly sophisticated products that sold at premium prices and were often loaded with more accessories and functions than many customers wanted.''They have been perceived as being so much more expensive that in a lot of cases they weren't even being invited to bid,'' said Richard Norton, president of DocuTrends, a Saratoga, Calif., market research firm.Office copiers and related equipment and services are expected to account for about half of Xerox's business this year, or about $7.5 billion in sales.</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/business/company-news-xerox-reports-a-narrower-quarterly-loss.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; XEROX REPORTS A NARROWER QUARTERLY LOSS<date>Published: April 24, 2003</date><text>The Xerox Corporation reported a first-quarter net loss yesterday as a one-time charge for litigation wiped out a profit. Xerox said it had a loss of $65 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a loss of $114 million, or 16 cents a share, for the year-earlier period. On Monday, Xerox, the maker of printers and copiers, announced a charge of $183 million, or 25 cents a share, for litigation involving its pension plan. Excluding the charge, Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said it had a profit of 13 cents a share, better than the 8 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.

Her salary was unchanged at $1 million; her bonus rose 20 percent, to $1.5 million from $1.25 million. Other compensation fell nearly 24 percent, to about $67,000 from about $88,000.In the filing, Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said the compensation reflected Ms. Mulcahy's work to fix the company's finances and regain credibility with investors.The company last year restated $6.4 billion in revenue over five years and paid a $10 million fine for recording sales prematurely. Ms. Mulcahy has cut more than 17,000 jobs in the last two years and has slowed a sales decline.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/business/company-news-xerox-hires-treasurer-from-phone-equipment-company.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; XEROX HIRES TREASURER FROM PHONE EQUIPMENT COMPANY<date>Published: April 08, 2003</date><text>The Xerox Corporation, the copier maker, has hired Rhonda Seegal of Avaya as treasurer to succeed Gregory B.

''Previously, computer systems had been designed for groups or organizations.''It would be another two years before an unruly group of hobbyists would ignite the personal computer industry, but the Alto was the machine that established the concept of a computer under a single user's control.In a world in which computing had just moved from decks of punch cards to multiuser text-based terminal screens, the luminous Alto display, covered with images and graphical fonts, was a revelation.It served as the inspiration for the Apple Lisa and Macintosh after Apple Computer's co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, visited the laboratory for a demonstration. The machine had a similar impact at Microsoft, which, like Mr. Jobs, hired away important researchers from the Xerox center, known as PARC.The Alto was the brainchild of Alan Kay, a young computer scientist who had studied at the University of Utah and taught briefly at Stanford University. Dr. Kay and his researchers had been early to foresee that computers would become more than digital calculators, evolving into a medium capable of blending sound, digital video and information.He was interested in proving his ideas by working on interactive educational systems for children. He had been circulating the idea of a portable machine he called a Dynabook that anticipated many features of the laptop computer.Yet in 1972 his idea for building a computer to teach children had been rejected by a Xerox lab manager, who dismissed the idea as being too far outside the research center's charter.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/29/business/a-worst-companies-list-from-calpers.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">A Worst-Companies List From Calpers<date>Published: March 29, 2003</date><text>The nation's largest pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, has released an annual report identifying companies that it says are corporate America's worst because of poor corporate governance and stock performance, with Xerox atop the list.Officials from Xerox, as well as representatives from other corporations named Thursday, challenged those claims, saying they have acted on their own to reverse questionable corporate behavior.Tumbling stocks and large bonuses for top executives drove the $131 billion pension fund to name six companies, including the entertainment company Gemstar-TV Guide International, based in Pasadena, Calif., and the JDS Uniphase Corporation of San Jose, Calif., as the fund's poorest performers.The pension fund, known as Calpers, said the companies were selected from a list of 1,800 in which the fund has investments. The companies were chosen based on their long-term stock performance, corporate governance practices and net operating profit.The president of Calpers, Sean Harrigan, said the pension fund, which owns a combined 11.6 million shares in the six named companies, would pressure the companies' boards for change.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/business/fraud-suit-names-kpmg-and-partners.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Fraud Suit Names KPMG And Partners<date>Published: January 30, 2003</date><text>The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud complaint yesterday against KPMG, one of the four remaining large accounting firms, claiming that it knew for years that Xerox was improperly inflating its profits and helped it do so.The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, also named four KPMG partners, including Michael A. Conway, one of the firm's most senior officials and a former chairman of the industry group that was in charge of assuring that accounting firms did quality audits.KPMG and lawyers for some of the partners denied the allegations and said the firm had acted properly. KPMG called the suit ''clearly unjustified,'' adding that ''at the very worst, this is a disagreement over complex professional judgments.''It was only the second time in recent years that the commission accused a major accounting firm of fraud. In 2001, the S.E.C. obtained a consent decree against Arthur Andersen stemming from the firm's audits of Waste Management.Andersen collapsed last year, after the Enron scandal erupted and the firm was convicted of criminal charges in that case. Justice Department officials cited the earlier Waste Management case as a major reason it decided to file the criminal charges.In its complaint against KPMG, the S.E.C. said that auditors for the firm had repeatedly pointed to ways that Xerox management had manipulated its results to raise reported profits by more than $1.2 billion before taxes from 1997 through 2000. But it said that the company had refused to change the process and that senior partners at KPMG had repeatedly decided to sign off on bad accounting.''Instead of putting a stop to Xerox's fraudulent accounting, the KPMG defendants themselves engaged in fraud,'' the suit stated. ''There was no watchdog at Xerox. KPMG's bark sounded no warning to investors; its bite was toothless.''The S.E.C. said that Xerox managers repeatedly adjusted the results sent in by field offices, making what the commission called ''topside'' adjustments to assure that the company met Wall Street forecasts. Xerox stock rose rapidly in the late 1990's, as those results were viewed as evidence that the company was successfully dealing with increased competition.''Although the defendants sometimes meekly challenged manipulative topside accounting devices at Xerox, they were easily satisfied by untested, self-serving management explanations,'' the S.E.C. complaint stated.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/23/business/kpmg-expects-sec-move-over-audits-done-for-xerox.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">KPMG Expects S.E.C. Move Over Audits Done for Xerox<date>Published: January 23, 2003</date><text>The accounting firm KPMG said yesterday that it expected the Securities and Exchange Commission to file a civil complaint against the firm for its work as auditor for the Xerox Corporation.KPMG did not provide details of the reason for the anticipated complaint, which would probably be filed in federal court in Manhattan, and a spokeswoman for the S.E.C. declined to comment. KPMG, which said it stood by its audits, said the complaint would probably name the firm, three current partners and one former partner.''Today's charged regulatory environment has resulted in inappropriate actions being taken,'' KPMG's chief executive, Eugene D. O'Kelly, said. ''The result is a great injustice to KPMG and the four partners involved.''If the S.E.C. files a complaint, KPMG would become only the second major accounting firm to face such charges in recent decades. The first was Arthur Andersen, which settled fraud charges in connection with its audit of Waste Management in 2001, the year before it was driven out of business as a result of the Enron scandal.The S.E.C. settled a complaint against Xerox in April, when the company said it would pay a $10 million fine and restate its financial results as far back as 1997. The company later reported that the total amount of the restatement was $6.4 billion, with the effect of lowering revenues and profits in 1997, 1998 and 1999 but raising them in 2000 and 2001.KPMG, which Xerox fired as its auditor in 2001, has consistently said that it did nothing wrong in approving Xerox's accounting.At issue in the S.E.C. complaint filed against Xerox, which will most likely be the basis of any complaint against KPMG, was the method of accounting for recording revenue and profit from multiyear copier leases.The S.E.C. said that the method used violated generally accepted accounting principles; KPMG has argued that the method is acceptable and that the S.E.C. was advised in advance that the method was being used.KPMG also said that PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm brought in to replace KPMG, had concurred with KPMG's accounting at Xerox.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/16/technology/palm-changes-system-for-handwriting-input.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">Palm Changes System For Handwriting Input<date>Published: January 16, 2003</date><text>PERHAPS recognizing the handwriting on the wall, Palm Inc. is changing the handwriting input component of its Palm operating system for hand-held organizers.Palm said this week that its PalmSource software division would drop the Graffiti handwriting recognition software built into Palm OS and switch to Jot, a program from the Communication Intelligence Corporation. Palm said that Jot was more intuitive than Graffiti because it allowed the use of conventional handwriting for entering letters into hand-held devices.In Graffiti, the user enters a symbol that may be similar to the letter or number it represents but is not necessarily identical. T, for example, is entered as something resembling a 7 to eliminate any need to lift the stylus for a second stroke. In Jot, a T will simply be entered as a normal T.The new software, which has been licensed by Palm, will be called Graffiti 2 Powered by Jot and will be embedded in current and future versions of Palm OS, Palm said.While PalmSource says it is moving to Graffiti 2 to make handwriting on hand-helds easier and to expand its market, the company acknowledged it had stepped up research on Jot and other input software because of a legal cloud.In 1997, the Xerox Corporation sued U.S. Robotics, which was then Palm's parent company, arguing that the Graffiti feature of Palm OS infringed on copyrights for Xerox's Unistroke software, which recognizes one-stroke motions as characters.In December 2001 the United States District Court in Rochester ruled that Palm had infringed on Xerox patents, and in February 2002 the court ordered Palm to post a $50 million bond to cover potential damages.Palm appealed the district court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A three-judge panel heard the case last week and is expected to rule in two to four months, said Christa Carone, a spokeswoman for Xerox.Ms. Carone said that Palm's decision to switch its input system would not affect Xerox's suit. ''Xerox expects to be fairly compensated by Palm for all its past infringements,'' she said.Marlene Somsak, a spokeswoman for Palm Solutions, Palm's hardware unit, said that Palm's decision to switch to the Jot-based system was final regardless of the outcome of the dispute.Palm officials predicted that most users would have no trouble making the switch.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/21/business/company-news-xerox-says-it-understated-interest-payments.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; XEROX SAYS IT UNDERSTATED INTEREST PAYMENTS<date>Published: December 21, 2002</date><text>The Xerox Corporation, whose financial practices recently led to a $10 million fine, said yesterday that it had discovered an error that resulted in an understatement of interest expense. The error was identified by the company and occurred with the adoption of an accounting standard in January 2001, Xerox said. It resulted in an after-tax understatement of interest expense of $5 million to $6 million, or less than 1 cent a share, in each of the four quarters of 2001 and for the first three quarters of 2002. Christa Carone, a Xerox spokeswoman, said Xerox had $903 million in interest expense last year. To adjust for the items, Xerox will restate its 2001 financial statements and revise 2002 quarterly financial information.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/03/business/technology-xerox-says-new-material-will-allow-plastic-transistors.html?ref=xeroxcorporation">TECHNOLOGY; Xerox Says New Material Will Allow Plastic Transistors<date>Published: December 03, 2002</date><text>A Xerox technologist will describe a new material today that allows the creation of ''printed'' plastic transistors, which the company says could one day make possible inexpensive, lightweight and flexible displays for cellphones, laptops and televisions.The advance will be detailed in a paper to be presented at the Materials Research Conference in Boston by Beng Ong, a research fellow at Xerox Research Center of Canada in Mississauga, Ontario. He will describe an experimental polymer that can be used to make organic transistors on a plastic substrate.''We believe polymers will be much easier and lower cost to manufacture,'' said Tony Paine, an executive at Xerox's innovation group in Toronto. He said that a near-term commercial application for the new material could be in the manufacturing of the transistors that serve as the drivers for liquid crystal displays, like those used in phones and personal digital assistants, or P.D.A.'s.''Think about the value of a laptop or cellphone display that you could drop without breaking,'' said Raj Apte, a member of the research staff at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. ''Making a cellphone or a P.D.A. that you could sit on is a no-brainer.''The new material is promising, Xerox researchers said yesterday, because it will potentially have the electronic properties of silicon while also being slow to degrade in the presence of oxygen. Earlier organic semiconductors were impractical because they decayed when exposed to air.The material, polythiophene, has achieved performance on electronics benchmarks that is an order of magnitude greater than current polymer materials.Xerox researchers said the company envisioned a new electronics manufacturing process on roll-to-roll machinery, which is now used in publishing and in the manufacturing of solar cells. Under a grant from the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the Palo Alto Research Center is experimenting with Dow Chemical and Motorola to create a manufacturing process based on roll-to-roll material handling and depositing that would form the polymer material into circuit patterns using ink jets.Currently, silicon-based microelectronic devices are made using a photo-lithographic manufacturing process that involves depositing and chemically etching materials on a rigid silicon substrate.Other researchers in the field said plastic semiconductors that could be printed in high volume and low cost were a hot area for research and commercial activity.''I'm aware of six or eight companies trying to make these transistors,'' said Dr. Michael D. McCreary, vice president for research and development at E Ink, a display manufacturer in Cambridge, Mass. He said that his company planned to commercialize its first display next year and that it had created a prototype plastic display in partnership with Lucent Technologies.</text></article></page></root>
