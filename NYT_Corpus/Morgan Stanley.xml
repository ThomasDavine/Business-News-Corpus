This is not a scam. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Nigeria, the West African nation that has gained notoriety for the illicit e-mail spammers aiming for Western bank accounts, is attracting attention for legitimate financial opportunities — investing its own savings. In an effort to preserve and increase its oil revenue, the country recently established a so-called sovereign wealth fund, following the path of many resource-rich countries. Now, Wall Street titans like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are courting top government officials, aiming to grab a piece of a portfolio that could eventually be worth tens of billions of dollars. “The country is at a point of inflection, and what we do in the next few years will set the pace,” said Olusegun Aganga, the former Nigerian finance minister and current minister for trade and investment, who helped create the sovereign wealth fund. “It’s a land of opportunities, which unfortunately has not been tapped well.” More than half a century after discovering oil in the Niger Delta, the country continues to subsist barrel to barrel. Poverty is rampant. Public corruption is pervasive. And the government coffers are bare, even though Nigeria is the 10th-largest oil producer in the world. By saving and investing the petro dollars, Nigeria hopes to break the resource curse. The nation, which derives 80 percent of its revenue from oil, created the sovereign wealth fund to buffer its economy from volatile commodity prices and impose fiscal discipline. The government so far has set aside $1 billion for the fund, and it could funnel as much as $2.5 billion a year, if oil prices remain high. “One of our biggest problems in civil society is the time horizon that we’re operating on — whether election cycles or quarterly reports,” said Ashby H.B. Monk, a research associate at the University of Oxford who studies sovereign wealth funds. “The idea of a sovereign fund is to give government bureaucrats an opportunity to make long-term policy knowing that the buffeting winds of capitalism won’t blow them off course.” Such funds have become powerful investment forces over the years. Abu Dhabi and Kuwait have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars by plowing their oil riches into stocks, bonds and other global assets. During the financial crisis, sovereign wealth funds provided critical capital to banks and other troubled firms. To grab a piece of the lucrative business, big banks and asset managers have tirelessly cultivated relationships with governments worldwide and added teams dedicated to sovereign wealth funds. In recent months, bankers, lawyers and consultants flew to the Nigerian capital of Abuja to pitch officials on their services. The government chose JPMorgan Chase as one of its advisers on the structuring of the fund. In other countries, the Wall Street feeding frenzy has drawn criticism. The Libyan Investment Authority, which was started in 2006, has complained that it lost millions of dollars on several investments, while money managers generated huge fees, according to documents leaked this summer to Global Witness, an advocacy group. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether American money managers, in trying to land business with sovereign wealth funds, violated antibribery laws, according to people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about the inquiry. “If you don’t get these organizations designed correctly as sophisticated investment operations, you can lose a lot of money,” Mr. Monk said. “It’s the power of finance — for good or bad.” Nigeria’s new fund is the brainchild of Mr. Aganga, a Nigerian native who worked at Ernst &amp; Young’s London office before joining Goldman Sachs in 2001. Last year, the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, asked Mr. Aganga to join his cabinet. As the minister of finance, Mr. Aganga pushed to start a sovereign wealth fund almost immediately. He had helped oversee part of Goldman’s Africa business, and knew Nigeria was among the last oil-rich nations without an investment portfolio. “It’s important that we have some savings for the future generations,” Mr. Aganga said. “It just makes sense for your economy. You’re completely exposed otherwise.” But Nigeria has a spotty record managing its money. In 2004, the country started plowing extra oil revenue into a separate account, as a way to build savings. At one point, the portfolio held an estimated $20 billion, analysts say. The funds did not last long. State and federal authorities leaders regularly siphoned off money to fill budget holes, build utilities or pay for other projects. By last year, the assets had plummeted to less than $1 billion. “There were no rules about withdrawals or whom it belonged to among the three tiers of government in Nigeria,” said Razia Khan, head of African research at Standard Chartered Bank. To avoid making the same mistakes, Nigeria is earmarking assets for different purposes in a structure that mirrors older sovereign wealth funds. One portfolio, which will invest in stocks and bonds, is focused on long-term growth in preparation for the day when the oil wells run dry. An infrastructure portfolio will support upgrades to the country’s bridges, roads, buildings and railways. During periods of weakness, the government will have an emergency account to prop up the economy. But officials will be able to access the money only under certain circumstances, like a steep drop in oil prices. Commitment will be crucial. Some politicians are already grumbling that the sovereign wealth fund will divert assets that the economy desperately needs now, and they are threatening to derail the effort. Such pressure, said John Campbell, a former United States ambassador to Nigeria and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research center, could prompt the country to “raid the cookie jar” to deal with short-term issues. “Unless there is the political will to live up to those aspirations,” he said, “it’s not going to work very well.” “My view is, better mute the trumpets for the time being,” Mr. Campbell said. It will come down to execution, say Nigerian officials and outside analysts. The government is tapping an independent board to oversee the investment process and to ensure compliance. While critics point to the delay in naming those directors as a potential concern, authorities defend their position. They argue that the new finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former managing director at the World Bank, who was sworn in this August, needs time to learn all about existing matters. The board “will define how effective this becomes,” said Fola Oyeyinka, an adviser to the Nigerian minister of finance. “The flavor of that board will dictate not just to Nigerians but to the world how serious we are.”</text></article>

Quarterly numbers — due in the coming weeks — hint at its ability to hit manufacturing targets. But Silicon Valley-style growth is central to the story.Like many young tech companies, Tesla burns cash. In the coming months, it will wind down its run of 2,500 blisteringly fast Roadster cars, and next year, it will start producing the more sedate Model S sedan at a rate of 20,000 a year. The group, led by Elon Musk, expects its new model to cost about $150 million to bring to market. That is not a lot by Detroit’s standards, but start-ups need to hew closely to budget and schedule — something investors look for in Tesla’s quarterly reports. The real value is longer term. Morgan Stanley analysts have an optimistic case in which electric vehicles of various types take 25 percent of the global car market by 2025 — from 0.1 percent this year — and Tesla grabs roughly a tenth of that. By then, its shares could be worth $135 apiece, almost five times the current level. The analysts’ more pessimistic outlook, though, is that the company eventually runs out of cash, despite having resources totaling $662 million at the end of June. Either outcome may be extreme. But Tesla’s stock price is still anticipating impressive growth. Its enterprise value of nearly $3 billion is more than five times the average analyst estimate of revenue for 2012, according to Thomson Reuters. Take 2013, when the Model S is set to be produced all year, and that ratio drops to 1.5 times. But that still implies a dose of Google, which trades at just under four times, as well as a slug of Ford, valued below one times estimated 2013 sales. To justify today’s valuation, Tesla needs to start selling cars well beyond the Roadster niche. And for long-term upside, electric cars must catch on with the world’s driving public. A documentary that opened on Friday, “Revenge of the Electric Car,” looks at resurgent development at Tesla, General Motors and Nissan — five years after the same director wondered “Who Killed the Electric Car?” Tesla needs the revenge to be powerful and long-lasting. The New Nifty Fifty Though downtrodden world equity market indexes point to deep disquiet among investors, valuations of individual stocks vary widely. Fishing the bottom for low-rated bargains is one way forward. Ironically, shareholders may be better served by paying for higher-class equities. The world’s 200 largest quoted stocks trade at an average of 11.5 times expected forward-year earnings, according to Thomson Reuters’s Starmine database. The average hides a broad range, even excluding outliers. BP trades on a multiple of six. L’Oréal, the French cosmetics company, sits at nearly 18 times earnings. Stocks priced below average are sure to attract the attention of bargain hunters — especially when the averages themselves are modest by historical standards. But Morgan Stanley research published this week supports the ageless wisdom that investors often get what they pay for, and that it may be worth paying premium prices for premium quality. Often, but not always. Morgan Stanley looks back to the Nifty Fifty stocks of the 1960s. The companies were supposed to offer high growth and low risk, and enthusiasts argued that the companies — Procter &amp; Gamble, I.B.M. and Polaroid were on the list — were all but certain to grow enough to justify any valuation. For a while, it all worked out well. From 1964 to 1972, the Nifty Fifty companies produced better earnings growth than their American peers, and their share prices outperformed the S.&amp; P. index by 15 percent a year. But enthusiasm became excess. The Nifty Fifty price-earnings ratio topped 40 at the height of the bull market that preceded the stock market rout of 1973-74. In the later 1970s, Nifty Fifty shares underperformed. The current market looks more like 1964 than 1972. Of the 200 largest public companies around the world, a top-notch group of 50 are on course to deliver an average 20 percent increase in earnings in the next 12 months. These shares trade on a forward price-to-earnings ratio — calculated by Starmine — of 13. Even if the analysts’ estimates are optimistic, there appears to be good value in the next generation Nifty Fifty.

Dexia’s problems are not entirely caused by Europe’s debt crisis, but some issues in its case are a matter of broader debate. Among them are how much of a bailout banks should get, and the size of the losses they should take on loans that governments cannot repay. Among Dexia’s biggest trading partners are several large United States institutions, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. To limit damage from Dexia’s collapse, the bailout fashioned by the French and Belgian governments may make these banks and other creditors whole — that is, paid in full for potentially tens of billions of euros they are owed. This would enable Dexia’s creditors and trading partners to avoid losses they might otherwise suffer without the taxpayer rescue. Whether this sets a precedent if Europe needs to bail out other banks will be closely watched. The debate centers on how much of a burden taxpayers should bear to support banks that made ill-advised loans or trades. Many on Wall Street and in government argue that rescues are essential, to avoid the risk of destabilizing the financial system — with one bank’s failure to pay its obligations leading to problems at other banks. But others counter that the rescue of Dexia is reminiscent of the United States’ decision to fully protect big banks that were the trading partners of the American International Group when it collapsed, a decision that was sharply questioned and examined by Congress. Critics warn of a replay of the financial crisis in autumn 2008, when governments used taxpayer money to shore up troubled companies, then allowed them to transfer those funds to their trading partners to protect those institutions from losses. In using public money to rescue private institutions, these critics say, policy makers effectively rewarded banks that traded with companies that were in trouble, rather than penalizing them, and that encouraged risky behavior. “The question is did the A.I.G. experience and the bailouts generally contribute to the current situation?” asked Jonathan Koppell, director of the School of Public Affairs at Arizona State University. Would the banks, he continued, “have had a different view in dealing with Greece — or with Dexia for that matter — if those who had dealt with A.I.G. hadn’t been made whole?” Given the global and interconnected nature of the financial system, institutions around the world have other types of indirect risk to European debt problems. But the scope of these ties is not fully known, because the exposure is hidden by complex transactions that do not have to be reported in detail. Dexia, which was bailed out by France and Belgium once before, in 2008, is just a small piece of the broader European debt and banking turmoil. But its collapse comes at a critical point, as European officials are meeting this weekend to work out how taxpayer money should be used to resolve the Continent’s debt crisis. The most acrimonious debate has been over the amount of losses banks should suffer for lending hundreds of billions of euros to countries that may not be able to fully repay. In the case of Greece, big lenders in Europe have tentatively agreed to swallow modest losses on what they are owed, but are resisting proposals that would force them to take a much bigger hit. Even if they accept losses, they may then seek tens or hundreds of billions in capital infusions from their governments. As the Dexia bailout deal closed last week and was approved by the French Parliament, officials overseeing the restructuring say that the bank will meet all of its obligations in full. Alexandre Joly, the head of strategy, portfolios and market activities at Dexia, said in an interview that the idea of forcing Dexia’s trading partners to accept a discount on what they are owed “is a monstrous idea.” He added, “It is not compatible with rules governing the euro zone, and it has never, ever been considered to our knowledge by any government in charge of the supervision of the banks.” 1 2 Next Page »As Europe’s debt crisis has deepened, a recurring question is how much risk it poses to the United States economy, and especially American banks.</text></article>

Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, said the firm “has made far more progress than it is being given credit.” 8:54 p.m. | Updated What a difference a few weeks can make. In early October, shares of Morgan Stanley dipped below $12 during the day, as the financial firm battled rumors about its exposure to the European sovereign debt crisis. But the company is slowly shaking off the speculation, addressing some concerns with better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday. The stock — which rose as much as 6 percent on the news before ending essentially flat at $16.64 — is now up more than 40 percent from its low earlier this month. “Clearly, we are in a very dynamic environment and our journey is not done,” the bank’s chief executive. James P. Gorman, said in a conference call with analysts. “But the U.S. financial system in general, and Morgan Stanley in particular, has made far more progress than it is being given credit.” It is a marked change from a year ago. The company earned $2.15 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to a loss of $91 million a year ago. Despite the sharp drop in the stock market, it notched gains in core divisions like equity sales and wealth management In its results, Morgan Stanley moved to clarify its exposure to five countries at the center of the European debt crisis. It is less than some have feared, with just $2.11 billion in exposure, including hedges. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release Goldman Loss Offers Bad Omen for Wall Street Bank of America Loses Title as Biggest in U.S. But Morgan Stanley, like rivals, also got a major boost from one-time gains. The firm booked $3.4 billion on the falling value of the company’s debt. On a per share basis, the one-time gain accounted for 98 percent of the firm’s earnings. Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note to investors that it was a “weak quarter, but not as bad as anticipated.” Michael Mayo at Crédit Agricole Securities noted the “main news is that results were not worse than peers given inline declines in capital markets,” which were down sharply in the quarter. As with the rest of the industry, Morgan Stanley is trying to find its footing in a postfinancial crisis world, with a stricter regulatory regime and weaker growth prospects. With new rules forthcoming, the firm has exited high-margin businesses like proprietary trading. Instead, it is focusing on less risky groups like Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the firm’s global wealth management division, which is a less capital-intensive business with the potential for steady profits. In the latest quarter, the unit posted net revenue of $3.26 billion this quarter, compared with $3.1 billion in the period a year earlier. Still, the business got hit by the market turmoil, even as the firm logged record inflows. The division had $1.6 trillion assets under management in the quarter, down from $1.7 trillion in the previous quarter. Third-quarter revenue in institutional securities, bolstered mainly by the one-time gain on the value of Morgan Stanley’s debt, increased 123 percent, to $6.45 billion. Asset management reported revenue of $215 million for the period, down 73 percent from the previous year on losses in firm investments. With the industry facing a more muted reality, Mr. Gorman told analysts that the firm intended to pay “those employees who are delivering value.” That is a theme that Wall Street chiefs have struck since last year, implying the best staff members would get competitive compensation while packages for the rest would fall. So far this year, Morgan Stanley has set aside $12.69 billion to cover compensation and benefits, up 6 percent from year-ago levels.</text></article>

The Cost of Being Gay A look at the financial realities of same-sex partnerships. Another financial titan has decided to extend a benefit that will put its gay and lesbian employees on equal footing with their heterosexual co-workers. Beginning Jan. 1, Morgan Stanley will begin reimbursing employees for the extra taxes they pay on health insurance for their same-sex partners. The news follows a similar announcement last week from Bank of America, which makes Morgan Stanley the sixth financial services firm to adopt the policy, joining Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas. The new policy has also spread relatively quickly among big consulting companies, law firms and handful of big technology companies. We’ve been keeping close track of who’s doing what on a scorecard. (You can see if your company made the list here.) For those of you who haven’t been following the issue closely, here’s some background: Under federal law, employer-provided health benefits for domestic partners are counted as taxable income, if the partner is not considered a dependent. On top of that, the employees cannot use pretax dollars to pay for their premiums — unlike their opposite-sex married counterparts. Since gay unions are not recognized by the federal government, same-sex couples can not avoid the extra costs by getting married. So while many large employers offer health insurance coverage for domestic partners, these employees must pay more to use it. Like several other firms, Morgan Stanley is covering the costs only for same-sex partners and their dependents. Eligible employees will be reimbursed with a lump sum once a year, a company spokeswoman said. Let us know if you’ve heard of any other companies that have adopted the policy, and we’ll add them to our chart.

    <article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/the-missed-red-flags-on-groupon/?ref=morganstanley">The Missed Red Flags on Groupon<date>October 17, 2011, 9:35 pm</date><text>Antoine Antoniol/Bloomberg NewsAndrew Mason, the founder of Groupon, said the I.P.O. would exceed expectations. This summer, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, flew to Chicago to personally pitch his firm to underwrite what was supposed to be the hottest initial public offering of the year: Groupon, the fledgling online coupon company that was being valued at around $30 billion. Mr. Blankfein’s pitch succeeded and Goldman was selected as one of three lead underwriters, including Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. As the summer progressed, some insiders whispered that the offering could value the company at even more. For Wall Street, the I.P.O. was the ultimate bragging right. They probably aren’t bragging anymore. DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Groupon’s triple-digit growth has slowed, slicing Groupon’s valuation in half — if not more. Analysts now suggest the valuation will be lucky to be more than $10 billion. A series of accounting and disclosure gaffes have brought the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, raising questions about the company’s credibility. The history of Groupon’s chairman, Eric Lefkofsky, was also unearthed, showing a lawsuit-prone entrepreneur who flipped a dot-com company in 1999 only to have it lead to bankruptcy a year later for the firm he had sold it to. And Groupon’s filing shows that when the company privately raised $950 million in a pre-I.P.O. round in January, it paid out $810 million of that to its investors and employees, a red flag for any investor. (Mr. Lefkofsky and his wife took home about $319 million of the total.) All of this raises an obvious question: How did so many Wall Street firms desperate to underwrite the Groupon I.P.O. miss these warning signs when pitching such a sky-high valuation? Or did they just turn a blind eye? “Underwriters are supposed to be gatekeepers, not just a sales and marketing agent,” said Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant for the S.E.C. “Underwriters have gotten to the point of being cheerleaders. I question whether they are really fulfilling their obligation to investors.” A cursory reading of the various versions of Groupon’s prospectus that the banks signed off on, as did the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, would give virtually anyone a modicum of pause. And a deep dive into the numbers should have raised alarm bells at the outset about even talking about the possibility of a $30 billion valuation. Here’s just one data point: Groupon has $225 million in the bank. The company lost $102.7 million in the last quarter on revenue of $878 million. If that were to continue at the same pace, it would need to find a new way to start making money quickly or raise new financing. That is why the I.P.O. could not come soon enough. (Groupon, it should be noted, says it does not intend to use the proceeds of the I.P.O. to finance operations in the next 12 months. But there is always next year.) In total, as of last quarter, the company had $681 million in current liabilities but only $376 million in assets. Among its liabilities, it owed $392 million to vendors. That is because the company receives money from customers before it has to pay its vendors, called a working capital deficit. In some cases, a working capital deficit is not a problem. Wal-Mart has a working capital deficit, too. But when there are questions about whether your business can continue to grow at the same rate, a working capital deficit can become a problem because it means you are relying on a steady stream of new revenue to pay off old liabilities. The company also spent $432 million in the first six months of the year on marketing, an unsustainable model. Add in the fact that Groupon’s revenue slowed in August, up only 13 percent, compared with 96 percent in the first half of the year, according to Yipit Data, and the picture becomes a bit nerve-racking. Groupon is in a quiet period ahead of its I.P.O., so the company, as well as its underwriters, is unable to comment publically. But in a memorandum to employees last month, Groupon’s chief executive and founder, Andrew Mason, said he was not worried: “We’re almost on the other side, and the negativity leaves us well positioned to exceed expectations with an I.P.O. baby that, having seen the ultrasound, I can promise you is not one of those uglies.” He also said that he planned to slow the company’s marketing expenditures. “Eventually, we’ll ramp down marketing just as fast as we ramped it up, reducing the customer acquisition part of our marketing expenses,” he wrote. Of course, it is possible that Groupon could update its prospectus with new numbers before the I.P.O., showing that it has already begun to get its house in order. If it were to really slow its marketing spending, it is possible Groupon could turn a profit. Even so, it does not fully explain how Groupon’s underwriters, whose endorsement of the company is supposed to be considered the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, originally came up with Groupon’s questionable $30 billion valuation. Perhaps more troubling, those same banks allowed their client to publish one of its first filings with an accounting gimmick. It was a made up metric called Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income that accounted for the company’s operating income but conveniently excluded several major expenses, including marketing and acquisition-related costs. That caught the eye of the S.E.C., and Groupon has since been forced to remove the accounting metric. The cynical reason that the banks stood by Groupon and its accounting shenanigans is most likely the expected fees from the offering. Even if Groupon’s I.P.O. values the company at $10 billion instead of $30 billion, the banks will probably walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. “There’s a ton of money to be had,” Mr. Turner said. “That’s what’s driving this.”</text></article>

In a news release announcing the deal, just seven investment banks and law firms were listed as having helped draft the transaction. That’s a relatively small number — and even smaller if you factor in the debt Kinder Morgan will assume as part of the takeover, which pushes the enterprise value up to roughly $38 billion. By contrast, AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA drew upon the services of 12 banks and law firms, while Hewlett-Packard‘s $11.7 billion purchase of Autonomy of Britain listed 14 advisers. (To be fair, people involved in the H.P. deal say only nine were intimately involved in putting the transaction together.) Even with the relatively few number of bankers and lawyers involved, there were still a few complexities to the adviser relationships. Goldman Sachs had already been advising El Paso on its prior plan to spin off its exploration and production businesses, while Morgan Stanley served as the main financial adviser on the Kinder Morgan deal and provided a fairness opinion. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz has been providing legal advice to El Paso on both matters. Meanwhile, Goldman has a relationship with Kinder Morgan as well. The firm’s private equity arm, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, was one of the backers of a $22 billion management buyout of the pipeline company led by Richard D. Kinder, the chief executive of the company, in 2006. Goldman sold some of its holdings in Kinder Morgan’s initial public offering in February. Two Goldman managing directors, Henry Cornell and Kenneth A. Pontarelli, also sit on Kinder Morgan’s board. They both work in Goldman’s principal investments division. Here’s the breakdown of the advisers behind the deal.

Look at this impressive rundown of the bank's critical numbers and ratios from Paul Gulberg, an investment banking analyst with the independent research firm Portales Partners. Morgan Stanley has much more capital and lower leverage than it did at the height of the financial crisis, which I like to think of as 9/08. It has almost $60 billion in common equity, compared with $36 billion before September 2008, and its ratios are stronger. Its trading book - which is volatile and where any bank can take sudden, large losses - is smaller than it was. Morgan Stanley has more long-term debt and higher deposits, both of which stabilize its finances. The bank has more cash available in case there's a crunch and a smaller amount of Level III assets, which don't have an independently verifiable value and so must be estimated by the bank. Hedge funds have parked a smaller amount of assets at Morgan Stanley. That's good because in the financial crisis, they pulled them from the bank. Yes, Morgan Stanley by any measure is a safe and solid investment bank. Except for one: The amount of trust people have in the whole financial and political system. It's just about zero. That's why the bank's shares are down 42 percent this year. That's why all the big bank stocks have had double-digit dips. True, they start their next round of quarterly reporting in a matter of days. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, and its earnings may calm fears temporarily. But the essential problem will still be there, a slow burn beneath the global financial system that flares up at the worst moments. Banks don't have faith in other banks, investors are deeply scarred and wary, and nobody believes that the governments around the world could grapple with the magnitude of the problems, even if they wanted to. Three months ago, the French-Belgian bank Dexia passed the European stress tests. By that measure, it was fine. Then it collapsed. This weekend France, Belgium and Luxembourg swooped in to save Dexia and pledged to figure out how to recapitalize European banks as a whole. So investors had a moment of euphoria on Monday: Governments will save institutions! While they probably won't hesitate to wipe out equity holders in failed financial institutions and will perhaps force the value of bondholders' investments to be trimmed, they will do everything they can to protect counterparties so that the system doesn't collapse. That's the hope, at least, and it has a rational basis. Almost universally, regulators and political leaders believe that letting Lehman fail in the fall of 2008 was a disastrous mistake. Its downfall cascaded throughout the global financial world, collapsing money markets, terrifying lenders to banks and accelerating the implosion of multiple financial institutions. So investors and policy makers, burned by the recent crisis, are all supposed to be acting more prudently and forcefully. Yet, the moment one examines almost any detail of the global financial system, faith falters once again. Take the uncertainty about the derivatives markets. Morgan Stanley has a face value of $56 trillion in derivatives. That's really nothing. JPMorgan Chase has more - amounting to the G.D.P. of large countries - a face value of $79 trillion in derivatives. If something goes wrong with just one-tenth of 1 percent of those trades, it's kablooie. Now those are gross numbers. Many people would dismiss those totals as ridiculous and misleading. Anyone who brings them up is merely displaying ignorance. The banks' derivatives portfolios are full of off-setting trades that net out at a smaller number. Derivatives can be dismissed as a popular bugaboo, but they really are just a symbol of the larger problem. A recitation of daily stories reveals all kinds of reasons that banks don't trust each other. To take just one news item, almost at random: Bloomberg News reported the other day that a Danish bank was refusing French sovereign debt as collateral. Nobody really knows how much exposure the American banks have to the European financial and political crisis. The Treasury Departmentminimizes the issue while other outlets raise the specter of catastrophic problems. So trust, naturally, is the casualty. ''If you get in a period of stress, everyone starts questioning whether the hedges will hold up and whether the collateral is good enough,'' said Mr. Gulberg, the banking analyst. Surely no bank would be so reckless as to accept dodgy collateral these days. It would hold out for something unassailable, like, say, Triple A mortgages on American homes. Wait, scratch that. It would accept sovereign debt, perhaps from some European realm that has been around for centuries. Whoops, no, no. Well, O.K., maybe United States Treasuries - and we'll agree to ignore that one of the country's two major political parties was willing to plunge the United States into default to achieve its aims. So there's concern about the collateral. But what about the hedges? Of course, they wouldn't hedge with some bank like Dexia, which at year-end had $700 billion worth of loans, undrawn commitments, financial guarantees and the like. Some financial institutions have to be on the other side of Dexia's commitments. Some might even be those supposedly strong and prudent banks that were supposed to have learned so much from the financial crisis. Did Morgan Stanley learn its lesson from the crisis? You begin to see the problem. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Morgan Stanley shares are down 42 percent this year.

Both its consumer and Wall Street businesses were hit hard by the still-anemic recovery in the United States. The bank made $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $4.4 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analysts’ consensus estimate of 96 cents a share. Shares of JPMorgan fell almost 5 percent on Thursday to $31.60. Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and chief executive, said that his bank had seen surprisingly few signs that consumers and businesses were retrenching. In fact, he pointed to a modest increase in credit card loans and a much sharper uptick in loan growth to small and midsize corporations as evidence the broader economy was doing much better than many had feared. In addition, loan losses appear to be stabilizing. “It hasn’t really strengthened, but the recovery is still here,” Mr. Dimon said in a conference call with journalists on Thursday. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release In one sign of confidence, the bank bought back more than $4.4 billion of shares and warrants during the third quarter. The paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter. That helped offset $1 billion the bank set aside in pretax funds to cover potential legal claims largely stemming from problems in its mortgage division. The bank also took a $542 million pretax loss in its private equity unit. Revenue remained under pressure, falling to $24.4 billion, or 11 percent, from the second quarter, amid a slowdown in stock and debt offerings that had propped up the bank’s results in the past. Difficult trading conditions, slimmer profit margins on lending, and the elimination of overdraft and other penalty fees all weighed on top-line growth. One thing that has not changed, however, is banker compensation. This year, workers at JPMorgan’s investment bank are on track to be paid, on average, about $389,000 per employee, up 4 percent from $369,000 per employee in 2010. Over all, the bank’s employees are poised to make about the same amount as they did in 2010 — an average of about $118,000 in salary, bonus, and other compensation. Star bankers and traders stand to reap millions. As a diversified bank and the first to report earnings, JPMorgan is seen as an indicator for the financial industry. It was among the first banks to prompt analysts to start cutting earnings estimates when it warned in early September of a sharp fall-off in its Wall Street businesses. The other big banks will report earnings next week; Citigroup and Wells Fargo are to release their results on Monday morning, and Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs follow later in the week. All are expected to report a similar slowdown in their investment banking businesses, with some analysts forecasting that Goldman Sachs will report its second quarterly loss as a public company. Investors are so concerned about the banks’ prospect for growth that they fled the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks are down more than 30 percent since January. Stagnant loan growth, higher capital requirements, and the reduction of once-lucrative debit card swipe fees are expected to take a big bite out of profits. What’s more, investors are increasingly nervous about the exposure of American banks to their counterparts in Europe, which have vast holdings of bonds backed by Greece and other nations with weak economies. The choppy markets weighed heavily on its JPMorgan’s investment bank’s results. Profits dropped 20 percent from the prior quarter, to $1.6 billion. Over all, trading revenue was down sharply from a year ago, when market conditions were much better. The bank’s large fixed-income and commodities operations fell 14 percent from the second quarter, while equities fell 15 percent, excluding the accounting gains taken on its debt. Investment banking fees fell 31 percent, as corporations shelved plans for acquisitions as well as stock and bonds deals, given all the uncertainty swirling in the markets. Those figures were roughly in line with guidance provided Wall Street in mid-September. Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan expected to eliminate around 1,000 jobs, largely through attrition. “We are building an investment bank for the long run but we always trim our sails,” he said. Chase Home Lending, the bank’s mortgage division, continues to bleed money. Losses have improved slightly, to around $900 million this quarter, but show few signs of letting up anytime soon. “We don’t expect a lot of improvement going forward in housing numbers,” Mr. Dimon said during the conference call. “It’s hard not to be cautious.” On top of that, Chase faces billions of dollars in potential legal claims stemming from the federal government and private investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage bonds backed by loans that quickly went sour. It might also have to pony up several billion dollars more as part of a settlement with federal and state regulators for its role in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure mess. Banking analysts say the mortgage problems could cost the bank up to $9 billion. The bank’s other major businesses fared a bit better, despite the looming concerns about the job and housing markets. Chase Card Services, its credit card lending arm, posted an $849 million profit, down 8 percent from last year. Chase’s large commercial banking unit booked a $571 million profit, amid an 18 percent uptick in lending to middle-market corporations. JPMorgan’s asset management unit posted a $385 million profit despite facing the same drop in trading-related activity as the investment bank.</text></article>

In a letter of inquiry sent to Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Morgan Stanley, William F. Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, asked the firms to give a list of the clients they had provided employment referrals to since January 2009. Mr. Galvin said his letter was aimed at putting the firms ''on notice that these are issues that need to be explored.'' The request comes the day after an article in The New York Times explained how Wall Street firms had established staffing services in an effort to attract and retain brokerage and trading business. Press officers for Goldman, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank declined to comment about the inquiry. As hedge funds have become more prominent, they have become a significant driver of banks' earnings. The industry accounts for as much as 35 percent of all trading revenue on Wall Street, according to the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. In the wake of the financial crisis, such profit centers have proved all the more important, prompting Wall Street banks to sweeten their services. Big banks, previously informal recruiters, now have entrenched practices to help hedge funds find financial executives, accountants and other professionals. Mr. Galvin is exploring the scope of the relationships. While he does not yet know what direction the inquiry may take, if any, he already sees some potential avenues of exploration. For instance, he said firms might be offering the service only to select hedge funds, which could violate Massachusetts securities laws. He also said he planned to look at whether the Wall Street recruiting broke rules regarding gift-giving. These laws prohibit Wall Street firms from giving gifts valued at more than $100 a year to individuals who are in a position to direct business to them. The staffing services could also raise questions about disclosure. It is unclear whether hedge funds detail the nature of the relationships to their investors. The concern is that the money managers could be directing business to banks in exchange for recruiting, at the expense of their investors. Earlier this year, Mr. Galvin's department fined Goldman Sachs $10 million for hosting so-called trading huddles in its stock research department. At these meetings, analysts developed short-term trading ideas to share with the biggest clients. Mr. Galvin's office said in a statement in June that the huddles were ''a dishonest and unethical violation of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act by putting certain clients at an advantage over others.'' Goldman agreed to stop holding trading huddles. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

Nearly 10,000 workers in the securities industry in New York could lose their jobs through the end of next year, according to a report issued Tuesday by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, bringing the total cuts for New York in the sector to 32,000 since January 2008. “The securities industry had a strong start to 2011, but its prospects have cooled considerably for the second half of this year,” Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement. “It now seems likely that profits will fall sharply, job losses will continue and bonuses will be smaller than last year.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release As Profits Wane, Wall Street Braces for Layoffs Goldman Draws Up Deeper Cuts The report, which covers all member firms of the New York Stock Exchange, also said pretax profits earned by securities firms in the first half of 2011 slipped to $12.6 billion, a decline of 10.8 percent from the same period a year earlier. It said that while revenue at securities firms grew by 12.5 percent during the period, expenses made a bigger jump, rising 18.7 percent over the year-ago period. Despite job cuts and lagging profits at their firms, Wall Street employees who remain employed are doing well. The average salary of a worker in the industry in New York jumped to $361,330 in 2010, a 16 percent increase over the average last year, according to the report. That is more than five times the average private sector salary in New York, which stands at $66,120. Cash bonuses, which can account for a large portion of a financial employee’s annual income, are expected to fall in 2011, though the comptroller’s report did not predict the amount of the decline. In 2010, cash bonuses totaled an estimated $20.8 billion. Brendan Mcdermid/ReutersA report by Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York comptroller, forecasts falling profits. It is a tumultuous time for the city’s securities industry, which includes banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as well as smaller brokerage firms and research groups. For nearly a month, a phalanx of protesters from the Occupy Wall Street movement has been camped out in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, demanding investigations of bank executives whose behavior they feel spurred the financial crisis. On Tuesday, protesters marched to the homes of corporate executives including Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorganChase, to protest corporate greed and rising income inequality. Regulatory changes have also taken a toll on Wall Street. An early version of the Volcker rule, a curb on certain types of trading that would reduce the amount of risk taken on by large firms, was released in draft form Tuesday. In a report issued this week, Moody’s said the Volcker Rule, if put in place in its current form, would be “likely to diminish the flexibility and profitability” of the largest United States banks. Anticipating tough times ahead, banks have already begun battening down the hatches. Bank of America, saddled by bad mortgage assets and a flood of legal troubles, announced last month that it planned to cut 30,000 jobs globally in the next few years, and eliminate $5 billion in annual costs by 2014. Credit Suisse, Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs and other large banks have also announced plans to cut jobs and expenses. “I think it’s reasonable to expect a slow patch,” said Chris Kotowski, a banking analyst with Oppenheimer. “People should plan on that, personally and professionally, and city officials should plan on that in terms of their budgeting.” Wall Street’s struggles will most likely be reflected in New York City’s tax revenue, as well as in the revenues of nonfinancial businesses, like high-end real estate firms and expensive restaurants, which depend on a steady flow of well-off customers. The comptroller’s report estimates that for every job lost on Wall Street, two are lost in the city in other industries, and one additional job is lost elsewhere in the state. “These developments will have a rippling effect through the economy and adversely impact state and city tax collections,” Mr. DiNapoli said in the statement. “As we know, when Wall Street slows, New York City and New York State’s budgets feel the impact and that is a concern.” A further glimpse into the financial health of the industry will come this week, when Wall Street’s largest banks begin to release their third-quarter earnings. Many analysts expect the largest banks to post smaller profits than last quarter, and some are even predicting that Goldman Sachs, once the most profitable bank on Wall Street, will post a loss. “It’s entirely possible,” Mr. Kotowski said of the continued problems anticipated by the comptroller’s report. “It can also all turn on a dime.”</text></article>

Paulson, decided a few weeks ago to amend its reporting policies to make it harder to obtain performance data. But the changes failed to obscure this painful fact: one of his largest funds is down 47 percent through September, a loss that would require returns of almost 100 percent to surmount, according to investors in the fund. The nonleveraged version of the same fund is down about 32 percent, according to the investors. Other funds that were doing fine earlier this year are now also taking a nosedive, including Mr. Paulson’s gold fund ( up 1 percent for the year after falling 16 percent last month), which placed bets on various assets linked to gold, as well as his Recovery fund (down 31 percent for the year), which placed a bet on the recovery of the United States economy. Both funds were hit with double digits losses in September after gold prices fell and stock market volatility continued. Such reporting changes are common in the world of hedge funds. For many of the indexes and databases, information is collected on a voluntary basis, and often funds stop reporting in bad times. In Mr. Paulson’s case, investors say that instead of giving updates on each fund’s performance to all investors, the data now show only those funds in which an investor had money. Redemptions through September were low, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 to 3 percent of overall assets, according to an investor, as fund devotees stick with Mr. Paulson through this rough patch. And while a new window to make redemption requests arrives on Oct. 31 for his Advantage funds, mass withdrawals are not a foregone conclusion, according to investors. On Tuesday, Paulson &amp; Company has scheduled a conference call with investors. Mr. Paulson has aggressively raised assets ever since shorting the subprime mortgage market minted billions for him and his fund. Many of his new investors are high-net-worth clients at major banks like Morgan Stanley, who are notoriously quick to flee. But his more enduring investors, those who made money alongside him in 2007, may be more reluctant to leave, some say. One investor noted that since the assets Paulson &amp; Company owns are so depressed, it could make sense to hang in until markets snap back. It has been a bad year for Mr. Paulson’s firm. While the performance of a number of big hedge funds has been held flat this year by choppy markets, Paulson &amp; Company began experiencing big losses early on. The firm lost nearly $500 million on a failed investment in a Chinese timber concern after a researcher betting against the stock accused the company of fraud. Later, as the markets fell on European debt concerns, Paulson &amp; Company’s portfolio tumbled along with it.</text></article>

Galvin, says money managers should disclose the value of the services they receive from big banks. Wall Street banks often boast that they hire the best and the brightest. Now, scrambling to bolster profits, they have become full-time headhunters for some of their biggest hedge fund clients, a role that is rife with potential conflicts. Big banks have long provided extra benefits to hedge funds, including finding office space for firms and raising money for new portfolios. They have even acted like informal recruiters for their premier clients by passing along résumés or making introductions to industry professionals. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink But those once-ancillary placement services have become established practices as Wall Street struggles to make up for profit centers that have been lost to new regulations and a weak economy. Since the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and others have become powerful recruiting forces for hedge funds. In an effort to secure lucrative brokerage and trading business, the banks scout finance executives, accountants and receptionists free. Goldman calls the practice “talent introduction.” Without the necessary disclosures and appropriate restrictions, the staffing services could prove controversial. For one, Wall Street firms risk provoking the ire of a client if they poach hedge fund talent or compete for the same potential employees. It also raises a question of loyalty; hedge fund executives may be swayed to direct business to the Wall Street firm that hired them rather than the bank that makes the best sense for investors. “We get put in this situation every day,” said Stuart Hendel, global head of prime brokerage at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which offers recruiting as part of its hedge fund services. The banks, he said, have “to walk a tight rope.” Banks say they have strict rules to prevent conflicts. Bank of America says it will not poach active employees of a current client. “All we’re doing is providing a clearinghouse for managers to meet prospective employees,” Mr. Hendel said. “We don’t go looking for people, people seem to find us. And we make it very clear we’re not providing recommendations.” Goldman said it disclosed its consulting services to clients and had “robust policies and procedures” to prevent conflicts of interest. “We are not in the headhunting business,” a spokeswoman for the firm, Andrea Raphael, said. “We do not solicit employees of one client to work at another client.” Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The practice renews concerns about how hedge funds indirectly pay for such secondary services. Government regulators have cracked down on these “soft dollar” arrangements — where a money manager steers business to a bank in exchange for perks. The deals can come at the expense of investors, who may be unaware of the relationship. Several years ago, Massachusetts’s chief financial regulator, William Galvin, took aim at so-called hedge fund hotels. At the time, Wall Street firms provided office space to up-and-coming money managers at below market rates in return for their trading business. As part of a settlement with UBS, investment advisers that leased real estate from the bank in the state had to provide written disclosure to current and prospective clients about the arrangement. It is unclear if hedge funds report their use of Wall Street staffing services. Mr. Galvin said that the money managers should disclose the value of the services they receive from big banks and the employees placed by banks. “It’s the type of relationship investors should know about, or simply shouldn’t exist,” Mr. Galvin said. As the industry has grown in size and stature, hedge funds have become an increasingly important source of revenue for Wall Street banks. Hedge funds, for example, account for an estimated 35 percent of trading commissions, according to Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. To distinguish themselves in the highly competitive business, banks — which provide credit and execute transactions for the big investors through their prime brokerage and trading divisions — have built out their suite of services. Recruiting was a natural extension. Wall Street firms, through their prime brokerage units, are involved in the daily operations of thousands of hedge funds, giving them a good sense of the industry turnover. After acting as informal recruiters for years, many banks formalized the process in recent years. The Wall Street firms have created rich databases that track hedge fund openings and potential candidates, with a small staff dedicated to the service. It is appealing for hedge funds. Traditional recruiters take as much as 25 percent of the hire’s first-year compensation. But Wall Street doesn’t charge anything. Richard Scardina, co-founder of the Atlantic Group, a professional search firm, said the banks were his biggest rivals. “It’s competition, but they are not going to put me out of business,” he said. “We specialize in recruitment day in and day out, and that is an edge that is hard to compete with.” Mostly, the banks’ staffing efforts focus on back-office and accounting functions, although the banks occasionally place investment professionals and research analysts. Glazer Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund with roughly $500 million, recently tapped Goldman to hire a staff member in its accounting division, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The potential landmines for banks are significant. The majority of people in Goldman’s database are out of work, according to executives at three hedge funds who have used the service. But the list, the people said, does include a small number of hedge fund employees looking to leave their jobs, because they’re unhappy or are looking to move to another part of the world. In such instances, banks could run the risk of poaching staff from their hedge fund clients, said Dick Del Bello, a senior partner at Conifer Group, a independent firm that provides administrative support to hedge funds. “The one thing they have to be careful of is, you don’t want to raid the henhouse,” he said. “You don’t want to go to client A and take someone actively there and send them to client B.” The practice could also have unwanted consequences for hedge funds. If the Wall Street bank knows a top executive wants to leave a firm, the departure could raise red flags about the health of the hedge fund, Mr. Del Bello said. The bank, in response, might decide to withdraw the fund’s credit, potentially forcing it to sell assets. Ms. Raphael of Goldman said that if the firm discovered something material, it “would discuss the matter and its implications with the client.” To Mr. Galvin, it comes down to disclosure. “If you are an investor, you want to know the manager is acting in your interest without an ulterior motive.”</text></article>

It is a war that is being fought in large part in the shadows: against anonymous blogs and market whispers, but also against undefined fears about exposure to troubled European banks. While those worries are common to all the big Wall Street banks, Morgan Stanley, as the smallest, is perhaps the most vulnerable among them. In response, Morgan Stanley executives have been rallying employees and talking to the company's biggest shareholders. The campaign culminated late on Monday, with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which owns approximately 22 percent of Morgan Stanley, publicly reaffirming its support for the company. The push may have helped on Tuesday. Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 12.4 percent, after falling nearly 29 percent since the beginning of September. Morgan and other banks were primarily buoyed on Tuesday by a suggestion that European officials would look at bank recapitalizations. Nonetheless, there has been a bloodbath in bank stocks. Morgan Stanley is down 48.5 percent for the year; Goldman Sachs has fallen 44 percent; and Bank of America is off about 57 percent. And the cost of insuring Morgan Stanley's debt for five years through credit-default swaps, though it eased on Tuesday, remains at levels that were seen during the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley's war-roomlike approach to market volatility highlights the difficulties of stamping out rumors in a world of instant, and often anonymous, information. Its latest round of troubles began on Friday morning before the markets opened at 9:30 a.m. Zero Hedge, a well-read and controversial financial blog, linked to a Bloomberg News article that noted Morgan's credit-default swap spreads had been widening. The Zero Hedge post also directed readers to a previous Zero Hedge article that pegged Morgan Stanley's net exposure to French banks at $39 billion, about $12 billion more than the bank's current market capitalization, reigniting fears about its exposure. It was a potent cocktail of information. The company's stock opened down more than 3 percent, prompting a flood of calls to Morgan's investor relations and press offices. Calling Zero Hedge for damage control was not an option. The post was written by an anonymous blogger who goes by the name of ''Tyler Durden,'' a character in the movie ''The Fight Club,'' and the Web site does not give readers a way to readily reach its writers. Adding to Morgan Stanley's woes, Friday was the last day of Morgan Stanley's third quarter. The company is set to release its earnings in a few weeks, and securities laws limit what it can say about its financial condition. Unable to reach Zero Hedge, Morgan Stanley's investor relations department went into overdrive, quickly pulling together talking points for callers that were circulated to both media and investor relations staff members. According to the talking points, reviewed by The New York Times, the numbers cited by Zero Hedge ''represent gross asset positions and thus do not reflect the benefit of collateral or other hedges and protection, and the more relevant exposure to consider is the net exposure.'' So what is its net exposure? The company was limited in what it could say because of the pending earnings announcement. To address this point, staff members were told to direct callers to pre-existing stock research. ''Analysts estimate that the actual net exposure is meaningfully lower,'' the talking points read. In particular, they cited a recent report by Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, who estimated that Morgan's ''total risk to France and its banks is less than $2 billion net of collateral and hedges.'' Zero Hedge could not be reached for comment. Despite Morgan Stanley's efforts, the stock ended on Friday down about 10 percent, at $13.51, its lowest close since the fall of 2008 and the depth of the financial crisis. The stock price was particularly frustrating to James P. Gorman, the company's chief executive since early 2010. He has been leading the effort to rebuild the company; he even bought 100,000 shares of Morgan Stanley in early August at approximately $20 a share.</text></article>

And Larry Ellison’s acquisitive Oracle is a credible potential suitor. A Breakingviews analysis suggests that even while paying a big premium, Oracle could reap a hefty return.Despite H.P.’s expensive deal to buy Autonomy, a British rival, H.P.’s stock is cheap. It trades at less than five times estimated earnings for the company’s next fiscal year. If Oracle paid a 40 percent premium to gain control, the total outlay, including assumed debt, would be a bit over $80 billion. That’s more than half of Oracle’s enterprise value. But Oracle has $32 billion of cash and short-term investments. For a compelling deal, the company could always issue stock as well. And the numbers are persuasive. Analysts reckon H.P. will pull in $13 billion of operating profit in the 2012 fiscal year. Add in a fraction more from Autonomy, and that would bring Oracle a 16 percent annual return on its total investment off the bat. Oracle might be able to squeeze out some costs. If it cut 10 percent of H.P.’s selling, general and administrative expenses and its research and development costs, that would bring $1.6 billion in annual savings. Throw those in, and pro forma for the 2012 fiscal year Oracle’s return on investment would be 18 percent. Along the way, it is possible that H.P. could slightly ease the burden for an acquirer by selling businesses it bought last year in its $1.2 billion purchase of Palm. The mobile operating system may be in limbo, but the related patents are a hot commodity. There are potential snags, however. The presence at Oracle of Mark Hurd, chief executive of H.P. until just over a year ago, may delay any possible move. Moreover, Mr. Hurd might not be the ideal boss for an Oracle-owned H.P. As chief executive, he cut costs too deeply. There’s also the important broader strategic question of whether Oracle should increase its commitment to hardware. Purely on the figures, though, H.P. would make a lucrative target. Fear Factor Morgan Stanley’s October woes feel like a drama lacking a crisis. The company, which three years ago suffered a bank run, was already facing skepticism about its turnaround before the third quarter turned crummy. But that’s not behind its latest misery. Morgan Stanley’s stock has dropped more than 17 percent since Thursday after the cost of insuring its debt against default rose as investors again became anxious over the bank’s exposure to Europe. But the substance to the worries looks thin. A Zero Hedge blog post two weeks ago snowballed. It asserted that Morgan Stanley had $39 billion of French bank risk on its balance sheet, or more than half its assets minus liabilities, known as book value. But these numbers dated to 2010. The bank, led by James Gorman, has almost halved that figure. What’s more, the blog picked only the gross exposure, which included client assets, and those of the bank, held at French institutions. It ignored cash, hedges and collateral. Factor those in and the net exposure is zilch. Of course, 2008 taught investors not to take banks at their word about exposures — or the quality of their hedges. Morgan Stanley itself had almost a $10 billion loss in 2007 from disastrously hedging an otherwise-smart mortgage bet. So investors are skittish. But even after the bank’s recent rout, Morgan Stanley shares are hardly out of whack with rivals’. Like Citigroup, it trades at just about two-fifths of book value, but that is far better than Bank of America’s 27 percent. Even JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which navigated the last crisis deftly, are trading at only two-thirds of book value. Under pressure to show that its turnaround in fixed-income trading and wealth management is working, Morgan Stanley ought to trade at a discount anyway. That doesn’t mean Mr. Gorman should hold his breath and wish for the latest ruckus to pass. Providing more information on the way the company hedges its exposures, and with whom, would help — and he is likely to do that later this month. Of course, as the autumn of 2008 taught investors, once a panic over financing and capital hits a bank, all bets are off. Mr. Gorman may need to get out even further in front of this one.

He has been leading the effort to rebuild the company; he even bought 100,000 shares of Morgan Stanley in early August at approximately $20 a share. On Friday, Mr. Gorman shared his concerns with senior executives at Mitsubishi, conversations that culminated with discussions over the weekend between Mr. Gorman and Nobuyuki Hirano, his counterpart at the Japanese bank. The two men discussed the market rumors, concurring that they ran contrary to what they felt was going on in the market, said two people briefed on the conversation. The company is expected to report third-quarter results in two weeks. Those results, these people said, are solid in light of the recent stock market rout. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimated that the bank would report a profit of 36 cents a share. Mr. Gorman and Mr. Hirano agreed that it would be helpful if Mitsubishi issued a news release expressing its support. That did not come, however, until Monday after the close. Early on Monday Mr. Gorman decided to speak out himself. “In fragile markets, where fear triumphs over common sense, these things are bound to happen. It is easy to respond to the rumor of the day, but that is not usually productive,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Instead we should let balanced third parties do their own analysis and let the facts speak.” On Monday, despite Mr. Gorman’s efforts, the company’s stock tumbled 7.7 percent. Six minutes after the close, Mitsubishi issued its statement. “In response to recent market volatility M.U.F.G. wishes to reiterate that we are firmly committed to our long-term strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley. The special relationship we have formed remains core to our global business strategy.” Initially, the statement seemed to have little effect on the stock. The cost to insure Morgan Stanley’s bank debt with credit-default swaps on its debt continued to rise Tuesday morning, but then fell back, according to Markit, a financial information company. Its shares closed at $14.01, up $1.54, or more than 12 percent. “Mitsubishi’s announcement was the equivalent of a Japanese firm saying you are part of the family,” Mr. Hintz said.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/business/investor-fear-over-morgan-stanley-sharpens.html?ref=morganstanley">Investor Fear Over Morgan Stanley Sharpens<date>Published: September 30, 2011</date><text>It is Morgan Stanley’s turn on the hot seat.As confidence in the soundness of some of the world’s biggest banks has fallen in recent weeks, investors have been selling off their shares of one financial institution after another.   Now, the fears about Morgan Stanley are becoming especially acute. Investors are worried about the bank’s exposure to the European debt crisis, its ability to weather a turbulent trading environment and its reliance on short-term borrowing to finance its operations. The bank and some analysts say the fears are unfounded. But the market drove Morgan Stanley shares down 10.5 percent on Friday to $13.51, and the stock has lost 41 percent in the last three months. That performance was par for the course in what was a bruising third quarter for the entire financial industry. Bank of America shares fell more than 44 percent. Citigroup shares dropped more than 38 percent, while even Goldman Sachs, considered the mightiest of the Wall Street giants, tumbled more than 28 percent. It was also a brutal quarter for the broader stock market. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index fell 14 percent from July to September, its worst performance since the fourth quarter of 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. Almost everywhere they looked, investors saw trouble. In the United States, the Congressional deadlock over debt and the downgrade of the nation’s once-sterling credit rating rocked the confidence of consumers and businesses. In Europe, rising concerns about a potential Greek default and the inability of other governments to agree on a financial rescue plan surged through the markets. Grim data also pointed to a sharp slowdown in economic growth around the globe. Now Morgan Stanley, which never regained the prestige and power it had in the years before the 2008 crisis, is quickly becoming a focal point for investors who fear that it may not be able to weather another financial storm In another closely watched indicator of investor sentiment, the cost of buying protection against a default of Morgan Stanley bonds has soared. It now eclipses the cost of similar insurance on major French banks. Only a few weeks ago, the French banks came under heavy fire amid concerns that they were struggling to finance their operations. Investors are now paying $449,000 a year to insure $10 million of Morgan Stanley bonds against a possible default in a sparsely traded market in what are called credit-default swaps. That is almost three times the cost in early June, but it is still well below the roughly $1.3 million a year it cost to insure Morgan Stanley bonds a few weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, according to pricing from Markit. Among investors, the concerns are many. Some worry that the test could come from the company’s exposure to French banks. Others fear a liquidity crisis similar to what occurred in 2008 when banks like Morgan Stanley struggled to borrow the short-term debt that keeps them afloat. Still other investors expect the turbulent markets to take their toll on trading and investment banking results, which are the lifeblood of Wall Street.   “It strikes me that everything seems to be O.K. with these guys,” said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, who is a former treasurer at Morgan Stanley. “I’m not arguing that we’re not seeing stuff in the credit-default swaps market that is pretty scary-looking. But they just don’t seem to be having any problems funding themselves.” Some investors worry that Morgan Stanley may be too reliant on short-term borrowing or that it lacks a significant deposit base like those of the large commercial banks JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America. Others, however, note that Morgan Stanley has shifted much of its borrowing into longer-dated paper since 2006 and that its deposits have risen to $66 billion, from $28 billion. Citing the quiet period before Morgan Stanley reports third-quarter earnings, a spokeswoman for the company declined to comment. In recent weeks, analysts and investors have scoured obscure regulatory filings and reports, trying to determine what potential exposure Wall Street banks could have to troubled regions and institutions in Europe. One filing that quickly gained attention in the market revealed that Morgan Stanley had one of the biggest exposures among Wall Street companies to the ailing French banks — about $39 billion at the end of last year, before factoring in offsetting hedges and collateral. Morgan Stanley has not provided investors with more up-to-date information. But in a research note, Mr. Hintz said that Morgan Stanley had substantially reduced its exposure to French banks and estimated that it was now likely to be less than $2 billion, after factoring in collateral and hedges. Investors also expect Morgan Stanley to report lackluster trading results, in line with many of its peers who have seen a slowdown in activity as clients have moved into cash. After several periods of lackluster results, Morgan Stanley’s trading desks had a standout performance in the second quarter — besting even Goldman in challenging markets. Morgan Stanley’s financial statements showed that it was increasing its appetite for risk. Now, some investors worry that Morgan Stanley may have turned too aggressive at just the wrong time. They are now girding for another round of dismal results — especially after JPMorgan warned in mid-September that its trading revenue could fall almost 10 percent from a year ago and now that Wall Street analysts expect Goldman to report a loss in the quarter.  It is Morgan Stanley’s turn on the hot seat.</text></article>

The opening of European capital markets to American investment banks quickly led to United States financial domination of the Continent and of a large part of the rest of the world. American private equity firms have been equally successful at capturing the global market. But as they say on Wall Street, past performance is no indication of future results. Can Wall Street continue its winning streak? The question boils down to whether it can succeed in Asia, particularly in China. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section - Fall 2011 Investment banks in the United States and in Europe have historically dominated the Asian capital markets, but this dominance has been spotty of late. In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs was the best American performer in the rankings for Chinese debt raised offshore, ranking sixth with a 5.9 percent market share. For all Asian debt offerings, only two United States banks, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, were ranked in the top 10. Still, in other areas, the United States is competing strongly. Dealogic reports that for the first half of 2011, five of the top 10 investment banks underwriting equity in Asia were based in the United States. And Western banks occupy seven of the top 10 slots for providing advice to Asian companies on takeovers. Yet in China, domestic banks held five of the top 10 slots for providing takeover advice on Chinese acquisitions, according to Thomson Reuters. The performance highlights an ominous failure in China. The American banks compete in international offerings with only spotty success. But they don’t compete at all for Chinese companies raising money domestically. According to Dealogic, in the first half of 2011 no American investment banks ranked in the top 10 for locally raised Chinese debt denominated in renminbi. The reason is China’s exclusionary policies. Until this year, China did not allow non-Chinese firms to operate in domestic markets. Previously, American firms were forced to operate through partnerships with domestic Chinese firms. Not surprisingly, these Chinese domestic partners have viewed American banks as merely short-term partners to provide capital and expertise. For example, the China International Capital Corporation, one of China’s biggest investment banks, was formed by a partnership between Morgan Stanley and China Construction Bank. Morgan subsequently grew disenchanted with the relationship as C.I.C.C. grew and Morgan was squeezed out of its day-to-day operations. Morgan sold its stake for $1 billion in 2010. Even with the rule change, American banks remain hobbled in the Chinese domestic market. China recently allowed Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase to form their own mainland ventures, but with the condition that they observe certain operational restrictions, including doing business through a Chinese partner with less than a one-third ownership stake. Morgan Stanley has now established a joint venture with Huaxin Securities to replace its C.I.C.C. relationship. Chinese investment banks are now big enough to compete for international offerings. China’s biggest domestic underwriter of initial public offerings, the Guosen Securities Company, has doubled its staff in Hong Kong in the last year. Guosen, which is controlled by the city of Shenzhen, will compete with American banks for more international offerings by Chinese companies from Hong Kong. Chinese investment banks are entering this new beachhead by hiring staff members trained by the Western investment banks. Guosen Securities, for example, lured Cheng Gang from HSBC Holdings to head its Hong Kong operations. And these domestic banks are being aided by the Chinese government, which often pushes local companies to include Chinese investment banks for its international offerings. Bank of China picked three Chinese banks but only two international banks for its recent $7 billion Hong Kong offering. The Chinese government is thus doing in investment banking what it is doing in other industries. It is strong-arming foreign investment banks to provide capital and expertise as a bridge to building a bigger market share for domestic players. Presumably, the goal is for these Chinese investment banks to compete throughout Asia and globally represent Chinese companies. Underwriting fees in Hong Kong have fallen to as low as 1.9 percent for the recent Prada offering, from a range of 2 to 3.5 percent. One reason is the increased competition among investment banks. Underwriting fees remain at about 6 percent in the United States. Given the obstacles, one would think that American private equity firms might try a different approach in China. Instead, these firms also appear to be striking Faustian bargains, trading their capital and expertise for a Chinese presence. Private equity firms cannot buy whole companies because Chinese regulations largely prohibit such ownership. Instead, the private equity firms have teamed up with local entities for minority stakes or have otherwise bought interests in publicly traded Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong or abroad. These investments, however, have succeeded in part because of the bubbly nature of the Chinese markets. It remains to be seen how these firms will do with these investments if China’s markets slow. Private equity has been rushing to take advantage of this growth by establishing renminbi-denominated funds. Carlyle formed one with the Beijing municipal government. Blackstone, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also teamed up with local Chinese governments to form these funds. Because the funds are denominated in renminbi and have mostly Chinese investors like municipalities, they have much freer investment rein. The Chinese government is also experimenting with a program to allow limited foreign investment in these funds. It is unlikely, however, that Chinese governments will allow private equity firms to take the kinds of profits they can realize in the United States. For one thing, American private equity firms, like American investment banks, are seeing more competition. According to a recent McKinsey report, local private equity firms occupy 20 percent of the market — double the number from 2007. These Chinese firms are more likely to attract Chinese government investment than are their foreign rivals. The same dynamic at work in investment banking will work in private equity as these local Chinese firms gain experience and hire Western private equity firm employees. Last year, TPG and Goldman Sachs lost senior private equity employees who left to start their own domestic funds. The $300 billion Chinese sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation, has bought 10 percent of Blackstone and is earmarking more funds for private equity investment, some of it to be spent abroad. Ultimately, these local private equity firms are likely to rise to advise C.I.C. and other Chinese investors on this foreign investment. It is hard to blame American investment banks and private equity firms, though. They are going for half a loaf rather than nothing at all. While the Chinese financiers are likely to keep elbowing out United States banks in China, it remains to be seen if they can become international bankers in Asia, or, like the Japanese banks, remain local players. One thing appears certain: Wall Street is going to have to fight to preserve its global and Asian position, let alone to grow in places like China. Wall Street will have to be doubly careful it doesn’t give away its business in the headlong sprint into China and Asia, by buying short-term growth in a way that creates long-term global competitors.

Vikram S. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, boldly promised in 2009 that “we will be the single largest emerging markets financial services company.” Goldman Sachs’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said at a conference last year that one of his firm’s big goals was “to be Goldman Sachs in more places.” Special Section Fall 2011 View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Special Section Fall 2011 But there’s a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks. “A lot of big banks are looking to developing markets, but historically it’s tended to be a volatile move,” said James Sinegal, a bank analyst at the research firm Morningstar. “It might not be as easy as they expect.” Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. The economies of countries like China, India and Brazil are growing faster than that of the United States. Such places also represent an untapped client base, with a growing middle class and a large number of wealthy individuals. As profits wane on the home front, Wall Street firms are increasingly dependent on the emerging markets to bolster their bottom lines. Citicorp, a division of Citigroup, draws about half of its revenue from emerging countries, up from roughly 25 percent in 2005. International markets account for 47 percent of Goldman’s profits. Morgan Stanley generated nearly a third of its net revenue from outside the Americas. “With the United States slowing down, it is not surprising that institutions are looking in the emerging markets,” said Hamid Biglari, a Citicorp vice chairman and chief of emerging markets. But the perils can be plentiful, with economic, political and regulatory challenges. Foreign regulators have scolded banks, fined them and even banned their activities in various countries. Citigroup twice ran into problems with Japanese authorities. In turn, Wall Street says it has cleaned house at overseas offices, taken greater control of foreign ventures and tapped local bankers to lead new projects. Local knowledge is especially critical, as firms try to navigate the regulatory and political environment that is crucial to a bank’s business. Earlier this year, Citigroup found itself in hot water with Indonesian regulators. After an investigation into suspected embezzlement by an employee and the death of a client after meetings with the bank’s outside debt collectors, the country’s central bank imposed sanctions on Citigroup, including a one-year ban on opening new branches. In June, the bank removed its top country officer, replacing him with a native Indonesian, Tigor M. Siahaan, a seasoned banker experienced in dealing with local regulators and government officials. Now, the bank is tweaking its internal controls, bringing its debt collecting in-house and regularly rotating back-office personnel. The bank said it was also working closely with Indonesian authorities. “How to behave responsibly in these markets comes with experience,” Mr. Biglari said. “You have to figure out how to work with the cultural norms.” Financial firms have also realized that they need to commit to a market, because it can take years if not decades to build up local relationships and understand the country’s customs. While Goldman says on its Web site that it has had a presence in Russia since 1998, the firm has had its troubles in the country. Not long after opening in Russia, Goldman downsized its operations, concerned about the financial crisis that prompted the government to devalue the ruble. It closed the Moscow office and reassigned staff members. Christopher Barter, co-chief executive for Goldman’s Russia business, said the investment bank should not have left the country. “We missed out on years of a footprint there,” he said. “When you go into a country, you have to maintain your commitment.” It took years to build up the business in Russia again. Goldman reopened the Moscow location in 2001, but it didn’t fully ramp up there until 2006, when it obtained a brokerage license. Today, the firm has 140 employees in Russia, up from 30 people five years ago. The company has established stronger ties in the country since it has returned. In 2008, Goldman held a board meeting in Russia, a nod to its re-emergence there. Michael Sherwood, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs, now visits Russia several times a year. And Mr. Blankfein, along with other Wall Street chiefs like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, has joined a committee set up by the Russian government to help bring more foreign money to the country. Firms have also realized they need more management oversight of overseas investments. Morgan Stanley was one of the first investment banks to establish a joint venture in China. In 1995, it teamed up with China Construction Bank to form the China International Capital Corporation. But the Wall Street bank was a passive investor, owning just one-third of the business, the limit for foreign securities firms under Chinese rules. It also ceded management control to its partners. In 2010, Morgan Stanley sold the stake to a group of private equity firms. Since then, Morgan Stanley has forged a new relationship with Huaxin Securities. While it still owns a one-third stake in the venture, called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, it has seats on the firm’s board and plays a role in the day-to-day management of the firm. A Morgan Stanley managing director, Yang Kai, is the chief executive of the company. While foreign business is hardly a guaranteed win, financial firms are willing to take the risks. It’s one of the industry’s few options as banks deal with costly new regulations, sluggish economic growth in their home markets and a volatile market — all of which are weighing on profits. “These guys are hurting and it gets worse by the day,” said Michael J. Driscoll, a professor at Adelphi University’s business school and former senior trader at Bear Stearns. “You can only squeeze so much till you go looking elsewhere for a return.”</text></article>

Mack, will step down at the end of year, paving the way for the company’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, to take on that role as well. The bank announced Mr. Mack’s retirement late Thursday morning shortly after its board met by telephone to vote on the transition. Revolving Door View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The Changing of the Guard Morgan Stanley press release Mr. Mack, a former chief executive of the company, has been chairman since early 2010. He is expected to retain a senior advisory role. He is working on a book about leaders and his years on Wall Street, which is scheduled to be published next September by Simon &amp; Shuster. Mr. Mack, a graduate of Duke University, is expected to join other corporate boards. He already serves on the boards of a number of nonprofit organizations and is chairman of the panel of economic advisers for Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a Republican presidential candidate. The decision to have Mr. Gorman succeed Mr. Mack as chairman was widely expected. Mr. Mack, 66, is one of Wall Street’s best-known figures. He worked at Morgan Stanley for years, rising from bond salesman to become the company’s president. After a long-running dispute with Morgan Stanley’s then-chief executive, Philip J. Purcell, he left the company in 2001. He soon resurfaced at Credit Suisse, which named him chief executive of the Credit Suisse First Boston investment bank, and later co-chief executive of the parent company, the Credit Suisse Group. At Credit Suisse, he lived up to his nickname “Mack the Knife,” drastically eliminating jobs and cutting costs. But the relationship, in the end, was ill-fated. At one point he proposed merging Credit Suisse First Boston with another investment bank. The Swiss bank’s board disagreed, and his contract lapsed in 2004. In 2005, after an uprising at Morgan Stanley forced Mr. Purcell to step down, the board asked Mr. Mack to return as chief executive. He received a standing ovation when he walked into the trading floor on his first day. Yet his record as Morgan Stanley’s leader was mixed. He made riskier bets after returning to the firm, giving it some of its former swagger, but he was unable to pull back in time in 2007 and 2008 as the New York bank sustained significant losses. During the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley required $10 billion in emergency support from the federal government, as well as a $9 billion investment by the Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to survive. Mr. Mack, however, received credit for negotiating the Mitsubishi deal, persuading the Japanese bank to move ahead with the partnership despite the difficult environment. Morgan Stanley repaid the government bailout money in 2009. Mr. Gorman has been running the day-to-day operations of Morgan Stanley since 2010. He has been trying to revive the company’s fortunes, reducing risk and rebuilding units that were injured during the credit crisis. He has received credit from analysts for his efforts, but Morgan Stanley’s stock, like that of other financial companies, continues to languish. Its shares closed Thursday at $16.59, up $1.11, but down from the $29.60 when Mr. Gorman became chief at the start of 2010. When Mr. Mack took the helm in 2005, Morgan Stanley’s shares were trading above $43. Morgan Stanley’s move to combine the chief executive and chairman roles is likely to raise eyebrows among corporate governance watchdogs. They typically encourage companies to have a nonexecutive chairman, which they say gives the board a more independent voice.</text></article>

Harris, one of the most senior women on Wall Street, is also a gospel singer. Wall Street banks are not known as particularly religious workplaces. But Carla A. Harris, a managing director at Morgan Stanley and a part-time gospel singer, has found a way to blend profits with piety. Ms. Harris, one of the most senior African-American female executives on Wall Street, began her career in mergers and acquisitions, then worked her way up the equity capital markets ranks. She now runs the emerging manager platform at Morgan Stanley, where she advises asset managers owned by women and members of minorities. Off The Clock View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink But after hours, she is a celebrated gospel artist who sings in two choirs, has released three solo albums and has performed packed shows at Carnegie Hall. “I always like to say that my success is not about who I am, but whose I am,” Ms. Harris said, pointing to the sky during a recent interview in a Morgan Stanley conference room. Ms. Harris, 48, began singing as a 9-year-old in her Catholic elementary school’s talent show. She grew up on a steady diet of soul and R&amp;B, but when she arrived at Harvard, she joined the Radcliffe Choral Society, an all-female classical choir. That forced her out of her comfort zone, she said. “I’d never sung Stravinsky and Bach and Mendelssohn,” she said. “I wanted to challenge myself.” After Harvard, Ms. Harris did a short stint at Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm, and got her M.B.A. at Harvard Business School before joining Morgan Stanley in 1987. At first, she said, she kept her passion for music hidden from her banker colleagues. On Wednesday nights, she would sneak out from the bank to go to Harlem, where she would watch amateur night performances at the Apollo Theater before heading back on the subway to the bank. “I wanted to keep Carla the Singer in a box,” Ms. Harris said. “But it wasn’t long until people figured it out.” She eased into showing her musical side in a professional setting, first performing for colleagues in 1991 at a group function. Four years later, she sang “Amazing Grace” at a client dinner for Heartport, a biotech company for which Morgan Stanley was the lead underwriter on the initial public offering. Ms. Harris’s performance was a hit, and she soon found herself performing at company functions. She sang at colleagues’ weddings, did an impromptu song at the bank’s analyst training conference, and serenaded John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chairman, with “White Christmas” and “The Christmas Song” at a company talent show in 2009. “Her singing and the way she has nurtured her talent is always inspiring,” said Daniel Simkowitz, Morgan Stanley’s chairman of global capital markets. Regina FlemingCarla A. Harris sings for two choirs and has performed at Carnegie Hall. Today, Ms. Harris — a demonstrative and fast-talking woman with a fondness for gold jewelry and golf ball-size earrings —said she squeezed music into her day however she could. She sings in the car on her morning commute from her Montclair, N.J., home, takes voice lessons during her lunch break, and even sneaks quick vocalizations in the elevator ride up to her eighth-floor office. “It’s enough to get a couple notes out if you need to, if you’re having one of those days,” she said. It can be hard to be religious on Wall Street. Gregory H. Zehner, a former Goldman Sachs partner who left that firm to become a pastor, has spoken about the ways in which his job came into conflict with his Christian faith. But Ms. Harris said she had “never felt compromised” as a banker with one foot in God’s kingdom. “Carla is the same person in the office as in church,” said W. Mark Howell, who leads the Mark Howell Singers, a group for which Ms. Harris is a featured soloist. “Her favorite saying is, ‘God is good all the time,’ and if she’s giving a speech at work, she’ll open by saying, ‘God is good all the time.’ ” Expressing her faith at work even won Ms. Harris some unlikely allies. She said colleagues often asked her, behind closed doors, to say prayers for them. One “very senior” Morgan Stanley executive, she said, e-mailed her after her Carnegie Hall performance in 2006. The executive thanked her for her performance, particularly for a song called “Standing on Holy Ground,” she said. “He said, ‘As I stood on the platform at Greenwich to get my train in this morning, I was feeling a little low and reflective. But then I reminded myself that I was standing on holy ground,’ ” Ms. Harris recalled of the e-mail. Today, Ms. Harris sings in both the Mark Howell Singers and the Gospelites choir at St. Charles Borromeo Church in Harlem. She said her banker lifestyle meant that she sometimes missed rehearsals for business travel, but that she made an attempt to remain fully involved. “When I’m there, I’m there.” With scheduled concerts, two rehearsals a week, a busy quarter at Morgan Stanley and a new CD titled “Unceasing Praise,” it is clear that if idle hands are the devil’s workshop, Ms. Harris is well out of trouble. “She is a party animal,” said Charlene R. Jackson, one of Ms. Harris’s longtime friends. “We’re always like, ‘Carla, do you ever stop?’ ” Off The Clock is a DealBook column that features the extracurricular hobbies of Wall Street professionals.

In a bellwether for other large financial firms, JPMorgan Chase warned that third-quarter trading revenue was likely to fall about 8 percent from a year ago. Investment banking income is also expected to drop by one-third from a year earlier, as corporations get cold feet about acquisitions as well as stock and debt offerings. “I think you can safely expect a decline in our markets revenue,” Jes Staley, the head of JPMorgan’s investment bank, said in remarks at the Barclays financial services conference on Tuesday. There are still 13 trading days left in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, and Wall Street firms will not release their final numbers until the middle of next month. But a sharp fall-off in summer trading seems poised to weigh heavily on the banks’ earnings — and perhaps accelerate another round of layoffs expected in the coming months. After helping lift Wall Street’s results during the financial crisis, trading revenue is projected to fall for a second straight quarter. On average, it is expected to be down by about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also expected to have weak third-quarter results. Investors shrugged off the latest bad news as shares of the biggest banks rose slightly on Tuesday in relatively calm trading. But bank stocks have been pummeled recently. The KBW index, a widely cited gauge of the banking sector, has fallen more than 28 percent since January. Although Wall Street firms can land windfalls making speculative bets with the banks’ own capital, the bulk of their trading revenue comes from transactions made on behalf of clients. But with the heightened volatility over the summer, many companies and investors remained on the sidelines — causing a significant slowdown in trading activity. The lackluster trading results come at a bad time for the industry, when profits and revenues have slipped to the levels attained before the housing boom. Many are bracing for a slowdown in lending, as consumers grow nervous about their job prospects and businesses put off expansion plans. Banks still face an endless stream of legal headaches and litigation fees from the foreclosure mess. In addition, new regulation has ratcheted up compliance costs and caused once-lucrative income streams, like debit card swipe fees and overdraft charges, to vanish. And all that is not counting the impact of the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates low for the next two years — a move that will erode lending profit margins in the months ahead. In anticipation of leaner times ahead, banks are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations. On Monday, Bank of America announced plans to cut about 30,000 jobs across the company, or nearly 10 percent of its work force. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Credit Suisse and UBS are among the major Wall Street firms that have started laying off employees in the last few months. JPMorgan’s investment bank is more than halfway through a five-year plan to save about $1.3 billion a year by consolidating its trading operations — a move that will involve shedding as many as 3,000 workers, some of whom will be employed elsewhere in the bank. But so far, Mr. Staley said the bank does not anticipate a major round of layoffs beyond those previously announced. “We have had a very good first half of the year,” he said at a banking conference in Frankfurt last week. “We will see how this plays out.” Still, the numbers at JPMorgan may foreshadow more pain ahead. JPMorgan was among the first major banks to sound the alarm bells over souring subprime mortgage loans in early 2007. In 2008, the bank flagged concerns about ballooning losses on its large portfolio of home equity loans ahead of many competitors and has moved quickly to shore up its reserves against legal claims stemming from the mortgage mess. In his remarks, Mr. Staley said investors could expect equity and fixed income trading revenues to decline about 30 percent from the second quarter, putting them at about $3.85 billion. Investment banking fees are expected to fall to about $1 billion, down from $1.9 billion in the second quarter. He also said that the bank’s private equity business would face a “moderate loss” of about $100 million and that its asset management business would see trading-related declines. Other banks may see a similar fall-off in trading. Citigroup, which has a giant fixed-income business, could see core trading revenue drop 47 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Overall trading revenue at Morgan Stanley is expected to fall about 1 percent from a year earlier, while revenue at Bank of America is expected to rise about 11 percent. Both banks had relatively weak third-quarter results in 2010. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs’s trading income is expected to fall about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse. But that may not represent the full extent of the declines it can expect. Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote in a recent report that the bank could face more than $3.2 billion in losses tied to its investment and lending businesses, which include private equity and other investments made with the bank’s own capital. That is because it must adjust its accounting to reflect the market’s recent round of wild swings.The worries of Wall Street banks keep growing.</text></article>

Women — always a rare breed in the upper echelons of Wall Street — are looking like an endangered species in the executive suite of big banks. On Tuesday, Bank of America reshuffled its management team, culling Sallie Krawcheck from its ranks. With her departure, a handful of women will still report directly to the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, but they largely fill top roles in groups that don’t produce revenue. Among them: Anne Finucane, the global strategy and marketing officer; Christine Katziff, the corporate general auditor; Andrea Smith, the head of human resources; and Cathy Bessant, the head of global technology and operations. It is a long-running theme across Wall Street, with the plum spots in investment banking and brokerages most typically held by men. At Goldman Sachs, women make up little more than 12 percent of the partnership, an elite group that includes the firm’s most senior executives and biggest stars.

Erin Callan, the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers, got the boot just months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Zoe Cruz, the co-president of Morgan Stanley, was ousted in a management shake-up in late 2007. Terri Dial lasted just a year as chief executive of Citigroup’s consumer business in North America. And Heidi Miller, the head of JPMorgan Chase’s international efforts who was once viewed as a potential successor to the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is set to depart the company early next year.

Wall Street no longer runs on Dunkin.’ Shares of the Dunkin’ Brands Group slid 5 percent Tuesday morning, as equity analysts issued a mixed bag of reports. The doughnut and coffee purveyor, which went public less than two months ago in a highly anticipated public offering, did not get a resounding vote of confidence from its underwriters — many of which initiated coverage on the stock with a “neutral” or negative rating. Goldman Sachs, one of its top underwriters, slapped a “sell” rating on Dunkin’ and a $23 price target, citing a “full” valuation. In its note, issued early Tuesday, Goldman praised the company’s margins and international opportunities but warned that its earnings per share growth will probably not rise fast enough to support the stock’s momentum. “We see the potential for underlying Dunkin U.S. comps to decelerate and disappoint in the back half of 2011 and 2012,”  the firm noted. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink A number of banks — which had to wait several weeks after Dunkin’s offering before issuing reports — took a similarly cautious stance. Three of its underwriters, Barclays Capital, Wells Fargo Securities, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, issued “neutral” or “equal weight” ratings on Dunkin’. Barclays, which set Dunkin’s price target at $27, said the “strengths of its global portfolio make a compelling long-term investment.” But it added that the valuation is a “primary concern” since it is trading at a premium to its restaurant peers. Other potential hurdles include the company’s plans to expand on the West Coast and its ability to turn around its Baskin-Robbins chain, according to Barclays. The skepticism evident in Tuesday’s research notes stands in stark contrast to the enthusiasm for Dunkin’s shares in late July. During the company’s public offering, international and domestic investors flocked to the banks for a piece of Dunkin’. Orders amounted to more than 20 times the size of the eventual offering, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. Shares of Dunkin’, which have traded as high as $31.94, are still about 35 percent above the company’s offering price. Historically, underwriters have not been shy to heap praise on the companies they have shepherded to the public markets. In the wake of LinkedIn’s debut, the company’s underwriters, JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, all stamped bullish ratings on the stock with rosy outlooks, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch calling LinkedIn a “$10 billion long-term revenue opportunity.” Still, there was some love for Dunkin’ on Tuesday. At least four of its underwriters, J.P.Morgan, Stifel Nicolaus Weisel, Williams Capital Group, and William Blair &amp; Company, issued positive ratings on the stock. Its lead underwriter, J.P. Morgan, delivered an “overweight” rating, assuring investors that “longevity and low-risk growth should sustain premium multiple.” It set its price target at $30.</text></article>

The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is suing 17 leading banks that sold them nearly $200 billion worth of subprime mortgage-backed securities that fell sharply in value when the housing market collapsed. The federal government has already put over $150 billion into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to bail them out, so this is a chance to recoup at least some of the losses. While the claims sound like a typical securities fraud suit, the F.H.F.A. is relying on lesser-known provisions of the federal securities laws that give it a significantly stronger basis for obtaining substantial recoveries from the banks that packaged the mortgages and sold securities backed by them. The Securities Act of 1933 authorizes claims by purchasers of securities who bought them pursuant to a registration statement (Section 11) and a prospectus (Section 12(a)(2)), two documents that must be filed before a security can be sold for the first time. Liability under these provisions is set off if they “contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.” White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links NYT: Federal Regulators Sue Big Banks Over Mortgages The two provisions were intended to ensure that issuers of securities, and those responsible for drafting the documents filed as part of the process, would be careful that all the information disclosed to investors was correct. Those who can be held liable for a violation of Section 11 are the issuer of the security and its directors, anyone who signed its registration statement and every underwriter involved in the offering. Section 12(a)(2) applies to the issuer and the actual underwriter selling the securities by a prospectus. Neither provision requires proof that the defendant actually relied on the misleading or omitted information, nor that those involved in the sale sought to defraud purchasers. While intent to defraud, or at least recklessness, is usually an element of a securities fraud claim, these provisions dispense with that requirement in order to create a strong incentive for issuers and underwriters to make sure the information provided to purchasers is both complete and correct. Along the same lines, unlike a typical securities fraud claim, lawsuits brought under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) do not require a plaintiff to prove that the misstatement or omission caused any damage. The remedy for a violation is the difference between the amount paid for the security and its value at the time the lawsuit was filed, or the price for which it was sold. In effect, this is a money-back guarantee if the registration statement or prospectus included a material misstatement or omission. There are relatively few lawsuits brought under these provisions because they are limited to those who purchased in the initial offering of the securities, and they do not apply to transactions in the secondary market, like sales on a stock exchange. There is also a much stricter statute of limitations applied to these claims that requires filing a lawsuit within one year of discovery of the misstatement or omission, and no later than three years from the filing of the documents. Unlike other purchasers, the F.H.F.A. can pursue its claims even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought the mortgage securities from 2005 to 2007 because a provision of federal law extends for up to three years the limitations period for filing claims. The lawsuits generally allege that the issuers and underwriters, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, misstated the owner occupancy percentage and loan-to-value ratio for the pool of loans included in the mortgage-backed securities and falsely certified that the lenders complied with proper loan underwriting procedures. The National Credit Union Administration filed similar claims against Goldman Sachs and other securities sellers, seeking nearly $2 billion. In response, some defendants argued that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not misled about the risks in the mortgage-backed securities they purchased. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said the mortgage giants were the “epitome of a sophisticated investor,” while a Bank of America statement asserted that they “claimed to understand the risks inherent in investing in subprime securities and continued to invest heavily in those securities even after their regulator told them they did not have the risk management capabilities to do so.” Although the banks can plausibly claim that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were knowledgeable about the mortgage market, the standard for a violation of Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) is whether any misstatements or omissions were “material,” which means a reasonable investor would consider them important. The materiality standard is quite broad, and arguing that these investors should have known better does not undermine a claim that the registration statement and prospectus included material misstatements. There are defenses to the F.H.F.A. claims, but they will not be easy for the banks to establish. Any defendant, other than the issuer, can assert a “due diligence” defense to a Section 11 claim, and for Section 12(a)(2)) the issuer or selling underwriters can try to show they acted with “reasonable care.” The burden of proof is on the defendant to make out these defense, and courts have not looked favorably on claims that sophisticated issuers somehow overlooked important information. Defendants can also offer a “negative causation” defense to limit the potential damages by showing that any drop in the value of the securities was not related to the misstatement or omission in the documents. This is the opposite of the “loss causation” requirement for the typical securities fraud claim, which requires the plaintiff to show a connection between the misstatement or omission and any decline in value. The misstatements and omissions described in the F.H.F.A.’s complaints relate to how the mortgages were likely to perform during the impending collapse in the housing market. Showing negative causation may not be possible if the value of the securities was overstated from the outset. Moreover, putting the burden to show “negative causation” on the defendants means the F.H.F.A. gets the benefit of the doubt on loss. The value of the mortgage-backed securities at issue in the lawsuits is almost $200 billion, although the government is unlikely to recover all of what was invested because the securities retain at least some value. The total potential recovery is difficult to establish at this point, but the potential exposure of the banks could be significant because Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) impose near strict liability on issuers and underwriters. And that cannot be welcome news to banks already buffeted by losses in other parts of their loan portfolios and the prospect of a double-dip recession. Peter J.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/business/bank-suits-over-mortgages-are-filed.html?ref=morganstanley">Federal Regulators Sue Big Banks Over Mortgages<date>Published: September 2, 2011</date><text>A bruising legal fight pitting the country’s most powerful banks against the full force of the United States government began Friday, as federal regulators filed suits against 17 financial institutions that sold the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac nearly $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that later soured.The suits are the latest legal salvo fired at the banks accusing them of misdeeds during the housing boom. Investors fled financial shares Friday amid growing concern that the litigation could last for years and undermine earnings and balance sheets in the process. The complaints were filed just as the stock market closed Friday afternoon, but with word leaking out of the impending legal action during the trading session, shares of Bank of America fell more than 8.3 percent, while JPMorgan Chase dropped 4.6 percent and Goldman fell 4.5 percent. “The suits only add to the uncertainty that dogs the industry,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole. “Banks should pay for what they did wrong, but at the same time they shouldn’t be treated as a big piñata that has the effect of delaying the housing recovery. If banks have to pay for loans they made five years ago, are they going to make new ones?” After the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, years of litigation followed. The mortgage bust and the subsequent financial crisis have spawned a similar legal fight, said Jaret Seiberg, a financial policy analyst with MF Global in Washington. “It’s going to be exceedingly difficult and take years to play out,” he said. “There’s not much incentive for either side to settle.” The litigation represents a more intense effort by the federal government to go after the financial services industry for its supposed mortgage failures. Indeed, the cases were brought on the basis of 64 subpoenas issued a year ago, giving the government an edge in its investigation that private investors suing the banks lack. The Obama administration as well as regulators like the Federal Reserve have been criticized for going too easy on the banks, which benefited from a $700 billion bailout package shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the autumn 2008. Much of that money has been repaid by the banks — but the rescue of the mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie has already cost taxpayers $153 billion, and the federal government estimates the effort could cost $363 billion through 2013. Even though the banks already face high legal bills from actions brought by other plaintiffs, including private investors, the suits filed Friday could cost the banks far more. In the case against Bank of America, for example, the suit claims that Fannie and Freddie bought more than $57 billion worth of risky mortgage securities from the bank and two companies it also acquired, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial. In addition to suing the companies, the complaints also identified individuals at many institutions responsible for the machinery of turning subprime mortgages into securities that somehow earned a AAA grade from the rating agencies. The filing did not cite a figure for the total losses the government wanted to recover, but in a similar case brought in July against UBS, the F.H.F.A. is trying to recover $900 million in losses on $4.5 billion in securities. A similar 20 percent claim against Bank of America could equal a $10 billion hit. In a suit that identifies 23 securities that Bank of America sold for $6 billion, the company “caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an amount to be determined at trial.” Within minutes of the filing of the suits, several banks responded with a preview of the legal arguments they will make in the coming months, namely that Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated investors who should have known the securities were not without risk, and that the losses were caused not by fraud or misrepresentation but by underlying difficulties in the housing market. In a statement, Bank of America said Fannie and Freddie “claimed to understand the risks inherent in investing in subprime securities and continued to invest heavily in those securities even after their regulator told them they did not have the risk management capabilities to do so.” In spite of that warning, Bank of America said, the government-controlled mortgage giants “are now seeking to hold other market participants responsible for their losses.” Other large banks also assembled huge amounts of so-called private label mortgage-backed securities for Fannie and Freddie that declined sharply in value after the housing bubble burst in 2007. JPMorgan Chase sold $33 billion, while Morgan Stanley sold over $10 billion and Goldman Sachs sold more than $11 billion. A who’s who of foreign banks were also big bundlers and sellers of these securities, like Deutsche Bank with $14.2 billion, Royal Bank of Scotland at $30.4 billion, and Credit Suisse selling $14.1 billion. All were sued Friday. “We believe the claims brought by the F.H.F.A. are unfounded,” said Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank. “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated investor, having issued trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and purchased hundreds of billions of dollars more, often after hand-picking the loans they now claim should not have been included in the offerings.“ Buried in the filings themselves, however, is a damning portrait of the excesses of the housing bubble, when borrowers were able to obtain home loans without basic proof of income or creditworthiness, and banks appeared only too happy to mine profits taking the risky loans and assembling them into securities that could be sold to investors. In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, for example, the suit says that “Goldman was not content to simply let poor loans pass into its securitizations.” In addition, the giant investment bank “took the fraud further, affirmatively seeking to profit from this knowledge.” When an outside analytics firm, Clayton, identified potential problems in the underlying mortgages Goldman was turning into securities, the suit said, “Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red flags revealed by Clayton’s review.” Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Citigroup. Similar behavior in terms of warnings provided by Clayton transpired at Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, RBS and UBS, according to the complaints.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the state on Thursday, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has urged city residents of low-lying areas to evacuate their homes by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Wall Street, too, is entering the bunker. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Interactive Feature: Hurricane Irene Tracking Map Many of New York’s largest investment banks have their headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, and thus fall outside the city’s designated flood zones. Bank of America‘s 1 Bryant Park skyscraper, Citigroup‘s 399 Park Avenue building, Morgan Stanley‘s 1585 Broadway bureau, and JPMorgan Chase‘s 270 Park Avenue offices are all outside the zones. Credit Suisse‘s tower, located a little further south at 11 Madison Avenue, also carries a “no zone” designation. But the headquarters of Goldman Sachs, located at 200 West Street in Battery Park City, is located in Zone A, the low-lying area that the mayor has ordered to be evacuated. So is American Express‘s office in the World Financial Center. Deutsche Bank‘s 60 Wall Street headquarters, several blocks away from Goldman, is in Zone B. A Goldman spokesman declined to detail the bank’s hurricane preparations, but said that the bank had “plans in place to ensure the safety of our people and the ongoing operation of our business.” A Deutsche Bank spokesman said in a statement: “We are monitoring the storm closely and keeping employees informed with regular updates. We have already taken steps to ensure that we can conduct business as usual while maintaining the safety of all our employees, which is of utmost importance.” Some Midtown banks have second offices in high-risk zones. The Tribeca office of Citigroup, located near the Hudson River at 388 Greenwich Street, is in Zone A, as is Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, also in the World Financial Center. Citigroup’s Tribeca office houses its investment bank and trading floor. Merrill Lynch Wealth Management employees and other tenants of the World Financial Center were sent instructions for a “controlled lockdown” on Friday, but a spokeswoman for Brookfield, the building’s manager, said the lockdown protocol had been superseded by Mayor Bloomberg’s evacuation order. Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said that the bank had off-site offices in undisclosed locations available in the case that employees are unable to get to their normal locations. “Citi is committed to providing uninterrupted service to our clients during the storm and seeks to minimize any possible impact,” she said. Goldman Sachs, normally a bastion of conservative fashion, has told employees in some divisions they can dress casually on Monday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a memo, the firm instructed employees to “exercise good judgment” when determining proper dress. Some banks have begun booking hotel rooms for critical employees who may not otherwise be able to make it in to Manhattan, and a professional golf tournament sponsored by Barclays, which was scheduled to finish on Sunday, was shortened to 54 holes from 72 holes because of the impending storm. Chase announced that it would keep its 376 New York City branches open until 8 PM on Friday, to give customers ample time to complete banking transactions before the storm. It said the branches would be open until 11 a.m. on Saturday. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is located at 33 Liberty Street, said, “We are monitoring the storm and have contingency plans in place and multiple levels of redundancies to ensure regular operational functioning.” A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, John Nester, said: “We have been communicating throughout the day with markets and securities firms on whether the markets will be open Monday. Discussions will continue Saturday and Sunday as appropriate. The markets will make the decision whether to open in consultation with the S.E.C.” The New York Stock Exchange, which at 11 Wall Street is located in Zone C, is “planning to open on Monday,” a spokesman said, though it has a number of options if the storm makes that impossible, such as routing trades to its electronic market.

On Wednesday, Jive Software became the latest technology company to file to go public, joining a pipeline that includes Groupon and Zynga. Jive Software, a social network tool for businesses, is looking to raise $100 million, according to its filing, quoting a figure used to calculate registration fees. Jive Software, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to serve as lead underwriters for the offering. Although Jive is not part of the consumer Web, like Facebook and Groupon — two of the most highly anticipated public offerings — it does merge the social Web with enterprise. Jive’s flagship platform allows businesses to create and manage social networks, in order to facilitate communication, data sharing and general online collaboration.

Last year, it rose 54 percent, to $46.2 million, but it recorded a loss of $27.6 million. Jive has posted a loss every year, for the last five years, according to its filing. At the end of June, it had “an accumulated deficit of $84.5 million.” With business costs rising, the company said it did not expect to be profitable for “the foreseeable future.” Jive, which plans to trade under the ticker “JIVE,” will use about $20 million of the offering’s proceeds to pay off outstanding debt.

That appears to be the mind-set of many nervous investors when it comes this week to financial stocks, which are down more than the broader market. Goldman Sachs is down almost 12 percent since Monday’s open. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are both down roughly 17 percent. Citigroup dropped 15 percent and JPMorgan Chase shares sank almost 9 percent. Some market insiders feel the sell-off is overdone. Bank executives are grumbling about it. There is nothing systemic seemingly going on here, they say. In some cases, banks have record-high capital levels thanks to recent regulatory rules requiring them to put up more capital against riskier businesses. Leverage, or how much money a firm borrows to fund its business, is down significantly since the financial crisis. An optimist may even argue these stocks are a screaming buy right now. All of the country’s biggest financial stocks are trading below book value, or crucial financial measure that refers to the liquidation value of a company’s assets if it were forced to sell everything. So what gives? No one cares about all that right now. “What you are seeing is the manic ‘I remember 2008’ selling,” said Glenn Schorr, a banking analyst with Nomura. “And the only thing that worked then was to get out of the way and not come back too early. The more cash they have, the safer people feel right now.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links A Rough Patch for Hedge Funds Europe Weighs Short Selling Ban Holders of financial stocks, burned by what happened in 2008, don’t want to stick around and see how this latest bump in the road ends, especially given the questions surrounding bank exposure to Europe, continued litigation stemming from the credit crisis and the potential impact of a possible recession, which threatens to crimp big money makers for the banks, including M.&amp;A., underwriting and beyond. Mr. Schorr said while most banks have stated they have bought protection to hedge against their exposure in Europe, bank investors are worried it may not matter. “There may be a voluntary restructuring instead of an actual bankruptcy so the protection they have bought might not pay off,” he said. Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities, is downright pessimistic, saying concerns over Europe and litigation are just a symptoms of larger problem, one that is systemic. “This is a continuation of 2008,” he said. “We are finally coming to grips with the fact we have a massive debt problem that needs to be dealt with. This is not a problem for our grandchildren. It is our problem. We have a financial system structured on a bankrupt currency and that system is now breaking down and a new system will arise to replace it, but we don’t yet anything to replace it. “ Mr. Bove said recently moved all his holdings into cash. While everyone’s hair seems to be on fire this week, major players including Fidelity, Wellington Management and AllianceBernstein have been big sellers of financial stocks for months now, regulatory filings show. This selling points perhaps to another concern about these stocks. Financial firms, with lower leverage levels and more rigorous capital requirements, simply won’t be able to generate anywhere near the returns they did before the financial crisis. Goldman’s return on equity was just 8 percent in the second half of this year, down from more than 30 percent in 2006. Banks argue that big shareholders are always selling in and out of their stocks. This week’s hubbub aside, the selling by some of these long-term holders suggests that concerns run deep. And even though the country’s banks are well capitalized and have significantly lowered their leverage levels since the crisis, it may be some time before investors wade in again.</text></article>

Bank of America dropped almost 11 percent. Citigroup sank 10.5 percent. Goldman Sachs fell 10 percent, while Morgan Stanley was down 9.7 percent. All told, bank stocks have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year — and have swung wildly up and down over the last week — as the weakening economy is expected to take a toll on business and reduce earnings. But concerns about European banks are driving the latest wave of selling. Société Générale’s share price dropped 14.7 percent on Wednesday, the most of any European bank, as its chief executive “denied all rumors” that he said caused the stock to fall. Other European giants were alsopounded. Shares of Intesa Sanpaolo of Italy fell nearly 14 percent. Crédit Agricole and AXA Financial of France dropped more than 10 percent apiece. Financial institutions across the Continent have huge holdings of government and corporate bonds from Italy and Spain. Doubts about the financial health of European lenders are encouraging investors to unload their shares and driving up their borrowing costs. Those banks, in turn, trade billions daily with their counterparts on Wall Street. They also rely on billions of dollars invested by American money market mutual funds to finance loans and other investments. That has created a vicious circle, where fears about the soundness of European banks are feeding new concerns about the stability of American financial institutions. “The European situation is back and isn’t going away,” said Alex Roever, the head of short-term fixed income at JPMorgan Chase. “It continues to keep pressure on the market.” Only a few months ago, American banks looked as if they had finally found their footing. Loan losses were easing. Profits and bonuses were back. Even some of the new regulations had turned out to be not as draconian as many bankers once believed. But there has been a steady drumbeat of dismal headlines in the last few weeks. First, weak data for the housing market and the broader economy suggested that banks would find it even harder to grow. Standard &amp; Poor’s downgrade of the United States government further rattled confidence, the lifeblood of the financial system. Then, in a sign of how grim things had become, the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of pledging to keep interest rates near zero for the next two years. That may prevent the economy from slipping into another recession, but it will squeeze lending profits that make up the bulk of banks’ income. And that comes as demand is already slowing for all kinds of loans and a wave of deal making has been shelved. “Everyone is going to be lowering their estimates,” said David Ellison, the chief investment officer of two FBR mutual funds that invest in financial companies. “You are going to have lower loan growth and lower margins; we are in a new era.” If that were not enough, there are lingering worries about the legal hangover from the housing bust. Bank of America, which faces potentially tens of billions of dollars in investor claims, held an unusual conference call on Wednesday to reassure shareholders it could cope with all settlements, among other concerns. Its shares fell to $6.77 on Wednesday, after reaching a postcrisis high of almost $20 in April 2010. Now, as Europe’s fiscal troubles spread to core trading partners like France, there are renewed fears of contagion. The links between French and American institutions, after all, are orders of magnitude larger than they are between American banks and say, Greek, or even Spanish ones. For example, according to the Bank for International Settlements, French banks owed American institutions more than $160 billion at the end of 2010.  Spanish banks owed less than $20 billion. And that’s not counting the billions of dollars that big American banks lend directly to overseas companies or any European government debt they hold as investments. Nowhere is that nervousness greater than in the short-term financing markets, where European banks turn to American money funds each day for tens of billions of dollars in funding. 1 2 Next Page »Fear is on the rise again that worsening problems at some of Europe’s biggest banks may wind up hurting financial institutions in the United States.</text></article>

E*Trade is bending to Citadel’s will. The online brokerage company announced on Monday that it had created a new special committee to evaluate the company’s strategic options. The group, made up of three independent directors, has also hired Goldman Sachs to advise. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink It’s a victory for Citadel, the hedge fund led by Kenneth Griffin, which has been pushing Citadel to restructure its board and consider a sale. In tersely worded letters, delivered in July, the firm chided E*Trade’s board for squandering a “phenomenal franchise.” In a list of demands, Citadel directed E*Trade to look at a sale, declassify its board and eject two directors.  In response, E*Trade hired Morgan Stanley to explore a sale and said it would look into changing the board’s structure at next year’s shareholder meeting. Unappeased, Citadel, E*Trade’s largest shareholder, sent another letter, criticizing the process as “awash in conflict” and reiterated its demands for immediate changes to the board. Citadel also said it had filed to convene a special shareholder meeting to address its concerns. Although the conflict seems far from over, Citadel began to back down on Monday. In a new letter to E*Trade, the firm said, “We trust this new process, involving all directors, will be more transparent and objective, and look forward to the board and its adviser, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, working quickly to fulfill this crucial mandate.” The firm also said it had suspended further shareholder action, “including our request for a special meeting.” According to people briefed on the matter, Mr. Griffin told E*Trade’s board that he had two main complaints about the company’s process. The first was that he wanted the special committee to be made up only of directors who had joined within the last three years. The second was that he specifically preferred Goldman as an adviser. Morgan Stanley was unacceptable because the bank had done some work for E*Trade in the past, though its last merger advisory assignment was the company’s 2005 $1.6 billion takeover of BrownCo, a unit of JPMorgan Chase. To head off a protracted battle with Citadel, E*Trade agreed to the hedge fund’s demands over the weekend, these people said.

Morgan Stanley posted a promising second quarter despite losing money on eight trading days in the quarter, according to a regulatory filing released on Monday. On the positive side of the ledger, the firm said it produced more than $200 million in revenue on one day and had seven days in the quarter when revenue topped $100 million. In the year-ago period it reported revenue more than $100 million on six days and had 11 money losing days. In the first quarter Morgan Stanley reported that it lost money on three trading days.

Although the financial firm reported a second-quarter loss of $558 million, three crucial divisions posted significant gains. Revenue in the firm’s institutional securities business, which houses trading and banking, rose almost 15 percent, to $5.19 billion. The improved results were a promising sign that the turnaround plan Morgan Stanley embarked on after the financial crisis was taking hold. They were also a point of pride for the firm: it was the first time since 2008 that its quarterly revenue exceeded that of its rival Goldman Sachs.

Also in Monday’s filing, the company singled out four lawsuits against it, estimating those actions could “reasonably” cost the company roughly $1.5 billion if judgements go against Morgan Stanley. In one suit, filed in September 2009, Citibank sued Morgan Stanley, claiming the Wall Street firm failed to pay $245 million due under a credit default swap agreement. Morgan Stanley said in its filing that on June 27 the court found in favor of Citi, awarding the bank $269 million plus post-judgment interest. Morgan Stanley has appealed the ruling, according to the regulatory filing. “Based on currently available information, the company believes it could incur a loss of up to approximately $269 million plus post-judgment interest,” the filing says.</text></article>

A day after the stellar debut of Dunkin’ Brands, the specialty tea retailer Teavana soared 63.5 percent on Thursday on its first day of trading. Shares of Teavana, priced at $17, opened at $28.95 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The stock rose as high as $29.35, before settling at $27.80. The offering, valued at $121 million, comes amid robust investor demand for popular consumer brands that have definable growth opportunities.On Wednesday, shares of Dunkin,’ which raised $422.75 million in its oversubscribed offering, jumped 46.6 percent. While Teavana’s premium teas are not as well known as Dunkin’ Donuts Coolattas, the retailer has 161 company-owned stores in 35 states and more than a dozen franchise outlets in Mexico. The company, based in Atlanta, has expanded aggressively. It has more than tripled the number of stores in the last five years. According to a recent filing, Teavana plans to have “at least 500 stores” in the United States.

In the background is “Turn Off the Dark,” by the artist Rachel Harrison, made from a cubicle wall, office supplies, toy parrots and curtains. David Muenzer, a receptionist at the law firm Latham &amp; Watkins, was feeling bored and curious one day in February. He decided to explore the firm’s storage space. Then, in a turn of events that would make for a recession-era “Alice in Wonderland,” Mr. Muenzer, 24, discovered two vacant floors of 885 Third Avenue in Midtown. It was a ghost town of abandoned cubicles, complete with motivational posters, name plates and white boards with plans for another day at work. A bit of snooping revealed that the 32,000-square-foot space had been vacated by Morgan Stanley in 2008, amid the housing crisis. “Within seconds of being in here, I knew,” said Mr. Muenzer. The space had a feeling, he said, that “underscores the absence of the worker.” Mr. Muenzer, a receptionist by day and conceptual artist by night, convinced his employers to let him use the floors to host an art show. (The law firm had leased the space but would not begin renovating until the fall.) Rather than stripping the office to give it the conventional feel of the white cube galleries that dot Chelsea, he kept the office as was — complete with pale yellow walls, emerald carpet, pushpins and plants. Mylan Cannon/The New York Times“Dried Dream,” by Rebecca Lieb, made with dirt and carpet. Mylan Cannon/The New York Times“Around the Water Cooler Two,” by Rachel Harrison. The artist Rebecca Lieb filled an office with dirt. Trisha Baga hung a trophy around the neck of a potted tree. Mr. Muenzer stuffed the mail room with letters dyed with food coloring. Craig Kalpakjian placed a looped video of an endless hallway at the end of a hallway. Rachel Harrison overturned a cubicle wall and painted it with the name “Julie Taymor.” “When you’ve been exhibiting for a long time, which I have now — yeah, this is a slightly unique situation,” said Ms. Harrison, who surrounded a water cooler with a frame she covered in a skin of cement, giving it the effect of being engorged in a stone cave. “It’s not like we’re in Nebraska and it’s someone’s father’s law office.” No, 885 Third Avenue is not someone’s father’s Midwestern law office. It is known as the Lipstick Building, for its design: a curving column of red marble designed by the Modernist architect Philip Johnson. More recently, it has become known for having housed Bernard Madoff’s operations, on its 17th floor. In 2010, the building’s owner filed for bankruptcy. Morgan Stanley’s decision to leave in 2008 was also product of a tough economy. “It was too expensive,” said Pen Pendleton, a Morgan Stanley spokesman. The show, “14 &amp; 15,” could have been vengeful; after all, even artists were not immune to the effects of the economic meltdown. Instead it felt archaeological, with the artists casting themselves as explorers uncovering a foreign world. “I felt like we found things in there,” Ms. Harrison said, describing her discoveries in the electrical room. “Nothing had moved in years.” On a recent tour, Mr. Muenzer pointed out USB cords left curled in a corner, a thumbtack lodged in a wall and black marks on the floor: Relics of an ancient world. “The scuffs are very interesting,” he said. “Judicious cleaning was an important creative act.” Jennifer Murray, administrator of the New York office of Latham &amp; Watkins, wrote in an e-mail that the firm “readily agreed to the concept” of the gallery. At the opening last month, twenty-somethings drank wine in front of a white board, artists peered into cubicles, a group of women chatted around the engorged water cooler. It was like an office, a real office, but with everything topsy-turvy. The bohemian sub-economy stomped on office carpets like astronauts walking on a soundless moon. One guest wondered if a dead plant — placed in a corner — was a piece, or wasn’t. It was. “There were some live plants,” Ms. Harrison recalled. “So I found a dead plant to put there. I thought that was funny.” “14 &amp; 15″ will be on display at 885 Third Ave through October 31 by appointment. Contact fourteenandfifteen@gmail.com for more information. Correction: July 15, 2011 An earlier version of this post said that the work "Around the Water Cooler Two" used "hundreds of pounds of plaster."

But on Thursday, robust gains in almost all of JPMorgan Chase’s main businesses offered some hope that the industry’s prospects are not as bad as feared. Over all, the bank said second-quarter revenue climbed 7 percent to $27.4 billion — a strong showing amid a stagnant consumer economy and some of the most challenging trading conditions of the last few years. That helped JPMorgan handily beat analysts’ consensus estimates with a profit of $5.4 billion, or $1.27 a share. Still, it was not enough to lift beaten-down bank stocks. Shares of Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo fell slightly on Thursday. The solid revenue figures fly in the face of the dismal projections by many Wall Street analysts, who have been warning that banking is quickly returning to a boring, low-growth business. The figures also take some of the air out of the financial industry’s arguments that new regulations are depressing revenue and stifling the fragile economic recovery. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release JPMorgan Names Co-Head of North America Investment Banking Even the chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has raised concerns about the cost of the new rules, acknowledged that his bank would be able to make up a big part of the missing revenue. “JPMorgan will be just fine,” he said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters. Bank officials said the revenue levels largely reflected a modest increase in lending and an uptick in fee income that could be sustained in the months ahead. For example, JPMorgan’s investment bank had a sharp increase in underwriting fees for debt and equity, as well as a big increase in deal advisory income that helped offset weaker trading results. Its Chase retail banking unit benefited from more profitable home lending and an increase in fee income from checking accounts, debit cards and the sale of investment products. That helped it absorb charges totaling almost $1 billion to cover mortgage losses, and an additional $2.3 billion in charges tied to rising legal and foreclosure costs. Revenue in its corporate banking, asset management and treasury services units also grew. Only the bank’s big credit card business, Chase Card Services, had a decline in revenue from a year ago. It fell 7 percent as a result of legislation that eliminated lucrative penalty fees and its decision to shed a risky credit card portfolio it had acquired with Washington Mutual. The rest of the banking industry has been bracing for lower top-line growth. Besides the impact of the new financial regulations, the weak job and housing markets have curtailed lending. Ultra-low interest rates are putting pressure on profit margins. And Wall Street trading revenue, which helped prop up the banks’ results in wake of the 2008 financial crisis, also has slowed. All told, revenue for the banking industry is expected to fall more than 5 percent, to about $186 billion in the second quarter, according to Trepp, a financial research firm. That would put it near 2005 levels. Second-quarter profits, however, are likely to be far more robust than a year ago — about $30.6 billion industrywide, up 41 percent. The reason is that many banks stand to benefit from the reversal of funds they had previously set aside to cover losses or legal claims. That windfall can help pad bank bottom lines, even if there is little top-line growth. In JPMorgan’s case, a $1 billion benefit from the reversal in credit card loan loss reserves contributed to about 12 percent of its second-quarter, pretax earnings. For the entire industry in the first quarter, about $12.6 billion, or roughly 43 percent of profits, came from the release of reserves. Analysts expect to see similar trends in the second quarter. Citigroup, which will report on Friday, is expected to show revenue falling about 9 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters. Net income, the analysts project, will rise about 9 percent amid lower losses on credit card and corporate loans. At Goldman Sachs, which will report on Tuesday, revenue is expected to fall about 3.5 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates. Profit could rise sharply from the second quarter of 2010, when the bank took a big charges to cover the British tax on bonuses and resolve allegations by federal securities regulators that it had misled investors on a complex mortgage deal. Revenue at Bank of America, which also will report on Tuesday, was expected to drop about 15 percent, largely because of $20 billion worth of charges tied to the cleanup of its mortgage troubles, which it announced in late June. As a result, the bank warned that it would lose $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion. Some analysts suggest that JPMorgan’s strong results could be the exception rather than the rule. Much depends on how banks fare in the most unpredictable of businesses — trading. “For those who own these stocks, it was a pleasant beginning to the earnings season,” said Frederick Cannon, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. “But one point doesn’t make a line.”</text></article>

He is the closest thing to a truly independent director on the roster of Rupert Murdoch cronies. Mr. Perkins also has some relevant experience: he quit the board of Hewlett-Packard five years ago over a phone-hacking scandal. That makes him a prime candidate to lead the charge for a badly needed overhaul of governance at the News Corporation.The company’s shares have tumbled 14 percent over the last week, as phone hacking and other malfeasance at News of the World brought the abrupt shutdown of the tabloid and then raised the specter of the News Corporation losing its grip on British Sky Broadcasting, the British satellite TV group. Though shareholders bought in knowing that Mr. Murdoch called the shots, they are still entitled to expect independent directors to fight their corner. The company needs a fully independent inquiry into what happened, a critical assessment of its current businesses and strategy and an objective review of governance, among other things. Yet there isn’t much nonpartisan thinking to be found on the company’s board. Though nine of the 15 directors up for election last August met Nasdaq’s standards for independence, they mostly don’t really reflect the word’s meaning. Kenneth Cowley ran a News Corporation division for years and has served on the board for over three decades. Andrew Knight was chairman of News International, the division now under scrutiny, before becoming a director in 1994. John Thornton, now a professor in China, helped win business from Mr. Murdoch when he was president of Goldman Sachs. Few of the supposed independent directors lack a history with the News Corporation or its boss. So the responsibility may fall on Mr. Perkins’s shoulders. His own phone records were hacked when Patricia Dunn, then chairwoman of H.P., hired investigators to uncover board leaks. He resigned, later talking of “the questionable ethics and the dubious legality” of the methods used. Mr. Perkins, a founder of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, also used the episode to rail against tick-the-box corporate governance, which he said was increasingly substituting for judgment. The mess at the News Corporation provides him a perfect opportunity to lead his fellow independent directors in practicing what he preached. Maintaining Balance Morgan Stanley should keep two at the top. John Mack is due to retire as chairman at the end of the year and the board may well grant the title to James Gorman, adding to his duties as chief executive. Combining the two roles is far more common in the United States than in Europe. But the directors should resist the temptation. Mr. Gorman’s rebuilding of the firm has been slowed by the uncertainty over regulatory reform and the economy’s effect on earnings across the financial sector. He isn’t without success. He notably saved $800 million of annual costs by persuading Mitsubishi UFJ to convert its preferred shares into common stock. But Mr. Gorman is edging only slowly toward repairing and expanding fixed-income trading and the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney retail brokerage unit. Not only is it too soon to consider granting him another title, but making him chairman could prove a distraction from his day-to-day responsibilities. A C.E.O. tending to those can leave the chairman to focus on monitoring top executives and shareholder interests. Chief executives should do the same, but there is an inherent conflict of interest in juggling the concerns of investors against personal ambitions. Appointing an independent lead director only partly offsets that. Consider the fate of rivals like Bank of America, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, where having the same person serve as chairman and chief executive impeded the ability of the board and other executives to challenge decisions. Arguably, that also affected Morgan Stanley, which lost some $10 billion on a subprime mortgage trade, encouraged by the desire of Mr. Mack, who held both top jobs at the time, to ramp up risk. Of course, splitting the roles is no panacea. It didn’t prevent some European banks from getting into trouble. And a few banks with one man in both positions came through the crisis less financially scarred than others, for instance JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. But Bank of America and Citigroup have wisely embraced the separation of powers. If the right people are put in the two jobs, it creates a more effective balance and better corporate governance.

Taubman, the co-presidents of institutional securities, and Gregory Fleming, the president of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Wall Street has a new guessing game: whom will James P. Gorman choose to be his No. 2? Mr. Gorman, the Australian-born chief executive of Morgan Stanley, is not expected to take over as chairman until early next year, after John J. Mack steps down. But inside the investment bank, speculation is already swirling about the next president, a title now also held by Mr. Gorman. It is a crucial position, and the person filling it is usually seen as the heir apparent to the top spot. While there are several long shots, the odds favor three senior executives. Insiders are betting on the co-presidents of institutional securities, Colm Kelleher and Paul J. Taubman, as well as Gregory J. Fleming, the president of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink They could be waiting a while to get the nod from Mr. Gorman. People close to the chief executive say he has no intention of filling the spot right away and could even wait years. Mr. Gorman, 52, is still a young chief executive and does not see the need to publicly anoint a second in command, the people say. Choosing one would most likely ruffle the feathers of the executives passed over — a situation Mr. Gorman does not want so early in his tenure. By waiting to pick a president, Mr. Gorman can also monitor the performance of each deputy, keeping them in healthy competition with one another. “It’s too early to give anyone that type of promotion,” said a UBS stock analyst, William Tanona. “Mr. Gorman needs to get some decent quarters behind him before doing anything like this. The company is going through a transition phase with new people, and there is still a lot to be worked out.” It is not unusual for a Wall Street chief executive to keep the job empty. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Brian T. Moynihan at Bank of America both have several senior deputies but no president. But a strong No. 2 can be useful. Goldman Sachs’s president, Gary D. Cohn, is often called to attend investment banking pitches and step in when the firm’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, is busy. The rumor mill at Morgan Stanley is starting in anticipation of a board meeting this month. The directors are scheduled to meet in Japan, where a top shareholder is based, to discuss management changes at the top. The current chairman, Mr. Mack, is widely expected to retire this year. If he does, it will pave the way for Mr. Gorman to step into the role. Morgan Stanley has a deep bench of executives from which Mr. Gorman can pick a president — when he eventually does. Mr. Taubman and Mr. Kelleher, who have been running institutional securities since late 2009, are natural choices. The two top executives played crucial roles in guiding the company through the financial crisis. Mr. Taubman, 50, helped secure a lifeline from the Japanese bank Mitsubishi in 2008 shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, and he is now focused on investment banking. Mr. Kelleher, 54, was Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer during the rocky period. He is now charged with turning around sales and trading, a crucial unit that has not fully recovered from the depths of the disaster. Both have long histories at Morgan Stanley, too. Mr. Taubman, who has been with the firm for 29 years, is one of the largest individual shareholders, with almost 1.1 million shares, valued at roughly $25 million. Mr. Kelleher, an outgoing Irishman who has eight siblings, is an accountant by trade, having worked at Arthur Andersen before joining Morgan Stanley in 1989. As can be common with co-heads of a division, their professional relationship is tense, according to colleagues who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly. It is sometimes uncomfortable in meetings with the two executives, since it is readily apparent they do not get along, the colleagues say. Through a spokeswoman for the firm, Mr. Taubman and Mr. Kelleher declined to comment for this article. The relative newcomer of the group, Mr. Fleming, 48, has known Mr. Gorman since their days working together at Merrill Lynch. Hired in late 2009 to run the firm’s asset management division, he quickly improved the group’s profitability, in part by selling noncore assets and cutting costs. This year, Mr. Gorman added the retail brokerage unit to his duties. Expanding the unit’s lower-risk, fee-based business is a crucial part of the firm’s broader strategy. There are also dark-horse candidates to consider, like the chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, 53, and Jim Rosenthal, 58, head of corporate strategy. Both are senior executives and members of Mr. Gorman’s inner circle. Mr. Gorman could also look outside to fill out his corporate suite. As is usually the case in these races, it is too early to call. Of course, that has never stopped Wall Street from talking.</text></article>

It is the latest financial firm to announce cutbacks amid a lackluster market and weak earnings on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are planning to reduce their headcounts.

The company is expected to file for an offering on Wednesday, according to people briefed on the matter. Zynga’s offering may be the biggest yet by a social media firm. The company potentially will seek to sell as much as 10 percent of its shares for a price that will value the company at $20 billion or more, according to people briefed on the offering plans. If the sale brings in $2 billion, it will be among the largest technology offerings since Google’s in 2004. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The filing is expected to shed light on Zynga’s business, including how much it depends upon Facebook for its revenue. The numbers should also provide some insight on the financials of Facebook, which is widely expected to file for its I.P.O. in the next 12 months. Zynga has selected banks led by Morgan Stanley to underwrite the offering, people briefed on the matter said. The underwriting group also includes Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and JPMorgan Chase. Representatives for Zynga and the banks declined to comment. Like several of its peers, Zynga has pushed up the time line for its market debut: as recently as February, it was aiming for an I.P.O. early next year. As the force behind popular online games like FarmVille and CityVille, the company makes the bulk of its revenue from the sale of virtual goods and now claims more than 215 million monthly active users. It has been profitable for several years, its founder and chief executive, Mark J. Pincus, has said. Still, Zynga may encounter skepticism over the valuations of the newest Internet companies. Although LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, reached an intraday high of $122 on its first day of trading, the stock has since pulled back significantly. On Tuesday, shares of LinkedIn rose 12 percent, bolstered by a batch of positive analyst reports, and closed at $85.66. When Zynga goes public, Mr. Pincus, who founded the company in 2007, and its venture capital investors will see their fortunes multiply. The group — which includes Yuri Milner’s DST Global, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers, Silver Lake Partners and Andreessen Horowitz — has sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into Zynga.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/business/28views.html?ref=morganstanley">Wall St. Job Cuts Loom if Slump Persists<date>Published: June 27, 2011</date><text>Wall Street is again talking of impending job cuts. With trading revenue falling, the pressure is growing for investment banks to lay off employees. Executives are still debating whether the current slump is a blip. But nobody wants to slash ranks right before a turnaround, so the knives may not come out for a few months.Firms have jumped the gun before. Morgan Stanley scaled back its fixed-income operations after the 2008 crisis, leaving an already-damaged franchise unprepared for the bailout-fueled recovery the next year. It has since hired 400 or so people in interest rates and other more liquid markets, but has not yet made much progress toward its goal of increasing revenue by about a third. Merrill Lynch also hit the panic button in 2008, perhaps more understandably given its huge losses at the time. But Thomas K. Montag, who had just been hired from Goldman Sachs to run trading, extended the cull to equities desks. The firm ended up trying to rehire many of the same people months later, with varying success. That was not the first time Merrill pulled the trigger too early. A decade ago, E. Stanley O’Neal, then chief executive-in-waiting, cut thousands of workers soon after the Sept. 11 attacks. At the time the company was still trying to recover from its previous mass firing after the Russian and Long-Term Capital Management crisis in 1998. No firm wants to repeat such mistakes. And many market participants think fixed-income trading should recover. Analysts at Nomura, for instance, estimate that it should grow by an average of 7 percent a year from here. The question is when that gets going. The European sovereign debt crisis, the federal debt ceiling impasse and concerns about the pace of economic recovery are taking their toll on markets. Deutsche Bank estimates that trading volumes are down 20 to 40 percent this quarter. That will bring a few job reductions, with other cuts coming from noncompensation expenses. But if the trading business hasn’t rebounded by September, Wall Street’s elevators will be full of former employees with cardboard boxes heading down and out for good. Tepco’s Familiar Mess Tokyo Electric Power is looking like an undead relative of America’s housing zombies. Shareholders of the Japanese utility, scheduled to hold its annual meeting on Tuesday in Tokyo, have seen the value of their holdings tumble 85 percent since the March earthquake. The American housing crisis eviscerated the stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a similar way. As with those companies, it is questionable whether Tepco’s next chapter involves public shareholders at all. Tepco’s mess echoes that of Fannie and Freddie in significant ways. The utility — valued at 3.4 trillion yen ($42 billion) in early March, but now worth less than a sixth of that — is a central part of the industrial infrastructure underpinning Japan’s economy. The two American mortgage giants increased, and still support, America’s huge housing sector, although their shares, once worth much more than $100 billion combined, are now essentially worthless. Tepco and the United States government-sponsored enterprises dominated their markets, were overseen by feckless regulators and became complacent before disaster struck. They operated with inadequate risk management and capital regimes. Both were also widely held by retail investors as stocks that seemed safe. The stories also, of course, diverge. The collapse in Fannie and Freddie’s share prices culminated in an open-ended government rescue that ensured the companies’ creditors were fully protected. With Tepco, the Japanese government has said it will help with the trillions of yen the company will pay in compensation, but that assistance looks likely to be capped. Bankruptcy is not off the table. Nor is the idea of leaning on banks to write off loans. So Tepco’s credit is under a giant cloud as well: the cost of insuring against default implies it is riskier to lend to the once unassailable Tepco than to Pakistan. The fate of the company’s shareholders is probably in the hands of Japan’s lawmakers. Nearly three years on, their counterparts in the Congress cannot figure out how to restructure Fannie and Freddie. Though unsustainable in their current form, they are seen as too central to a sluggish economy to risk radical change. It is not hard to imagine a zombified Tepco roaming in similar fashion, subsisting on what is left of its shareholder value. ANTONY CURRIE and RICHARD BEALESWall Street is again talking of impending job cuts. With trading revenue falling, the pressure is growing for investment banks to lay off employees. Executives are still debating whether the current slump is a blip. But nobody wants to slash ranks right before a turnaround, so the knives may not come out for a few months.</text></article>

    <article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/wall-street-banks-lose-ruling-on-research/?ref=morganstanley">Big Banks Lose Ruling on Research<date>June 20, 2011, 10:54 am</date><text>Jin Lee/Bloomberg News A federal appeals court ruled on Monday that investment banks could not stop a financial Web site from immediately publishing the research recommendations of their stock analysts, delivering a blow to Wall Street and a win for the investing public. Perhaps more significant, the decision was a victory for Internet companies whose business models depend upon summarizing and commenting on others’ original content. Yet media businesses also cheered the ruling because it left in place legal protections against rogue competitors who copy and resell original news reporting at little or no cost. “It’s a great decision for the free flow of information in the new media age,” said Kathleen M. Sullivan, a lawyer who filed a brief in the case on behalf of two clients, Google and Twitter. In a lawsuit closely followed by the world’s largest financial, media and technology businesses, a panel of three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan ruled that Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America could not dictate who reported news about their stock research — nor when they reported it. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The decision leaves in place all traditional federal copyright protections. For example, a site can report on the content of Wall Street research, meaning that it could run a headline like “Morgan Stanley’s semiconductor analyst upgrades Intel.” But the site would violate copyright law if it reprinted the analyst’s report on Intel verbatim. “A firm’s ability to make news — by issuing a recommendation that is likely to affect the market price of a security — does not give rise to a right for it to control who breaks that news and how,” Judge Robert D. Sack wrote in the court’s 88-page opinion. The ruling reversed a controversial lower court decision made last year that required a financial Web site, theflyonthewall.com, to wait until 10 a.m. to publish news about Wall Street research that had been issued before the stock market’s 9:30 a.m. opening bell. The site was also ordered to delay its headlines during the day by two hours. The ruling effectively gave the banks’ clients a chance to digest market-moving research before everyone else. The banks had argued that the Web site’s publishing headlines about a bank’s upgrade or downgrade of a company’s stock — often before the information was fully disseminated to the banks’ clients — was tantamount to stealing intellectual property. They contended that delivering stock recommendations exclusively was key to their business because clients were more likely to trade with them if they learned of a stock recommendation from them rather than elsewhere. Benjamin E. Marks, a lawyer for the banks, said in a statement that they were “disappointed in the court’s decision, and we are reviewing the decision to determine our next steps.” He added: ”Each of the plaintiffs remains committed to protecting their equity research against unauthorized appropriation.” The banks’ lawsuit against theflyonthewall.com was based on a legal doctrine called ”hot news misappropriation,” which is meant to protect organizations from stealing original content generated by competitors and reselling it. The original “hot news” doctrine evolved from a famous Supreme Court case in 1918, when The Associated Press successfully prevented the International News Service from appropriating its wire reports on the war in Europe. With the rise of the Internet and digital media, the largely dormant “hot news” doctrine has become more relevant, as competitors can now copy content and repackage it as their own product with just a few keystrokes. While the Second Circuit upheld the viability of a “hot news” claim — where one organization copies and resells news originally gathered by another — it said that the banks’ case did not fall within this law. In this instance, the court said, the Web site was not “free-riding” on Wall Street firms’ stock recommendations. “The firms are making the news; Fly, despite the firms’ understandable desire to protect their business model, is breaking it,” Judge Sack wrote. Corynne McSherry, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet freedom advocacy group, said that while the ruling preserves the protections of the “hot news” doctrine, it seems to limit its use. “While it may have survived this case, it now appears to have been narrowed to within an inch of its life,” Ms. McSherry said. Media outlets applauded the ruling. The Associated Press, which submitted a brief to the court along with 13 other news organizations, including The New York Times, said in a statement that it viewed the decision “as a victory for the news media and the public.” “The ruling upholds the traditional protections of the news media against competitors who would copy the gathered news and resell it in direct competition with the original news gatherer,” Andrew L. Deutsch, a lawyer who filed the brief on behalf of the companies. “It preserves the economic incentive to engage in news gathering.” Lawyers for Google and Twitter had argued that it was antiquated for a court to ban a Web site from immediately disseminating news. A Web site’s swift republishing of facts — whether a bank’s investment recommendation or a scoop from The New York Times — has become a firmly entrenched part of the news reporting ecosystem, they said. “This ruling acknowledges the reality of new media,” said Ms. Sullivan, the lawyer for the Internet companies. “Hot news goes cold in a nanosecond.” Theflyonthewall.com, a small outfit in Summit, N.J., has exploited this new reality. The site, which charges $65 a month and has thousands of subscribers, has called itself the “fastest news feed on the web” and ”a one-stop solution for accessing analyst’s comments.” In a statement, the company called the ruling ”a complete victory in its long-running battle with the investment firms.” Even though the ruling directly affects cases only in the Second Circuit — New York, Connecticut and Vermont — the decision by the influential court is expected to reverberate in cases across the country. Judge Sack is considered one of the country’s leading experts on copyright law, which could enhance the ruling’s influence. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruling in Banks v.

DealBook’s Susanne Craig and Adrienne Carter discuss why Wall Street is cutting back and what it means for earnings and stock prices.</text></article>

Faced with weak markets and uncertainty over regulations, many of the biggest firms are preparing for deep cuts in jobs and other costs. The cutback plans are emerging even as Wall Street firms have mostly recovered from the financial crisis and are reporting substantial profits again. But those profits are not as big as they were before the crisis, and it is expected that in the coming months it will be even more difficult for firms to make money. Worries about debt in Europe and the shape that the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul rules will ultimately take, combined with the usual summer doldrums, are prompting banks to act. “It’s a tense environment right now,” said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with the investment bank Nomura. Even Goldman Sachs, Wall Street’s most profitable firm, is retrenching. Senior executives at Goldman have concluded they need to cut 10 percent, or $1 billion, of noncompensation expenses over the next 12 months, according to a person close to the matter who was not authorized to speak on the record. The big pullback will cause Goldman employees, who have already been ordered to cut costs, to re-examine every aspect of their business. The firm, this person said, had not set final targets for layoffs, but Goldman was “certain” to shrink headcount in the coming months. Decisions on bonuses are still months away, but they are sure to come down as well if business does not pick up. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Bank of America is also examining its expenses and is likely in the next few months to cut some staff members from its securities division, according to one senior executive at that firm who was not authorized to speak on the record. And Credit Suisse is in the process of identifying people to cut in its investment banking unit, according to a person briefed on that bank’s plans. Morgan Stanley is expected to cut at least 300 low-producing brokers in its wealth management division this year, more than the firm initially expected, and has announced plans to cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses over the next three years. Unlike many of its rivals, however, the firm so far has no plans to cut staff members from its investment banking and trading division, which has added hundreds of employees over the last two years or so as part of a rebuilding effort after the financial crisis. Scott Eells/Bloomberg NewsIn the first quarter of 2009, Goldman Sachs, above, cut staff by almost 9 percent. Since then, most firms have held steady. That will change this summer. Some firms have already wielded the ax. In January, Barclays Capital cut 600 people, or more than 2 percent of its worldwide staff, citing a business slowdown, and recently cut more employees for “performance-related reasons,” according to a person briefed on the cuts but not authorized to speak on the record. A third of the January cuts were in New York. Regulatory overhaul has weighed on the decisions to cut back, senior bank executives say. Regulation has caused some Wall Street banks to exit some businesses, like proprietary trading. Rules that require banks to hold more capital will probably cause some firms to end certain business lines as they decide they can more effectively deploy the capital elsewhere. On products like derivatives, firms will lose revenue as instruments once traded off exchanges will move into open markets. While many financial rules are still to be written, some firms have decided that they cannot afford to wait any longer. The last significant industrywide job cuts were in early 2009. In the first quarter of that year Goldman alone cut its work force by almost 9 percent. Since then, most firms have held steady on their head counts or have added to them slightly. That will change this summer. The scale of the expected cuts is bad news for the New York City economy, which depends heavily on a booming financial industry to pay taxes and fill its restaurants. And they will come as the national economy is still struggling to find its footing since the financial crisis. Not all is doom and gloom. Wall Street is benefiting from the boom in social media and technology public offerings. In recent weeks big names like Pandora Media and Linkedin have gone public, brought to market by banks. So far this year, companies have raised $29.3 billion in public offerings, up more than 200 percent from a year ago. This year is on track to be the most lucrative since the technology boom in 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. The profit picture is also somewhat more stable for diversified companies like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, which have large commercial retail banking operations in addition to those in trading and sales. JPMorgan has no immediate plans to cut head count in trading, according to a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. The bank is, however, trying to reduce noncompensation expenses. But firms like Bank of America are still paying for mortgage sins of days gone by, which have dimmed their profit pictures. Earlier this year Bank of America put aside another $1 billion to cover claims from outside investors who lost money and want the firm to buy back billions of dollars in bad Countrywide Financial mortgages. The Durbin Amendment, a proposed restriction on debit card fees, is also expected to reduce profits when it comes into effect next month. For those firms that depend on trading, it is clear how much the engines of Wall Street have slowed. Return on equity, the amount a firm earns on its common stock outstanding and an important measure of financial performance, has decreased significantly in the years since the credit crisis. Industrywide return on equity was 8.2 percent in 2010, down from 17.5 percent in 2005, according to Nomura. And this year there is another reason that is prompting Wall Street to act more swiftly on cuts. Wall Street typically pays out roughly half of its revenue in compensation, and firms often wait until late summer to cull staff when they have a better sense of revenue for the year. The newest cuts are expected to come earlier this year because of recent changes in the way employees are paid. Traditionally, Wall Street employees get most of their annual pay in the form of a one-time year-end bonus. But after the credit crisis most firms changed the way they compensated employees in an effort to discourage excessive risk-taking, increasing base salaries while reducing performance-related payments. As a result, banks are paying out more compensation as the year goes on, forcing firms to re-evaluate staffing levels earlier in the year because more of their compensation costs are now fixed. Firms are also trying to cut noncompensation expenses and are looking for ways to cut fat. Goldman’s goal to cut $1 billion in noncompensation expenses this year is significant, analysts say. There will be immediate and significant savings from the fall off in trading volumes. Trading firms pay fees to trade, and lower volumes could result in an annual savings of $200 million at Goldman alone, one analyst estimated. Those savings will come naturally, but most will not, and banks will be forced to rein in everything, including travel and professional fees.</text></article>

With Pandora’s hot-performing stock debut, the New York Stock Exchange has been the host for 46 debuts raising $24.5 billion, compared with 30 I.P.O.’s raising $4.7 billion on Nasdaq, according to data from Thomson Reuters. And Pandora isn’t the only tech company to choose the Big Board, since both LinkedIn and Demand Media have also chosen to park their listings there. That’s a reversal from the last tech cycle. In 2000, the Nasdaq market had 389 initial offerings that raised $58.1 billion. That year, the New York Stock Exchange had just 38 I.P.O.’s that raised $43.9 billion. Pandora’s offering is also the latest feather in the cap of Morgan Stanley, one of the company’s three lead underwriters. The firm has now been a bookrunner on 31 I.P.O.’s that have raised about $4.3 billion in proceeds, giving the bank nearly 15 percent of the market. Morgan Stanley is also the apparent underwriter of choice for hot tech companies. The bank has been a bookrunner on 11 tech, media and telecom deals that have raised $1.6 billion so far this year. And its list of I.P.O. clients includes a who’s who of popular Internet players, including not only Pandora but also LinkedIn, Demand Media, Russia’s Yandex and China’s Renren.

In a filing released on Thursday afternoon, the firm disclosed that it had purchased 2,044,717 shares, or 22.7 percent, of the company’s Class A shares. Its asset management arm, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, owns the largest amount, roughly 21 percent. The remainder, 1.7 percent, likely resides in a trading account or is being held for another client. The firm purchased less than 5 percent at the I.P.O price of $45. The rest was bought in the public markets, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. So Morgan Stanley likely had to pay up for the stock. Shares of LinkedIn, which were priced at $45 a share for the I.P.O., more than doubled on their first day of trading. While they have since pulled back, the company is trading at $72 a share, way above its debut. Although Morgan Stanley’s exposure represents a large chunk of the company’s public float, its just a fraction of the business, which has two classes of stock. Morgan Stanley owns about 2 percent of LinkedIn’s overall shares.</text></article>

So far, three investment banks have landed the coveted role of underwriting the stock sale. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were listed on the top line of Groupon’s regulatory filing, signifying their presence as lead underwriters for the offering. The two firms have been dueling for big roles in bringing hot tech companies to market in this latest cycle. Morgan Stanley was a lead underwriter for the last hot debut, LinkedIn. Goldman led Demand Media’s offering and has reportedly made strong pitches to the likes of Facebook and Zynga for their expected public debuts. The third listed underwriter is Credit Suisse — which dominated during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s under the leadership of Frank P. Quattrone — so far has not had a huge presence in this cycle of technology I.P.O.’s.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/business/27foreclose.html?ref=morganstanley">Settlement on Military Foreclosures<date>Published: May 26, 2011</date><text>Two mortgage servicing companies have agreed to settle federal complaints that they wrongfully foreclosed on the homes of at least 178 military service members and to set aside a minimum of $22 million to compensate those victims.The Justice Department announced on Thursday that it had simultaneously filed and settled lawsuits against the two companies — a subsidiary of Bank of America formerly known as Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, and Saxon Mortgage Services, a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. The companies were accused of knowingly and repeatedly violating the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a federal law that extends an array of financial and legal protections to military personnel. Specifically, the companies were accused of ignoring a provision of the law that required them to get court orders before foreclosing on active-duty service members. Without admitting wrongdoing, the former Countrywide unit agreed to pay $20 million to approximately 160 victims of illegal foreclosures from January 2006 to May 2009. It also agreed to reimburse victims of any other illegal military foreclosures found to have occurred from May 2009 to the end of last year. Further, it promised to upgrade its training and report future violations of the civil relief act to the Justice Department. Although most of the improper foreclosures began before Bank of America acquired Countrywide, “it is our responsibility to make things right,” said Terry Laughlin, an executive vice president at the bank. He added, “These errors are not acceptable, and we certainly regret them.” According to Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil rights division, the Countrywide settlement is “easily the largest amount ever recovered“ by the Justice Department for violations of the civil relief act. Saxon was accused of illegally foreclosing on approximately 18 service members, “some of whom were severely injured in the line of duty or suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder,“ according to Mr. Perez. Without admitting wrongdoing, Saxon agreed to pay $2.35 million to victims of those foreclosures, made from January 2006 to May 2009. It also agreed to pay the victims of any subsequent wrongful military foreclosures, through the end of last year, and to upgrade its training programs. “First and foremost, we want to apologize to those military families that were affected by any mistakes made in the foreclosure process,” said Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley. “Our servicemen and women deserve the highest level of customer service.” He said that Saxon “has taken meaningful steps to ensure it has appropriate policies and procedures in place to comply fully” with the civil relief act. Both companies agreed to repair any damage their improper foreclosures had caused to the credit scores of the affected homeowners. There have been widely publicized violations of the civil relief act since well before January 2006, the starting date for these settlements. Indeed, the Saxon investigation was based on a complaint by Sgt. James B. Hurley, an Iraq veteran who lost his home in western Michigan in an improper foreclosure in 2005. Saxon and its co-defendant in that case, Deutsche Bank, reached a confidential out-of-court settlement with the Hurleys early this year. Mr. Perez said the 2006-9 period was chosen because it encompassed the sharp spike in national foreclosure activity that began in late 2006. The settlement terms expand that window to the end of 2010. The two mortgage companies have set up a direct hot line for service personnel who believe they are eligible for relief under the settlements. That number is (800) 896-7743, mailbox 6 for the former Countrywide unit and mailbox 995 for Saxon.Two mortgage servicing companies have agreed to settle federal complaints that they wrongfully foreclosed on the homes of at least 178 military service members and to set aside a minimum of $22 million to compensate those victims.</text></article>

He said he expected the rollout to be complete in about six months. Regulators, worried about investment scams, keep a close eye on what brokers and other Wall Street staffers are saying. As a result, Wall Street has been slow to embrace social media. Mr. Saperstein’s memo is below: I am excited to announce that MSSB will begin a staged roll-out for Advisors to use Social Media. We are the first major wealth management firm to announce a vendor solution for our Advisors to use key social networking sites to market themselves and share the firm’s intellectual content, while complying with regulatory requirements. Over the last few years, the emergence of Social Media has changed the way in which people communicate with each other, and companies interact with clients. MSSB is embracing how Social Media is changing communication and is at the forefront of the industry in how we are incorporating it into our business strategy. In the coming weeks, Morgan Stanley will implement a technology solution that will capture and retain all communications on approved social networking sites to comply with regulatory requirements. This technology will enable MSSB Advisors to fully leverage the power of social networking sites in a compliant way. In addition to the compliance component, we will also have a tool for Advisors to distribute Firm approved research and content, providing you with a powerful way to share our unique intellectual content with clients and prospects. You will have the ability, with the click of a button, to share pre-approved “status updates” or “tweets” with your social and professional networks.

This first group includes our Chairman’s Club members and many others who have been working with us for the past year to get to this solution. We expect to open it up to the rest of the Field within 6 months. For those participating in the initial roll-out, shortly you will receive an email from Lauren Boyman with more details on training and how to get started by getting your profiles approved. This roll-out will continue our recent history of innovative communications strategies, including being the first firm to introduce an internal social networking site for Financial Advisors (Advisor Insights) and the first to introduce texting capabilities. Also, building on this momentum, later this summer the GIC will present an iPad application that was recently piloted with positive feedback. The app brings GIC’s On The Markets to you in a digital and interactive format to help you engage with clients. MSSB is committed to continue leading our competition in innovation. This will be a significant competitive advantage. We look forward to getting your feedback as this very important initiative progresses.</text></article>

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/opinion/21nocera.html?ref=morganstanley">Was LinkedIn Scammed?<date>Published: May 20, 2011</date><text>If there’s one thing we’ve all learned in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it’s that stiffing your client is not a crime. Not if you’re an investment bank.Deutsche Bank, according to a recent report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sold its clients subprime mortgage bonds that one of its own traders at the time described as “pigs.” Goldman Sachs took unseemly advantage of unsuspecting clients to offload its most toxic assets in 2007 and 2008. During the subprime bubble, this kind of behavior was par for the course. It still is, apparently. On Thursday, LinkedIn, an Internet company that connects business professionals, became the first major American social media company to go public. The company had hired Morgan Stanley and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch division to manage the I.P.O. process. After gauging market demand — which is what they’re paid to do — the investment bankers priced the shares at $45. The 7.84 million shares it sold raised $352 million for the company. For this, the bankers were paid 7 percent of the deal as their fee. For a small company with less than $16 million in profits last year, $352 million in the bank sounds pretty wonderful, doesn’t it? But it really wasn’t wonderful at all. When LinkedIn’s shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, they opened not at $45, or anywhere near it. The opening price was $83 a share, some 84 percent higher than the I.P.O. price. By the time the clock had struck noon, the stock had vaulted to more than $120 a share, before settling down to $94.25 at the market’s close. The first-day gain was close to 110 percent. I have no doubt that most everyone at LinkedIn was thrilled to see the run-up; most executives at start-ups usually are. An I.P.O. is an important marker for any company. And, of course, the executives themselves are suddenly rich. But, in reality, LinkedIn was scammed by its bankers. The fact that the stock more than doubled on its first day of trading — something the investment bankers, with their fingers on the pulse of the market, absolutely must have known would happen — means that hundreds of millions of additional dollars that should have gone to LinkedIn wound up in the hands of investors that Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch wanted to do favors for. Most of those investors, I guarantee, sold the stock during the morning run-up. It’s the easiest money you can make on Wall Street. As Eric Tilenius, the general manager of Zynga, wrote on Facebook: “A huge opening-day pop is not a sign of a successful I.P.O., but rather a massively mispriced one. Bankers are rewarding their friends and themselves instead of doing their fiduciary duty to their clients.” There is nothing wrong with a small “pop” in the aftermath of an I.P.O.; investors, after all, don’t want to buy a stock that is going to go down immediately. But during the Internet bubble of the 1990s, the phenomenon of investment bankers wildly underpricing I.P.O.’s so that money could be diverted to favored investors got completely out of hand — stocks would sometimes rise 500 percent on the first day. It was obscene. Indeed, most business journalists writing about the LinkedIn deal focused on the first-day run-up as evidence that we’ve entered another Internet bubble. But over at the Business Insider blog, Henry Blodget — who knows a thing or two about bad behavior on Wall Street — had the perfect analogy for what the banks had done to LinkedIn. Suppose, he wrote, your trusted real estate agent persuaded you to sell your house for $1 million. Then, the next day, the same agent sold the same house for the new owner for $2 million. “How would you feel if your agent did that?” he asked. That, he concluded, is what Merrill and Morgan did to LinkedIn. It’s worth remembering that most of the young Internet companies with those eye-popping I.P.O.’s back in the day are long gone. With their flawed business models, maybe they were doomed from the start — but the cash they left on the table at the I.P.O. might have allowed at least a few of them to survive. Similarly, LinkedIn is still a fragile enterprise. Its business model remains unproved. It is going to have to grow awfully fast to justify its stock price. Its executives may yet rue the day they let themselves be sold down the river by their investment bankers. LinkedIn is supposed to be the client, but it was treated like the mark. Ever since the financial crisis, investment bankers have been constantly questioned about whether they have any larger social purpose besides making money. What they invariably say is that they play a critical role in capital formation, meaning that they help companies raise the money they need to grow and prosper. The LinkedIn deal suggests something darker. The crisis hasn’t changed them a bit. They’re still just in it for themselves.If there’s one thing we’ve all learned in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it’s that stiffing your client is not a crime. Not if you’re an investment bank.</text></article>

More immediately, a growing number of companies have taken it upon themselves to make life a little more equal for their gay employees.These companies are reaching into their own pockets to pay for an extra tax that their gay employees owe on their partners’ health insurance — something that their married heterosexual co-workers don’t have to worry about because the federal government recognizes them as an economic unit. To gay employees, gaining equal benefits is about more than the money. The gesture itself validates their relationship with their partners at a time when the government has not. Most heterosexuals take for granted that they can add a spouse or children to their employer’s health plan. But gay employees with partners have that option only if they work for an organization that offers domestic partner coverage. And even when the coverage is available, it costs gay couples more because they are taxed on the value of those benefits. Over the last year, however, as the word has gotten out about this inequity, more companies have begun to “gross up” these workers, as the policy is known. “It very quickly became a litmus test among employees for how welcoming their firm was,” said Daryl Herrschaft, director of the workplace project at the Human Rights Campaign. “A lot of folks were very proud of their companies and wanted to tell a lot of people, and in doing so, it sparked some competition.” The competition has become most apparent in a handful of industries, notably law firms, big consulting companies and in Silicon Valley. More Wall Street firms, meanwhile, are said to be considering the policy. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, the New York law firm, is the latest firm to follow suit. And Teach for America, the nonprofit teaching program, adopted the policy earlier this month after initially learning about it on Bucks, the personal finance blog on The New York Times Web site, which has been singling out the companies that gross up and those that do not — the New York Times Company among them. “We realized that it was the right thing to do and we were in a position to do it, so we did,” said Rex Varner, vice president on the human assets team at Teach for America. A small number of organizations, including Kimpton Hotels and Cisco, have had the policy in place for several years. But it wasn’t until Google started compensating its employees last June that the movement really began to take off. Apple, Facebook, Barclays, McKinsey and Bain &amp; Company are some of the prominent names that followed suit. Even more companies have said they publicly support same-sex marriage or equal financial treatment for gay couples, but they haven’t gone as far as adopting the policy. About 58 percent of Fortune 500 companies extend domestic partner coverage to employees with same-sex partners, according to the Human Rights Campaign. But when you look at a broader group of companies, the numbers shrink: Only about 36 percent of large companies, or those with more than 200 workers, offered the coverage in 2009, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. About 20 percent of small companies offered the coverage. Even as the number of companies that “gross up” increases, they remain a distinct minority. (The online version of this column links to our running list of companies.) In fact, a large group of major corporations joined a coalition, led by the Human Rights Campaign, that supported legislation to eliminate the tax, but most of them don’t gross up their own employees. Another group of prominent business leaders recently signed an open letter urging New York lawmakers to legalize same-sex marriage, arguing that it would help attract and retain talent. But not everyone on that list, including Lloyd A. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, for instance, has started to gross up employees within their own offices. That would also, arguably, help attract and retain talent. Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley (whose board chairman, John J. Mack, also signed the letter) said they were reviewing their policies. So we’ll see what happens. One of the biggest obstacles to adopting the gross up policy has been concern about the cost and legal implications. Will people rush to sign up? Many firms, for instance, decided to make only same-sex employees with domestic partners eligible since opposite-sex couples have the option to marry. “To spend money to make up for the inequities for our government and our governmental policies is a very significant thing,” said Ross Levi, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay rights organization in New York. “Companies shouldn’t have to be making up for the ways that government is failing its L.G.B.T. people and our families,” he added, referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. That said, he added that the private sector had historically “led government in terms of equality for L.G.B.T. people.” Generally, it would cost an employer about $2,000 to $2,500 to gross up an employee who incurred extra taxes of $1,200 to $1,500, according to Joseph S. Adams, a partner at McDermott Will &amp; Emery who specializes in employee benefits. The numbers will vary depending on several factors, including the employee’s tax bracket and state of residence. This example assumes a 25 percent federal tax bracket (and includes rough estimates for state, local, and employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare, bringing the total tax rate to about 40 percent). On average, a typical employee with a domestic partner will pay about $1,069 more a year in taxes than a married employee with the same coverage, according to a 2007 report by Lee Badgett, research director of the Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation policy issues. (That figure, which is bound to be higher now given escalating health care costs, includes taxes on the benefit itself as well as the money employees would save if they could pay for their benefits using pretax dollars like heterosexual employees can. There is an exception: If the partner is considered a dependent, the extra taxes aren’t levied.) At Barclays, which began compensating gay employees at the beginning of the year, the team working on the policy considered how it might affect their expenses. But when Barclays looked at the numbers, they concluded the cost was “not material.” And, in any case, they said it was the right thing to do. “Too often people come with ideas requiring creativity and people start explaining obstacles about why you can’t do it,” said Jeffrey G. Davis, managing director and co-chairman of Barclays’ L.G.B.T. employee group. So they worked with their human resources department to find ways to make it as simple as possible. Instead of reimbursing employees in every paycheck, for instance, they provide a lump sum at the end of the year. His advice to others who want to lobby their own employers is to “anticipate peoples’ concerns and questions before you go to them for approval, so you have the right answers.” “That is the biggest part of the effort,” he said. The Human Rights Campaign has materials on its Web site to help guide employees and their companies through the process, too. With more companies adopting the more generous policy, others are now looking at whether they’re offering the basics for gay employees. As Cynthia Yeung, a San Francisco resident who is on the steering committee of her employer’s L.G.B.T. group, put it, “When you raise the bar, everyone has to jump a little higher to be average.”The battle to legalize same-sex marriage may be dominating the headlines, but that issue could take years to resolve. More immediately, a growing number of companies have taken it upon themselves to make life a little more equal for their gay employees.</text></article>

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/business/17bank.html?ref=morganstanley">N.Y. State Investigates Banks’ Role in Fiscal Crisis<date>Published: May 16, 2011</date><text>The New York attorney general has requested information and documents in recent weeks from three major Wall Street banks about their mortgage securities operations during the credit boom, indicating the existence of a new investigation into practices that contributed to billions in mortgage losses.Officials in Eric T. Schneiderman’s office have also requested meetings with representatives from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. The inquiry appears to be quite broad, with the attorney general’s requests for information covering many aspects of the banks’ loan pooling operations. They bundled thousands of home loans into securities that were then sold to investors such as pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies. It is unclear which parts of the byzantine securitization process Mr. Schneiderman is focusing on. His spokesman said the attorney general would not comment on the investigation, which is in its early stages. Several civil suits have been filed by federal and state regulators since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, some of which have generated settlements and fines, most prominently a $550 million deal between Goldman Sachs and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But even more questions have been raised in private lawsuits filed against the banks by investors and others who say they were victimized by questionable securitization practices. Some litigants have contended, for example, that the banks dumped loans they knew to be troubled into securities and then misled investors about the quality of those underlying mortgages when selling the investments. The possibility has also been raised that the banks did not disclose to mortgage insurers the risks in the instruments they were agreeing to insure against default. Another potential area of inquiry — the billions of dollars in credit extended by Wall Street to aggressive mortgage lenders that allowed them to continue making questionable loans far longer than they otherwise could have done. “Part of what prosecutors have the advantage of doing right now, here as elsewhere, is watching the civil suits play out as different parties fight over who bears the loss,” said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia. “That’s a very productive source of information.” Officials at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs declined to comment about the investigation; Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment. During the mortgage boom, Wall Street firms bundled hundreds of billions of dollars in home loans into securities that they sold profitably to investors. After the real estate bubble burst, the perception took hold that the securitization process as performed by the major investment banks contributed to the losses generated in the crisis. Critics contend that Wall Street’s securitization machine masked the existence of risky home loans and encouraged reckless lending because pooling the loans and selling them off allowed many participants to avoid responsibility for the losses that followed. The requests for information by Mr. Schneiderman’s office also seem to confirm that the New York attorney general is operating independently of peers from other states who are negotiating a broad settlement with large banks over foreclosure practices. By opening a new inquiry into bank practices, Mr. Schneiderman has indicated his unwillingness to accept one of the settlement’s terms proposed by financial institutions — that is, a broad agreement by regulators not to conduct additional investigations into the banks’ activities during the mortgage crisis. Mr. Schneiderman has said in recent weeks that signing such a release was unacceptable. It is unclear whether Mr. Schneiderman’s investigation will be pursued as a criminal or civil matter. In the last few months, the office’s staff has been expanding. In March, Marc B. Minor, former head of the securities division for the New Jersey attorney general, was named bureau chief of the investor protection unit in the New York attorney general’s office. Early in the financial crisis, Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York who preceded Mr. Schneiderman as attorney general, began investigating Wall Street’s role in the debacle. But those inquiries did not result in any cases filed against the major banks. Nevertheless, some material turned over to Mr. Cuomo’s investigators may turn out to be helpful to Mr. Schneiderman’s inquiry.The New York attorney general has requested information and documents in recent weeks from three major Wall Street banks about their mortgage securities operations during the credit boom, indicating the existence of a new investigation into practices that contributed to billions in mortgage losses.</text></article>

Guru Linda Robinson Joins BlackRock<date>May 16, 2011, 4:58 pm</date><text>After 25 years with her public relations firm, Robinson Lerer &amp; Montgomery, Linda G. Robinson has left to join BlackRock as a senior managing director and the global head of marketing and communications. Ms. Robinson, a prominent fixture on Wall Street, has been a close adviser to several corporate chiefs on their communication strategy. Morgan Stanley‘s chairman, John J. Mack, has long been a client. She is no stranger to BlackRock. Ms. Robinson has been a director on the firm’s board since 2004 and has a long relationship with the firm’s chief executive, Laurence D. Fink. With her new role, she will step down from her board seat, according to an internal BlackRock memo obtained by DealBook. Ms. Robinson’s appointment is part of a bigger push by Mr. Fink to elevate the presence of the firm in the wake of BlackRock’s 2009 merger with Barclays Global Investors “After 25 years I have worked on the most interesting issues facing companies and Wall Street, and I want opportunity to work on one project and focus on it long-term,” Ms. Robinson said. Revolving Door View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink In the letter, BlackRock also announced that Jim Badenhausen, a partner at R.L.M., will join BlackRock as a managing director and global head of corporate communications. “As a director and a consultant to the company, Linda has long been a valued adviser to me and other senior leaders at BlackRock,” Mr. Fink wrote in the letter. “In her new role, Linda will have overall responsibility for enterprise marketing, media relations, internal communications and executive communications, and she will be working in close partnership with investor relations, government relations and philanthropy.” Ms. Robinson founded R.L.M. in 1986 with Walter Montgomery, the firm’s chief executive. The firm, which is based in Manhattan and was later acquired by the Young &amp; Rubicam Group in 2000, specializes in strategic communications services for a wide range of corporations and organizations, including banks, law firms, universities and nonprofit organizations. Before founding R.L.M., Ms. Robinson, a graduate of the University of Southern California, was a senior vice president at Warner Cable Communications and the director of public affairs for the Department of Transportation. Ms. Robinson makes an appearance in “Barbarians at the Gate,” the best-selling book on the 1988 takeover battle for RJR Nabisco. “Linda Robinson was no ordinary flak,” the book’s authors, Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, wrote of her role. In an e-mail to friends and colleagues, Ms. Robinson heaped praise on her co-workers and said the move to BlackRock “was a very difficult decision – indeed, one of the most difficult I’ve ever made.” She added, “At BlackRock, we will continue to partner with –and rely upon – R.L.M. and its talented team, and I know the bonds of friendship will endure as well.” Here is a copy of Mr. Fink’s announcement: As BlackRock continues to enhance the management of our brand and reputation and all of our external and internal communications, I am pleased to announce that Linda Robinson, a visionary in the field of communications and a BlackRock Director since 2004, will become Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Marketing and Communications. As a Director and a consultant to the company, Linda has long been a valued adviser to me and other senior leaders at BlackRock. In her new role, Linda will have overall responsibility for enterprise marketing, media relations, internal communications and executive communications, and she will be working in close partnership with investor relations, government relations and philanthropy. Linda will serve on the Global Executive Committee and report to me. As she assumes this new executive role, Linda will step down from the BlackRock Board with deep gratitude from her fellow Board members for the many contributions she has made as a director. Since founding her strategic communications firm, Robinson Lerer &amp; Montgomery (RLM), in 1986, Linda has provided strategic counsel to hundreds of leading corporations around the world. She has been highly sought after by corporate boards, CEOs and other senior managers to help guide them through some of the most significant business challenges and opportunities of recent times. These global business leaders have long valued Linda as a strategic adviser because of her superb judgment, high level of integrity and the passion and commitment that she brings to everything she does. And, after working on a wide range of situations over the past 25 years, I believe BlackRock will benefit greatly from Linda focusing her energy, creativity and insight on just one company – our company – over a sustained period of time, particularly as we continue to build the BlackRock brand in the marketplace. I also am pleased to announce that Jim Badenhausen will join BlackRock as a Managing Director and Global Head of Corporate Communications, managing media relations and internal communications, reporting to Linda. Jim is a Partner at RLM, where he has advised a wide range of companies in financial services and other industries since 1997 – including our team here at BlackRock. He previously spent a decade as a communications advisor for government and political organizations. Finally, I am pleased to announce the addition of another experienced communications executive – Craig Brown – to the BlackRock team. Craig will join the firm as a Director and will be working closely with both Linda and Jim as we look to build out and enhance our communications and marketing organization. Linda, Jim and Craig will assume their new roles with the Firm in June. Their partnership with our marketing and communications professionals is longstanding and will facilitate their transition. In particular, they will continue to work closely with Bobbie Collins, who coordinates our global media relations team, and Lance Berg, who shifted his focus at the beginning of the year to coordination of our global internal communications efforts. Dick Davis will continue to support the communications team prior to Linda and Jim’s arrival at the Firm. In addition, Linda has been working closely with our extremely talented branding and marketing professionals on the evolution of our global brand. Grace Sette, who previously announced she is leaving the firm at the end of July, will work on this important brand initiative through her transition, and Pete Boland and Rick Andrews will continue to take the work forward under Linda’s leadership. I have been outspoken within the firm and publicly about the importance of building our global brand, investing in our marketing and communications efforts, and constantly challenging ourselves to achieve a new level of excellence. Today’s announcement reaffirms that commitment. Please join me in welcoming Linda, Jim and Craig to the Firm. Here is a copy of Ms. Robinson’s personal memo: Earlier today, I told you with a heart full of admiration and respect how truly blessed I’ve been over the last 25 years – working with the smartest, most dedicated group of people imaginable doing work I dearly love. Back in 1986, when we set out to launch a new kind of communications consultancy, Walter and I knew that the key to long-term success was assembling a world-class team of professionals. When I look back over everything we’ve done since then, the thing I’m most proud of is the quality of the people who have joined – and helped to build – this Firm. And the thing I will take with me – and treasure most – is how special they have been – both as colleagues and as friends. I know, and you know, that RLM today is the finest collection of communications talent in the world. The quality of the work you deliver day in and day out, the sacrifices you make for our clients, and the passion and character that guide all that you do – they are truly unsurpassed. All that and more is what has earned RLM the sterling reputation it enjoys in the marketplace today. Since the Firm was launched, we’ve enjoyed strong growth and profitability, particularly so in the past decade while so many of you have been here. Even more important, the quality and consistency of our work, the breadth of our clients, and the caliber of our people are as strong as they’ve ever been. Building on Our Success with the Same “DNA” In business, as in life, however, change is inevitable – especially after 25 years. Indeed, change is healthy in any organization. It opens the way for new ideas and new leaders to emerge. It creates new opportunities for growth and creativity, and a new level of success. And I believe now – when RLM is strong, when the organization is thriving and when the bench of talent is deep – is the best possible time for a transition like this. Walter has been a spectacular leader, a trusted counselor and a valued partner and friend throughout the past 25 years. As CEO, he has helped grow our business and nurture our client relationships, while always exhibiting the integrity, superb judgment, and tireless work ethic that have come to define the RLM “DNA” – in large part because they are in Walter’s own. He has been the steady hand – the rock on which RLM has been built – driving the Firm forward and helping define its unique culture. He’s made sure this team has always delivered top-quality work – and exceeded our clients’ expectations. He’s nurtured the strategic, analytical approach and original thinking that have marked our work, and always driven a painstaking – dare I say “neurotic” – attention to detail that has served our clients so well. Walter has earned a reputation across corporate America as a trusted confidant to Boards and CEOs, and as a man of enormous generosity and humanity. And that reputation is so very well-deserved. Closer to home, he’s also been a mentor and friend to so many colleagues over the years – and he continues to be that today. I feel deeply fortunate to have had the chance to work with and learn from Walter these many years – and lucky that I will continue to benefit from his wisdom and insight in the years to come. As more and more of you have assumed leadership roles across the Firm, I’ve also been able to see the future of RLM. I have no doubt that with continued leadership from Walter and Michael, as well as the entire senior leadership team, RLM will thrive and grow in the years ahead. From Many, Valued Clients… to Just One During my time at RLM, I’ve literally worked with hundreds of companies – indeed sometimes it seemed like dozens in a single week. That’s been wonderful and given me the opportunity to work on every conceivable type of situation. But now I want to focus on helping just one company – concentrating my time, attention and energies on a single mission and seeing initiatives through a sustained period of time. In recent years, I’ve been fortunate to serve on the board of BlackRock and also work with them as a client. It is a company I have come to know well, led by people for whom I have great respect, and I’ve accepted an opportunity to join BlackRock as Global Head of Marketing and Communications. While BlackRock is a wonderful and truly unique organization with an unparalleled reputation worldwide, this was a very difficult decision – indeed, one of the most difficult I’ve ever made. For me, RLM has been more than just a job – it has been my life and family. This change, though, is made easier knowing that we will continue to work together in the years ahead. At BlackRock, we will continue to partner with –and rely upon – RLM and its talented team, and I know the bonds of friendship will endure as well. * * * What we have built together at RLM is truly unique – I hear it again and again from the clients and others with whom we work. We have truly earned the trust of our clients – which is no small thing – and we have built a culture of mutual commitment – one where people make tremendous sacrifices to always go the extra mile for our clients . . . and for one another. The past 25 years have been an amazing journey. I am deeply grateful to each of you for the chance to share it with you and for all you’ve done to make it a success. I look forward to continuing to work with you all in my new role. And, I have no doubt whatsoever that each of you will continue to enjoy many more successes in the years to come. With devotion and continued admiration,</text></article>

The European officials are looking at whether banks, including Barclays and Goldman Sachs, have harmed rival organizations that could compete in markets for providing information and clearing a form of transaction that had become critical to the smooth functioning of the entire economy. “Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive behavior and facilitate violations of competition rules,” the European Union antitrust commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said in a statement. “I hope our investigation will contribute to a better functioning of financial markets and, therefore, to more sustainable recovery.” The inquiry follows an examination of that market last year by The New York Times that highlighted efforts by banks like JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and others to control access to the derivatives market, even as global regulators try to bring transparency and safety to a murky corner of the financial world. Derivatives — instruments that shift risk from one party to another — added to the panic during the financial crisis, because banks and regulators did not know all the parties involved in trillions of dollars of interweaving contracts. The roughly $600 trillion market is controlled by a small number of players, concentration that has raised competition concerns in recent years. Those banks have recently taken many steps to try to hold on to their advantages in the market, even as regulators have tried to exert greater control over the market. The European Commission inquiry is focused on one type of derivative known as a credit default swap, which is essentially an insurance contract. They are widely used in stock investing and mortgage investing, when an investor wants to bet against a company’s bond or a mortgage bond. They are frequently used as a measure of the credit worthiness of companies and governments and have become a crucial component in gauging borrowing costs. The commission has previously estimated the value of all the positions on the market for credit default swaps to be $21.5 trillion, with about $3.27 trillion of that amount representing position on the market for credit default swaps in sovereign debt. The banks are involved in two crucial components of the market for credit default swaps. Sixteen of the banks are shareholders in Markit, a London-based organization that is the leading provider information on the market for credit default swaps. European Union officials suspect that the banks’ arrangements with Markit could effectively lock out other data providers. Nine of the banks involved also have a financial relationship with the IntercontinentalExchange, a public company that owns ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear U.S. That company is involved in a new business area known as clearing — which regulators are promoting as a way to bring more safety to the derivatives market. The banks had been creating their own effort to clear derivatives through a company they owned called the Clearing Corporation. In 2008, they sold that company to ICE, which was developing its own business. In exchange, ICE allowed the banks to influence the way the clearing business was set up and also granted them multiyear price breaks on clearing fees. Critics say the banks worked with ICE to create rules and practices that were anticompetitive, like membership rules that for a while blocked other brokers from signing up to do business there. Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for Mr. Almunia, said that officials began the investigation without receiving formal complaints from competitors but said wrongdoing would be “obviously harming other players in the market.” ThomsonReuters, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Bloomberg are among companies that could compete with Markit provide information on trading credit default swaps. Eurex and L.C.H. Clearnet are among the companies that also provide clearing services for credit default swaps. The derivatives market has exploded in size since the 1990s as more companies and investors looked for ways to take positions in commodities, corporate defaults, mortgages and other assets without having to purchase actual goods. Derivatives allow one party — usually a bank — to give customers exposure to price changes in goods through a written agreement to pay based on changing prices. The Justice Department has also been investigating this market and told The Times in December that its inquiry was focused on “the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries.” The Justice Department began its investigation of Markit in the summer of 2009, and by last fall it had expanded into looking at clearing practices between companies like ICE and the banks. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange also has a clearing house business and has partnered with the banks to develop it. The European Commission was in frequent contact with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission about the investigations announced on Friday, but it had received no indications that their United States counterparts were still actively pursuing similar investigations, said European Union officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak publicly. The European Commission’s investigation may increase the pressure on the Department of Justice to take action. European regulators could fine the banks involved in the case up to 10 percent of their global annual sales for the kinds of antitrust and cartel violations that officials are investigating in Europe. Even so, the commission may find other ways to inject greater competition into the market. The commission has increasingly favored settling major investigations to win quicker results, and it could waive fines if the banks agreed to adjust their contracts with Markit and ICE Europe. The banks named in the investigation are JPMorgan, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Crédit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Wells Fargo, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale. All of these banks declined to comment or did not return an inquiry. The IntercontinentalExchange did not reply to a request to comment. Markit issued a statement defending its actions. The company said it “has no exclusive arrangements with any data provider and makes its data and related products widely available to global market participants.” It said it was “unaware of any collusion by other market participants as described by the commission.”</text></article>

Mr. Topper, a Columbia Business School graduate, will be based in Palo Alto, Calif. “This is an exciting period of activity in the technology sector and we are pleased to welcome Ethan who is an outstanding banker with deep relationships throughout Silicon Valley,” Mark Shafir, co-head of Citigroup’s global technology media &amp; telecom banking group, said in a statement. “We look forward to Ethan leveraging his experience to deliver the full range of our institutional platform to technology clients across the industry.” Prior to Union Square Advisors, Mr. Topper was the head of Credit Suisse‘s global technology mergers and acquisitions group. He also held technology banking roles at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Technology Group and Morgan Stanley. The move comes as deal-making picks up in Silicon Valley. Since the start of this year, the sector has welcomed several multibillion dollar transactions, including the announcement of AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile. The growing exuberance for technology companies — further underscored by rising valuations for social Web businesses, like Groupon and Facebook — has encouraged Wall Street banks to strengthen their ties to the region. Last year, Citigroup hired a veteran technology banker, Paul Phillips, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, “As the technology sector continues to grow and evolve, we are committed to meeting all the needs of our clients and having a banker of Ethan’s caliber and experience to partner with our existing tech team demonstrates that we’ve got the best talent in place to execute on behalf of our clients,” Ben Druskin, co-head of the global technology media &amp; telecom banking group, said in statement.</text></article>

In a prospectus filed on Thursday, the Moscow-based Yandex, the country’s most popular search portal, said it hoped to raise $1 billion, a target used to determine fees. The company plans to list its shares on Nasdaq. Started in 1997, Yandex is a giant in Russia’s emerging technology market. The company, which also operates in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, enjoys a comfortable lead in the region. Last year, Yandex generated about 64 percent of all search traffic in Russia and it led the country’s Internet sector by revenue, with $439.7 million, according to its filing. Yandex recorded net income of $134.3 million for 2010. Like its United States counterpart, Google, the bulk of its revenue come from online advertising. Yandex’s filing, comes as several Internet leaders prepare to test the public markets. The social shopping site Groupon is said to be considering an offering later this year, according to people close to the company, who were not authorized to speak because talks are private. Facebook, the sprawling social network, is expected to pursue an I.P.O. in 2012. “Yandex will be in extremely high demand given its comparison to the likes of Google, in the United States, and Baidu.com, in China,” said Paul Bard, vice president of research at Renaissance Capital. “Investors are very interested in Internet leaders in large, under penetrated markets, and Yandex certainly fits the bill.” Based on Yandex’s current financial figures, Mr. Bard says the company’s initial valuation could “easily be set at $4-$5 billion and could be as high as $7-$8 billion.” If Yandex raises more than $1 billion in its I.P.O., it would be the largest Internet offering since Google’s debut in 2004 (a $1.7 billion offering). Yandex originally filed to go public in 2008, but the company postponed it plans amid turmoil in the financial markets. According to Thursday’s filing, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank Securities and Goldman Sachs will act as lead underwriters for the deal. Yandex’s major investors include the hedge fund Tiger Global Management and Baring Vostok Private Equity Funds.</text></article>

Chesapeake Energy’s fluid spill in Pennsylvania looks minor compared with BP’s Gulf of Mexico explosion a year ago. All the same, the spill will galvanize critics of hydraulic fracturing, a process that releases natural gas from shale rock by blasting it with water, sand and chemicals. Deepwater oil, coal and nuclear operations all have had recent disasters, and with Earth Day on Friday, now is a good time for renewable energy firms.In April 2010, an explosion in one of Massey Energy’s coal mines killed 29 workers. Just weeks later, BP’s Macondo well started gushing millions of barrels of oil into the gulf. And more than a month after Japan’s large earthquake, the Fukushima nuclear plant is still leaking radiation. This week’s blowout and spill in Bradford County, Pa., puts the latest technique to extract natural gas under scrutiny, too. With thousands of wells now being drilled in the United States and big plans unfolding around the world, this is unlikely to be the last time frackers stumble. And it gives proponents of greener energy a public relations opening. Natural gas has become an unexpected nemesis of wind and solar energy in recent years. Low gas prices have made renewable projects look even more expensive than they seemed before. In addition to the image-enhancement opportunity, renewable energy firms can also finally showcase projects with enough scale to rival fossil fuel burners and nuclear reactors. The Shepherds Flat wind project under construction in Oregon will create 850 megawatts of capacity, close to the output of a typical atomic reactor. First Solar, a $12 billion energy company, is building a 550-megawatt plant in California. Renewable energy still has a mountain to climb. In America, for instance, wind and solar power still provide just 1.4 percent of the nation’s total energy diet. And although alternative sources are becoming cheaper, in many cases they still need subsidies. With belt-tightening happening in governments everywhere, that kind of help is under threat. But with the full range of traditional energy sources now on the defensive, wind and solar power producers have a chance to seize an opportunity. Narrower Margin Chalk one up for Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James P. Gorman. Persuading Mitsubishi UFJ to convert $7.8 billion of preferred stock into common shares early will save his bank almost $800 million a year in dividend payments and lift its common equity. It’s a smart and opportunistic move to offload the expensive capital that saved the Wall Street firm during in the 2008 crisis. Of course, Morgan Stanley’s deal with its Japanese partner isn’t all good. Increasing the capital base makes it harder to reach a mid-teens return on equity, the bank’s target, especially after managing only about a 6 percent return in the first quarter. Not having to pay Mitsubishi dividends will make up only about half the extra earnings needed to post a 16.5 percent return with the extra capital — and to sustain it across the cycle. That’s a distant prospect either way, even if Morgan Stanley is making progress. Its advisory and underwriting units are performing well and its trading operation posted its best quarter since the crisis. But there’s a long way to go. The pretax margin in wealth management, 10 percent, is slightly better than what it was for all of 2010, but it’s still half of Mr. Gorman’s target. Even the beleaguered fixed-income trading unit looks better. Revenue more than doubled from the fourth quarter, after stripping out the effect of accounting rules on its own liabilities. But there’s still no tangible evidence that Morgan Stanley is making enough headway to improve its market share from 6.5 percent among the top nine players to the 8 percent the management wants to achieve within a year. Mr. Gorman, who will be under growing pressure to improve the bank’s performance in his second year on the job, could decide to put some of the additional equity into trading in hopes of increasing returns. Or he could lobby the Federal Reserve to allow his firm to buy back some of the extra capital. Neither step is a sure thing. For now, the Mitsubishi deal leaves the chief executive’s recovery plan with less margin for error.

Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, received some bad news earlier this year. A joint venture controlled by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial in Japan was facing huge losses, which would drag down earnings at the American investment bank. But Mr. Gorman used the situation as leverage, striking a deal that frees Morgan Stanley from paying roughly $800 million a year to Mitsubishi, the costly overhang of a cash infusion made during the financial crisis. Announced on Thursday, the agreement between the two banks removes a major financial burden on Morgan Stanley, which at the same time reported that first-quarter profit declined 48 percent from the period in the previous year. It also was a personal victory for Mr. Gorman, who has struggled to turn around Morgan Stanley since becoming chief executive in January 2010. In an internal note to employees, Mr. Gorman, 52, called the deal a ''signature event'' for the firm. Under the terms of the transaction, Mitsubishi will trade most of its convertible preferred stock in Morgan Stanley for common stock. Once completed, Mitsubishi UFJ will own 385 million common shares, or roughly 10 percent of the company. The agreement requires approval from shareholders and regulators. Although the firm still faces major obstacles in its recovery, investors welcomed the deal. Shares of Morgan Stanley closed at $26.48, up 1.69 percent, on Thursday. Morgan Stanley reached out to Mitsubishi for a $9 billion lifeline during the depths of the crisis in 2008. In exchange for the money, the investment bank agreed to make quarterly dividend payments of roughly $200 million on Mitsubishi's stake. The firm was required to do so until the stock hit $37.875 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading sessions - or until the two banks reached a new agreement. With the stock languishing below that target, Morgan Stanley insiders worried it could take years to reach that level. For months, the Mitsubishi stake has been a source of aggravation for Mr. Gorman, who had inherited several headaches, some of which he dealt with by shedding nonessential divisions. At a staff meeting in January, the chief executive expressed his frustration about the dividend payment. In response to questions about bonuses, he told employees that the firm needed to show restraint on compensation in part to appease shareholders and get the stock price up - generating an automatic end to the Mitsubishi payment. When the news of the joint venture troubles crossed his desk around the same time, Mr. Gorman moved to use the information to his advantage. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, who worked with Mr. Gorman and other senior Morgan executives on the latest deal, said the losses ''took a logical discussion to the finish line.'' The parties were also cognizant that Goldman Sachs was moving to pay back a $5 billion crisis investment from Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which was completed this week. In late March, Mr. Gorman flew to Japan to meet with executives of Mitsubishi and they reached an accord not long after. Morgan Stanley's board voted to approve the pact this week. The directors also met to review the firm's first-quarter earnings, which Morgan Stanley released Thursday. Morgan Stanley posted a profit of $736 million, compared with $1.41 billion a year earlier. The results included a pretax loss of $655 million from the Mitsubishi joint venture. The firm's quarterly profit of 50 cents a share beat analysts' expectations of 35 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Net revenue was $7.6 billion for the quarter, compared with $9.1 billion a year ago. Although the Mitsubishi deal removes one obstacle to Morgan Stanley's prospects, the firm still has plenty of work left on its turnaround, as it contends with a sluggish economic environment and a more restrictive regulatory regime. Its fixed-income and commodities division posted revenue of $1.77 billion, down 35 percent from year-ago levels. Asset management posted net revenue of $626 million, down 4 percent. ''We made clear progress increasing client share and this translated to financial performance. We have seen the benefits of our investments in hiring and the leadership as we execute across our businesses,'' he said.

Under the terms of the deal, Mitsubishi UFJ will exchange most of its convertible preferred stock in Morgan Stanley for common stock. But the new agreement comes at a price for shareholders. Once completed, Mitsubishi UFJ would own 385 million common shares of Morgan Stanley, meaning that in this latest agreement it is extracting an additional 75 million shares, valued today at roughly $2 billion. In the end, Mitsubishi UFJ will own 22.4 percent of Morgan Stanley and will gain an extra board seat. The Japanese bank will also hold on to a small amount of convertible preferred stock, with an annual dividend of $50 million. Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, said the conversion was the right move for Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ, calling it “a testament to the strength of our unique relationship that we were able to capitalize on this opportunity to reach an agreement in the best interests of both companies.” Morgan Stanley struck the original deal in the darkest days of the crisis, with Mitsubishi UFJ providing a $9 billion cash infusion in exchange for convertible preferred stock. But the dividend on the stake, roughly $800 million a year, proved to be a drag on Morgan Stanley’s earnings. Morgan Stanley had to keep making the payments until the terms of the deal were changed or its stock traded above $37.875 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading sessions. At the current level, shares of Morgan Stanley would have had to appreciate by roughly 40 percent to trigger that condition. Mr. Gorman said the conversion would result in an industry-leading capital position for Morgan Stanley. In a separate note to employees, Mr. Gorman said the repayment was a “signature event” for the firm. “It will eliminate roughly $800 million in annual dividend payments on these preferred shares and boost our earnings power,” he said. Still, the conversion will most likely hurt the firm’s return on equity, an important measure of profitability. It will also dilute current shareholders, who have been losing patience because Morgan Stanley’s stock price has been in neutral all year. Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told analysts on a conference call that the conversion was subject to a shareholder vote and regulatory approval. Morgan Stanley, which like its peers is still feeling the aftereffects of the financial crisis, posted first-quarter earnings on Thursday of $736 million, down 48 percent from the period a year earlier, and it recorded a $655 million loss from a joint venture it has with Mitsubishi. While Morgan Stanley’s quarterly profit of 50 cents a share is down from the first quarter of 2010, when the company earned 99 cents a share, it beat analysts’ expectations of 35 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Morgan Stanley’s shares were up almost 3 percent in midday trading after news of the conversion and the release of stronger-than-expected first-quarter results.</text></article>

On Monday, Citigroup announced earnings per share of 10 cents, versus 15 cents a year ago. Shares of Citigroup closed essentially flat at $4.42 a share, a day when the rest of the market was down significantly. The stock rose 1 percent on Tuesday, with JPMorgan Chase similarly up.</text></article>

The banks, which all worked for Parmalat in the years before its bankruptcy, were also acquitted of accusations that they did not have appropriate internal systems that would have prevented their employees from carrying out the fraud. Employees of the banks were also acquitted. The four banks had all denied wrongdoing. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Parmalat collapsed after it was revealed that the company’s debt was eight times as much as it had publicly stated and that sales and profit had been overstated for at least a decade. The four banks were part of a large pool of financial institutions that Parmalat used to raise money and organize acquisitions that helped turn a provincial milk producer into a large multinational food company, with businesses in Europe, the United States, Latin America and Australia. A much smaller Parmalat emerged from bankruptcy and was relisted on the Milan stock exchange in 2005. Bank of America hailed the judge’s ruling, saying it confirmed that “not only was the claim without foundation, but Bank of America had appropriate organizational models in place” as required by Italian law. Citigroup said that it had “maintained throughout that it was defrauded by Parmalat” and that the Milan court’s judgment confirmed “unequivocally that Citi and its employees did not have any involvement” in the affair. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank also said they were satisfied with the verdict. Milan prosecutors had asked that each bank be fined 900,000 euros ($1.3 million) and that a total of 120.6 million euros be seized from the banks: 70 million euros from Citigroup, 30.7 million euros from Bank of America, 14 million euros from Deutsche Bank and 5.9 million euros from Morgan Stanley. The prosecutors did not say whether they would appeal the verdict. The decision to appeal is usually made after the judges have published the reasoning behind their verdict, which must be done within 90 days of the ruling. Considering the time and effort the prosecutors put into the case, it would be extremely surprising if they did not appeal, said a person involved in the trial who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case until it was officially closed. The four banks are still on trial in Parma, where Parmalat is based, on charges of covering up the fraud that led to its bankruptcy. That trial is in its preliminary phase and is likely to last another two to three years. In December, the Parma court sentenced Calisto Tanzi, Parmalat’s founder and chief executive at the time of the collapse, to 18 years in prison for his role in the company’s demise. Mr. Tanzi has appealed that ruling. Two years ago, the Milan court sentenced Mr. Tanzi to 10 years in prison in another trial connected to Parmalat’s collapse. Mr. Tanzi lost the first appeal of that case and the second appeal could be decided in the next several months.</text></article>

Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, received $14 million for 2010. Even though James P. Gorman was promoted to chief executive of Morgan Stanley last year, he received a $1 million pay cut, as his total compensation fell to $14 million, the firm disclosed Thursday in a regulatory filing. The pay cut comes as Mr. Gorman strives to revitalize Morgan Stanley, where earnings and its stock price have remained under pressure since he took charge at the beginning of 2010. For the year, Mr. Gorman received a cash bonus of $1.55 million and a deferred cash award of $2.33 million that can be clawed back based on the firm’s performance, according Morgan Stanley’s annual proxy statement. Those total cash awards of $3.88 million were down from a deferred cash award of $5.71 million he received for 2009 when he was the firm’s co-president. Morgan Stanley also gave Mr. Gorman $3.5 million in stock options and $3.88 million in restricted stock that vests over three years, as well as $1.94 million in stock awards tied to the firm’s performance, for a total of $9.32 million. That compares with $8.55 million in restricted and performance stock awards for 2009.

Gorman, the firm's chief executive. Despite a flurry of management changes and a big hiring spree to bolster its trading business, a big Wall Street money maker, the company's stock price is lower than when Mr. Gorman took over in early 2010. Analysts have been cutting their earnings forecasts for Morgan Stanley's first-quarter results, which the company is scheduled to report next week. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs chimed in, cutting sharply its estimates for the bank. ''You can only take so much pain,'' said David P. Foley, an investment manager at Estabrook Capital Management, which as of Dec. 31 owned roughly 661,000 shares in Morgan Stanley, valued at almost $18 million. ''We have to go to our clients and defend the stock, and invariably someone says, 'Why do you still own this thing?' Eventually, I am sure Morgan Stanley will turn around, but the firm has become harder and harder to defend because it still hasn't turned the corner.'' Mr. Gorman has been working to turn that corner for Morgan Stanley, a one-time Wall Street powerhouse that was almost brought to its knees in the 2008 financial crisis. Yet the company continues to be hobbled by one-time legacy items, and the stock price has fallen more than 9 percent since Mr. Gorman took over. In 2010, Morgan Stanley produced a return on equity, a closely watched measure of financial performance on Wall Street, of 8.5 percent, down from 23.5 percent in 2006. In 2009, return on equity was 5 percent. In contrast, Goldman produced a 2010 return on equity of 11.5 percent and its stock has fallen roughly 4.5 percent since early 2010. And analysts are expecting Morgan Stanley to report a decline in its first-quarter results. The consensus, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, is that Morgan will earn 37 cents a share in the first quarter ended March 31, down from 99 cents a share in the quarter a year ago. Analysts expect the first quarter to include a handful of one-off charges, including the impact of a major embarrassment for the firm. Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, a unit that Morgan Stanley created with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group but that it does not control, may post a fiscal year loss of $960 million, a recent report in the Nikkei newspaper of Japan said. Morgan Stanley owns 40 percent of the venture, and its share of this loss will be reflected in its first-quarter results. The company declined to comment on the Nikkei report. James Mitchell, an analyst with the Buckingham Research Group, estimates that the losses will result in an after-tax reduction in Morgan Stanley's net income of $290 million, or 20 cents a share. Keith Horowitz at Citigroup estimates that the impact on Morgan's earnings will be as high as $385 million. Morgan Stanley's relationship with Mitsubishi was struck in the darkest days of the financial crisis, when the company accepted a $9 billion lifeline from the Japanese bank. The investment was similar to the one the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett made in Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley also set up two joint ventures with Mitsubishi to increase its presence in Japan. But unlike Goldman, which recently announced plans to pay back Mr. Buffett, Morgan Stanley still has expensive ties to Mitsubishi. In addition to the joint-venture losses, its dividend payments to Mitsubishi on the $9 billion investment total roughly $220 million a quarter, or almost $900 million a year. Getting out of this investment has proved more difficult than many executives at Morgan Stanley initially thought. The dividend payments will continue until the two parties can come to an agreement to end them or until the stock trades above $37.875 for 20 days out of 30 consecutive trading days. For this to happen, Morgan's stock would have to increase 41 percent. As a result, Mr. Gorman is keenly focused on the company's stock price, employees say. At an internal meeting in January, workers disappointed that their compensation was down confronted Mr. Gorman, according to employees who attended the session but were not authorized to speak on the record. Mr. Gorman told them he had to show restraint on expenses because he was focused on lifting the share price above $38 to free Morgan Stanley from the Mitsubishi investment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment for this article.</text></article>

Blankfein, testified about a former Goldman director who had possibly leaked confidential information to Mr. Rajaratnam. Next up, Morgan Stanley. Adam Smith, a former portfolio manager at the Galleon Group, the hedge fund Mr. Rajaratnam ran, is expected to take the witness stand as soon as Monday and tell the jury that he obtained illegal tips about merger deals from a Morgan Stanley investment banker. Then, Mr. Smith is expected to say, he and Mr. Rajaratnam earned substantial profits by trading on the information. Mr. Smith pleaded guilty in January to insider trading and is cooperating with the government. He will be the first former Galleon employee to testify in the trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, which begins its fourth week on Monday. His testimony is expected to illuminate the culture inside Galleon, which was one of the world’s largest and most powerful hedge funds before Mr. Rajaratnam’s arrest in October 2009. Galleon, which focused on technology stocks, practiced the so-called mosaic theory of stock investing, which relies on analysts to ferret out data about companies by aggressively pressing sources for information to build a mosaic about those companies and gain an investment edge. Mr. Smith, in effect, has admitted that pieces of his mosaics came from illegal stock tips. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business School, Mr. Smith, 38, was an investment banker in Morgan Stanley’s Silicon Valley office before joining Galleon in 2003. Galleon was a perfect fit for Mr. Smith, who specialized in the technology industry and preferred the fast-moving trading culture of a hedge fund to the slower-paced world of investment banking. A popular figure on the trading floor with a keen sense of humor, Mr. Smith thrived at Galleon, which at its height managed $7 billion. Mr. Rajaratnam took to Mr. Smith early on and gave him his own pool of money to manage, according to two people who had been close to him and would speak only on the condition of anonymity. At his peak, Mr. Smith controlled about $250 million. In his best years, he earned several million dollars annually. He was among the firm’s hardest workers, taking frequent trips to Asia to visit sources and production facilities. Mr. Smith has also admitted to obtaining the confidential financial results of two technology companies — the Intersil Corporation and Nvidia — from employees at those companies and then trading on the information in advance of their quarterly earnings announcements. His relationship with a former Morgan Stanley colleague, Kamal Ahmed, is expected to be a focus of his testimony. Mr. Ahmed is a Morgan Stanley managing director who is said to have provided Mr. Smith with information about pending deals, including Integrated Device Technology’s acquisition of Integrated Circuit Systems in 2005 and Advanced Micro Devices’ purchase of ATI Technologies the next year. Earlier in the trial, the government played a secretly recorded telephone call from 2008 in which Mr. Smith can be heard telling Mr. Rajaratnam about a potential sale involving Vishay Intertechnology. Mr. Smith says, “Listen, ah, I talked to Kamal last night” and explains that Morgan Stanley had tried to win the assignment to sell Vishay but that another bank “got the mandate.” He then says that he is going to buy some Vishay stock. On the call, Mr. Rajaratnam asks Mr. Smith how the market is treating him and Mr. Smith responds: “Like a baby treats a diaper.” Morgan Stanley has placed Mr. Ahmed on administrative leave. Doug Tween, a lawyer for Mr. Ahmed, said his client was cooperating and “we remain confident that he did nothing illegal or improper.” Mr. Rajaratnam’s lawyers are expected to portray Mr. Smith as untrustworthy and to argue that he is testifying in return for a lenient prison sentence. Just weeks before the trial began, prosecutors also tried to use Mr. Smith to gather information on Ian Horowitz, Mr. Rajaratnam’s personal trader at Galleon. On Jan. 14, after he began cooperating with the government, Mr. Smith made three secretly recorded calls to Mr. Horowitz in which he tried to elicit evidence of insider trading. At the end of the third call, Mr. Horowitz, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, said to Mr. Smith: “The questions you are asking me are like you are tapping me on the phone trying to get me to say some things.” “Are you serious?” Mr. Smith said, denying that he was recording their call. “Dude, come on.”</text></article>

Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, has called on BP — the British energy giant that typically relies on in-house teams or small boutiques for its deal-making. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Gorman was spotted in the reception area of BP’s headquarters in London. He was there with Franck Petitgas, Morgan Stanley’s global co-head of investment banking. A BP employee soon led the men through the security barriers and toward the elevators, while DealBook was taken downstairs to the canteen for another meeting. It remains unclear with whom Morgan Stanley met or what they discussed. BP has been reluctant to hire investment banks in the past. The British oil giant preferred to use its in-house merger and acquisitions team and worked with a small advisory boutique, Lambert Energy Advisory. Lambert Energy advised BP on its $7.8 billion partnership deal with Rosneft of Russia. That does not mean that Morgan Stanley and other large investment banks aren’t pitching BP for business. After all, the oil company is still in the process of completing its $30 billion divestment program, and its chief executive, Robert Dudley, made clear he was keen on forging partnerships with national oil companies.</text></article>

Proceeds from the acquisition — the largest announced so far this year and one of the biggest since the end of the financial crisis — will be divvied up among a dozen financial and legal advisers. Particularly striking is the presence of two major boutique firms, Greenhill &amp; Company and Evercore Partners, as advisers to AT&amp;T. Then again, Evercore has long served as an adviser on the roughly $200 billion in mergers that led to the modern-day AT&amp;T. Others will benefit as well. JPMorgan Chase, an adviser to AT&amp;T, will cement its standing as the top-ranked adviser on deals worldwide as counted by Dealogic, with $170.1 billion worth of transactions as of Saturday. Morgan Stanley, the principal adviser to Deutsche Telekom, the owner of T-Mobile USA, is ranked third worldwide with $110.9 billion worth of deals, drawing closer to longtime rival Goldman Sachs. Credit Suisse, another Deutsche Telekom banker, will probably displace Bank of America Merrill Lynch as the fourth-ranked deal adviser globally, having racked up $101 billion worth of assignments to Merrill’s $108.5 billion as of Saturday. The AT&amp;T deal is also notable for who is missing: Goldman, which had been advising Sprint Nextel in its talks with Deutsche Telekom, people briefed on the matter previously told DealBook.

Nears<date>March 17, 2011, 12:43 pm</date><text>Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News In contrast to the sea of deep discounts on its Web site, the valuation of Groupon keeps moving higher. The social shopping site, which recently spurned a $6 billion takeover offer from Google, has held discussions with Goldman Sachs bankers about a possible initial public offering that could value the company at close to $25 billion, according to a person close to the matter who was not authorized to speak because the talks were private. At $25 billion, Groupon’s valuation would top Google’s $23 billion market value when it went public in August 2004. Although plans are not final and Groupon could still decide against pursuing an offering, the company may file as early as this spring, people have told DealBook. A Groupon spokeswoman declined to comment. Although it is unclear how large the offering would be, if it happens, the lead underwriter stands to reap millions in fees. According to the person close to the discussions, Goldman Sachs is currently the front-runner to handle the offering, although Groupon has talked with Morgan Stanley bankers as well. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Groupon, the Chicago-based start-up that was founded in 2008 and connects consumers to local deals, has enjoyed a meteoric rise. At the end of December 2009, the company’s payroll numbered 124 people; today it has a global work force of more than 5,900, roughly half of which signed on in the last three months.  That staff, largely made up of salespeople who manage local business accounts, supports Groupon’s user base of more than 70 million subscribers in over 500 markets. Led by its 30-year-old founder, Andrew Mason, the company has been profitable since June 2009, according to data provided by a Groupon spokeswoman. In another sign of just how hefty the company has become, on Thursday, about 300 of Groupon’s salespeople moved out of its headquarters, a converted Montgomery Ward warehouse, to another building across town. As Groupon advances, the company is facing increased pressure from me-too daily deal sites and the No. 2 in the market, LivingSocial, which recently raised $175 million from the online retailer Amazon. Larger players, meanwhile, are also plunging into the market. Google is testing a rival product called Google Offers, and Facebook is expanding Deals, its location-based deals program. Still, Ben Horowitz, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Groupon investor, says he is not worried about the new competition. In a meeting with journalists on Wednesday night, he said it would be difficult for any rival to build up a sales force comparable that of Groupon. The company is making more than enough money to support its work force, he said, adding that others would struggle to scale up their operations. Bloomberg News reported earlier on Thursday that Groupon’s offering could be as much as $25 billion.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/business/12military.html?ref=morganstanley">U.S. Investigating Military Family Foreclosures<date>Published: March 11, 2011</date><text>The Justice Department is investigating allegations that a mortgage subsidiary of Morgan Stanley foreclosed on almost two dozen military families from 2006 to 2008 in violation of a longstanding law aimed at preventing such action.A department spokeswoman confirmed on Friday that the Morgan Stanley unit, Saxon Mortgage Services, is one of several mortgage and lending companies being investigated by its civil rights division. The inquiry is focused on possible violations of a federal law that bars lenders from foreclosing on active-duty service members without a court hearing. Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined on Friday to comment on the investigation. However, in the fine print of a recent regulatory filing, Morgan Stanley disclosed that it was “responding to subpoenas and requests for information” from various government and regulatory agencies concerning, among other issues, its “compliance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act,” the law that governs the actions creditors can take against service members on active duty. The investigation came to light in a document that Saxon’s lawyers filed on Tuesday in federal court in Grand Rapids, Mich., during a trial to assess damages against Saxon and two co-defendants after a federal judge ruled late last year that they had illegally seized and sold the home of Sgt. James B. Hurley, a Michigan National Guard member who lost his home while he was serving in Iraq in 2005. That case was ultimately settled on Thursday. In the document filed on Tuesday, one of Saxon’s lawyers characterized the investigation as “merely a preliminary investigation based on unproven allegations, for which no liability or wrongdoing has been found.” The filing also suggested that Saxon was negotiating a settlement, but neither Morgan Stanley nor the Justice Department would comment on any talks. According to people present in the courtroom, the discussions of the Saxon filing indicated that as many as 23 military foreclosures were under scrutiny in the Justice Department investigation. Under the civil relief act, a judge must hold a hearing at which the service member is represented before granting a lender the right to foreclose on the service member’s home, even in states where a court order is not required for civilian foreclosures. As early as 2005, advocates for military families were complaining that banks and other lenders were frequently violating the law. Sergeant Hurley was one of the service members affected by a violation of the act. He returned from duty as a power generator mechanic in Iraq in December 2005 to find that Saxon had foreclosed on his riverside home outside Hartford, Mich., and sold it to someone else. He sued Saxon and two co-defendants, Orlans Associates, the law firm in Troy, Mich., that handled the foreclosure paperwork, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, the trustee for the mortgage involved in the foreclosure. The case dragged on until late last year, when Judge Gordon J. Quist of United States District Court ruled that the foreclosure and sale of the Hurley home had violated the civil relief act and ordered a jury trial to determine damages. On Thursday, the fifth day of that trial, Sergeant Hurley settled with all the defendants in the case for an undisclosed sum, according to Col. John S. Odom, a retired Air Force lawyer who represented the Hurley family. The terms of the settlement are confidential, Colonel Odom said. “But the Hurleys are well pleased,” he added. Mr. Lake of Morgan Stanley said: “We are very pleased to have settled this matter with Sergeant Hurley. As we have said previously, Saxon is always willing to make reasonable accommodations to amicably resolve a matter, especially for our service men and women.” John T. Gallagher, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the settlement itself. “As Deutsche Bank has repeatedly informed The New York Times, loan servicers, and not trustees, initiate and manage all foreclosures,” Mr. Gallagher said. He emphasized that Saxon, as the servicer on the Hurley mortgage, “had the sole interaction with Mr. Hurley’s representatives regarding the loan. No employee of Deutsche Bank had any involvement in the underlying facts.” The settlement came two days after the brief courtroom drama on Tuesday that led to the disclosure of the Justice Department investigation. It began when Colonel Odom unexpectedly served a subpoena on Saxon’s general counsel, Gregory Smallwood, who was present in the courtroom. Saxon’s trial lawyers immediately filed a motion arguing that the subpoena should be quashed because “the court has ruled inadmissible any reference to the D.O.J. investigation for which plaintiffs have suggested Mr. Smallwood’s testimony would be probative.” The motion also argued that “the fact that Saxon may be negotiating a settlement of the investigation is also inadmissible” and that “any reference to the investigation, the negotiation of a consent decree, or the allegations that are the basis for that investigation, would also be unfairly prejudicial to Saxon.”The Justice Department is investigating allegations that a mortgage subsidiary of Morgan Stanley foreclosed on almost two dozen military families from 2006 to 2008 in violation of a longstanding law aimed at preventing such action.</text></article>

The regulations instead encourage big European banks to steal business from their United States rivals, according to a new report by analysts at JPMorgan Chase‘s British investment bank in London, JPMorgan Cazenove. The rules lose their authority at the United States border, leaving foreign banks to dominate. Of course, some foreign banks operate United States subsidiaries that insure their deposits with the federal government. Those banks, in many cases, would be subject to the new rules. But in general, big banks in Britain, Germany and France “could benefit from regulatory arbitrage opportunities and gain market shares,” thanks to elements of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, the report from JPMorgan Cazenove said. The opportunities arise from Dodd-Frank provisions that force banks to spin off some derivatives business, halt proprietary trading and wind down their investments in hedge funds. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links JPMorgan Cazenove report (pdf) The report noted that European banks face strict limits on executive pay packages, which “could threaten efforts” to attract high-priced talent. But the compensation curbs pose a “significantly less material” threat to profits than the rules facing Wall Street, the report said. Big European investment banks like Barclays and Deutsche Bank “would be the winners” from the Dodd-Frank Act, while Goldman Sachs potentially has the “most to lose from the new rules,” the report said. Goldman faces its greatest threat from the so-called Volcker Rule. Named after Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who proposed the rule, it prohibits federally insured banks from trading for their own benefit rather than for clients, a tactic known as proprietary trading. The hope, lawmakers said, was to prevent banks from using their own capital to take risky bets while the government guarantees their deposits. Goldman was among the first Wall Street giants to wind down its proprietary trading desks after President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law in July. The bank’s principal strategies group, a proprietary desk whose alumni include a former Treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, recently joined the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. JPMorgan Chase has similarly planned to close its proprietary trading business. The Volcker Rule ultimately could “have a significant impact” on trading revenue, according to the report. The rule also prohibits American banks from owning more than a 3 percent stake in hedge funds and private equity shops. Morgan Stanley recently sold its majority stake in the hedge fund FrontPoint Partners to comply with the rule. Morgan Stanley and Goldman are better positioned to comply with another Dodd-Frank rule that requires banks to spin off their derivatives desks into separately capitalized entities. This move will “create regulatory disadvantage” to banks like Bank of America and Citigroup, which are not well prepared for the shakeup, the report said. The report echoes concerns raised by Congressional Republicans. Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee’s capital markets panel, recently complained that the Dodd-Frank Act would push business overseas. “I am concerned,” he said in a March 3 letter to regulators, that some rules “may be setting up a system that encourages regulatory arbitrage, one where American financial companies will be severely disadvantaged.”</text></article>

The next day, she was scheduled to speak at the Goldman Sachs headquarters in Lower Manhattan. What follows is an edited and condensed transcript of the conversation. Q. Wait, you’re speaking at Goldman tomorrow? Who let that happen? A. [Laughs.] Yeah, I was a little concerned when my publicist booked it. She e-mailed me about the event, and I was like, “Do they know what I wrote about?’” Q. In your book, you talk about an old-boy culture at Morgan Stanley that made those years difficult for you. Explain that culture. A. Well, part of it is a class thing. A lot of the people around me had grown up talking about their private schools, summer camps, country clubs. A lot of times people like to exchange information about their lives – whether they’re going to St. John or St. Maarten this year – and that’s challenging when you don’t have that background. Q. Come to think of it, you were sort of the triple-threat of finance handicaps: female, minority and not from a privileged background. Of those three, which was the hardest to overcome? A. I’d say being a female was the most obvious thing. But it’s because my specific group in corporate finance wasn’t used to having women around. Look, I don’t think people intentionally tried to make me feel excluded. But so much of this business is about relationships. When we recruit, we call it “fit,” which basically means, “Do I get along with this person?” And a lot of the time, if you have common friends or went to the same private school as somebody, it makes it much easier to get along. Q. In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine’s Deborah Solomon, Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs said that it wasn’t possible to achieve gender equality on Wall Street when so few of the applicants for finance jobs are women. What part do colleges and business schools play in ensuring fair representation? A. It’s not really about bringing women in. Once banks bring people in, they need to make an environment that people want to stay in. And banks have a reputation for not creating a very good environment for women or minorities. So they can pass the buck down, but then colleges can pass the buck down to high schools. I don’t see the point in doing that. Q. Let’s say that tomorrow, you’re tapped to replace James P. Gorman as chief executive of Morgan Stanley. What do you do to make it a more comfortable place for minorities and women? A. You have to educate people. People at the very top have to be taught to say, “This kind of thing is not tolerated. We really mean it. And there’s going to be a consequence if you go to strip clubs during your meetings, if you pull women off of deals.” One of my colleagues got pulled off a deal because a client said, “I don’t want any women on the deal.” Now, I felt like Morgan Stanley had the option to say, “That’s not appropriate. We hire women here, and having them involved is part of the deal.” But they didn’t. Q. A lot of firms now have mandatory sexual harassment workshops for new employees. Does that help? A. Not really, because here’s the attitude toward that workshop: Everybody dreads it and tries to get out of it. But recently, I’ve heard that some firms have started inviting theater companies to come in and act out everything that can happen in terms of sexual harassment scenarios. That’s a little more thoughtful. Q. In your opinion, what separates the relatively few women who have reached the upper echelons of finance, like Ms. Cohen, from women who haven’t? Did they have it easier? A. It’s not that those people didn’t have to deal with stuff. [the Morgan Stanley managing director] Carla Harris is one of my mentors. She’s been there most of her career, and she was very helpful. But I know she’s put up with so much. I don’t think our generation has the tolerance to deal with that when we know there are so many other options out there. Q. Moving away from gender, a lot of your book was about the shortcuts and hacks you used to cope with the long hours at Morgan Stanley. Can you give our young finance readers some tips? A. Put half of what you’d put in your bathroom in your desk. Toothbrush, extra change of clothes, shoes. [Laughs] Man, it sounds so pathetic now. Q. Well, that’s one of the things I found most interesting about your book. People outside the industry have an image of high-flying bankers living the dream, but everyone you knew was on Prozac. A. My experience was very extreme, and it showed a lot of the problematic things happening at an investment bank. I didn’t know the challenges I would be facing. Q. You’ve left Wall Street, and are now the chief executive of MindWorks, a consulting firm that advises corporations on relieving stress in the workplace. Knowing what you know now, what advice would you give to a college student considering a job in banking? A. When you take this job, you give up stuff to the level that it makes you happy, and at some point, if it’s not making you happy, you don’t need to continue doing it. And I think, in some ways, that’s the message of this book: I’ll tell you what I went through, and if you’re willing to do that, if you can navigate it better than I did, then more power to you.</text></article>

Just ask Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused a former Goldman Sachs board member, Rajat K. Gupta, of facilitating insider trading while he was on the Goldman board. A current Morgan Stanley director, Howard Davies, has resigned as head of the London School of Economics because of his dealings with Libya. The news about the two men throws a spotlight on the boards of the two firms for the first time since the financial crisis. Goldman and Morgan were, of course, the two Wall Street investment banks that survived the crisis and that not so coincidentally had better corporate governance than their peers. But has anything really changed in the boardroom since the crisis? Heightened scrutiny, to be sure, has led these firms, as well as others, to shake up their boards. Morgan Stanley has three new directors. Goldman also has three new directors and has shrunk its board to 11 members from 12. Citigroup and Bank of America, which together received over $90 billion in federal help, have a majority of new directors. In all four companies — as well as more broadly in corporate America — there is now a preference for operational experience, for people who have run companies. The recent changes on the Goldman board reflect this trend. Goldman’s three new directors are Lakshmi Mittal, the head of the global steel maker Arcelor Mittal; H. Lee Scott Jr., the former chief executive of Wal-Mart; and James J. Schiro, a former chief executive of Zurich Financial Services. These are seriously accomplished people. We are long past the days when O. J. Simpson could serve as a member of the board and the audit committee of Infinity Broadcasting. Boards are now required to have independent members and separate compensation and audit committees. And in financial institutions, there is certainly a renewed focus on risk, with many boards holding separate breakout sessions on the issue. Peter R. Gleason, chief financial officer of the National Association of Corporate Directors, said recently that a single board membership could take 225 hours a year. It has become less of a perquisite or a way to build client relationships and more of a job. Sidney J. Weinberg, the legendary chief executive of Goldman, sat on more than 30 boards, including that of General Electric. But this is no longer possible. According to a recent survey by the corporate directors association, 37 percent of companies limit the number of other directorships a member can hold. So if directors are more dedicated, is change still needed? Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Boards may be more focused, and the names may have changed, but the type of director is increasingly the same: men, and about 15 to 20 percent women, with operational experience. Despite the experience of the financial crisis, no one expects a board member to be able to price a complex derivative. In the case of a financial institution, the job of a director is about asking good questions and monitoring. Those who want or expect more from a financial firm would end up having a board of math Ph.D.’s to the exclusion of all else. This concept applies to other types of companies like General Motors, which, before its bankruptcy, suffered because its board was unwilling to challenge management. But if it is good questioners we want, is it appropriate to put only members of the same club on the board? There have been hundreds of studies on corporate board composition, but there is no consensus on what works. It is unclear whether independent directors add value, though evidence shows that they do bring more independent decision-making. There is also evidence that separating the chairman and the chief executive can add value. And at least one controversial University of Michigan study found that a Norwegian law requiring boards to be at least 40 percent women reduced a company’s market value. There is also little agreement on whether people from different backgrounds add value. In his book “Fault Lines,” the University of Chicago economist Raghuram G. Rajan argues for a diversity of perspective and background, and that directors should come from academia, public interest organizations and other fields. The idea is that these people will bring independent thinking. It also may affect things like compensation. European companies are required to have labor representatives as directors, and this may be one part of the reason that compensation is lower for European chief executives. But boards need to be collegial places, and a more diverse mix of people may upset this need. This is Goldilocks’s porridge, a hard mix to get right, one that varies with each company. But it is important. If the same type of people are always appointed to corporate boards, will anything change? When the next bubble comes along will these directors critically question industry practices? Or will new directors with more diverse backgrounds continue the perceptible improvement in corporate board decision-making and add value? The rush to appoint operational people with the same skill set is an obvious response to the financial crisis. Certainly, operational experience is valuable, but if everyone is the same, it may spur group-think instead. In many banks currently, the only debate is whether board appointees should have an operational background or an operational background specifically from a financial company. Seven of the 13 members of the Bank of America board are from finance companies and two are from financial regulators. The boards of Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman may be more focused these days on risk and compensation, but their directors largely have similar backgrounds. Adding two or three board members with more diverse backgrounds could spur more critical thinking — a type of introspection that was absent before the crisis. And these four are the leaders in reforming governance. General Electric, which also was in a perilous state during the financial crisis, has added only two new members to its 16-member board since. Many financial institution boards remain unchanged. As we enter proxy season, this type of re-examination is a step that all financial institutions should take and shareholders should request. Deadwood needs to be removed, and directors penalized for their companies’ poor performance. For all companies hiring new directors, perhaps it is time they told their search consultants that some diversity in background is appropriate. As of last year, the S.E.C. requires companies’ to state the “experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills” that led them to choose a director. Operational experience may be valuable, but so is critical thinking. People from other backgrounds may be just the right ingredient to perfect this difficult mix. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the world of mergers and acquisitions.</text></article>

Lynch, is stepping down and leaving the firm, according to a memo obtained by DealBook on Friday. ''We have greatly benefited from his stand-out leadership in vastly improving our relationships with global regulators, navigating our conversion to a financial holding company, and directing the firm's efforts resulting in successful resolutions of a number of major litigations and investigations,'' Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James P. Gorman, said in the memo. The firm did not indicate who would be Mr. Lynch's successor. Mr. Lynch, who has been the firm's vice chairman since May 2009, joined the firm in late 2005 as an executive vice president and chief legal officer when John Mack became chief executive. For Mr. Lynch, the key move was his departure from the post of chief legal officer in February 2010. At that time, Morgan Stanley said Mr. Lynch was stepping down to focus on his duties as vice chairman, according to an internal memo obtained by DealBook. ''Gary has decided to step away from his role as chief legal officer and concentrate on his other senior management responsibilities,'' Mr. Gorman said in that 2010 memo. But some analysts saw Mr. Lynch's move a year ago as signaling the eventual end of his tenure at the firm. Mr. Lynch has a long history with Mr. Mack, who stepped down as Morgan Stanley's chief executive at the end of 2010 but continues to serve as its chairman. Prior to Morgan Stanley, Mr. Mack served as the chief executive of Credit Suisse, where he hired Mr. Lynch to be the chief legal counsel for that firm in 2001. During his tenure, Mr. Lynch was praised for shoring up Credit Suisse's legal reputation and settling issues with regulators. In the aftermath of the dot-com bust, he helped Credit Suisse navigate claims that it overcharged its clients in public offerings, leading to a $100 million settlement with regulators in 2002. Before joining Wall Street, Mr. Lynch was a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardell and was the director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the mid-to-late 1980s. Mr. Lynch is not the first high-profile executive hired by Mr. Mack to leave the firm. Jack DiMaio, another Credit Suisse alum, joined in 2009 to be the global head of interest rate, credit and currency trading and stepped down in January. At that time, the company also announced the resignation of Charles Johnston, president of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture; Gregory J. Fleming, a key hire by Mr. Gorman, took over his responsibilities. The departure of Mr. Lynch was first reported by Bloomberg News. Susanne Craig contributed to this report. Below is a copy of the memo from Mr. Gorman: Gary G. Lynch has decided to leave and pursue opportunities outside the Firm. Since May 2009, Gary has served as a Vice Chairman of Morgan Stanley based in London. He has been on a number of our Morgan Stanley subsidiary boards throughout the region and has been working as a senior manager advising the Firm on issues of policy and strategy. As you know, from 2005 to 2010, Gary was our Chief Legal Officer. While Gary's accomplishments during his tenure are too numerous to list here, we have greatly benefitted from his stand-out leadership in vastly improving our relationships with global regulators, navigating our conversion to a financial holding company, and directing the Firm's efforts resulting in successful resolutions of a number of major litigations and investigations. We will miss Gary's wise counsel and outstanding business judgment. Please join me in thanking Gary for his many contributions and wishing him well in his future endeavors.

Sir Howard, who resigned earlier this week as the director of the London School of Economics, will remain on Morgan Stanley’s board, according to one person close to the bank who was not authorized to speak publicly. The board remains fully supportive of Mr. Davies and has no plans to ask him to step down, this person said. Sir Howard, who offered his resignation on Tuesday, is departing the university under a cloud of controversy. The London School of Economics is under fire for its ties to the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and his son, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a graduate of the school. Over the last few years, the university has accepted several donations from the regime, including a commitment of £1.5 million British pounds ($2.4 million) from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation ($488,000 of which has been received); $50,000 for Sir Howard’s consulting work; and a £2.2 million contract between L.S.E. Enterprise and Libya’s Economic Development Board to train Libyan civil servants and professionals. On Thursday, the university announced that there would be an independent investigation into the school’s ties with Libya and Seif Qaddafi. In Sir Howard’s resignation letter, made public on Thursday, the director expressed his regret but said the decisions were reasonable and justified. “However laudable our intentions, in the light of developments in Libya the consequences have been highly unfortunate, and I must take responsibility for that. I advised the council that it was reasonable to accept the money, and that has turned out to be a mistake,” he added. Sir Howard, who has been director at the university for more than seven years, previously served as the chairman of Britain’s Financial Services Authority and the deputy governor of the Bank of England. He was also a former employee at McKinsey &amp; Company. According to his profile on Morgan Stanley’s Web site, he is currently a director of insurance firm Paternoster and the British financial services firm Prudential. In recent years, some boards have adopted rules that require directors who lose or change jobs to be reviewed. For instance, if a director is the chief executive of another company and is fired or retires, the board may ask him to not stand for re-election. Sir Howard’s move comes as other notable names who profited from the Qadaffi regime, publicly disassociate themselves from the Libyan dictator. Several musicians who were paid to perform for the regime, such as Mariah Carey and Nelly Furtado, have announced plans to return or donate their performance fees to charities.

Over the last week, the country’s big banks for the first time released their potential legal exposure in their 10Ks, the annual report companies are required by regulators to provide to shareholders. They were headline-grabbing numbers at most big banks — except for one, Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs said it could face as much as $3.4 billion in ligation costs for all the lawsuits and regulatory investigations it has on its plate. Citigroup said that an additional $4 billion in costs its possible legal matters. JPMorgan Chase said its woes could run $4.5 billion beyond what that bank has already set aside in reserves. Among the big firms, Morgan Stanley’s tab was the lowest at $518 million. These revelations, according to executives at various firms, came after the Securities and Exchange Commission in late 2010 sent a note to a number of chief financial officers reminding them that they are required to make disclosures when there is a reasonable possibility of a loss. The S.E.C., these executives say, followed up to make sure they would provide deeper information. One executive remarked the agency’s reminders were, put politely, forceful. In their various filings, most firms seem to have made their estimate based on “reasonably possible losses.” Said JPMorgan Chase in its filing: “This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the firm is involved, taking into account the firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made.” Morgan Stanley’s decision not to provide a catch-all number turned heads among Wall Street number crunchers this week. The bank opted instead to provide only its estimate for two separate lawsuits, potential exposure that totaled $518 million. It had previously disclosed this amount while other firms had not typically disclosed any litigation estimates. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Some pundits on Wall Street have questioned the premise of any litigation disclosure, saying it sounds like one big guessing game But at least one analyst says it’s a step in the right direction. “If in doubt put it out, that is the adage the industry should live by,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole Securities.</text></article>

The sale was originally planned for the end of 2010, but the transaction was delayed by the arrest of a French doctor who was accused of leaking inside information to a hedge fund, which was later revealed to be FrontPoint. The fund quickly put a portfolio manager for its health care team on leave. Although neither FrontPoint nor its managers were accused of wrongdoing, the whiff of the scandal created considerable turmoil for the firm as investors fled. Investors withdrew $3.5 billion, more than half of the assets under management. As Morgan Stanley and FrontPoint, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., continued to work toward arranging a spinoff, another potential stumbling block emerged. One of the best-known managers at the firm, Steve Eisman, was considering leaving FrontPoint to start a fund. Mr. Eisman is best known for his bet against the subprime mortgage market, which earned him hundreds of millions and a major role in “The Big Short,” the best seller by Michael Lewis. People close to Mr. Eisman said he was frustrated with the heavy investor redemptions. A person who has worked with to FrontPoint but was not authorized to speak publicly said that Mr. Eisman planned to stay with the fund. Mr. Eisman declined to comment.</text></article>

Inc.<date>February 24, 2011, 9:01 am</date><text>Tony Avelar/Bloomberg News Mary Meeker Hey Uncle Sam, Mary Meeker has some advice on how to fix the economy. In an essay for Bloomberg Businessweek, Ms. Meeker, the former Queen of the Internet turned venture capitalist, urges taxpayers to think of themselves as shareholders in U.S.A. Inc. — a debt laden, bloated corporation. That investment, she writes, is at risk unless the government makes some serious changes. “The idea of the U.S. as a corporation is more than a thought experiment. It’s a way to reposition our approach to long-term problems. What would U.S.A. Inc. be worth? Who would want to buy its shares? And what would a turnaround expert recommend for a company that lost more $2 trillion (“net operating cost”) in 2010?” As she sees it, the situation can be remedied if the government is willing to take some drastic measures. Ms. Meeker, who left Morgan Stanley in November to join the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, suggests some fixes on the fringe. Reducing the deduction for home mortgage interest, for example, would raise tax revenue without raising tax rates. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The Bloomberg Businessweek article But Uncle Sam is going to have to do much more than that to get U.S.A. Inc. out of trouble. Medicare and Medicaid, she notes, are the real “crushers.” “Since Medicare and Medicaid are the biggest challenges to U.S.A. Inc.’s solvency, fixing their finances has to be at the top of the agenda,” says Ms. Meeker. “Genuine improvement requires slowing combined public and private spending through efficiency and better incentives.” For one, she questions whether the government should reduce the incentive for doctors “to practice wasteful defensive medicine by capping non-economic damage awards for malpractice.” Defensive medicine is when doctors order extra tests to deter patients from suing, costing the system millions of dollars a year. As for Social Security, Ms. Meeker suggests raising the retirement age. “Since Social Security’s creation in 1935, life expectancy has increased 26 percent to age 78, while the system’s normal retirement age has gone up just 3 percent to 67,” she noted. In the essay, Ms. Meeker points to a handful of corporate turnarounds that America could learn from, among them that of General Motors, the carmaker that filed for bankruptcy in 2009. As Ms. Meeker notes, the company followed a course of “slashing, burning, and stiffing bondholders.” Then “it got a new lease on life,” pulling off a $20 billion initial public offering in November. While she does not think U.S.A. Inc. should take such drastic measures, she notes it is nonetheless “encouraging to see how a company that’s given up for dead can come back strong.” “U.S.A. Inc. needs to prime itself for the same kind of renewal,” she says, “and prepare for brutal decisions that change how we do business.” USA Inc. – A Basic Summary of America’s Financial Statements</text></article>

Nevertheless, the state is trying again, Mary Williams Walsh and Michael Cooper report in The New York Times. Illinois hopes to sell $3.7 billion of bonds to make this year’s contribution to its fund. It is essentially paying a single year’s bill by adding to its already heavy debt load. That short-term thinking is not unlike Americans taking out home equity loans to pay for cars and vacations before the housing bust. But investors have learned a lot about the pitfalls of debt since the state tried to shore up its fund a few years ago. This time the municipal bond markets are jittery, and federal securities regulators are investigating whether Illinois has been properly describing its pension fund and the risks it may pose. Amid the heightened oversight, Illinois is providing more information about its troubled finances than in the past. So much unfavorable detail is emerging that the bond issue will test investor faith in a deeply troubled state’s commitment to do whatever is necessary, raise taxes or cut services, to keep its promises to bondholders. Illinois has a team of banks, actuaries, lawyers and financial advisers helping it get the latest pension bonds to market. The lead underwriters are Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Loop Capital Markets; 11 other underwriters will sell smaller portions. A local firm, Peralta Garcia Solutions, is advising the state, and three law firms are helping make sure the bonds are issued legally.</text></article>

Scott Applewhite/Associated Press Elizabeth Warren, the leader of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. As the new federal consumer watchdog agency takes shape, Wall Street might see a few familiar faces on its roster. Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard University law professor who is setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced her latest string of hires on Thursday, including former managing directors at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers from abuses in the lending industry. Now the bureau is turning to former members of the industry to help it police banks, credit card companies and mortgage lenders. “Building a team to develop smarter financial regulations means hiring top-notch leaders with a wide range of experiences,” Ms. Warren said in a statement. Revolving Door View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The bureau’s hires announced Thursday include Rajeev Date, the former Deutsche Bank managing director. Mr. Date, who also worked at Capital One Financial as a senior vice president, will be the bureau’s associate director for research, markets and regulations. “Raj Date and his team bring a wealth of experience in the financial services industry, government, nonprofits, community banking and academia,” Ms. Warren said. Ms. Warren also hired Elizabeth Vale, a Morgan Stanley managing director who was vice president and portfolio manager at Philadelphia National Bank. Her industry experience will come in handy — she will serve as a liaison to community banks and credit unions. Ms. Warren’s hires also include a former financial industry lawyer, a former senior employee at the mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac and Corey Stone, who once was the chairman of Start Community Bank in New Haven, Conn. The bureau has gone on a hiring spree in recent weeks. As of late January, the bureau had more than 100 employees. Ms. Warren added five senior leaders to her team in one week in December, including Richard Cordray, the outgoing attorney general of Ohio, who will run the bureau’s enforcement division. A consumer protection bureau might seem like an unlikely place for former bankers to land, but Ms. Warren has made an effort to reach out to Wall Street.

Not surprisingly, both companies brought in a cadre of advisers to help put the deal together. NYSE Euronext was advised by Perella Weinberg Partners and BNP Paribas and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz; Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy; and the Dutch firm Stibbe. Deutsche Börse was advised by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Linklaters. The NYSE Euronext assignment is a big achievement for Perella Weinberg, the boutique co-founded in 2006 by Joseph R. Perella. (Several bankers at much larger institutions have expressed surprise at how the firm leapfrogged over them to get the assignment.) The firm has snagged advisory roles in several major deals since its founding, including Wachovia’s sale in 2008 to Wells Fargo and the Pepsi Bottling Group’s takeover by Pepsico in 2009. But several of its most recent major deals — like the leveraged buyouts of J.Crew and Del Monte, the sale of Massey Energy to Alpha Natural Resources and Qwest Communications‘ merger with CenturyTel — have been advising company boards, a less-lucrative role. Deutsche Börse’s advisory team poses fewer surprises, with Deutsche Bank serving as a natural lead adviser alongside JPMorgan. Yet the joint news release on Tuesday also mentioned other firms that provided “further financial advice.” In this case, Credit Suisse and Société Générale were additional advisers to Detusche Börse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley worked for NYSE Euronext, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. (Morgan Stanley already has a piece of two other exchange mergers. It is advising the London Stock Exchange in its deal with the Toronto Stock Exchange, and Singapore’s SGX in its acquisition of Australia’s ASX.) Why bring in the additional help? It’s possible that NYSE Euronext was doing a favor to Goldman and Morgan, two of its most important customers. Beyond the advisory fees, the two firms would also receive credit in the all-important league tables. But it’s also possible that NYSE Euronext may want the two firms around if a potential rival bidder, like the CME Group, emerges. Other banks have been studying ways to get a piece of the action, people briefed on the matter have told DealBook, though it’s unclear whether anything concrete will take shape.</text></article>

But a set of documents, e-mail messages and minutes of crucial regulatory meetings released recently by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission provide fresh detail about just how close to the brink both firms came. This week the commission will release another set of documents on its Web site, including an interactive timeline that goes back to the Great Depression. The site will also feature hours of previously unreleased audio recordings of interviews with major players in the crisis, like Joseph Cassano of the American International Group, who was at the center of the credit-default swaps business. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Crisis Commission Findings The current documents paint an especially desperate picture of Citigroup, one of the most troubled big banks, which needed several cash infusions from the government during the crisis. “In short, I will characterize the liquidity and confidence situation as negative and deteriorating such that viability may be threatened without outside support,” a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation official, Christopher J. Spoth, wrote of Citigroup in an e-mail on Nov. 21, 2008, to the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair. That late-night missive also contained a chilling summary of a call earlier that day between Citigroup’s risk management team and regulators. Shares of Citi fell 20 percent, to $3.77, on Nov. 21, 2008, and were down about 60 percent in that week. The liquidity pool of the bank, which had received its first bailout funds just a few weeks earlier, was shrinking and customers were panicking. The call summary shows that private bank deposits fell $1 billion that day, with $353 million “withdrawn due to Citi name concerns.” The bank was bleeding money elsewhere as well. At 5 p.m., the so-called broker-dealer cash box — the equity and cash that Citigroup keeps on hand to cover short sales — was valued at $15.3 billion. The pot of money had dwindled to $11.4 billion by the end of the day. Amid the turmoil, counterparties were backing away from Citigroup. “UBS initially cut equity finance lines in half to Citi, from $1.8 billion to $900 million,” the call summary said. UBS temporarily reversed its decision after Citigroup’s senior management reached out to the banks. But the call summary said UBS planned on Monday to ask Citigroup to post additional collateral and would no longer accept certain collateral. That Sunday, documents show, Ms. Bair chaired a closed-door meeting of F.D.I.C. directors to discuss Citigroup’s rapidly deteriorating financial position. Directors gathered in person and by phone to determine whether Citigroup’s ailing health posed a systemic risk. “In hindsight, I think there have been some systemic situations prior to this one that were not classified as such,” said John M. Reich, an F.D.I.C. director, according to a transcript of the meeting. “The failure of IndyMac pointed the focus to the next weakest institution, which was WaMu, and its failure pointed to Wachovia, and now we’re looking at Citi, and I wonder who’s next.” The meeting ended with an agreement that Citigroup should be considered systemically important to the American financial system. The next day regulators intervened. The Treasury, along with the F.D.I.C., agreed to provide protection against the possibility of unusually large losses on an asset pool of $306 billion of loans and securities backed by residential and commercial real estate and other assets. “Citi is a fundamentally different company today than it was before the crisis,” a company spokesman said on Wednesday. “Under Vikram Pandit’s leadership, Citi has overhauled its risk management, reduced its risk exposures and bolstered its financial strength. With the goal of supporting the American and global economic recovery, Citi is implementing a strategy based on its core banking businesses and is focused on responsible growth.” Morgan Stanley, too, was on shaky ground, before negotiating a cash infusion in October 2008 from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan. “Morgan is the ‘deer in the headlights’ and having significant stress in Europe,” wrote Amy White of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in an e-mail on Sept. 19, 2008, to several senior officials of the New York Fed, including its then-chairman, Timothy F. Geithner, currently the Treasury secretary. “It’s looking like Lehman did a few weeks ago,” Ms. White wrote, on a day when Morgan Stanley experienced $22 billion in outflows from its prime brokerage unit. As is well-known at this point, Lehman Brothers was sinking fast. In the bank’s final days, just a week or so before Ms. White’s email, Lehman desperately turned to JPMorgan Chase for advice, and a financial lifeline. “They sent the Junior Varsity — they have no proposal and are looking to us for ideas/credit line to bridge them to the first quarter when they have [sic] intend to split into good bank/bad bank,” a JPMorgan executive, John J. Hogan, wrote in a message to a colleague, Steven D. Black. Mr. Black responded, looping in his boss, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive: “Let’s give them an order for the same drugs they have apparently been taking to think that we would do something like that.” Lehman filed for bankruptcy less than a week later in the largest corporate failure in American history.

The deal, the companies said, will create the largest post-acute health care services company in the United States, with operations in 46 states and more than $6 billion in annual revenue. The combined company will have 118 long-term acute care hospitals with 8,492 beds and 226 nursing and rehabilitation centers. Under the terms of the deal, each holder of RehabCare common stock will receive $26 a share in cash and 0.471 of a share of Kindred common stock. Kindred plans to issue about 12 million shares for the deal. Kindred, which will also assume about $400 million in debt, plans to secure about $1.9 billion of long-term financing from JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Global Markets. “We believe that the combination will be highly accretive for Kindred stockholders, provide significant long-term strategic benefits to the stockholders of both companies and enhance our future growth prospects,” Paul J. Diaz, president and chief executive of Kindred, said in a statement. The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of Kindred and RehabCare, which is based in St. Louis, Mo. The deal is expected to close on June 30, and requires two members of the RehabCare board to join the Kindred Board. Morgan Stanley advised Kindred, while Citigroup was the financial adviser to RehabCare.</text></article>
