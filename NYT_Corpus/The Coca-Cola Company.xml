Martin, the architect of the plan and the top parks official at the Grand Canyon, said his superiors told him two weeks before its Jan. 1 start date that Coca-Cola, which distributes water under the Dasani brand and has donated more than $13 million to the parks, had registered its concerns about the bottle ban through the foundation, and that the project was being tabled. His account was confirmed by park, foundation and company officials. A spokesman for the National Park Service, David Barna, said it was Jon Jarvis, the top federal parks official, who made the “decision to put it on hold until we can get more information.” He added that “reducing and eliminating disposable plastic bottles is one element of our green plan. This is a process, and we are at the beginning of it.” Mr. Martin, a 35-year veteran of the park service who had risen to the No. 2 post in 2003, was disheartened by the outcome. “That was upsetting news because of what I felt were ethical issues surrounding the idea of being influenced unduly by business,” Mr. Martin said in an interview. “It was even more of a concern because we had worked with all the people who would be truly affected in their sales and bottom line, and they accepted it.” Neil J. Mulholland, president of the foundation, said that a representative of Coca-Cola had reached out to him late in the process to inquire about the reasons for the water bottle ban and how it would work. “There was not an overt statement made to me that they objected to the ban,” Mr. Mulholland said, adding, “There was never anything inferred by Coke that if this ban happens, we’re losing their support.” The foundation president noted in the interview that Coca-Cola had recently donated $80,000 for a recycling program on the Mall in Washington. A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Susan Stribling, said the company would rather help address the plastic litter problem by increasing the availability of recycling programs. “Banning anything is never the right answer,” she said. “If you do that, you don’t necessarily address the problem.” She also characterized the bottle ban as limiting personal choice. “You’re not allowing people to decide what they want to eat and drink and consume,” she said. In seeking the ban, the Grand Canyon park, under Mr. Martin’s direction from 2006 until his retirement last December, was following the example of Zion National Park, in Utah, which had instituted a similar program to great acclaim in 2008. The park service gave it an environmental achievement award in 2009 for eliminating 60,000 plastic bottles from the park in its first year. Discarded plastic bottles account for about 30 percent of the park’s total waste stream, according to the park service. Mr. Martin said the bottles are “the single biggest source of trash” found inside the canyon. Mr. Martin said he got approval to proceed with implementing the ban after he briefed his superiors in both the Denver regional office and Washington headquarters in the spring of 2010. Research showed that the park sold about $400,000 worth of bottled water in a given year. The planned ban at the Grand Canyon would have covered only smaller bottles and would not have applied to other beverages such as soda or juices. In preparation, the park and its contracted concessionaires installed more water “filling stations” for reusable bottles at a cost of about $300,000, according to information provided by the park service to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an environmental group based in Washington that has worked to uncover the underlying reasons for the abrupt turn-around on the ban. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Shares of Coke, which have gained nearly 12 percent over the last year and trade at a premium to its peers, were down 0.4 percent to $66.74. A majority of the company’s sales comes from outside the United States, so shifts in currency and the effects of hedging strategies can affect results. Coke’s third-quarter profit came in slightly above Wall Street estimates, helped by higher sales volume and price increases, as well as the currency benefit. Third-quarter net income rose to $2.22 billion, or 95 cents a share, from $2.06 billion, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were $1.03 a share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting $1.02, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 45 percent to $12.25 billion, raised by last year’s acquisition of North American bottling operations, price increases and a 5 percentage point currency benefit. Analysts expected $12.01 billion. But the company said currency exchange rates would reduce its fourth-quarter operating income by a low- to midsingle-digit percentage rate, while still increasing full-year income by the low- to midsingle digits.</text></article>

The Coca-Cola Company is bringing out another commercial in the popular, long-running series of “Happiness Factory” spots for its flagship Coca-Cola brand. The commercial is to be introduced on Friday on the Coca-Cola fan page on Facebook. An event page has also been set up on Facebook to promote the premiere of the spot. The commercial is the first new installment in the “Happiness Factory” series in three years. It will be the fifth spot in the series, which began in 2006. Like the previous four spots, the new commercial is the result of collaboration among the Amsterdam office of the Wieden &amp; Kennedy advertising agency; Psyop, a production company; and Human, a music company. The new commercial, called “The Great Happyfication,” runs about six and a half minutes and features strange and wonderful animated characters in the vein of those from the previous spots. The premise remains the same, too, that a Coke vending machine is actually a “happiness factory” and a coin dropped into the slot takes a magical journey that ends with the delivery of a cold bottle of Coca-Cola. “The Great Happyfication” offers viewers several snappy songs and dances and ends with an elaborate production number. The songs are meant, as a character named Pete puts it, to “share the secret formula for happiness” — a sly reference to the famous secret formula for Coca-Cola. The songs address ways to be happy, get happy or stay happy, among them having friends, being curious, looking for love and being active. The commercial is to run in social media and online.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/a-redesigned-brand-hopes-to-avoid-tropicana-storm/?ref=cocacolacompany">A Redesigned Brand Hopes to Avoid Tropicana Storm<date>August 31, 2011, 12:40 pm</date><text>As an up-and-coming beverage brand gets a new look, executives are hoping to avoid a redesign debacle like the one that roiled Tropicana orange juice. Honest Tea, which sells organic drinks under the Honest Tea and Honest Ade names, will soon bring out new labels for its plastic bottles. An announcement is expected to be made on Thursday. The labels are meant to be less cluttered than the current ones, brighter-looking and more inviting to potential customers. For instance, fruits that appear on the labels of products like Honest Tea Peach White Tea and Honest Ade Pomegranate Blue will now be shown cut open rather than closed and whole. Such details may seem picayune, but what a label looks like on a crowded shelf could make the difference between a product’s being bought and being overlooked. Worse yet, a design that consumers deem unappealing could actually cost a brand business, as PepsiCo learned in 2009. That was when a redesign of packaging for Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice was widely castigated –- and followed by a significant slump in sales. PepsiCo hastily restored the original design. nytimes.com/2009/02/23/business/media/23adcol.html “You want to make sure you’ve got your best outfit on,” said Seth Goldman, president and “teaE.O.,” as he calls himself, at Honest Tea in Bethesda, Md. The changes came after discussions with consumers in focus groups and talking with the Honest Tea sales force, he added. “It was not done without a great deal of hand-wringing,” Mr. Goldman said, laughing. “We went back to the drawing room several times.” “It can always be a little risky,” he added. For one thing, some fans of the Honest beverages may misconstrue the redesign. The changes come about six months after the Coca-Cola Company, which owned a minority stake in Honest Tea, decided to exercise its option to buy the rest of the company. Those consumers who say Coke is “‘changing everything’” are wrong, Mr. Goldman said, because “that’s not the case.” Rather, he said, the changes were in the works for a while, prompted by problems that became apparent with the previous label designs. For instance, the name Honest Tea or Honest Ade “didn’t pop out at you” on shelves, Mr. Goldman said. And with the previous designs, he added, the two types of beverages “didn’t necessarily look related.” Perhaps the biggest change is the disappearance of black bands at the top and bottom of the labels. Now, the labels are white. The caps will remain black, though. The label redesign is being handled by Turner Duckworth, an agency that specializes in brand identity and package design, along with an internal team at Honest Tea. To promote the new labels, there will be signs in stores as well as sampling events. There will also be promotions in social media like Facebook (facebook.com/HonestTea) and Twitter (Twitter.com/HonestTea). The new labels will be phased in slowly, Mr. Goldman said, and will most likely arrive at warehouses around Sept. 12 before showing up in stores. There is a chance that Honest Tea will also redesign the labels on its glass bottles based on the response to this label redesign, he added. The plastic bottles account for more than 60 percent of sales.</text></article>

I learned strategy early; if I couldn’t figure out where they all were and avoid them, one would always give me a job. My nickname was Remote Control because they would always make me get up to change the TV channel.My father worked for Coca-Cola, so I grew up with a very famous brand. He was vice president for prestige accounts, with clients like the United States Olympic Committee and Disney. I put myself through the University of Georgia by working in two bars. First, I was a barback, stocking liquor and doing anything else required, and was later promoted to bartender. Then I managed a bar called Crazy Zack’s in Athens, Ga., my last two years of college. I often say I learned more about people while standing behind a bar than perhaps in any other job I’ve had. It taught me to read people and to size them up. After graduating in 1980, I got a job with E.&amp; J. Gallo Winery as a salesman in Mississippi. After a couple of years, I left and worked for Coke in its wine division, the Wine Spectrum, in California. I hadn’t intended to work for the same company as my father. I was due to be promoted at Gallo when my boss called and said Wine Spectrum was a competitor and since my father worked for its parent company, they were firing me. It was daunting to be fired right out of school for something I had no control over, but it was a good lesson in corporate politics. I ended up working for Wine Spectrum for two years while attending Pepperdine University at night for an M.B.A. In the 1980’s, Wine Spectrum was sold to Seagram and I transferred to Seagram as part of the sale. After 18 months at Seagram, I returned to Coke in the fountain department, which sold syrup to institutions and other places having soda fountains. Like Gallo, Seagram was a fine company, but I wanted to move on. Doug Ivester, then the president of Coca-Cola North America, suggested that I replace my father when he retired. In 1990, I spent a year apprenticing under my dad, then took over prestige accounts for four years. Working for your father in a big corporation isn’t that common, and it’s not always easy. It deepened my relationship with him because I got to see him in a different light. From the mid-1990s to 2004, I was promoted to president of the Coca-Cola fountain unit and then to president of Coca-Cola North America and Latin America. After leaving Coke in 2004 by mutual agreement, I became interested in private-equity-backed companies and spent a year consulting for them. One of these companies, Willis Stein &amp; Partners, had an interest in Ubiquity Brands, the parent company of several snack food businesses, and appointed me in 2005 as Ubiquity’s president and C.E.O. In 2007, I led the sale of Lincoln Snacks to ConAgra and of Jay’s Foods to Snyder’s of Hanover. The process required some tough decisions that affected a lot of people. I learned that it’s crucial to address the difficult issues up front and to be open and honest. People can deal with almost anything as long as you treat them with respect and give them timely information. When the opportunity came to lead Bolthouse Farms, which grows and processes more than a billion pounds of carrots a year and produces juices and salad dressings, I felt that I could bridge the skills I had developed and work on healthy products. I joined as president and C.E.O. in 2009. Everything comes together for me in this position. I love sales and marketing, but walking in the carrot fields brings me back to the people who farm the land. It feels right. As told to Patricia R. Olsen.</text></article>

The company, whose brands include Sprite, Vitaminwater and Powerade, does the majority of its business outside the United States. That has kept it in favor with investors despite home market struggles, where anemic jobs growth has dulled sales of soft drinks. At the same time, volatility in commodity markets will lead to about $700 million in increased costs this year for things like packaging, sweeteners and fruit. Coke said it had raised North American prices 1 to 2 percent in the first half of the year, and had already started work on additional increases that should total 2 to 3 percent for the year, even though such moves might lead some budget-conscious consumers to cut back. “There’s no question that the U.S. consumer is still mixed, confused and somewhat apprehensive,” Muhtar Kent, Coke’s chief executive, told Reuters. Still, Philip Gorham, an analyst at Morningstar, said raising prices again could be difficult, given the delicate state of consumer spending after weak jobs growth in June. “Pricing should be led by the consumer, but the trouble is the consumer, particularly at the low end, is driven by unemployment, which is back up,” Mr. Gorham said. “I just don’t think the environment is right to raise prices.” Coke also said it planned to buy back at least $2.5 billion in stock by the end of the year, after it suspended buybacks in the second quarter because of discussions it was having regarding a “strategic option” for the company, like an acquisition. The discussions are no longer happening, Coke said. Coke reported net income of $2.80 billion, or $1.20 a share for the second quarter that ended on July 1, up from $2.37 billion, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.17 a share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 47 percent, to $12.74 billion, fueled by last year’s purchase of North American bottling operations, price increases and a 6 percent benefit from foreign exchange rates. Analysts were expecting revenue of $12.38 billion. The company said the integration of its bottler was progressing according to plan, with 2011 cost savings of $140 million to $150 million expected. In addition, the company said its productivity initiatives were on track to slightly exceed its expectations for annual savings of $400 million to $500 million by the end of 2011. Shares of Coca-Cola rose $2.20, or 3.3 percent, to $69.32. Earlier they rose to $69.45, the highest level since June 1999. Shares of PepsiCo, which plans to report its quarterly results on Thursday, rose 54 cents, to $68.54.</text></article>

The Coca-Cola Company will mark its quasquicentennial next week, reflecting that the first Coca-Cola was served by John S. Pemberton on May 8, 1886 at a pharmacy in Atlanta. There will be an event in Atlanta for employees and their families on Monday, which is to be streamed live online at Coca-Cola.com/125 and have a presence in social media like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. There are marketing plans being made for commemorations in most of the countries in which Coca-Cola is sold. For instance, a special television commercial has been produced to run in Britain. In the United States, television commercials for Coca-Cola will be modified to change the tag line, “Open happiness,” to “125 years of sharing happiness.” There will also be a campaign, to run throughout the summer, that will carry the theme “125 years of summer fun” and extend for 125 days. The campaign will include a new bottle size, with 1.25 liters of Coke, to be sold in stores, and commemorative versions of an existing bottle size, with eight ounces of Coke. There will also be 125 days of prize giveaways in the United States, through the existing My Coke Rewards program as well as through text-to-win codes that will be printed under the caps of various brands in the Coca-Cola trademark line-up. Other elements of the campaign will include a message during the 125th lap of the Coca-Cola 600 race, displays in stores to mark the anniversary and collectible cups at outlets like fast-food restaurants. Not everyone plans to join in wishing the Coke brand a happy anniversary. Michael F. Jacobson, executive director for the advocacy organization Center for Science in the Public Interest, wrote an article for the MomsRising blog that bears the title “Coke Turns 125: Why I’m Not Celebrating.” Mr. Jacobson, in his post, describes nondiet carbonated soft drinks as “liquid candy” and declares that it would be “a public health disaster” if Coca-Cola was able to sell “more Coke to more kids more often.”</text></article>

Founded in 1977 by Bill and Jan Schmidt, who owned a Coke bottling plant, the Schmidt Museum of Coca-Cola Memorabilia displayed antique delivery trucks, a marble and onyx soda fountain, trays, posters, jewelry, clocks and vending machines. The collection ranked “definitely among the top three” in private Coke holdings, said Phil Mooney, the archivist for the Coca-Cola Company. Maryland auctioneer Richard Opfer will handle a series of sales in the next few years at the museum, which are expected to total $10 million. The first auction will offer about 900 pieces. “We don’t want to flood the market–we don’t want to harm the values of anybody else’s collection,” said Larry Schmidt, the museum’s managing director. The closing was not announced in advance, he added, “to just keep it positive up to the last day.”</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/business/media/04adnewsletter1.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Now, Hit ‘Play’ if You Want a Fanta<date>Published: April 4, 2011</date><text>In the late 1960s, PepsiCo sold its flagship soft drink with a slogan that proclaimed, “Taste that beats the others cold, Pepsi pours it on.” These many years later, it is the PepsiCo rival, the Coca-Cola Company, that seems to be letting loose.Coca-Cola is vigorously pushing back against PepsiCo across a variety of beverage brand lines, seeking to maintain the gains that were embodied last year by Diet Coke’s overtaking Pepsi-Cola to become the No. 2 soda in the United States behind regular Coke. Coca-Cola has stepped up efforts for Coke, as well as Diet Coke, and continues to pour on the marketing support for Coke Zero, Powerade and Vitaminwater. There are also new campaigns for Sprite lemon-lime soda, Minute Maid orange juice and Fuze juices and teas. Last week, Coca-Cola added another brand to those ranks, introducing a global initiative for Fanta, the fruit-flavored soft drinks that come in varieties like orange, grape, pineapple, grapefruit, apple and strawberry. The campaign carries the theme “More Fanta. Less serious,” which is sometimes also appearing as “Less serious.” The campaign is the brainchild of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of WPP, the creative agency of record for Fanta. The Ogilvy New York flagship led the charge, supported by offices in cities like London and São Paulo. Psyop, the animation studio that creates the “Happiness Factory” commercials and video clips for the Coke brand, is also taking part in the Fanta campaign, developing a cast of cartoonlike multicultural characters who enjoy less serious lives filled with fun. The playful characters appear in television spots; on billboards, posters and store signs; in print advertisements; on fanta.com, the brand Web site, where they turn up in videos and on wallpaper and screen savers; on the brand’s Facebook page ; and on the Fanta channel on YouTube. So far, the characters do not seem to have a presence on the Fanta Twitter account, but who knows? Maybe they are the ones overseeing the Twitter feed. The campaign seeks to build on ads bearing the “Less serious” theme that have been running for five years in regions like Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Like those ads, the new ones are intended to appeal to teenagers, who consume vast quantities of flavored soft drinks, and also to mothers who frequently buy beverages for their offspring. Fanta is one of the Coca-Cola Company’s biggest brands, with annual sales in 190 countries that are estimated at more than $12 billion. In some countries, it outsells all Coca-Cola products except for Coke. But until now, Coca-Cola executives say, Fanta has not had the kind of huge, worldwide campaign that brands like Coke and Diet Coke (also known as Coke Light overseas) have. Fanta has “enjoyed double-digit growth in many, many markets,” says Jonathan Mildenhall, vice president for advertising strategy and content excellence at the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta. “The momentum is already quite impressive,” he adds. “We know we can accelerate it.” Executives at Coca-Cola are calling the “Less serious” campaign the largest and most unified ever for Fanta. Although they decline to discuss spending, they describe it using terms like “substantial,” which is corporate-speak for beaucoup bucks. According to Kantar Media, a division of WPP, Coca-Cola spent $4.1 million last year to advertise Fanta in the United States. The brand was restaged in this country in 2009, playing up its natural flavors and caffeine-free formula. The goal at the Coca-Cola Company is to celebrate a “universal truth” about a brand, Mr. Mildenhall says, and “an intrinsic product attribute.” So if the sales pitch for Coke is that “when you drink Coke, you drink in a wonderful, uplifting sense of being happy,” Mr. Mildenhall says, Fanta is being presented as the epitome and enabler of “a more playful attitude.” “Fanta is a credible champion of play,” he says, adding: “Fanta wants everyone to play more. Fanta is all about play; it’s bright, it’s bubbly.” Indeed, for the last couple of years the Fanta brand theme in overseas markets was “Fanta. Play on.” Research during the last five years has helped Coca-Cola executives “understand what the drivers of play are,” Mr. Mildenhall says, for “teens all around the world.” For one thing, teenagers prize a peer who can lighten up “a tense moment” with a joke, he adds, and value him or her for being able to “make my world more playful.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Muammar el-Qaddafi shape the nation’s economy.Two of Colonel Qaddafi’s sons began to fight for control of the local Coca-Cola bottling company, and their battle turned into an armed confrontation dominated by a militia loyal to one of the sons, according to American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. The dispute was settled when Colonel Qaddafi’s daughter intervened, but only after at least one worker was hurt, one Qaddafi cousin was stuffed into the trunk of a car and the Coca-Cola plant was shut down for months, the cables said. The episode provides a rare, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the Qaddafis and more broadly underscores how the whims of ruling families have tainted the climate for economic development in parts of the Arab world. In the 1990s, with Libya chafing under international sanctions, Coca-Cola did not have a bottling plant in the country. Instead, it was distributed through a franchise in neighboring Tunisia. It was only after Colonel Qaddafi abandoned his nuclear weapons program in 2003 and sanctions were relaxed by the West that American companies, including Coca-Cola, began to invest there again. Coca-Cola’s new bottling plant opened in 2005 through a local franchise known as the Global Beverage Company. But almost immediately, two of Colonel Qaddafi’s sons, Mutassim and Mohammed, began to compete for control of Global Beverage. The feud burst into view in late 2005, just two weeks after the plant opened, when security troops loyal to Mutassim occupied the bottling plant in Tripoli, according to a 2006 State Department cable. His militia occupied the plant until February 2006, blocking production. The State Department cable recounts how on Dec. 28, 2005, “Two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility, asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant.” Mutassim’s forces quickly took control of the plant after one foreign worker was injured and some equipment was destroyed. During the plant’s occupation, managers were initially allowed to enter the plant “singly or in pairs,” but later Coca-Cola employees were barred completely. Over the following weeks, company shareholders received extortion demands from “freelancers” while anonymous callers threatened the plant’s foreign workers with “political problems” or physical harm, according to the cable. “At no time did any Libyan authority offer a legal justification for the plant’s shutdown,” the cable said, recounting complaints from business officials involved. The battle reached a peak in February 2006, when men loyal to Mutassim went to Mohammed’s residence, where they abducted and assaulted one of his cousins, who is also one of Mohammed’s in-laws, in order to “send a signal to The Engineer (Mohammed),” according to the cable. Mutassim’s associates arrived at “Mohammed’s residence and began shouting for him to come out,” the cable says, quoting a witness. “Receiving no response, they left in search of one of Mohammed’s cousins, whom they stowed in the trunk of one of their cars and brought back to the residence.” One of the company’s board members received a hurried call warning him to leave Tripoli before Mutassim’s men could find him. Finally, their sister, Aisha Qaddafi, appeared to have become fed up with the fighting and brokered a deal between her brothers. According to the cable, the compromise called for Mohammed to sell his shares in the bottling operation, and in return Mutassim would call off his men and leave the company alone. One person caught in the middle of the fight told an official from the United States Embassy, according to one of the cables, that “although he had heard stories about doing business in Libya, he never imagined that what transpired was still possible here. ‘You know the movie, ‘The Godfather’? We’ve been living it for the last few months.’ ” On Wednesday, Kerry Tressler, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola at the company’s headquarters in Atlanta, acknowledged that in 2006 there had been “a period of uncertainty about the local ownership of the bottler” in Libya, but that the problem was eventually resolved. She said that production and distribution at the bottling plant have now stopped because of the protests and unrest. The State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said it would have no comment on the cables’ revelations.</text></article>

One More to Add to the File<date>Published: February 19, 2011</date><text>ATLANTA — Over the years, the public radio show “This American Life” has done some ambitious work. It was the first media outlet in the country to broadcast lengthy interviews with Guantánamo Bay prisoners. It sent reporters to Iraq for a month. And it exposed the misdeeds of a hedge fund.So what other topic could be so weighty, so captivating that it would cause the radio show’s Web site to crash under a stampede of visitors? A soft-drink recipe. The host, Ira Glass, revealed on last weekend’s show what he claimed was the original formula for Coca-Cola. He found it buried in a little-noticed article in the archives of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The recipe spread across the Internet, republished everywhere from CNN to Al Jazeera. A television show in Australia made its own Coke on air. Brewers in the United States swapped tips on finding the best sources for key ingredients like coriander oil and citric acid. “It’s sobering,” Mr. Glass said. “We’ve done a lot of serious reporting on many serious things. But nothing that got the attention that we got from taking on a soft drink.” Coke, as it always does, insists the recipe is inaccurate. The real formula, it says, remains in a bank vault in Atlanta. America has long been excited by the promise of cracking the culinary code of its favorite foods. It is simple human curiosity applied to the meals we love most. Within families, aging cooks hold their place by refusing to give up the key ingredient to the Sunday spaghetti sauce until children can be trusted with the secret. Companies, too, have long seized on the power of culinary secrets. KFC’s famous “11 herbs and spices” and McDonald’s “secret sauce” have helped make the companies billions. The allure makes some loyal customers even more devoted. Not that long ago, normally right-thinking cooks got so obsessed with creating the Twinkie at home that Williams-Sonoma began selling the molds. Todd Wilbur, a former television reporter, has built an entire empire on selling top-secret recipes in books and on his Web site. What’s notable is that some people now want to know secret corporate recipes with the passion others reserve for heirloom family recipes, said Laura Shapiro, a food historian and author. When food made in factories became part of the American diet at the turn of the last century, it was marketed as clean, pure and close to homemade. Then, things changed. Marketers exploited the convenience, unique tastes and secret formulas that could come only from a corporate test kitchen. And Americans grew more intrigued. “People think of packaged food as notably elusive,” she said. “Like how does that little blob of cream get inside the Hostess cupcake? Then you are curious and sometimes madly curious, as they are in this case.” But no company has a history of secrecy quite like Coke, which claims that only a handful of senior executives know how to make the soda flavoring it calls “Merchandise 7x.” In 1960, the author E. J. Kahn Jr. listed many of the original ingredients for Coke in his book “The Big Drink.” Then came the 1979 article in the Atlanta newspaper that “This American Life” rediscovered. And in the 1990s, the historian Mark Pendergrast found a recipe in the company’s own archives, written by the beverage’s inventor. But in all of these cases, Coca-Cola denied their authenticity. Not that the company minds the attempts. “What a tremendous tribute to this product that for 125 years nobody has been able to replicate the taste of Coca-Cola,” said Phil Mooney, the company’s archivist. The company does not file trademark lawsuits against imitators because it would have to reveal the actual formula in court. With that protection assured, Mr. Pendergrast plans to release yet another early version of the recipe in the next version of his book “For God, Country and Coca-Cola.” He is already anticipating the public reaction. “People want to have their cake and eat it, too,” he said. Even though they love learning secrets, they love having secrets. As long as Coke denies the imitations, many drinkers will continue to believe there is only one Real Thing. Mr. Mooney, the Coke archivist, says other recipes only make Coke taste better by comparison. “They’ll make this recipe, and then they’ll come crawling back to Coke,” he told Mr. Glass. “Real Coke will have never tasted so good.”</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/business/10coke.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Coke Earnings and Sales Soar After Bottler Purchase<date>Published: February 9, 2011</date><text>Coca-Cola on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales as it gained market share, and expanded in each of its major markets for the first time in at least five years.The results are the first to include Coke’s North American bottling operations. The improvement in the company’s home region showed that the October acquisition was paying off, just as the economic recovery was gathering steam. Coke shares, a component in the Dow Jones industrial average, closed up 0.45 percent to $63.15 after rising as much as 2.9 percent earlier in the session. Both Coke and its rival PepsiCo bought their North American bottlers last year as a way to improve performance by cutting costs, speeding innovation and giving themselves more control over distribution. Coke’s fourth-quarter net income rose to $5.77 billion, or $2.46 a share, from $1.54 billion, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings of 72 cents a share met the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue jumped 40 percent to $10.5 billion, topping analysts’ forecast of $10 billion. The bottler acquisition accounted for the bulk of the gain. Price increases, and selling a larger proportion of higher-price drinks, contributed two percentage points of growth. That more than offset the effect of Coke selling most of its drinks in international markets, where they often cost less than in the United States. The company said it planned to raise prices in the United States this year as it faces $300 million to $400 million in cost increases related to spikes in corn, juice, metal and plastic. Worldwide sales volume rose 6 percent in the quarter. Excluding the distribution of some Dr Pepper Snapple Group brands taken over with the bottling purchase, volume was up 5 percent. Including the benefit of those brands, volume rose 8 percent in North America, 5 percent in Latin America, 2 percent in Europe, 14 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment, and 1 percent in the Pacific region. It has been five or six years since the company has posted growth in all of its operating segments, its chief executive, Muhtar Kent, told Reuters.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/business/media/01adcol.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Super Bowl Ads Carry High Hopes<date>Published: January 31, 2011</date><text>MOST marketers that typically advertise in the Super Bowl sell brands with broad appeal and long histories, the better to resonate with the mass audiences that watch the game each year.For instance, for Super Bowl XLV, to be broadcast by Fox on Sunday, the sponsor roster includes Chevrolet, which turns 100 this year; Coca-Cola, 125; Mercedes-Benz, also 125; and Stella Artois, a beer introduced in 1926 that traces its roots to 1366. So what is Groupon, the purveyor of digital coupons that started in November 2008, doing in the game? Groupon executives hope their commercial in the Super Bowl, along with spots before and after, will help build awareness for the brand. Groupon has hired Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky — the MDC Partners agency known for offbeat ads for marketers like Burger King and Domino’s — to create the commercials. “We decided it was time to expose this brand in a big way, on the biggest stage,” said Rob Solomon, president and chief operating officer at Groupon in Chicago, referring to the Super Bowl’s usually being the most-watched television show each year. • Expectations are high for Super Bowl commercials because the large audiences anticipate fresh, imaginative spots they have not seen before. “It daunts the heck out of us,” Mr. Solomon said, “but Groupon has become a pretty interesting brand, and as a first-time advertiser we should be able to compete effectively.” “We’re humbled by the great brands” with extensive pedigrees that are advertising in the game, he added, “and since we aspire to be one, we should start now.” Those sentiments echo the bold words of many previous first-time Super Bowl advertisers, particularly the start-up dot-coms that crammed into the game in 2000. Seventeen advertised in Super Bowl XXXIV, among them Computer.com, Netpliance.com, OurBeginning.com, Oxygen.com, Pets.com and WebMD.com. The dot-com crash that followed wiped out almost all of them, raising questions about the effectiveness of using a high-stakes platform like the Super Bowl to generate awareness. “No way,” Mr. Solomon said when asked if there were grounds to call Groupon the Pets.com of 2011. Many of the dot-coms of 2000 “didn’t have a business model,” he said, whereas “we do, and we generate significant revenue.” (Groupon recently rejected a $6 billion takeover bid from Google, raised $950 million from large investors and is moving ahead with plans for an initial public offering that may value the company at $15 billion or more.) Mr. Solomon declined to discuss the content of the Groupon spot in the Super Bowl, which is planned for the third quarter, other than to describe it as “irreverent and humorous.” Brands like Chevrolet, which is buying five commercials in the game, and Coca-Cola, which will have two, have different reasons from Groupon for being Super Bowl sponsors. “We have 100 percent awareness,” said Chris Perry, vice president for United States marketing at the Chevrolet parent, General Motors in Detroit. “Everyone has heard of Chevrolet.” Rather, Chevrolet will run its spots, in the first, second and fourth quarters, to persuade car and truck buyers to give the brand the kind of consideration it enjoyed in previous decades. “We’re there with a mission, to make it difficult to not put Chevy on your shopping list this year,” said Joel Ewanick, global chief marketing officer at General Motors. The five Chevrolet spots, by Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group, will promote four models — Camaro, Cruze Eco, Silverado HD and Volt — and urge viewers to stay tuned for a spot to run in an episode of the Fox series “Glee” after the game. The Camaro spot will double as a commercial for the coming movie “Transformers: Dark of the Moon,” which will also be promoted in a commercial from the film’s studio, the Paramount Pictures division of Viacom. Like Chevrolet, Coca-Cola, which plans to run its commercials in the second and third quarters, has universal awareness. So its presence in the Super Bowl is more about trying to “express the brand’s values and beliefs,” said Pio Schunker, senior vice president for creative excellence at Coca-Cola North America in Atlanta. “We view this as our own personal State of the Union,” he added. One commercial depicts rival border guards who place their mistrust on “pause” by sharing soft drinks. In the other, a bottle of Coke ends a siege in an animated kingdom. Both are by Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. Coca-Cola executives will watch whether the commercials help “lead to long-lasting brand attribute changes,” said Katie Bayne, president for sparkling beverages at Coca-Cola North America, increasing the number of consumers who agree with statements like “ ‘Coke connects people’ ” and “ ‘Coke is a brand for me.’ ” The border spot is intended to celebrate “the small moment of human connection” that Coke can facilitate, she added, and the animated spot is meant to bring to life “the triumphant idea behind ‘Open happiness,’ ” the current Coke ad theme. Although Stella Artois describes its pedigree as predating Coke’s by a few centuries, its Super Bowl goal is more like Groupon’s. “Obviously, the Super Bowl is an enormous platform, a great day in America for beer,” said Andy Goeler, vice president for imports, crafts and specialties at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, part of Anheuser-Busch InBev. “It’s a wonderful time to let consumers know more about Stella.” • A 60-second commercial, to appear in the third quarter, will be the first that Anheuser-Busch has run for an imported beer in the Super Bowl. (There will also be a spot for Budweiser and three for Bud Light.) The commercial, by the Mother agency in London, features the actor Adrien Brody singing in a jazz club circa 1960. “We, frankly, think this spot is special enough to warrant running on the Super Bowl,” Mr. Goeler said. “Stella is stepping up to the next level.” Fox is charging an estimated $2.8 million to $3 million for each 30 seconds of commercial time in Super Bowl XLV. Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, estimates that Fox, part of the News Corporation, will take in more than $200 million in ad revenue for those spots. Among the other advertisers scheduled to be in the game are Audi, BMW, Best Buy, Bridgestone, CareerBuilder, CarMax, Cars.com, the Chrysler Group, Walt Disney Pictures, E*Trade, GoDaddy.com, HomeAway, Hyundai, Kia, Mars, PepsiCo, Skechers, Teleflora, Universal Pictures and Volkswagen. Also, Motorola Mobility plans to run a spot in the second quarter by the Anomaly agency in New York for the new Xoom tablet.</text></article>

Curtis Jackson, more commonly known as 50 Cent, has parlayed his career as a hip-hop artist into a multifaceted business and a tidy personal fortune. His minority investment in Glacéau turned into a windfall when Coca-Cola purchased the maker of Vitamin Water for $4.1 billion in 2007. Mr. Jackson has plowed the proceeds and other earnings into new investments, like Gunnar, a company that makes eyeglasses for heavy computer users to reduce eye strain. One of Facebook‘s early backers, Peter Thiel, is also an investor. Mr. Jackson spoke with DealBook on Friday from Las Vegas, where he is promoting his latest business venture, a line of headphones he has co-created with Sleek Audio: “Sleek By 50 Cent.” He has not invested in Facebook like Mr. Thiel. Still he speculates on the value of the social networking behemoth, saying its worth $50 billion, if not more. Q. Why are you increasing your investments in the technology sector? A. Well I’m just aware of things changing around me. As far as social networking goes, I developed ThisIs50.com. It has over 700,000 registered members and 30 million uniques per month. While a good idea is not really hard to find, finance to support those ideas is difficult. I have an aura, a business man’s aura. People know I’m conscientious, and I will make investments. Q. What is your average investment size these days? A. It depends on the actual company, and how much I believe in the growth of it. Like Gunnar, this could potentially be a billion dollar, profitable company. Q. How much did you invest? A. You want to know exactly how much money I invest? I’m not going to tell you that. If you come to work for me … Q. Are you worried about things getting overheated in tech? A. Well, nawh. Even in advertisement, you see more online advertisement than physical ads being purchased. When you see the things that were part of the traditional market no longer having the same value and you see where the shift is, where its growing versus where it is deteriorating, I think it’s clear what area you should be focused on. Q. Do you think Facebook is worth $50 billion? A. They brought in $2 billion in revenues this year. So how many years before it phases out or if it phases out? They just have to do different things to keep it advanced. I’m sure people are working on it. Q. What do you think it’s actually worth? A. Why isn’t there two Facebooks or three? Because it’s difficult to get that many people in one place and comfortable with the functions of that network. So I think it is worth that kind of money, maybe more, because everyone is aware of how to utilize it. The kids are converting to the web and computers, so easy, that it’s unbelievable. Things that I got to sit and have explained to me three or four times, my son is doing the first time, because he’s learning at a different rate. I’ll be honest in that area. I’ve seen him doing things and I go: how you do that, show me that again. Q. How many hours do you spend on social media sites per day? A. An hour, an hour and a half. Q. Did you try to invest in Facebook? A. No. I’ve had some money in Goldman. Q. How do you make investment decisions? Is there a group? A. They present ideas to me, and I make the decision. In the beginning, I’d rather invest in a dice game than the stock market. At least when the dice got rolling, I knew whether I won or I lost. When you’re not informed on it, you stay away from it. But I got a good group of people around me now, to explain things.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/business/media/04adco.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Pepsi to Sponsor ‘The X Factor’<date>Published: January 3, 2011</date><text>THERE are Coke people, and there are Pepsi people. But for Simon Cowell, who is moving from “American Idol” to “The X Factor,“ that allegiance — which quite often lasts a lifetime — is about to take a turn.Fox will announce Tuesday that Pepsi is the sole season-long sponsor for “The X Factor,” a singing competition that Mr. Cowell is bringing to the United States in the fall. Pepsi will have commercial time and integrations within “X Factor,” and the two brands will support each other on the Web and in stores. With the sponsorship deal, the Fox network is able to have it both ways: it has Coca-Cola locked up on “Idol” in the winter and spring, and now it will have Pepsi on “X Factor” in the fall. The sponsorship appears to be a victory for Pepsi in the never-ending Cola Wars — assuming that viewers take to “X Factor” the way Fox and Pepsi hope they do. Thanks to Mr. Cowell’s backing and its status as a hit overseas, there is already a significant amount of interest in “The X Factor,” and Fox is trying to stir it up further: in November, at least 10 months before the show’s premiere, the network started to run short commercials for it. “Coming to America Fall 2011,” the commercials say, trying to set up “X Factor” as a television event.  Late last year, Coke, Pepsi and other beverage companies participated in what Fox called a “jump ball negotiation” to be the exclusive beverage brand in “X Factor.” Frank Cooper, a senior vice president at PepsiCo, rebuffed questions about the Cola Wars in an interview. But when asked if he took any personal joy in stealing the “X Factor” franchise from Coke, he laughed and said, “We love winning.” “There is absolutely personal joy in getting the ‘X Factor’ property. I love it,” he said. “But I love it mostly because of what we can do with it.” Along with commercials, Pepsi and Fox will work together on marketing off the air and a joint Web site. Mr. Cooper said the social media and local community parts of the “Pepsi Refresh Project” — which lets people vote to give grants to deserving groups — would be used as a template for “X Factor.” Mr. Cowell, too, talked up the online opportunities for “X Factor” and Pepsi. “The social community, the Internet, is going to be a vital part of building up the buzz about this show,” he said in an interview on Monday. It is “extraordinary” to sign up a partner for a show that is still the better part of a year away from its premiere, said Jean Rossi, the executive vice president of sales for Fox and the president of Fox One, the cross-platform sales arm of Fox’s parent, the News Corporation. “Because of the way we want to co-promote this — being able to leverage some of Pepsi’s assets to get the promotion out there to launch the show — we felt we needed to get out early on this,” she explained. Fox will sell commercial time on “X Factor” as part of its upfront sales presentations in the spring.The American version of “X Factor” has been in development for an unusually long time. The show, which will be produced by FremantleMedia North America and Mr. Cowell’s Syco Television, was announced 12 months ago in conjunction with Mr. Cowell’s exit from “Idol.” Like “Idol,” it is a search for a musical superstar, but there are differences in the formats. Notably, “X Factor” auditions both individuals and groups, and does so in front of live audiences. Contestants on “X Factor” are divided into four categories, each mentored by a different judge. “X Factor” “has a lot of things going for it,” said Todd Gordon, the senior vice president and managing director of broadcast for Initiative, an ad buying firm, citing Mr. Cowell’s brand as a judge and the international track record of the show. FremantleMedia says “X Factor,” which originated in Britain, has been shown in more than 20 territories around the world.  “Idol,” the country’s most-watched reality show, has proved to be a hugely important vehicle for advertising. There were more product placements in “Idol” than in any other television series by far last year, according to Nielsen. Along with Coke, “Idol” has two other major sponsors, Ford Motor and AT&amp;T. While Fox has decided to make Pepsi the only season-long sponsor of “X Factor,” the network may sign up a couple of other partners for shorter periods. In “Idol,” “X Factor” and Fox’s other shows, integrated ad deals last one season with the right of first refusal the next season — a structure that protects Pepsi if “X Factor” is a dud. Pepsi had its eye on “X Factor” for much of last year, but the bidding for the beverage category partnership did not begin until the fall. The companies would not confirm a report on Deadline.com last month that the bids ranged from $50 million to $100 million. “It is a deal that none of us went into lightly,” Mr. Cooper, from PepsiCo, said, adding, “The money was not the most critical thing. The most significant question was, ‘What can we get out of this property?’ “ Pepsi will have regular commercial time throughout the season of “X Factor,” and its brand and its products will also be integrated into the show. Perhaps there will be blue Pepsi cups on the judges’ table, just as there are red Coke cups on “Idol.” But “that to me would be the wallpaper,” Mr. Cooper said. “We’re really going a layer deeper.” The specifics, he said, will be hashed out in the months ahead. Speaking for Pepsi, Mr. Cooper said, “We believe in the power of Simon Cowell.” Mr. Cowell, too, praised Pepsi as being the “right fit" for his show. Mr. Cowell sensed a trick question when he was asked which beverage he personally preferred. He thanked Coke for its support for “Idol” over the years, and he ended the interview by saying, “I do love the taste of Pepsi, yes.”</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/15/business/15soda.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Save the Children Breaks With Soda Tax Effort<date>Published: December 14, 2010</date><text>Over the last year, Save the Children emerged as a leader in the push to tax sweetened soft drinks as a way to combat childhood obesity. The nonprofit group supported soda tax campaigns in Mississippi, New Mexico, Washington State, Philadelphia and the District of Columbia.At the same time, executives at Save the Children were seeking a major grant from Coca-Cola to help finance the health and education programs that the charity conducts here and abroad, including its work on childhood obesity. The talks with Coke are still going on. But the soda tax work has been stopped. In October, Save the Children surprised activists around the country with an e-mail message announcing that it would no longer support efforts to tax soft drinks. In interviews this month, Carolyn Miles, chief operating officer of Save the Children, said there was no connection between the group’s about-face on soda taxes and the discussions with Coke. A $5 million grant from PepsiCo also had no influence on the decision, she said. Both companies fiercely oppose soda taxes. Ms. Miles said that after Save the Children took a prominent role in several soda tax campaigns, executives reviewed the issue and decided it was too controversial to continue. “We looked at it and said, ‘Is this something we should be out there doing and does this fit with the way that Save the Children works?’ ” she said. “And the answer was no.” Ms. Miles said the talks with Coke were continuing and the grant under discussion was significantly larger than past donations from the soft drink giant. Coke has given the group about $400,000 since 1991, according to a company spokeswoman. Save the Children has received much more money from Pepsi through the PepsiCo Foundation, which it has designated as a “corporate partner” in recognition of the $5 million grant for work in India and Bangladesh. PepsiCo awarded the grant in early 2009, before the charity began its soda tax advocacy. Representatives of both Coca-Cola and Pepsi said they had not asked the charity to alter its position on soda taxes. But soda tax advocates say that soft drink makers are flexing their muscles in opposition to soda taxes. In Washington State, the American Beverage Association, a trade group that includes Coke and Pepsi, spent $16.5 million to win passage of a November ballot initiative that overturned a small tax on soft drinks enacted by the legislature to help plug a budget gap. The beverage association outspent supporters of the tax by more than 40 to 1, and the tax was repealed. Jon Gould, deputy director of the Children’s Alliance, an advocacy group in Seattle, said Save the Children’s decision to abandon the issue was “a significant loss, especially at a time when the American Beverage Association has just shown that their resources are unlimited.” The alliance got $25,000 from Save the Children to help advocate for a soda tax. Kelly D. Brownell, a soda tax advocate and director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said that many food and beverage companies made donations to nonprofit groups fighting hunger but it was less common for them to finance work to address obesity. “It would be a shame if there were a quid pro quo and the groups felt pressure to oppose something like a soda tax,” Mr. Brownell said. Public debate about soda taxes has intensified over the last year. Proponents say that if the tax were large enough, perhaps a penny an ounce or more, it could reduce consumption of sugary beverages, which are high in calories and can contribute to obesity. In addition, money raised by the tax could be spent on public health efforts to fight obesity. The soda companies argue that it is unfair to blame their products for the obesity epidemic, which has complex causes. They say that policies should be focused instead on getting people to exercise more. So far, tax proposals have gotten little traction. Last year, federal lawmakers considered a soft drink tax to help pay for health care reform, but that idea was dropped. Governors, state lawmakers and mayors have proposed taxes but made little headway. Save the Children’s involvement in the issue began in late 2009, when it got a $3.5 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to fight childhood obesity through a program it called the Campaign for Healthy Kids. Save the Children initially financed the work of local groups, some of which focused on improving school lunches and requiring health education in schools. But local activists in Mississippi, New Mexico and Washington State used the grants to push for a soda tax. When politicians in Philadelphia and Washington proposed soda taxes this year, the Campaign for Healthy Kids got more directly involved, paying for lobbyists and polling. “We really took the lead on those and were publicly identified with those,” said Andrew Hysell, an associate vice president for Save the Children and the director of the obesity campaign. None of the soda tax measures supported by Save the Children passed, although in Washington, the city council removed a sales tax exemption for carbonated beverages. Save the Children’s prominent role in Philadelphia and Washington led top executives of the charity to review the work. Ms. Miles said they concluded the advocacy was not part of the charity’s mission. “We made a decision that it was an issue that was controversial among our constituents and really was not core to the work we’re doing in the U.S.,” Ms. Miles said. She said that while the charity’s constituents included corporate donors, concerns over fund-raising were not involved in the decision. Mr. Hysell informed soda tax advocates of the change in October and the Campaign for Healthy Kids removed declarations of support for soda taxes from its Web site. Officials of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who had encouraged Save the Children to advocate for soda taxes, are disappointed. “They were obviously some of the strongest out there working on the issue, and we had such high hopes,” said Dwayne Proctor, team director for childhood obesity at the foundation. He said the two groups would continue to work together on other aspects of the obesity fight.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/nyregion/17coke.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Cathleen P. Black on Coke Board During Soda Wars<date>Published: November 16, 2010</date><text>By her own account, Cathleen P. Black, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s choice to be the next New York City schools chancellor, has had almost no experience with the public education system.But for nearly 20 years, she played an influential role in a company that did: Coca-Cola. As America awoke to a national obesity epidemic and schools tried to rid their hallways of sugary drinks, Coca-Cola emerged as the biggest and most aggressive opponent of the scientists, lawmakers and educators who tried to sound the alarm. The company unleashed a flurry of lobbyists, donations and advertising to fight the efforts, prompting local officials to describe it as “bullying” and “unconscionable.” Even as other large food manufacturers embraced the public-health measures, Coca-Cola dug in its heels, rewarding schools that kept selling its products and threatening those that would not, officials said. Through most of these battles, Ms. Black, the magazine executive nominated last week to lead the nation’s largest school system, was one of 14 people on the company’s board of directors, and she sat on a company committee that focused on policy issues including obesity and selling soda to children. On a board that meets six times a year, she was privy to internal debates about the company’s combative strategy, and there is no public evidence that she ever questioned it. “I don’t think we’ve gone to a single meeting in the last two years where we haven’t discussed that issue,” said Donald McHenry, a longtime Coke board member and a professor at Georgetown University who sat on the committee with Ms. Black. Mr. McHenry would not characterize Ms. Black’s views on the topic, and she has declined interview requests since she was tapped. A spokesman for Coca-Cola and a spokesman for the city both declined to discuss Ms. Black’s role in the debate over how to handle the issue of sodas in schools. Ms. Black resigned from the Coke board this week, citing potential conflicts of interest, but her time at the company is especially striking because the man who chose her for the schools job has declared soda an urgent public health menace and has plastered the city’s subway cars with advertisements that liken drinking it to ingesting goopy liquid fat. “Normally, I would think that somebody who served for 18 years on the board of this junk-food producer is tainted,” said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “If you’re judged by the people with whom you hang out, it’s not a good sign,” said Dr. Jacobson, whom Mr. Bloomberg recently nominated for a national health “hero award” and who received it last month. “But I wouldn’t say it’s disqualifying. I don’t know what role she played on the board. It could be she was pushing them to cut the sugar or sell fruits and vegetables. It’s hard to know.” He added, “I don’t want to be naïve, because I don’t know what she pushed for, if anything — or was it easy money?” Asked about the apparent conflict between Mr. Bloomberg’s views and the work of his nominee, a spokeswoman for the mayor reiterated his opposition to the sale of sugary drinks in schools and his support of Ms. Black, saying the policy would continue under her chancellorship. In nominating Ms. Black, Mr. Bloomberg said she would bring corporate innovation and management savvy to the sprawling system. But her record at Coca-Cola shows she will bring corporate baggage as well. Ms. Black had been on the board since 1990, except for a brief leave, earning well over $2.1 million in cash and stock over the years, according to Equilar, which studies corporate pay. (Her current stock holdings in Coca-Cola are worth $3.3 million.) During Ms. Black’s tenure, pressure intensified on soda companies to limit sales in schools after Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, in 2001 declared obesity a national crisis with “tragic results.” He urged local communities to lead the fight. And much to the beverage industry’s chagrin, they did. In 2003, California and New York City banned the sale of soft drinks in elementary and middle schools. At the same time, a coalition of lawyers who had successfully sued tobacco companies began developing strategies for taking on food companies, threatening a barrage of lawsuits. By 2006, when Connecticut tried for the second year in a row to join the wave of local governments barring sugary drinks at schools, Coke and other companies pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into a bare-knuckle battle to stop the legislation. According to Connecticut state officials, Coke lobbyists warned school districts that if the legislation passed, Coke would stop providing money for after-school programs, which it had done in exchange for the right to put vending machines on campus.</text></article>

Black will have to give up more than the sweeping Midtown views from her office if she becomes New York City’s next schools chancellor: She will have to walk away from three lucrative sources of income that have made her a multimillion-dollar fortune over the last decade.City officials said on Friday that Ms. Black, a publishing executive, would not only step down from her job as chairwoman of Hearst Magazines, as many had expected, but she would also resign from the boards of Coca-Cola and I.B.M. Aides had indicated earlier on Friday that Ms. Black might remain on those boards, despite city rules that forbid employees from having a position or an ownership interest in a company that does business with the city. I.B.M., with contracts totaling more than $300 million, is one of the city’s largest vendors. As for Coke, most of its sales to the city come through third-party vendors, which is normally not considered a conflict, though it could create the appearance of one. The city’s Conflicts of Interest Board can grant permission to employees to serve on boards, typically on the condition that they recuse themselves from any city dealings with the companies. “She met with city lawyers prior to her announcement and will follow their advice and that of the Conflicts of Interest Board to address any potential issues before she starts,” said Natalie Ravitz, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education. But later on Friday, a City Hall spokeswoman, Jessica Scaperotti, said, “She will not be serving on any corporate boards at the time she becomes chancellor.” Her board seats might have complicated her attempt to win a state waiver to take the job, which is necessary because she does not have the educational background that state law requires. Some parents, teachers and local officials have already been urging the state commissioner of education to deny the waiver request, saying Ms. Black’s career record, which is almost exclusively in the corporate world, makes her unqualified for the job. Ms. Black, named on Tuesday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to succeed Joel I. Klein, is a top executive at Hearst, one of the world’s largest publishers. Her compensation there is not a matter of public record but it is likely to be several times the $250,000 the city would pay her as chancellor. She also now earns $500,000 a year for serving on the boards of I.B.M. and Coca-Cola. Board memberships have long been a way for top corporate executives to supplement incomes and enhance résumés. Serving on boards generally requires a small commitment of time and offers handsome perks, like stock options, all-expense-paid travel and free merchandise. Ms. Black, who is the chairwoman of the compensation committee and a member of the public issues and diversity review committee of Coca-Cola, attended 10 meetings in 2009, for which she earned $195,000 in cash and stock. She has been a director there since 1993. At I.B.M., where she has been a director since 1995, she earns $300,723 a year in cash and compensation. Aside from Ms. Black’s background, Mr. Bloomberg’s selection of her was also surprising for the secrecy surrounding it. Many of the mayor’s senior aides did not know about it until just before he announced it. The mayor’s office has declined to reveal any details of the search process, but one respected educator has said he was consulted: Geoffrey Canada, the chief executive officer of the Harlem Children’s Zone. Mr. Canada, in an interview on Friday, said Mr. Bloomberg had met with him about three months ago, around the time Mr. Kleintold the mayor he was planning to resign. Mr. Bloomberg “asked for my advice on what would make a great chancellor, and I gave it,” Mr. Canada said. He would not elaborate on what his advice was and did not say whether Ms. Black’s name came up. But he said he was “thrilled” with the choice, citing her extensive management experience. Mr. Canada declined to comment on whether he was offered the job. Mr. Bloomberg had called him the “most important living New Yorker” in a recent New York Magazine survey. Also on Friday, Mr. Bloomberg announced that the chairman of the Panel for Educational Policy, David C. Chang, had resigned on Nov. 5. Mr. Chang, the chancellor of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, was one of the original members of the panel, the successor to the city’s Board of Education. The panel is controlled by the mayor and has no significant power. In Mr. Chang’s place, Mr. Bloomberg named Robert Reffkin, an executive at Goldman Sachs. Members of the panel said that Mr. Chang’s resignation was not a reaction to the appointment of Ms. Black but a long-planned retirement. Mr. Chang did not return calls seeking comment. The training of Ms. Black continues, Ms. Ravitz of the Department of Education said. While she has not yet visited the department’s headquarters, she is in daily contact with officials there. She has also called Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the Board of Regents; Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker; Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker; Catherine Nolan, the chairwoman of the Assembly’s education committee; Michael Mulgrew, the teachers’ union president; and Ernest Logan, the principals’ union president. The Rev. Al Sharpton and Ms. Black have been trying to meet; he has concerns about her selection, a spokeswoman said, but he wants to meet with Ms. Black before reaching a conclusion.</text></article>

Now, the ranks of Team Coco are being swelled by major marketers like AT&amp;T, General Motors, Microsoft and the News Corporation.TBS, part of Time Warner, is reporting robust sales for commercial time during “Conan,” which will make its debut on Monday and will run from 11 p.m. to midnight, Monday through Thursday. In addition to buying spots, marketers are making deals for tailored promotions as well as customized content for television, Web sites, social media and mobile devices. Diet Coke, sold by another big advertiser, Coca-Cola, sponsored a four-minute preview of the show, which appeared online this week on Facebook, the Team Coco Web site (teamcoco.com/blog/show-zero/) and on YouTube. The 20th Century Fox unit of the News Corporation will offer previews of a film, “Unstoppable,” during the premiere week of “Conan,” which will be Mr. O’Brien’s return to late-night television. The Bing search engine, operated by Microsoft, will be included in an episode during the week of Nov. 29. And the Chevrolet division of General Motors may give away a 2011 Chevrolet Cruze to a viewer in November or December. “We know Conan has a passionate following and wanted to tap into that,” said Daryl Evans, vice president for consumer advertising and marketing communications at the AT&amp;T Atlanta office. AT&amp;T is sponsoring promotions for “Conan,” which feature an orange blimp, and will join 20th Century Fox as a sponsor of the premiere week. The AT&amp;T brand will also be integrated into an episode during the week of Dec. 6. “Conan is a proven talent and a proven brand,” Mr. Evans said. “Rubbing up the AT&amp;T brand against the Conan brand is a good thing; there’s a nice brand equity share.”  Mr. Evans said that the theme of AT&amp;T’s current ad campaign, “Rethink possible,” aligned well with “Conan,” in that Mr. O’Brien was “rethinking what you can do, being innovative” in leaving broadcast TV for cable. Brad Adgate, senior vice president for research at Horizon Media in New York, described “Conan” as “another example of the inroads cable is making” in its competition with the broadcast networks. Mr. O’Brien “is the biggest name TBS has gotten since Andy Taylor and Jethro Bodine,” he added, laughing, referring to characters on two sitcoms, “The Andy Griffith Show” and “The Beverly Hillbillies,” that TBS became notorious for running over and over. “Conan” represents another milestone for cable: TBS is charging an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 for each 30-second commercial — near or on par with what CBS charges for a spot during “Late Show With David Letterman” and what NBC charges for “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.” For years, TBS sales executives “always gnashed their teeth that they didn’t get the same pricing” as their counterparts at the broadcast networks, Mr. Adgate said, although their programming drew large, youthful audiences. TBS is now the No. 1 cable channel among viewers aged 18 to 34 — a group replete with O’Brien aficionados and prized by advertisers. “There really should be no mysterious delineation between the broadcast viewer of Conan and the cable viewer of Conan,” said Linda Yaccarino, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Turner Entertainment ad sales, marketing and acquisitions, who oversees channels that, in addition to TBS, include TNT and truTV. “It may have taken Conan O’Brien to hurdle over the line” that separated the two types of TV in the eyes of advertisers and agencies, she added, because “bringing Conan to TBS was quite a transformational deal, for the network and the industry.” TBS is “working closely with Conan’s creative team” on ideas to incorporate sponsors in the show, Ms. Yaccarino said, which may include commercials delivered by Andy Richter, the show’s announcer, or “Conan himself.” “I wish I could show you the Chevy Cruze creative,” she added. “It is so Conanesque.” The only hint she would give was that it would be “the best-smelling promo he’s ever done.”  There are risks involved with sponsoring “Conan,” among them that the show may not stand out amid the late-night clutter. Mr. O’Brien will compete against popular series like “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and “The Colbert Report,” both on Comedy Central; “Chelsea Lately,” on E!; as well as with Mr. Leno and Mr. Letterman. “The press always liked Conan more than viewers,” said Steve Sternberg, the longtime television research analyst who writes a blog, the Sternberg Report. “I don’t know why advertisers would initially pay the same rates for Conan as for Leno or Letterman until he demonstrates he can get a younger audience,” Mr. Sternberg wrote in an e-mail. “But TBS does skew young, so he does have a chance.” Mr. Adgate at Horizon Media said he believed that Mr. O’Brien “will do well” on TBS, particularly among viewers ages 18 to 49. And “it will be a hit with advertisers initially because of the familiarity they have with Conan,” he added. “But the show will also be a little bit different because it’s on cable, and he may be able to get away with a little more than he did on broadcast.”</text></article>

The United States Federal Trade Commission and Canadian Competition Bureau both approved the deal, the world’s largest soft-drink maker said on Monday. The next step would be for shareholders of the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, to approve the deal in a vote scheduled for Oct 1. A Stifel Nicolaus analyst, Mark Swartzberg, said he expected the deal to close as soon as next week. Coke announced the deal in February, just as archrival PepsiCo was closing a similar deal of its own. At that time, the F.T.C. reached a similar decision for PepsiCo regarding Dr Pepper’s business information.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/world/europe/19venice.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Behind Venice’s Ads, the Restoration of Its Heritage<date>Published: September 18, 2010</date><text>VENICE — Legend has it that the Bridge of Sighs, which connects the Palazzo Ducale here to an ancient prison, got its name because it gave convicts on the way to serve their sentences a last glimpse of the limpid lagoon.The view today, however, is more likely to be a gargantuan billboard on a blue sky of tarpaulin touting Bulgari or Coca-Cola. Behind the cloud-studded blue are the facades of fragile monuments under restoration; those structures are also the beneficiaries of the advertising revenue. But when the Coke billboards went up this summer on buildings that abut the Piazza San Marco — the historic and, perhaps more to the point, touristic, heart of Venice — there was an explosion from outraged Venetians. “We couldn’t stay quiet,” said Maria Camilla Bianchini d’Alberigo, president of a heritage protection association. “Too much is too much.” Her organization, the Fondo Ambiente Italiano, denounced the intrusiveness of the ads, setting off the public debate. “What’s missing is a set of criteria that makes the advertising compatible with the environment so that the buildings are not offended, and so that they are still visible,” she said. City officials counter that without these advertisements, the city could not begin to maintain its historic monuments, many of which show the ravages of centuries of wear, exacerbated by the impact of the watery setting. Renata Codello, the Culture Ministry official responsible for Venice’s monuments, said, “Ads pay for the restoration of public buildings,” which would not get repaired otherwise, “even though many are a hazard for public safety.” “We’re just not in a position to say no to money, not for aesthetic reasons,” she said in a telephone interview. “I can’t turn down the image of a bottle when there are pieces of the Palazzo Ducale falling to the ground.” Ms. Codello said her department had received $200,000 for restorations so far this year, well short of the $2.6 million to $3.9 million she requests annually to keep abreast of the most precarious situations. But Venice, Ms. Codello added, has relatively few advertising spaces on scaffolding, compared with cities like Rome and Florence where billboards are far more prevalent. The Culture Ministry has a budget of about $47 million for restoration of these sites, but Italy has a rich architectural heritage, and funds are always tight. Of that amount, $1.8 million was allocated to the entire Veneto region, which includes Venice. Private sponsorship, once limited to financial contributions, became less restrictive under a 2004 law that allowed contributors to have direct involvement in restoration projects, including carrying them out. The change in the law has not had a huge effect as far as bringing money in, according to a Culture Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with ministry policy. While discussions persist in Italy on the extent to which business interests should intrude upon cultural undertakings, and though private enterprises have been active within the state-controlled system for more than a decade — through bookstores, restaurants and ticketing services — officials entrusted with preserving Italy’s cultural heritage remain distrustful of commercial involvement. When Mario Resca, who ran the Italian subsidiary of McDonald’s for years, was appointed to a new ministry post to develop museums two years ago, there was a significant outcry that the ministry’s mandate would be bartered for an entrepreneurial model. And now the Italian government has been debating whether to turn over some properties, from mountains to army barracks, to local administrations, which have fewer restrictions on their patrimony. “We can increase efficiency and improve results, but we can’t commercialize everything,” Alessandra Mottola Molfino, president of Italia Nostra, another heritage protection agency, said in a telephone interview. “The lesson that goes out is that there is a price for everything.” In the case of the Bridge of Sighs and the Palazzo Ducale, the city signed an accord two years ago with Dottor Group, the company responsible for the restoration, allowing it to sell ad space to pay for its labor. One phase of the restoration of the palace was unveiled this month, and the company has said it expects work to be completed by October 2011. “The city coffers were empty, so we had to find sponsors,” Mayor Giorgio Orsoni said. Dottor Group, which is based in San Vendemiano, near Venice, pledged to raise $2 million over three years through the ads, which are affixed to the cloud-bedecked tarpaulin designed by the photographer Oliviero Toscani, best known for his ads for Benetton. Pietro Dottor, president of the company, said he preferred to “concentrate on our work, not the polemics. We are carrying out high-quality projects at zero cost to the city. That’s what is important.” The total costs of restoring the Canonica canal side of the Palazzo Ducale, including the Bridge of Sighs, will come to $3.6 million and all the money from the ads will go to the project. “Why not use this avenue? What do we gain by leaving the scaffolding blank?” Mr. Orsoni, the mayor, added. One proviso of the agreement with Dottor: The ads could not offend public taste. “You can’t show everything, but I don’t understand what the deal was with the Coke bottle,” Mr. Orsoni said. “Sure the colors were bright, but frankly, we’re used to seeing them all over the world.” In an e-mailed statement, Coca Cola said it had chosen to advertise on the Palazzo Ducale “not just to help promote our brand, but because it would also help preserve some of the city’s culture.” Government belt-tightening has increased the need for private money. In July, the Culture Ministry announced that it was seeking private sponsors for a $33 million restoration of the Colosseum, which had 4.7 million visits last year. Heritage organizations acknowledge that private sponsorship is a valuable asset but believe that advertising must be more contained. “It’s not a question of ideological radicalism, but of preoccupation with the invasiveness of the ads in delicate places, like Piazza San Marco,” Mrs. Bianchini d’Alberigo said. Venice is unique, “and a special dialogue exists between architecture, stones, water and man, which the ads shatter,” she said. Other critics of the ads assert that Venice is not fully exploiting its value as a location set. City Hall “is not sufficiently selling the concept of Piazza San Marco,” said Pieralvise Zorzi, an advertising executive and a descendant of one of Venice’s oldest families. “It’s a location that could be sold better.” And because “there is a lot of potential positive fallout for a company to say, ‘We restored this,’ ” he added, businesses could be more directly involved as sponsors — creating ads “made to measure for the location,” even though “it would cost them more.” Others believe that there is more money to be made for preservation through direct fund-raising, or by getting the city itself to sell the ads — the way that some professional sports teams buy air time and produce their own broadcasts, keeping all ad revenue for themselves. It is a notion that Mr. Orsoni dismisses. “City Hall is not an ad agency; it’s not our business,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/media/19adco.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Pepsi Campaign Restarts the Cola Wars<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>THE cola wars shaped not just the soft drink industry but also Madison Avenue, inspiring the satirical newspaper The Onion to declare, in a 1997 headline, “Ad Industry Veterans Honored With Cola War Memorial.” Now Pepsi is engaging in a bit of war re-enactment, remaking a well-known comparative commercial, but with a twist, replacing Coke and Pepsi with the sugarless versions Coke Zero and Pepsi Max.The original ad, by BBDO and directed by Joe Pytka, had its premiere during the Super Bowl in 1995. In it, a Pepsi delivery driver pulls into a diner where a Coke truck is parked and sits down at the counter several seats away from the other driver. The jukebox needle drops on “Get Together,” by the Youngbloods. “Good song,” the Pepsi driver says. “Great song,” replies the other, and then the two shake hands, sit side by side, and pull out their wallets to show pictures of their children, laughing. The Coke driver slides a can of his product toward the Pepsi driver, who takes a sip, smiles and returns it, but when the Coke driver reciprocates by taking a sip of the Pepsi, he likes it so much that he will not return it. Their expressions suddenly turn furious and, in a final shot from outside the diner, a chair flies through the window. The commercial has been viewed more than 1.7 million times on YouTube. The new spot, by the TBWA/Chiat/Day division of TBWA Worldwide and directed again by Mr. Pytka, uses the same setup, except this time the drivers drink Coke Zero and Pepsi Max, and the song is “Why Can’t We Be Friends?” by War. Also different: when the Coke driver takes a long sip of the Pepsi Max, the Pepsi driver pulls out his smartphone to record him, taps the screen a few times, and says, “YouTube.” This time it is not a chair but the two drivers who crash through the diner window. “I was never happy with the old ending,” said Mr. Pytka, 71, who directed his first Pepsi commercial in the 1970s. “I had shot a version with the guys coming out the window, and we had a long discussion, and Pepsi was concerned with the violence. The ending is completely satisfying now.” The commercial, scheduled to appear on Monday, even has a cameo: Art LeFleur, who played the Pepsi driver in the commercial 15 years ago, now plays the owner of the diner. Introduced in Britain and Italy in 1993, and widely available in Europe ever since, Pepsi Max was not introduced in the United States until 2007. The sugarless cola, which is sweetened with a combination of aspartame and acesulfame potassium, contains nearly twice the caffeine of Diet Pepsi, and also contains ginseng. A 2009 report by Mintel, the market research firm, said the soda’s sales had been “impressive,” even during the economic downturn, “likely by attracting price-sensitive energy drink users.” Diet Pepsi is more popular with women, but about 60 percent of Pepsi Max drinkers are men, according to Lauren Hobart, chief marketing officer of the sparkling brands division of PepsiCo. Diet sodas popular with men, like Pepsi One, Pepsi Max and Coke Zero, which many in Europe refer to as “bloke Coke,” avoid a word to which marketers believe men are averse: “diet.” (It is a widely held view in the weight-loss industry that men are more apt to say they need to “get in shape” than “go on a diet.”) Ms. Hobart said “while some of our past advertising was more overtly about being the diet cola for men, there’s still a lot of women drinking Pepsi Max, so it doesn’t make sense to be so specifically gender focused.” Among the company’s sugarless brands, Pepsi Max is popular with Gen X and Diet Pepsi with baby boomers. “Boomers generally grew up drinking Diet Pepsi but Gen X has been raised with more choices, and we’re trying to provide more choices that may meet their needs differently,” Ms. Hobart said. “The word ‘diet’ is more about what’s not in the can than what is. One of the things we like about Pepsi Max is it’s more about what the drink is — the fact that you can have zero calories with maximum taste — than what it is not.” Reanimating the ad put Pepsi’s current agency in the awkward position of executing another agency’s concept. “We all loved that original spot, so it’s almost like when a musical artist does a cover of a song,” said Rob Schwartz, chief creative officer of TBWA/Chiat/Day. Also, Mr. Schwartz’s agency and BBDO are both owned by Omnicon. “They’re cousins of ours, so it’s O.K.,” Mr. Schwartz joked. His agency also works on another rivalry campaign, the PC vs. Mac commercials for Apple, in which the actor and writer John Hodgman plays the personification of Microsoft as comically inept. In those ads, “we know from Frame 1 the winner and the loser,” Mr. Schwartz said. “We know that Microsoft is not going to win that battle; they’re too big and too clumsy.” But the cola rivalry calls for “less disparagement,” he said. “To me Coke and Pepsi is one of those rivalries that’s no different than the Yankees and Red Sox,” Mr. Schwartz said. “We do see them as a worthy adversary.” With the country engaged in two real wars, there is perhaps something quaint, even comforting, about one between carbonated beverages. “People love the cola wars,” said Ms. Hobart, of Pepsi. “People identify themselves in many cases as ‘I’m a Pepsi person’ or ‘I’m a Coke person.’ The rivalry is just a very integral part of our heritage for both Pepsi and Coke.”</text></article>

Written by Elizabeth Olson, the piece explained that Coke executives had asked Honest Tea to remove the words ''no high fructose corn syrup'' from its juice pouches because the executives considered them an implicit rebuke of Coke products that do contain the syrup. ''We got a strong request to change the wording,'' said Seth Goldman, co-founder of Honest Tea. In the end, Mr. Goldman held his ground, and Coke -- which owns an option to buy the rest of Honest Tea next year -- accepted the decision. The Honest Kids packaging now on store shelves continues to proclaim, ''no high fructose corn syrup'' (see the photo above). The decision, Mr. Goldman said, ''shows we do stand for something.'' In a brief interview, Mr. Goldman addressed some of the concerns raised by readers who commented on the case study:Q.Have you had second thoughts about the deal with Coke? A.Absolutely not. We entered the deal with the goal of expanding the availability and the impact of our brand, and we're making that happen in a way that we could never do on our own. We want to be the first mainstream organic beverage. No one can help us do this better than Coke. Equally important, Coke has embraced our brand, our team, and our culture -- even our quirky independent streak -- and we both see the same unmet demand for less-sweet beverages.Q.Were you surprised by the comments from people who are angry with Honest Tea?A.Not really. There are some people who were disappointed that we partnered with Coke just because Coke seems so different from what Honest Tea represents. But I've challenged those folks to look at how we operate and what we are selling. Since we started working with Coke, we've increased our Fair Trade offerings from 4 to 19 varieties. We've reduced our packaging-to-product ratio (a measure of packaging efficiency) by more than 50 percent, and we've expanded our range of zero-calorie offerings, including a new stevia-sweetened drink we're introducing next month. Some point to changes we've made over the past couple years and blame Coke. Any changes came from us.Q.Was there anything in the comments that you wanted to respond to or clarify?A.We do have several unsweetened teas, and even those with sugar are only a tad sweet. We have half the sugar (and calories) of most bottled teas. One reason we can afford to use organic cane sugar is that we use so much less of it. Our Honest Kids product has less than half the sugar of most kids drinks, so there, too, we're offering a healthier alternative. Another point worth noting is that there was never any discussion about adding high fructose corn syrup to any Honest Tea product -- the discussion only focused on whether we would take the ''no high fructose corn syrup'' language off our package. There was a comment questioning why our bottle has a hollow cavity at the bottom and accusing us of deceptive marketing. The bottle is designed that way because it is 22 percent lighter than our original bottle, which will save more than a million pounds of plastic every year. Because the bottle is thinner, it requires more pressure to hold its form, and that's why there's that funky dome underneath. We're not trying to fool anyone -- honest -- but sometimes our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint needs a little more explanation.Q.Have you heard from Coke since the publication of the case study?A.I talked with a colleague in Atlanta today and, of course, the article came up. We agreed it's unfortunate that the piece focused on one small road bump, when there are so many positive conversations we've had since the deal between Honest Tea and Coca-Cola -- conversations about sourcing of organic tea, package reduction, authentic marketing, community-based environmental initiatives and Fair Trade sourcing. Like any healthy relationship, there is give and take, but up to and including the packaging language for Honest Kids, we have collaborated with Coke and haven't made any change to our business that's inconsistent with the brand and vision that we started out of my house more than 12 years ago. The partnership with Coke is fundamental to taking Honest Tea's mission and impact to scale -- the Honest Tea party is just getting started. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/business/smallbusiness/08sbiz.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Can Honest Tea Say No to Coke, Its Biggest Investor?<date>Published: July 7, 2010</date><text>HONEST TEA makes juices and teas with natural sweeteners, including the pouch drinks Honest Kids. In early 2008, Coca-Cola took a 40 percent interest in the Bethesda, Md.-based company, which had revenue of $47 million last year. Coke has an option to buy the whole company next year.THE CHALLENGE Maintaining Honest Tea’s integrity while adjusting to a new relationship with a financial backer that has a different way of doing business. THE BACKGROUND Seth Goldman, now 44, left a mutual fund job in 1998 convinced that he could develop a wholesome alternative to sugary drinks that never seemed to quench his thirst. He joined forces with Barry Nalebuff, a professor he knew from the Yale School of Management, to start Honest Tea. For Mr. Goldman, coming up with new products and flavors like Pomegranate White Tea or Black Forest Berry is the entertaining part of the beverage business. The grittier part is getting the product distributed on a profit-making scale. Mr. Goldman scored Honest Tea’s first notable sale, to Whole Foods Market, by carting in several insulated containers of teas and a sample bottle — an empty Snapple container with a makeshift label — that persuaded the grocer to order several cases. Then Mr. Goldman spent nearly a decade trying to build distribution. That meant lots of trade shows, cold calls and nights at modest motels, where he and other Honest Tea employees doubled up to save money while they marketed the company’s drinks and signed up independent distributors. “You can build a great brand, but you can’t ship this through the mail,” he said. “Beverages have a high turnover, and you’re out of the game unless your product is being restocked and on the shelf.” Then, in early 2008, Honest Tea sold a minority stake, for $43 million, to Coca-Cola’s Venturing and Emerging Brands group, which was expanding Coke’s ability to meet consumer demand for lower-calorie drinks. Honest Tea products soon got much wider distribution, through Coke, on grocery shelves and college campuses across the country. But meshing Honest Tea’s socially responsible, ecologically aware, small-company sensibility with the huge international brand of Coke has not always gone smoothly. A few months after the deal, Coke started vetting Honest Tea’s ingredients to make sure they complied with federal requirements and noticed Honest Kids’ packaging had prominent lettering that promised: “no high-fructose corn syrup.” Executives at Coke construed the phrase as an implicit rebuke of its products, some of which contained the controversial factory-produced syrup. “We got a strong request to change the wording,” Mr. Goldman said. THE OPTIONS Under its deal with Coke, Honest Tea retained control over its products and contents. Mr. Goldman believed that drawing attention to the absence of corn syrup was crucial to being true to the Honest Tea brand. The packaging, he said, was designed to highlight attributes — low sugar content and organic ingredients — that attract purchasers, typically parents, to buy this kind of product. Honest Kids is expected to account for about one-third of Honest Tea’s projected $70 million in sales this year. “We were not going to drop Honest Kids, so we had to figure out how to handle this,” Mr. Goldman said. At the same time, Coke had been facing declining demand for its soft drinks, which was why it had been investing in small beverage companies like Honest Tea and the fruit-smoothie maker Innocent Drinks. In late 2008, Mr. Goldman traveled to Coke headquarters in Atlanta to seek a solution. “I met with various people in the company who explained their belief that high-fructose corn syrup is comparable to sugar in its health impact.” Mr. Goldman decided against trying to resolve the scientific point. “Our point of view was that we were not going to get into the debate over whether high-fructose corn syrup is the same as sugar,” he said. One option Coke presented, he said, was simply to eliminate the “no high-fructose corn syrup” banner. But Mr. Goldman argued that including the notification was a key signal to buyers that there were no hidden ingredients in the drink, an important issue given the growing chorus questioning whether high-fructose corn syrup contributed to the risk of obesity in adults and children. (One Honest Kids competitor, Kraft Foods, announced in April 2008 that it was eliminating the syrup from its Capri Sun juice pouches.) Coke also suggested that Honest Tea delete the corn syrup reference and substitute, “Sweetened with organic cane sugar.” But that, Mr. Goldman said, went against Honest Tea’s tenet that the consumer “does not want a product that is highly processed.” Another option Coke floated was adding the phrase “No fake stuff” to the packaging. Honest Tea rejected that, Mr. Goldman said, because it was subjective and would not persuade people to buy their products.</text></article>

After completing the buyout of the United States operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke will distribute Dr Pepper in the United States and Canada Dry in the Northeastern part of the country, where they are currently distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises. It will distribute Canada Dry, C’Plus and Schweppes in Canada. The agreement follows a similar deal between Dr Pepper and PepsiCo, whose agreement to buy its own top North American bottlers led it to pay Dr Pepper Snapple $900 million to continue selling Dr Pepper, Crush and Schweppes. Shares of Dr Pepper were down 1.7 percent on Monday as some investors were disappointed with the payout, while Coca-Cola shares were flat. “The terms and cash amount are in line with the previous deal with PepsiCo, however we believe some investors expected a higher payment to come from Coke,” a Credit Suisse analyst, Carlos Laboy, said in a research note. “We have heard from investors who were expecting the number to be north of what PepsiCo paid.” Go to Article from The Associated Press via The New York Times » Go to Press Release from Coca-Cola » Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/business/economy/19leonhardt.html?ref=cocacolacompany">The Battle Over Taxing Soda<date>Published: May 18, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTONThe classic way for lobbyists to defend their client’s interest is to insist that they are not actually defending their client’s interest. Really, they say, they are just looking out for ordinary Americans. Tobacco lobbyists spent years fighting regulation by claiming to be defending individual freedom, not the profits of tobacco companies. Detroit’s lobbyists did much the same to push back against seat belt and pollution laws. Wall Street has spent months opposing the financial regulation bill in the name of families and small businesses. The latest example comes from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the rest of the soda industry, which is trying to defeat a soda tax now before the District of Columbia Council. The industry has succeeded recently in beating back similar taxes in New York and Philadelphia, and in keeping one out of the federal health overhaul bill. But the Washington Council seems to be seriously considering a penny-per-ounce tax on nondiet sodas, energy drinks and artificial juices. Council members are set to vote on the issue next week. This soda debate is probably going to be around for some time. Cities and counties, desperate to find money to pay for schools and roads, are starting to see a soda tax as a way to raise revenue. The tax also appears to be one of the most promising ways to attack obesity, given the huge role sugary drinks play in the epidemic. “It’s wrong for the government to stand idle in the face of an epidemic of obesity that’s hurting the quality of life and the health of our residents,” says Mary Cheh, the Council member who has proposed the tax, “when we have policy choices in front of us that can materially affect the problem.” The soda industry, of course, is fighting back with newspaper and radio advertisements, among other things. It says a tax would most hurt “hard-working, low- and middle-income families, elderly residents and those living on fixed incomes” and would destroy jobs. Ellen Valentino, an industry official, recently told The Washington Post that companies would spend “whatever it takes” to make their case.  The argument for a soda tax is the same as the argument for a tax on tobacco, pollution or, for that matter, banks that take big, expensive risks. When an activity imposes costs on society, economists have long said that the activity should be taxed. Doing so accomplishes two goals: it discourages the activity, and it raises money to help pay society’s costs. In the case of soda, those costs come in the form of medical bills for diabetes, heart disease and other side effects of obesity. We’re all paying these bills, via Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance premiums. Obesity has become a significant cause of our swelling long-term budget deficit. And soda is a huge reason the country is so much more obese. The typical American consumes almost three times as many calories from sugary drinks as in the late 1970s. This increase accounts for about half the total per-capita rise in calorie consumption over the same period. Remember, many of these drinks have zero nutritional benefit — unlike meat, cheese or juice. As Kelly Brownell, a Yale researcher, says, the link between obesity and soda is scientifically stronger than the link between obesity and any other type of food or beverage. We’re drinking more soda for several reasons. Above all, the inflation-adjusted price has fallen 34 percent since the late 1970s, largely because it can be manufactured more cheaply than in the past. Meanwhile, the average real cost of fruits and vegetables has risen more than 30 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Coincidentally, Ms. Cheh’s proposed tax would roughly reverse the drop in the price of soda over the last three decades, at least for the popular 12-pack of cans. An extra penny per ounce on a 12-pack would add $1.44 — or about 30 percent — to the current typical $4.75 price. (The tax rate would be lower for single-serve bottles and higher for bulk purchases.) Most of the revenue would then be used to improve the miserable quality of many school lunches in Washington. One blog, Better D.C. School Food, has taken to documenting these lunches, with a series of photographs of bland bread, processed cheese and reconstituted beef. So what about Coke’s and Pepsi’s arguments against the tax? They are certainly right that less soda consumption could cost the soda industry some jobs. But it would eliminate jobs from the overall economy only if people put the money they had been spending on soda into their savings accounts. That’s highly unlikely. Instead, people will probably spend more on other food and drinks or, say, go to the movies more often — and create jobs in those industries. The argument that the tax will hurt the poor is a little more serious. The average American now drinks almost a gallon of sweetened beverages each week. If the tax passes, any Washington resident who continued to do so would have to pay about $1.20 each week in soda taxes. Yet even that number overstates the cost, because the tax would surely affect how much soda many people drank. One of the lessons of the recent rise in cigarette taxes is that big price changes can lead to big behavior changes, even with an addictive product like tobacco. Teenagers, the biggest soda drinkers of all, are especially price sensitive. People who cut their soda drinking from a gallon a week to merely three-quarters of a gallon — that’s still 96 ounces, more than twice the consumption level of the late 1970s — would be spending no more on soda than they are now. I suspect that some Washington Council members, in the face of opposition from the soda makers and distributors, may be tempted to support a weakened version of the tax. One option would simply be to extend the normal 6 percent sales tax to sweetened beverages. Like food, they are currently exempt. But here’s the problem with that idea: small tax changes don’t always change behavior, as a recent study by the RAND Corporation found. So a small soda tax could actually have a worse impact on some families’ budgets than a substantial one — by raising the price of soda without affecting consumption. No wonder the American Heart Association supports the penny-per-ounce proposal. Such a tax would certainly raise the cost of living for some heavy soda drinkers, just as cigarette taxes have stretched the budgets of some smokers and mandatory seat belts have added costs to car production. But consider the benefits from those other public health initiatives. They have vastly outweighed the costs. Someday, we will probably look back on our gallon-a-week soda habit the way we now look back on allowing children to ride without seat belts or listening to doctors who endorsed Camel cigarettes. We will wonder what we were thinking. Coke and Pepsi, unfortunately, seem willing to do whatever it takes to delay that day.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/business/19lupton.html?ref=cocacolacompany">John Lupton, 83, Creator of a Coke-Bottling Empire<date>Published: May 19, 2010</date><text>John T. Lupton, who transformed his family bottling business into a big piece of the Coca-Cola soft drink empire and then helped revitalize his native city, Chattanooga, Tenn., died on Sunday at his home in Lookout Mountain, Tenn. He was 83.Mr. Lupton died after a long illness, said his son, Cartter, of Sullivan’s Island, S.C. The bottling business that secured Mr. Lupton a place on the Forbes list of the wealthiest Americans was started by his grandfather and a pair of partners in 1889 — they paid a dollar for the right to bottle Coca-Cola — and then handed down to his father. What became the JTL Corporation grew over the decades into one of the largest bottling operations in the world, mostly through sales of a single brand: Coca-Cola. After his father died in 1977, Mr. Lupton assumed the chairmanship of JTL, leading the company on an aggressive expansion campaign as he acquired bottling plants in Florida, Texas, Colorado and Arizona. When none of his four children showed interest in taking over the family business, Mr. Lupton sold it to Coca-Cola in 1986 for about $1.4 billion. By then, JTL was responsible for roughly 13 percent of Coke’s sales in the United States. After he failed to secure the chairmanship of the soft drink conglomerate, Mr. Lupton instead turned his attention to reviving the fortunes of his hometown, which had gained an unsavory reputation for air pollution and neglect. With the Lyndhurst Foundation, begun by his father, investing more than $20 million, Mr. Lupton played a crucial role in developing the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga. The attraction opened in 1992. He also played a major role in the construction of the Tennessee Riverwalk, a downtown riverfront promenade that furthered the city’s return. An avid golfer, Mr. Lupton took particular pride in helping finance the Honors Course, a golf course near Chattanooga that has been celebrated in national magazines. He served on its nine-member governing board, though in practice it functioned as a body of one — a reality celebrated in a mock portrait that hangs in the clubhouse: the nine members, each topped by a head shot of Mr. Lupton. John T. Lupton was born in Chattanooga on July 23, 1926. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he worked briefly in the textile industry before joining the family business in 1948, first as a loader at a bottle-washing facility in Georgia and then in the management ranks. From 1956 to 1982, he served on the Coca-Cola board. In addition to his son, Mr. Lupton is survived by his wife, Alice; three daughters, Margaret Lupton Gerber of Memphis, Katherine Lupton Juett of Dallas and Alice Lupton Smith of Lookout Mountain, Tenn.; his brother, Joe Henderson; 11 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.</text></article>

The results, however, were weaker than analysts’ expectations. The company earned $1.61 billion, or 69 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 2, compared with $1.35 billion, or 58 cents a share, in the period last year. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $7.53 billion. Analysts expected earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $7.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. The company has courted consumers in international markets as their economies improve. Eurasia and Africa led international growth, with volume up 11 percent. India’s volume grew 29 percent and Turkey’s 18 percent. Elsewhere, Brazil’s volume gained 12 percent. The flagship Coca-Cola brand posted double-digit growth in Russia, Egypt, Brazil, India, Vietnam and the Philippines. About three-fourths of Coca-Cola’s revenue came from outside North America in the quarter. North America is the world’s biggest soft drink market, but sales have been weak as people shift to juices and teas. In North America, total case volume — including soft drinks and juices — fell 2 percent in the quarter. Soft drink volume declined 1 percent. The company credited its marketing campaigns for the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics. Also Tuesday, Coca-Cola named its North American president, Steve Cahillane, to lead a new business unit called Coca-Cola Refreshments. It will incorporate the newly acquired Coca-Cola Enterprises North American bottling operations, North American food service, the Minute-Maid and Odwalla juice businesses and North American supply-chain operations. Shares of Coke fell 1.54 percent, or 85 cents, to $54.47 on Tuesday.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/10/business/10llewellyn.html?ref=cocacolacompany">J. Bruce Llewellyn, Who Forged a Path for Blacks in Business, Is Dead at 82<date>Published: April 9, 2010</date><text>J. Bruce Llewellyn, whose success in fields as varied as banking, broadcasting, Coca-Cola bottling and groceries made him one of the most prominent black businessmen in America, died Wednesday night at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.The cause was renal failure, said Edward Lewis, a friend and legal guardian for Mr. Llewellyn. Mr. Llewellyn had been on dialysis for years, Mr. Lewis said. Throughout his life, Mr. Llewellyn repeated his father’s dictum that blacks must work twice as hard as whites to achieve half as much. In an interview with The Black Collegian in 1997, he asserted that success had not come easily, calling it “nerve wracking, gut-wrenching and pain inducing.” “You must act to acquire it with a vengeance and to pursue it with a passion,” he said. Mr. Llewellyn was one of the nation’s richest African-Americans, with a personal wealth estimated at times to exceed $160 million. He was appointed to government posts and advised presidents. In 1963 he joined with others, including David N. Dinkins, later to become mayor of New York City, in founding 100 Black Men, a social and philanthropic organization that began in New York and expanded throughout the United States. “We pushed our guys onto bank boards, into government jobs,” Mr. Llewellyn told The New York Times in 1976. “We’re the most dynamic group of black men in the country.” Perhaps his greatest triumph came in 1985 when he put together a group of black partners to buy a majority share of the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company. It was the first of the company’s bottling plants to be acquired by a black person. Four years earlier, Jesse Jackson and his advocacy group Operation PUSH had demanded that Coke open its bottling ranks to black ownership, pointing out that blacks were a major consumer of Coca-Cola soft drinks. Mr. Llewellyn, a deep-voiced, barrel-chested man who stood 6-foot-6, found initial success by mortgaging everything he owned to turn a tattered chain of supermarkets in Harlem and the Bronx, the Fedco Foods Corporation, into a company with $100 million in annual sales. Mr. Llewellyn’s use of a leveraged buyout in 1969 to buy Fedco came years before the tactic became commonplace. “For an African-American businessman to receive multimillion-dollar financing in the 1970s was a landmark event,” said Robert Towbin of the investment bank L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg and Towbin, as quoted by the Encyclopedia of African-American Business. In 1971 Jackie Robinson, a friend, asked Mr. Llewellyn to join the board of the Freedom National Bank in Harlem, of which Mr. Robinson was chairman. Mr. Llewellyn succeeded Mr. Robinson in 1973, and the next year took a leave of absence from Fedco to be the bank’s acting president. He succeeded in sorting out Freedom’s finances, partly by bringing in capital from white-controlled financial firms. (The bank ultimately failed in 1990 under other leadership.) During the Carter administration, Mr. Llewellyn was appointed to head the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an agency that supports American investment in emerging foreign markets. He also accepted business-related assignments from President Bill Clinton. Part of Mr. Llewellyn’s success stemmed from tax laws aimed at furthering minority ownership of communications companies. When he and some black partners bought a television station in Buffalo in 1985, the seller, Capital City Communications Inc., could get millions of dollars of tax advantages by selling to a member of a racial minority. As a result, Mr. Llewellyn’s group succeeded even though it offered a lower price than other suitors. Mr. Llewellyn’s associates said his deal-making skills transcended race, however. “No one ever had to bend any rules for J. Bruce Llewellyn,” Mr. Jackson once told USA Today. “He has the entrepreneur’s spirit, the will to risk for reward.” Mr. Llewellyn reprised the Buffalo deal when he assembled a group to buy NYT Cable TV, a New Jersey concern, from The New York Times Company in 1989 for $420 million. Mr. Llewellyn put up 20 percent of the price (the minimum percentage required to get tax breaks for minority ownership) while the Comcast Corporation and Lenfest Communications Inc. each picked up 40 percent. Mr. Llewellyn became chairman. James Bruce Llewellyn was born to Jamaican immigrants on July 16, 1927, in East Harlem. His father, Charles, a newspaper linotype operator, moved the family to White Plains when Bruce was 2. His sister, Dorothy Cropper, became a judge on the New York State Court of Claims. Gen. Colin Powell was a close friend of the family’s. In White Plains, Mr. Llewellyn worked in a restaurant his father acquired. He sold Fuller Brush products door to door and read Fortune magazine. Graduating from high school when he was 16, Mr. Llewellyn joined the Army in a special cadet program. He later became the youngest officer in his battalion. Afterward he used Army severance pay to buy a liquor store in Harlem. While running it, he attended the City College of New York on the G.I. Bill and graduated in 1955. After attending Columbia Business School and the New York University School of Public Administration and Social Service without graduating from either, he earned a law degree from New York Law School in 1960. He then entered private legal practice and went on to several city and federal government jobs in small business and housing. During the power blackout of 1977, riots caused $1 million damage to his Fedco stores, a warehouse and a computer center. But the company rebounded, and by the time he sold the chain for $20 million to Krasdale Foods in 1982, he had quintupled sales and nearly tripled the number of stores. In 1985, Mr. Llewellyn realized his dream of becoming the first black to own a major bottler when he won control of the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company, using stock he owned in a New York bottling company. He added new routes, products and equipment, and the plant thrived. Mr. Llewellyn’s marriage to Jacqueline Brown ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Shahara Ahmad; two daughters from his first marriage, Lisa Llewellyn and Alexandra Clancy; one from his second, Jaylaan Llewellyn; his sister, Judge Cropper; and a granddaughter. In recent years Mr. Llewellyn suffered from kidney and heart problems and had lived apart from his wife. In 2008, Mr. Lewis, Maurice Sonnenberg, and Donald McHenry, a former United Nations ambassador, were appointed guardians to look after Mr. Llewellyn’s health and financial and legal affairs. To many people in business, Mr. Llewellyn showed that investing in the black community could be profitable, as it was in the 1970s when he tailored his merchandising and employment practices to the black consumers and workers at his Fedco stores. His often-repeated point was that political and social power grew out of economic power. “Minorities have to understand that the world revolves around the golden rule,” he wrote in Fortune magazine in 1990. “Those who have the gold, rule.”</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/global/03food.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Japanese Food Companies Seek Growth Abroad<date>Published: April 2, 2010</date><text>TOKYO — Until he moved to Japan three years ago, Arturo Vega, a Spanish-language teacher, had no idea that the Sofyl brand of yogurt that he had bought in his native Mexico was made by Japanese company named Yakult Honsha.While Japanese products in the technology and auto sectors are household names worldwide, the same is not true in the food industry. But that may be about to change. As birth rates and the consumer market shrink at home, food companies in Japan are increasing the pace of their overseas expansions and trying to improve promotion of their brands. Analysts say that increasing sales abroad is crucial for manufacturers. To do so, the companies are combining, undertaking joint ventures, cutting production costs and creating strategies for new markets. “The domestic market is shrinking, deflation is cutting into sales and the sense of crisis is looming stronger and stronger,” said Arihiro Muroya, a senior economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo, an organization affiliated with the leading Japanese agricultural lender, Norinchukin Bank. The sector’s strategy has been twofold. First, Japanese companies have been infiltrating the health food and condiment categories overseas with soy-based products like tofu in countries where few domestic companies can compete. Second, Japanese producers capitalize on cute Asian-themed characters like koalas and pandas and apply technology to make amusingly shaped treats to attract snack-happy consumers. The Japanese confectioner Ezaki Glico, for example, makes a chocolate-dipped stick-shaped cookie that is sold in Europe, through a joint venture with Kraft Foods, as the Mikado, and elsewhere as Pocky. Mikio Kusama, head of the global business division at Ezaki Glico, said that Mikado sales brought in 15 billion yen ($159 million) a year and that Mikado sales in Europe were growing about 10 percent year. Yakult Honsha, which says its Sofyl yogurts and Yakult fermented-milk drinks contain bacteria that aid digestion, now draws 25.7 percent of its 293 billion yen in annual revenue from overseas units, thanks to 38,000 “Yakult women” who sell the products door to door in Asia and Latin America. The company says it sells 6.5 billion units of Yakult and Sofyl a year outside Japan. “We want our product to be available virtually everywhere, like Coca-Cola, and make a contribution to the health of people around the world,” said Hiroshi Narita, director for the international department at Yakult Honsha. Ajinomoto, a leading Japanese food company, with about 1.2 trillion yen in annual revenue, has increased its overseas sales ratio to 31.8 percent, from 22.8 percent, in eight years. The company’s flagship product, the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate, sells widely in Asia, Latin America and Africa, with overseas sales leaping 80 percent in the last decade, the company said. By contrast, overall company sales in Japan show “a totally different story, growing just a few percentage points every year,” the chief executive, Masatoshi Ito, said. “The home market is a mature one, where we focus on rich, high-value-added goods.” In terms of expansion, Japan’s Asian neighbors offer the biggest opportunities. Countries like Thailand already embrace a Japanese food subculture, and in China, growing numbers of upwardly mobile workers are increasingly inclined to purchase prepared foods and snacks. The international survey firm Euromonitor says that the Lotte Group, a company in Tokyo that sells products in more than 70 countries, is the leading Asian-owned confectioner, with a 10.3 percent market share. The company, maker of Koala’s March — chocolate-filled koala-shaped cookies — ranks fourth in terms of sales among global companies in the Asian sector excluding Japan — ahead of Nestlé but behind Mars, Perfetti Van Melle and Cadbury. Despite quality concerns raised by the recent recalls by Toyota Motor, a scandal caused by the sale of expired dairy products and eggs at Fujiya confectionery in 2007 and the Snow Brand food-poisoning fiasco in 2000, Japanese food manufacturers express pride in the country’s technological expertise. Mr. Muroya, of the Norinchukin Institute, said that safety issues raised in the past had not erased the reputation for reliability that Japanese food companies had nurtured with customers in Asia and Latin America. “Just take the packaging technology,” he said. “The quality of printing, like pictures and letters, and the sealing technology are hard to match.” Ichiro Nakamura, spokesman for Lotte in Japan, said that the 400 versions of Koala’s March cookies — some smile and some cry, some hold musical instruments and some play sports — are much more challenging to manufacture than people might think. “We have a special technology that puffs up the koala-shaped cookies so there is hollow space inside where soft chocolate can be injected later,” Mr. Nakamura said. “And unless you have the right technology, the cookies are going to break easily when packed into boxes.” Mr. Kusama, of Ezaki Glico, is also proud of its Mikado-producing capabilities. “Big Western manufacturers go for mass production and low-cost efficiency,” he said. “I suppose the things we make are too costly and time-consuming for them.” In fact, the sales and marketing strengths of Western food companies far outweigh those of the Japanese. Kraft, for example, has gross sales of $50 billion a year, nearly 10 times as much as Lotte, which grossed about $5 billion in sales in its 2008 financial year. (Lotte has a South Korean affiliate with equal revenue, however.) Analysts and management consultants said that the struggle of the Japanese food companies to keep up with their Western rivals in overseas territories sounded familiar: Japanese companies that have higher-quality products are still sometimes hampered by weak marketing and brand strategies. Yoshizumi Nakano, a senior consultant at Funai Consulting in Tokyo, said that multinational consumer product companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and Coca-Cola could attract talented personnel to their local sales networks, and that that translated into sizable local market share. “They employ the most talented people locally, pay them well and involve them dynamically in building local strategies,” he said. “For the Japanese firms, on the other hand, their overseas expansion is often just an extension of their home operation,” Mr. Nakano said. The local head is usually Japanese, he added, and is the only connection to the headquarters back home. Other local staff members, he said, often have little direct understanding of the company’s overall strategic direction. Kentaro Mori, managing director in Tokyo for the Boston Consulting Group, said: “Japanese firms may say, ‘We have superior products.’ That alone won’t do. You need sales and personnel who understand the trends of the local market, developers who will take the local taste into account and marketers who can explain the product to the locals on their terms.” “You need the whole package in order to win,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/business/media/31adco.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Marketers in Warm-Up for World Cup<date>Published: March 30, 2010</date><text>ALTHOUGH March Madness still has a weekend to go, advertisers are already gearing up for June and July Jubilation.The 2010 World Cup, to be held in South Africa from June 11 to July 11, has attracted a lengthy list of blue-chip sponsors seeking to capitalize on the global passion for soccer — or, as they say outside the United States, football. Marketers are starting to disclose details of their ads or, in some instances, introducing elements of their soccer-centric campaigns. Among those marketers are Adidas, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nike and Visa. The ardor for the World Cup is another example of how advertisers are stepping up support for marquee televised events, known as big event TV. Programs like the Grammy Awards, the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the Oscars have set ratings records or attracted significantly more viewers than in recent years. The strategy is “big voices in big places,” said Christopher J. Perry, interim head of marketing at Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley, Calif., and “we feel we’re reaping a lot of benefits from it.” Hyundai, which sponsored the broadcasts of the Super Bowl, on CBS, and the Academy Awards, on ABC, has a deal to be the exclusive automotive sponsor of the ABC and ESPN coverage of the World Cup, Mr. Perry said, which will be extended into print, online and radio. This dovetails with a deal for the Hyundai Motor America parent in South Korea, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, to become the exclusive automotive global sponsor of the event, which was struck with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA.  Powerade, sold by the Coca-Cola Company, is focusing its first worldwide integrated marketing campaign — for TV, print, online and outdoors — on the brand’s status as the official sports drink of the 2010 World Cup. The ads will even include a phrase proclaiming that Powerade was “chosen by FIFA to hydrate the 2010 FIFA World Cup players.” The campaign is to run in countries that account for more than 95 percent of Powerade’s sales volume, which include Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, South Korea and the United States. The campaign will also promote Powerade’s scheduled presence on the pitch — as they say in soccer — in the form of new squeeze bottles for the players at the 10 stadiums. And signs bearing the Powerade logo are to be posted around the stadiums. “Major sporting events, big-event television, are a wonderful platform,” said Mark Greatrex, senior vice president for global still beverages at Coca-Cola in Atlanta. They also can help “drive global scale for our big brands” as part of an initiative, called 2020 Vision, to more than double systemwide revenue, Mr. Greatrex said. “As we look at the sports-drink category out over the next 10 years,” he added, “there’s a lot of untapped potential” among dedicated athletes. “Part of the strategy is to build up the sports credentials of Powerade,” he said, which is where the FIFA relationship comes in. “We are making a big deal of the FIFA endorsement in every touch point,” he added, whether it is a sign in a convenience store, a Powerade channel on YouTube (youtube.com/powerade), a commercial or a poster. The campaign, which carries the theme “Keep playing,” is the first work for Powerade from the SapientNitro unit of the Sapient Corporation, which was recently named the worldwide digital agency for the brand. SapientNitro is also creating the nondigital elements of the campaign like the TV, print and outdoor ads. The ads present soccer as a game enjoyed around the clock and around the world by a gorgeous mosaic of players. “It doesn’t matter whether you have tons of money or play on a dirt pitch,” said Gaston Legorburu, worldwide creative officer at the Miami office of SapientNitro. “It’s kind of the neverending game.”The campaign aims to invoke the days “when you asked your mom to give you another 10 minutes to play outside,” he added. “There’s almost no light, but you still want to play.” Indeed, some scenes in the commercial and the video clips on the YouTube channel show games being played in the dark.  The Powerade push by Coca-Cola is coming as the brand’s far larger rival, Gatorade, sold by a unit of PepsiCo, is struggling with an unusual sales slump. Volume for Gatorade in the United States fell 15.5 percent last year compared with 2008, according to data from the Beverage Marketing Corporation. By comparison, volume for Powerade declined 1 percent, the data showed, and the sports-drink category fell 12.3 percent. Mr. Greatrex declined to discuss Powerade’s competitors. He did, however, contrast the Gatorade strategy of offering separate beverages to drink before, during and after athletic activity with the Powerade platform of providing consumers “one simple choice, to reach for one sports drink.”</text></article>

The plant, which opened in 2000 and closed five years later, polluted the groundwater and soil around the village of Plachimada, in the state of Kerala, the panel said. Coca-Cola said in a statement that it was unfortunate “that the committee in Kerala was appointed on the unproven assumption that damage was caused, and that it was caused by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages.” According to the panel, the bottling plant discharged a sludge that contained toxic chemicals like cadmium and lead. After villagers complained that the water table had dropped and farms were less productive, the village council decided not to renew the plant’s license.</text></article>

So it came as some surprise this week to see Coke copying the transaction, with a takeover bid of about $13 billion announced for Coca-Cola Enterprises’ North American bottling operations. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Zhu Min was appointed special adviser to the managing director of the I.M.F. Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » The about-face does not mean the decision is not financially and strategically sound. The 1980s-era smoke-and-mirrors trick of spinning off asset-heavy businesses to focus exclusively on its secret-formula concentrate is outdated. Nonetheless, Mr. Kent seems like a charlatan for so recently dismissing the idea after Pepsi beat him to the punch. The numbers work for both Coke and its bottler. That is a bit surprising given they also did when Coke spun it off. Coke cleverly avoids paying cash for the assets it is acquiring. It will cancel its 34 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises, worth $3.4 billion, assume $8.9 billion of debt and absorb about $600 million of unfunded pension liabilities. In return, Coke will get control of a bottling system that needs to adapt. The separation of the bottler from the syrup was applauded by Wall Street back when fizzy drinks were growing fast and the Wal-Marts of the world didn’t have huge market share. But consumer behavior has changed. American customers want a variety of noncarbonated beverages, like the Dasani brand of water and Powerade energy drinks from Coke, which the bottlers don’t look after. And more shoppers buy drinks at superstores, which are more efficiently served by fewer large trucks from warehouses rather than tens of thousands of Enterprises dispatches from bottling plants. While this will require retooling, Coke still says it can squeeze out $350 million of synergies. So why all the glum faces from Coca-Cola shareholders? They sliced nearly $5 billion off its market cap. True, Coca-Cola Enterprises engineered a sweet deal. But there was only one plausible buyer for the assets, so it’s hard to argue Coke was swindled. And Coke is paying about the same multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that Pepsi paid for its bottling assets. Coke investors may simply resent being surprised. While the company’s reversal of a longtime strategy looks sensible, it came out of left field. Mr. Kent, and his predecessor, Neville Isdell, discounted Pepsi’s deal. A chief executive who changes his mind shows either great intellectual flexibility  or a tendency to waffle. Influence at the I.M.F. It’s no secret that China would like to match its rising financial weight with a greater say in the institutions that oversee the global economy. That includes a larger formal voice in the International Monetary Fund. For years, China has been shut out of influential positions at the I.M.F., which is dominated by Western countries. So the appointment this week of Zhu Min as a special adviser to the I.M.F. managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a welcome sign of change. China may have preferred garnering a more senior position. When Mr. Zhu was promoted to be a deputy governor of China’s central bank late in 2009, the assumption in China was that he would soon become a deputy managing director at the I.M.F. (Asia’s top job at the I.M.F. has long held by Japan.) China may have unseated Japan as the world’s largest holder of foreign reserves, but the fund’s board doesn’t appear ready to replace Japan just yet. This may be seen as entrenched interests resisting change. But it also reflects practical experience. When the I.M.F. last year expanded its emergency borrowing program by $500 billion, Japan contributed $100 billion before China committed $50 billion. As an adviser, Mr. Zhu will not have direct influence in driving the fund’s policy agenda. But he may have impact on the margins. He can offer guidance on how the I.M.F. can improve its bonds with Asian emerging markets  a relationship that was strained when the I.M.F. doled out remedies during the 1997 currency crisis. As a former executive at a large state-owned bank, he has knowledge of China’s financial system. Mr. Strauss-Kahn has made it clear that he favors giving emerging markets a greater say at the fund. But he cannot change the balance of power overnight at the I.M.F., which has been the subject of protracted negotiations. Mr. Zhu’s appointment may help speed up the process. But China is still some way from taking its place at the I.M.F.’s top table.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Coca-Cola Enterprises via Bloomberg News Filled boxes moving along a conveyor at Coca-Cola Enterprises, a global company that is Coca-Cola's primary bottler. Related Reuters Breakingviews: Coke Adopts a Move It Scorned (February 26, 2010) Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Coca-Cola Enterprises Incorporated PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » For 24 years, the company had kept its bottling operations separate from its main soft-drink business. But now, under the terms of what the two companies called a “substantially cashless” deal, Coke will take over the North American operations of the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. Coca-Cola Enterprises would then acquire Coke’s own bottling operations in Norway and Sweden, becoming a European-focused producer and distributor of Coke products. It will also have the right to buy Coke’s 83 percent stake in its German bottling operations within 18 to 36 months after the deal’s closing. After the deal’s closing, expected in the fourth quarter, Coke will own about 90 percent of its North American bottling operations. In the deal, valued at more than $13 billion, Coke will give up its 34 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises, valued at $3.4 billion, and assume about $9.5 billion of debts and other obligations. Coke’s Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations are valued at about $822 million. Coca-Cola Enterprises plans to borrow to pay its shareholders, excluding Coke, a special $10-a-share dividend. The bottler also expects to buy back up to $1 billion of its own shares. “We have a strong and unrelenting belief in our unique and thriving global bottling system,” Muhtar Kent, Coke’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Our new North American structure will create an unparalleled combination of businesses, which will serve as our passport to winning in the world’s largest nonalcoholic ready-to-drink profit pool.” Last year, PepsiCo paid $7.8 billion to acquire its two main bottlers, the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas. Mr. Kent said the company’s North American business structure had remained essentially the same since Coca-Cola Enterprises was founded in 1986, while the market and industry had changed. “With this transaction, we are converting passive capital into active capital,” he said. While Coke and C.C.E. have sometimes had a strained relationship, the two have grown tighter in recent years. Mr. Kent spent part of his career in various Coke bottling operations.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Lower costs and higher volume helped increase profit, which was in line with analysts’ estimates. The company gained market share in the carbonated and noncarbonated beverage categories. The results continued a trend for the company, which sells Diet Coke, Sprite and Dasani water among other brands. The company has relied on strength overseas to counter a weak North American market that has experienced high unemployment and low consumer confidence. “This continues to be a story about emerging-market growth,” an analyst at Morningstar, Phil Gorham, said. He pointed to the strong numbers in China and India, particularly when comparing them against “a pretty strong quarter in ’08.” Still, the company gave a tepid outlook. “With consumers still challenged by a mixed global recovery, there again may be bumps along the way, with quarter-to-quarter volatility still possible as we move through 2010,” the chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said. Coca-Cola said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $1.54 billion, or 66 cents a share, from $995 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts’ average forecast was 66 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Net operating revenue rose 5 percent, to $7.51 billion, topping analysts’ average forecast of $7.22 billion. Sales by volume  an important measure for investors  rose 5 percent, outpacing gains of 2 percent in the third quarter, 4 percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first quarter. Several analysts were expecting volume to grow about 2 percent. Fourth-quarter sales volume rose 11 percent in the Pacific region, driven by a 29 percent increase in China, where Coke said it would continue to focus on generating double-digit annual growth rates. Sales volume rose 7 percent in Latin America, 1 percent in Europe and 5 percent in the company’s Eurasia and Africa division. Volume fell 1 percent in the North American market because of continued pressure on consumer spending and weak traffic to restaurants. Still, that decline was smaller than the 4 percent drop in the previous quarter. Shares of Coca-Cola rose $1.36, or 2.58 percent, to close at $54.01 on Tuesday.

There were some surprises near the end of the game in the ad line-up. Anheuser-Busch InBev added a spot in the fourth quarter, for Bud Light, bringing its total for the game to nine. Hyundai also added a spot in the fourth quarter, running a commercial for the Hyundai Sonata that had appeared during the pre-game show. The spot, depicting the workers of the Hyundai plant in Alabama carrying a car from the beginning of its manufacturing to the end, becomes the second in the game using a crowd joining forces to do good; there was a Budweiser spot with a similar tack, in which townspeople built a human bridge. E*Trade also bought an additional spot that was originally not in its plans, also in the fourth quarter. The spot featured five babies; the first one had three. There had been speculation that additional commercials would turn up in the game because of the strong demand among advertisers for time during this Super Bowl. Update | 9:47 p.m. The Ad Bowl inside the Super Bowl may have come to an end. There are usually no more commercials after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. By a preliminary count, there have been 63 spots in the game, and with two of them the identical spot for Skechers, the final total could be 62. A typical Super Bowl has 62 commercials. This game marked the third in a row that the fourth quarter was close (well, in this instance, for a while). The old theories about not wanting to buy time in the second half of a game, or especially in the final quarter, may finally be disproved. Update | 9:36 p.m. More grist for the mill of those who believe there is a misogynistic streak in the Super Bowl spots: a commercial for Bud Light beer in which a loutish man disrupts a women’s book club. “I’d love to hear you read some words,” the Neanderthal tells an attractive woman. The punch line at the end involves a weak play on words on “Little Women”: “I’m not too picky, you know.” Add the Bud Light spot to others for brands like Dodge and Flo TV and there is going to be an intense conversation in the hours and days after the game about Madison Avenue’s attitude toward women. Update | 9:19 p.m. There seems to be a theme in many of the Super Bowl spots: the need to reassure men that they are as manly as they hope they are. That theme recurs in Super Bowl ads because so many of the viewers are men and so many of the products advertised are aimed at them. For instance, a Dodge spot carried the theme “Man’s last stand” and showed men thinking to themselves about the women in their lives. The thoughts were not of the type to win plaudits from feminists; they were grudging and stereotyped, along the lines of “I will watch your vampire TV shows with you.” There was a spot for Flo TV showing a man shopping with a woman for women’s clothes. A man observing him was not pleased, admonishing him, “Change out of that skirt, Jason.” A spot for Dockers touched on the theme but more subtly, telling men it is time to “wear the pants” and showing scads of them pantsless. The overly masculine tone is upsetting many people who are posting comments to blogs about the Super Bowl spots, particularly women, who are decrying those spots as misogynistic. Update | 9:04 p.m. With the third quarter over, here is a wrap-up of the first three quarters, ad-wise. There were 15 spots in the third quarter, although my count may be off. Adding 15 to the 15 in the second quarter and 18 in the first brings the total so far to 48. Scotts, with a third-quarter spot for Roundup weed killer, was an advertiser that had not been listed in any of the pre-game rosters of Super Bowl advertisers. And the Google spot in the third quarter was unexpected, too, although tech bloggers had been speculating about it for the last day. Still a lot of anticipated spots to come, including the first appearance by the Budweiser Clydesdales. Update | 8:57 p.m. The speculation was indeed true — Google bought a commercial during the Super Bowl. The spot, appearing in the third quarter, was, as bloggers reported in the last day, promoting Google’s search function and is part of a series demonstrating search in action. The spot began with “study abroad” in Paris and continued through what seemed to be a whirlwind romance, through “jobs in Paris,” “churches in Paris” and “how to assemble a crib” — with an infant’s gurgle at the end. It was just like that sequence from the animated film “Up,” showing the married life of the old man, only about three minutes faster. The spot was tipped off by a Tweet from Google’s chief executive that alerted everyone to watch the spots during the third quarter. Update | 8:56 p.m. Men without pants … a Super Bowl XLIV theme. In the third quarter there was a third spot featuring a pantsless man. It was for Coca-Cola and showed a man sleepwalking through the veldt, encountering animals. The other two, also in the third quarter, were for CareerBuilder.com and Dockers. Update | 8:48 p.m. CBS came in for a considerable amount of criticism before the game when it refused to sell a commercial during the game to a gay dating Web site, ManCrunch.com. But a gay couple appeared in a spot in the third quarter, for Motorola. The spot featured Megan Fox in a bathtub wondering what would happen if she was to send a photo of herself out into the world. Among the vignettes of havoc was a scene of two men in a kitchen. One slapped the other in the face and the second man slapped back. The implication was that Ms. Fox’s naughty pictures could even come between a gay couple. It was a nice moment of inclusion rather than exclusion. Update | 8:05 p.m. And here is the halftime report on the commercials. There were 15 spots in the second quarter, with an asterisk, which added to the 18 in the first quarter totals 33. The average Super Bowl has 62 or so commercials of varying lengths, so Super Bowl XLIV is on track to be typical. The asterisk for the second quarter refers to three spots that will probably not be counted by the USA Today Ad Meter, pollsters, data trackers and the like who obsess over Super Bowl ads. One was for Papa John’s pizza, but because it was bought from the National Football League rather than CBS it will not be counted by most folks. The other two were promotions from CBS itself, one featuring Mark Sanchez of the New York Jets in a “CBS Cares” spiel for women’s heart health and the other a hilarious surprise pitch for “Late Show With David Letterman.” The latter was a sequel to a surprise promotion that CBS ran the last time the network broadcast a Super Bowl, in 2007. The spot three years ago had Mr. Letterman with Oprah Winfrey on a couch watching the game together; the new one added Jay Leno to the mix. In a news release sent minutes ago by CBS, the network said the new promotion was taped last week at the Ed Sullivan Theater, the home of “Late Show.” Update | 7:49 p.m. For the second time in the second quarter, there were two spots in a row with common content. The last time, it was spots for CareerBuilder.com and Dockers that both had men without pants. This time, it was spots for Dr Pepper Cherry soda and a new series on the truTV cable channel, “N.F.L. Full Contact,” that both had mini-men. For Dr Pepper Cherry, the wee men were dressed as members of Kiss. For the TV series, there was a miniature version of the football star Troy Polamalu. Kudos to CBS if this is all on purpose. Update | 7:37 p.m. Who wears the pants in the Super Bowl? Maybe no one. A commercial for CareerBuilder.com after the second quarter began, in which office workers wore only their underwear, was followed by a spot for Dockers in which men were shown pantsless. The CareerBuilder spot, part of a contest to get consumers to create commercials, was a joke about casual Fridays being taken to their illogical extreme. The Dockers spot was meant to comment on men needing to “wear the pants,” i.e., be mature enough to be seen in a pair of khakis. A delightful coincidence or the result of careful planning? It may be a Super Bowl ad mystery for the ages. Update | 7:29 p.m. CBS had a trick up its sleeve with an eye-popping promotional spot that appeared not long after the second quarter started. The spot showed David Letterman on a sofa watching the game with Jay Leno and Oprah Winfrey. The spot promoted “Late Show With David Letterman” and will certainly get a lot of post-game attention. It looked as if the improbable trio was actually on the sofa all at the same time. 7:20 p.m.: The first quarter is over and here is the ad count so far: 18 commercials, including the much-discussed Focus on the Family spot. Anheuser-Busch InBev and Frito-Lay had the most, three apiece. The Anheuser-Busch spots were all for Bud Light. The Frito-Lay spots were all for Doritos and all finalists in its consumer-created “Crash the Super Bowl” ad contest. The company was to run three spots in the game but in an e-mail message a spokesman said that Frito-Lay had an opportunity to buy a fourth spot so there will be another Doritos ad created by a consumer to come. Universal Pictures followed, with two spots, for the movies “Robin Hood” and “The Wolfman.” 7:03 p.m.: It was at 6:43 p.m. Eastern Time that Super Bowl ad history was made: the first commercial to advocate a side on a contentious public issue was shown. The spot was, of course, the commercial from Focus on the Family, the evangelical organization, which bought 30 seconds of time from CBS. The spot was similar to one that the organization ran several times in the pre-game show. It was the third commercial to be shown during Super Bowl XLIV, after spots in the first quarter for Bud Light beer and Snickers. The spot, as expected, featured the college football star Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam, who are both against abortion. The spot never used the word “abortion,” and the only nod to the organization’s anti-abortion stance was the sign off at the end, “Celebrate family. Celebrate life.” An article in USA Today on Friday suggested that the word was omitted to help smooth the clearance process for the spot to be accepted for airing. The spot directed viewers to the Focus on the Family Web site, where full information is available about a story Mrs. Tebow has often told about deciding to give birth to Tim despite doctors’ suggestions she get an abortion. The spot alluded to Mrs. Tebow’s story, which received extensive coverage before the commercial appeared, in a couple of ways. After Mr. Tebow pretends to tackle his mother, she says to him, “We’re trying to tell our story here.” And on screen these words appeared at the end of the spot: “For the full Tebow story, go to focusonthefamily.com.” The spot was slick and well done; a casual viewer might not have any idea it was from an organization as opposed to abortion as Focus on the Family. It used a production style and tone that is typical of Oprah Winfrey: upbeat, seemingly free of ideology, including chirpy music. The appearance of the spot has opened a debate on whether advocacy and issue ads belong on a Super Bowl, which has become an unofficial midwinter American holiday. If the answer is yes, there may come a time when watching the Super Bowl will be like watching TV in a swing state like Ohio or Florida the Sunday before a presidential election, with commercials taking sides showing up every couple of minutes. 6:35 p.m.: One of the last pre-game spots, for McDonald’s, was a winner. It was a sequel to a popular spot the company ran in the game in 1993, called “The Showdown,” pitting Michael Jordan and Larry Bird against each other in a game for fast food. The sequel was great, with LeBron James and Dwight Howard subbing for the original pair of basketball stars. And Mr. Bird even had a cameo. The question is, why didn’t McDonald’s run the spot in the game? Was the cost of a spot in the game so much more than one just a few minutes before the game starts? 6:25 p.m.: Although the Super Bowl is often the program watched each year by more women than any other, there are few signs of that in the line-up of commercials scheduled for the game. In the final minutes of the pre-game show, there was one spot aimed at women, for L’Oreal, and another, for Quilted Northern bathroom tissue, a product that is more often bought for a household by the woman than the man. As for the line-up in the game, some products are bought by women as well as men, among them Coca-Cola. But the lion’s share of spots will be aimed at men. Of course, the lopsided focus reflects that Super Bowls are by far the biggest show of the year for male viewers. Sometimes, though, advertisers reach out to the large female audience by scheduling spots for products meant for women. One year a commercial for Dove got a lot of attention. This year there will be a spot for Dove — but for the brand’s new line for men. 5:20 p.m.: The organization that is sponsoring what is perhaps the most talked-about commercial to be shown during Super Bowl XLIV is already running an ad. Focus on the Family, the evangelical organization that has bought a spot in the game, has been running a commercial during the pre-game coverage on CBS. The pre-game spot, like the spot the group is running during the game, features the college football star Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam, who have both in the past been vocal in their opposition to abortion. The pre-game spot, which has already run at least three times, shows Mrs. Tebow talking about her “miracle baby,” who turns out to be Tim. He appears at the end, hugging his mother, after which these words appear on screen: “For the full Tebow story, go to focusonthefamily.com.” It is not clear how much or how little the spot in the game will resemble the pre-game spot because Focus on the Family is not disclosing ahead of time any details about its in-game commercial. The presence of the commercial has been perhaps the biggest advertising story of this Super Bowl because it is probably the first time that an advocacy spot, taking sides on a contentious issue, has been accepted for broadcast during a Super Bowl. The commercial in the pre-game coverage does not include the word “abortion,” and is worded so carefully that an uninformed viewer might not know what the subject of the spot is. Focus on the Family is a conservative organization that is against abortion and gay rights. In a video clip on the organization’s Web site, an official says the Focus on the Family Super Bowl spot is to appear early in the game. USA Today reported on Friday that it is planned as the third spot in the first commercial break in the first quarter — in other words, the third commercial in the game.</text></article>

For Super Bowl XLIV on Sunday, the anticipation may be more keen than usual.

Multimedia The Ad Super Bowl Add to Portfolio CBS Corp Omnicom Group Incorporated PepsiCo Inc Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image A scene from the ad for the video game Dante’s Inferno by Electronic Arts, which changed the ad’s ending to meet CBS standards. Enlarge This Image A scene from a commercial for Denny’s, which bought three ads this year. “I can’t wait to watch,” said Steve McKee, president at McKee Wallwork Cleveland, an agency in Albuquerque, N.M., that for the 10th year is sponsoring a Web site, adbowl.com, where consumers can vote for their favorite commercials. For 2010, the agency is adding an Adbowl application for the iPhone. There are several reasons for the additional interest in the spots that CBS will broadcast on Sunday. The biggest is the inclusion of what is being called the first advocacy ad to ever appear in a Super Bowl, a commercial from Focus on the Family, an evangelical organization that is opposed to abortion. The spot, featuring the college football star Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam, has been the subject of one of the most intense tugs-of-war over an ad in many years. CBS is not disclosing beforehand the contents of the commercial or when during the game it will run, but that has not stopped advocates on both sides of the abortion issue from rallying supporters for or against the spot. For example, two organizations opposed to abortion, Americans United for Life Action and LifeNews.com, started a page on Facebook called Support Tebow’s Super Bowl Ad; as of Thursday afternoon, there were more than 168,100 fans. Planned Parenthood, which supports abortion rights, introduced on Wednesday an online commercial featuring two athletes  Sean James, who played for the Minnesota Vikings, and Al Joyner, an Olympic gold medalist  endorsing the right of a woman to make her own “decision about her health and her family.” Surveys by companies like Alterian, Nielsen and Zeta Interactive have reported that the Focus on the Family spot is the most-discussed of all potential Super Bowl commercials in online places like blogs and message boards. They also found extensive conversations about spots planned from other advertisers like Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Doritos, Taco Bell and Universal Pictures. The buzz suggests “there’ll be great dialogue about the commercials” after the game as well, said Nelson Marchioli, chief executive at Denny’s, which is buying three commercials in the game compared with one during the 2009 Super Bowl. “Last year, we got such a wonderful response, not only from customers but also from employees and franchisees,” Mr. Marchioli said. So “we wanted to plus it up” with additional spots, he added, as well as start a promotion on dennys.com to win free breakfasts earlier than it began last year. The Denny’s spots are being created by Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, a unit of the Omnicom Group. Another reason for the growing curiosity about the Super Bowl XLIV commercials is that the presence of the Focus on the Family spot is shining a brighter light on the contents of all the ads. For instance, a decision by CBS this week that Electronic Arts change the ending of its Super Bowl spot, promoting the new Dante’s Inferno video game, drew national attention. The company and its agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, wanted to end the spot with the words “Go to hell,” but CBS said the phrase did not meet its broadcast standards; the wording was changed to “Hell awaits.” Likewise, decisions by CBS to reject commercials submitted by other advertisers were extensively covered, although such refusals are commonplace before most Super Bowls. CareerBuilder.com, GoDaddy.com and KGB, a text-message information service, were told some spots they sought to run did not meet standards for broadcast; all three replaced those spots with others that were accepted. And there were thousands of articles devoted to the refusal of CBS to accept a commercial from ManCrunch.com, a new gay dating Web site. CBS said the spot  depicting two men in a passionate clinch that resembled dirty dancing without the dancing  did not meet its broadcast standards. The network also said it was worried about the ability of the Web site to pay for the commercial. Executives at ManCrunch.com said they had the money and called the refusal discriminatory. Despite the interest in commercials that will not appear, advertisers say they are confident the spots they intend to run will be noticed. “I think we’re getting our fair share of attention,” said Rudy Wilson, vice president for marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex., a division of PepsiCo. Frito-Lay is back with another Crash the Super Bowl contest, asking consumers to create commercials for Doritos snacks. Three consumer-produced spots, from more than 4,000 entries, will run during the game; based on their performance in the Super Bowl Ad Meter conducted by USA Today, Frito-Lay could give away as much as $5 million in prize money. Last year, a Doritos commercial created by two brothers from Batesville, Ind., won $1 million. The Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo raised eyebrows when it said it would skip Super Bowl XLIV after more than two decades of sponsorship. “I can’t really speak for Pepsi’s decision,” Mr. Wilson said, adding, “At Doritos we’re happy and excited” about returning to the Super Bowl. “We’re the biggest, baddest, boldest chip out there, and we needed the biggest, baddest, boldest stage out there,” he added. “That platform is the Super Bowl.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 5, 2010, on page B3 of the New York edition.</text></article>

The deal would allow Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drink maker, to take over a leading position on the Russian juice market from its rival PepsiCo, which together with Pepsi Bottling Group owns Russia’s largest juice maker, Lebedyansky. Lion Capital bought a 75 percent stake in Russia’s fourth-largest juice maker in 2007 and is now offering to sell it, two sources close to Nidan Soki told Reuters.

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/business/media/11adnewsletter2.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Q &amp; A with Stuart Elliott<date>Published: January 11, 2010</date><text>Q: (Reader) Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Wal-Mart Stores Inc Go to your Portfolio » My husband and I did a movie marathon recently and, as a result, saw every commercial they run like six times. There is one, a very long song, that seems to be a joint commercial for Coke and Wal-Mart. This struck us both as odd. What does each get out of this? Do they pay equally? Why does Coke want to be associated with Wal-Mart? Are there other commercials like this? A: (Stuart Elliott) Here is a reply, dear reader, from Dean Jarrett, a spokesman for the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies that worked on the commercial on behalf of Wal-Mart. “Your ‘movie marathon’ reader is describing an advertising technique commonly known in our industry as ‘co-op,’ or advertising that is funded by multiple partners to achieve a common goal,” Mr. Jarrett writes in an e-mail message. In this instance, the commercial, called “Extended Family,” began appearing in movie theaters in 2008 and returned for the 2009 holiday season. The catchy song in the spot is sung by a young man walking through his house, handing out bottles of Coke to guests at a party. “Our goal was to create an entertaining and uplifting alternative to traditional co-op advertising,” Mr. Jarrett says, which “can typically be very straightforward.” In co-op advertising, agencies representing the different brands collaborate, too, as well as the marketers. Here, Martin, the Wal-Mart agency, worked with a Coca-Cola agency -- Leo Burnett, part of the Publicis Groupe -- to create the spot. “Coke and Wal-Mart are wonderfully complementary and logical co-op partners because Coke is one of the world’s premier brands and nobody in the U.S. sells more Coke products at retail than Wal-Mart,” Mr. Jarrett says. “While we can’t get into payment details about a specific commercial,” he adds, “it is common practice for co-op partners to share both production and media costs.” “Examples of this type of advertising can be seen everywhere from print, radio and online to out-of-home and TV,” Mr. Jarrett says. “If it’s an ad promoting a product and reminding you to buy it at a particular place, good chance it’s a co-op ad.” Wal-Mart recently collaborated with Unilever on a co-op commercial for Dove soap. And Target, a Wal-Mart rival, has run spots for many years that feature artful displays of various products sold in Target stores. The timing of the commercial pairing Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart seems unrelated to a dispute between Coca-Cola and another retailer, Costco, which briefly led to the removal of Coca-Cola products from the shelves of Costco warehouse stores. The products went back on sale before the holidays. Mr. Jarrett would like to share some more information about the commercial: Dave Muhlenfeld, who wrote “Joy,” is “also the creator of those catchy tunes” in the commercials for freecreditreport.com, he says, which are also from Martin. Q: (Reader) My wife and I have actually enjoyed the Southwest Airlines advertisements that show its baggage handlers doing their jobs. They seem to enjoy the jobs so much, it appears like they might be actors. Are these the real Southwest Airlines baggage handlers in the ads? We hope so. A: (Stuart Elliott) “Yes, we used actual baggage handlers,” Melanie Mahaffey, a spokeswoman for the Southwest agency, GSD&amp;M Idea City, writes in an e-mail message. (The airline “calls them ramp agents,” she notes.) The employees, from various airports, appear in the spots “to tout the airline’s ‘Bags fly free’ policy,” Ms. Mahaffey says. The commercials are part of a campaign that carries the theme “Grab your bag, it’s on,” which began last June. Paul Brooks, a ramp agent in one of the spots, was even singled out by Bob Garfield, the ad critic for Advertising Age, in his annual “Bobby Awards” column praising outstanding performances in commercials. Mr. Brooks, who works at the airport in Austin, Tex., bested two professional actors to win a Bobby from Mr. Garfield. “We love this guy,” Mr. Garfield wrote in his column in the Jan. 4 issue of Ad Age, “and now we sort of love Southwest Airlines, too.” GSD&amp;M Idea City, based in Austin, is part of the Omnicom Group.

A donor list released Friday by the William J. Clinton Foundation shows that in all, Norway has given $10 million to $25 million to the charity since its founding roughly a decade ago. Oman gave $1 million to $5 million. The list gave only cumulative ranges rather than precise donations and did not say how much each contributor gave last year. The Clintons agreed to disclose the names of donors to the foundation annually to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest between the former president's fund-raising efforts abroad and Mrs. Clinton's role in helping to direct Obama administration foreign policy. President Obama made the disclosure a condition of his selection of Mrs. Clinton for the post. When the first list was released in December 2008, the two senior lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said the disclosure was ''designed to establish greater transparency and predictability with regard to the activities of the Clinton Foundation in the context of Senator Clinton's service as secretary of state.'' The William J. Clinton Foundation works in the United States and around the world on issues like climate change, economic development and health care, particularly H.I.V. and AIDS. It also runs the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Ark., which includes Mr. Clinton's presidential library. Last year's donors included the Saudi Arabian businessman Nasser al-Rashid, who has given at least $1 million to the foundation; professional golf's PGA Tour Inc., which donated $50,001 to $100,000 over all; and Mr. Trump, who has given $50,001 to $100,000 over all. Several foreign governments that appeared in the foundation's first disclosure in 2008 did not give last year.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image The facial profiler matched the photo of Stephanie Clifford, left, with that of Julianna Kay Mishkel, of Tampa, Fla. Related Times Topics: Facebook | Coca-Cola Company Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » It is not entering the online dating game but running a Facebook application that scans photographs of faces and tries to find matching images in its database, using attributes like skin color and chin angles. The idea behind the application, the “Coke Zero Facial Profiler,” is to draw people in with an entertaining game and surround them with a brand message while the profiler uploads and analyzes the photographs. Coke Zero is “still, in the scheme of things, a relatively young brand,” said Linda Cronin, director of media and interactive communications for Coca-Cola North America. The company wants to broadcast the message that Coke Zero tastes like regular Coke, and “coming to the site and interacting with the site helps us accomplish that goal,” she said. Coke Zero was introduced in the United States in 2005. “We had Coke and we had Diet Coke, but we were missing a no-calorie beverage for people that really love Coke. Diet Coke has a cola taste, but it was never intended to taste just like Coke,” Susan Stribling, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, said. In addition, young men largely avoided Diet Coke because “anything that’s ‘diet,’ they think that’s for girls,” Ms. Stribling said. Still, “we didn’t want to be Diet Coke for dudes,” said Dave Shiff, creative director for Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky, owned by MDC Partners, which handles the advertising for Coke Zero. “It skewed male in the beginning, but the goal was always that it should not alienate  a woman should be able to pick up Coke Zero and not feel weird about drinking it.” The campaigns have focused on the similarities between Coke and Coke Zero. Advertisements in 2006, for instance, depicted a scene of Coke brand managers fuming over Coke Zero stealing Coke’s taste profile and considering legal action. “What we tried to do is say, ‘Hey, look, let’s not just say Coke Zero tastes like Coke; let’s prove it. What are some of the things that might happen?’ ” said Jeff Benjamin, interactive executive creative director at Crispin. That spurred the idea for the facial profiler  if Coke tastes like Coke Zero, could someone out there look like you? The company introduced it in September as a Facebook application, though it began delivering matches only this month, when it had collected enough photographs. (More than 430,000 have been uploaded to date.) To use it, a visitor can gain access to the application through Facebook or by visiting cokezero.com and agreeing to let the application pull information from his or her Facebook account. The application examines the Facebook photographs of the visitor, then has the visitor add another photograph from his or her desktop or Web camera. Using facial-recognition software developed by an outside company, the application analyzes attributes like skin color, face structure and angles on the face. “It basically takes your face and turns it into raw data, then runs your face and matches it through the database of all these different people,” Mr. Benjamin said. In a test run, this reporter uploaded three different photographs and got three different matches. All were women, which was a relief, but the matches didn’t look like doppelgangers  they seemed to be based on the position of the face in the photo, and things like the shape of lips, chin and eyes. One of the matches, Julianna Kay Mishkel, of Tampa, Fla., said she had found that the matches were somewhat “hit and miss  some I could see the similarities, and some looked nothing like me.” “I do see similarities between us, same face shape, smile is similar, and a little bit of similarity in the eyes as well, but our noses are different,” Ms. Mishkel said in a Facebook message. “I thought it would be interesting to see if I really did have a ‘twin’ somewhere out there.” After receiving a match, the visitor can contact him or her via their Facebook page  how frequently people do that, Ms. Cronin said, is “yet to be seen.” (Mr. Shiff suggested some other, more humorous, uses that look-alikes might find for the application, like using one another’s gym memberships). Coca-Cola is gathering data on the application, but with this, as with many new-media projects, it is not entirely clear what the data mean. More than 288,000 people have installed the application, and the average time spent on cokezero.com (Coca-Cola does not have access to time spent on the Facebook version) for the week of Dec. 7, the most recent week available, was more than five and a half minutes. That time is “comparatively high relative to other programs,” Ms. Cronin said. There are sprinklings of other data. For example, there have been more than 100 non-English Twitter posts about the profiler, but whether that is good or bad is unclear. Coke will test to see whether the application has changed how people think about Coke Zero, and though “obviously we want to see an increase in sales, it’s very difficult” to trace it to a single campaign element when there are other elements going on, Ms. Cronin said. The effort required just a small media budget and was “absolutely” experimental, Ms. Cronin said. “Internally, we call it a worldwide social experiment to see how this is doing, what does it do for our brand-health measures,” she said. “We feel like it’s creating the buzz that we want.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 31, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/opinion/06diamond.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Will Big Business Save the Earth?<date>Published: December 5, 2009</date><text>Los Angeles Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Alain Pilon THERE is a widespread view, particularly among environmentalists and liberals, that big businesses are environmentally destructive, greedy, evil and driven by short-term profits. I know  because I used to share that view. But today I have more nuanced feelings. Over the years I’ve joined the boards of two environmental groups, the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation International, serving alongside many business executives. As part of my board work, I have been asked to assess the environments in oil fields, and have had frank discussions with oil company employees at all levels. I’ve also worked with executives of mining, retail, logging and financial services companies. I’ve discovered that while some businesses are indeed as destructive as many suspect, others are among the world’s strongest positive forces for environmental sustainability. The embrace of environmental concerns by chief executives has accelerated recently for several reasons. Lower consumption of environmental resources saves money in the short run. Maintaining sustainable resource levels and not polluting saves money in the long run. And a clean image  one attained by, say, avoiding oil spills and other environmental disasters  reduces criticism from employees, consumers and government. What’s my evidence for this? Here are a few examples involving three corporations  Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola and Chevron  that many critics of business love to hate, in my opinion, unjustly. Let’s start with Wal-Mart. Obviously, a business can save money by finding ways to spend less while maintaining sales. This is what Wal-Mart did with fuel costs, which the company reduced by $26 million per year simply by changing the way it managed its enormous truck fleet. Instead of running a truck’s engine all night to heat or cool the cab during mandatory 10-hour rest stops, the company installed small auxiliary power units to do the job. In addition to lowering fuel costs, the move eliminated the carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to taking 18,300 passenger vehicles off the road. Wal-Mart is also working to double the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 2015, thereby saving more than $200 million a year at the pump. Among the efficient prototypes now being tested are trucks that burn biofuels generated from waste grease at Wal-Mart’s delis. Similarly, as the country’s biggest private user of electricity, Wal-Mart is saving money by decreasing store energy use. Another Wal-Mart example involves lowering costs associated with packaging materials. Wal-Mart now sells only concentrated liquid laundry detergents in North America, which has reduced the size of packaging by up to 50 percent. Wal-Mart stores also have machines called bailers that recycle plastics that once would have been discarded. Wal-Mart’s eventual goal is to end up with no packaging waste. One last Wal-Mart example shows how a company can save money in the long run by buying from sustainably managed sources. Because most wild fisheries are managed unsustainably, prices for Chilean sea bass and Atlantic tuna have been soaring. To my pleasant astonishment, in 2006 Wal-Mart decided to switch, within five years, all its purchases of wild-caught seafood to fisheries certified as sustainable. Coca-Cola’s problems are different from Wal-Mart’s in that they are largely long-term. The key ingredient in Coke products is water. The company produces its beverages in about 200 countries through local franchises, all of which require a reliable local supply of clean fresh water. But water supplies are under severe pressure around the world, with most already allocated for human use. The little remaining unallocated fresh water is in remote areas unsuitable for beverage factories, like Arctic Russia and northwestern Australia. Coca-Cola can’t meet its water needs just by desalinizing seawater, because that requires energy, which is also increasingly expensive. Global climate change is making water scarcer, especially in the densely populated temperate-zone countries, like the United States, that are Coca-Cola’s main customers. Most competing water use around the world is for agriculture, which presents sustainability problems of its own. 1 2 3 Next Page » Jared Diamond, a professor of geography at the University of California at Los Angeles, is the author of Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse. More Articles in Opinion » A version of this article appeared in print on December 6, 2009, on page WK12 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » The company has been spending heavily to try to turn around North American sales, through advertising, new marketing techniques and changes in packaging and store displays. Despite that, North American sales, measured by case volume, were down 4 percent in the quarter, which ended Oct. 2, compared with the same period a year earlier. That was partly because the Fourth of July holiday shifted from the company’s third quarter to its second quarter this year. Volume sales for the first nine months of the year were down 2 percent. Outside of North America, case volume sales grew 4 percent in the quarter. Net income for the company was $1.896 billion for the quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier, which amounted to earnings of 81 cents a share during both periods. “We’ve been able to deliver for the first nine months of a very challenging operating environment,” Coca-Cola’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said in an interview. Mr. Kent stressed that about 80 percent of the company’s sales volume comes from outside North America. But he added that he would be “disappointed” if North American results did not begin to improve. In India, the company reported growth of 37 percent in volume sales. In China, sales grew by 15 percent. Volume sales in Mexico grew by 9 percent while they rose 3 percent in Brazil. In Russia, volume sales dropped by double digits, although the company did not give a specific figure. John Sicher, the publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade publication, said that Coke, like its rival PepsiCo, was suffering in part because its two biggest product categories in North America, carbonated soft drinks and bottled water, were both declining in sales. “North America continues to be a problem, and the big challenge in the next year or two is to get North America at least back to flat,” Mr. Sicher said. “North America being flat, with Coke’s international growth, paints a whole different picture.” Mr. Kent said that sales of Dasani brand water in North America were down by more than 19 percent. Sales of multipacks of Dasani, a popular packaging for water, were down even more, he said. Stock in Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, fell 76 cents, to $54.03 a share.

Cane Sugar: Jack Atley/Bloomberg News. More from Rob Walker at his blog, murketing.com/journal RSS Feed   Rob Walker's Consumed Column » Related More Consumed Columns Spend a few years writing about consumer culture, and you might get a little jaded about products or brands with cult followings. The extreme-loyalist customer always insists that there are perfectly rational reasons for his or her devotion; to the disinterested observer, the reasons seem dubious. This is good news for me, because it assures that I have plenty to write about. But this week, for once, I’m casting myself in the role not of the reasonable observer but of the dubious product-cultist. The product is Coca-Cola that is made and bottled in Mexico. I’m not the only person who believes that it’s better: there’s a Mexican Coke Facebook page with more than 10,000 fans. “I am a (Mexican) Coke fiend,” wrote Richard Metzger on the Web site Dangerous Minds this past August. “It is SO FREAKING DELICIOUS.” Mexican Coke is “a lot more natural tasting,” another fan recently told a news program in Idaho. “A little less harsh, I would say.” Mexican Coke cultists of course have a rational explanation: Coca-Cola bottled in Mexico is sweetened with sugar, while the U.S. version is (almost) always made with high-fructose corn syrup. That is so. And it’s surprising, given the degree to which uniformity defines the Coke idea. Who knew the “secret formula” could accommodate ingredient variation? Andy Warhol once suggested that Coke’s sameness united us all: “A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the president knows it, the bum knows it and you know it.” My own induction into this product cult was inadvertent and based on aesthetics. Some years ago I noticed a glass bottle of Coke for sale, and that was something I hadn’t seen in a while. It looked great; I enjoyed drinking it immensely. I didn’t notice the “No Retornable” and “Refresco” phrases on the 12-ounce bottle, or the ingredients. My rational explanation was that Coke tastes better from a glass bottle than from a plastic one or from a can. It happens that Popular Science examined this very contention on its Web site not long ago and allowed that as the “most inert” material in which the cola is packaged, it’s possible that glass results in a subtly more “pure, unaltered” product than plastic or aluminum. Of course a commenter on that site promptly chimed in that glass-bottle Coke often comes from Mexico: “In the United States, Coke is made with CORN SYRUP. . . . It’s disgusting.” I’ve now heard this contention many times, but never more so than lately, as high-fructose corn syrup has become one of the most demonized ingredients in contemporary food culture. There’s a political angle (corn subsidies), an authenticity angle (it’s processed, very pervasive and just sounds industrial) and a paranoid angle (the entertaining conspiracy theory that the 1985 New Coke fiasco was an intentional failure, orchestrated to distract consumers from an ingredient switch in Coke Classic). The upshot is the curious celebration of sugar as natural and desirable. Pure-sugar soda fans motivate other product cults, including Passover Coke (using sugar instead of not-kosher-for-Passover corn syrup) available only around the Jewish holiday, and Dr Pepper from a particular bottler in Dublin, Tex.; Coke’s biggest rival has put out a product called Pepsi Throwback, “sweetened with natural sugar.” Somehow all the reverence for sugar manages to make high-calorie carbonated drinks sound like health food. The Coca-Cola Company is by now quite familiar with the Mexican Coke cult. It is true, acknowledges a Coke spokesman, Scott Williamson, that different sweeteners are used by the company’s bottling partners in different parts of the world, for reasons having to do with price and availability. But, he says, “all of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible.” The company principally imports the Mexican version to appeal to immigrants who grew up with it and draw nostalgia from the packaging they remember. Online you’ll find Mexican Coke cultists offering tips about tracking down grocers who serve a primarily Latino clientele. Surely this is part of the fun — nobody wants to be a snob on behalf of a product that’s easy to obtain. But Coke is in the business of supply and demand and has seen to it that Mexican Coke has found its way into places like Kroger, Costco and a certain sandwich shop in my not-very-Hispanic neighborhood in Georgia. I have lunch there every week or two, and while it would be cheaper to have a can of American Coke, I always pay extra for the 12-ounce bottle that says it’s “Hecho en Mexico.” I do this because I believe it tastes better, and I really don’t care why. Spend a few years writing a column about consumer culture, and what you learn is that we all think everyone else’s shopping quirks are weird and irrational — but that our own make perfect sense.

Yang Boning, a spokesman for the N.B.A. in China, confirmed that a former employee had recently been detained in Shanghai, saying, “he did something wrong when he was working with the N.B.A.” Mr. Yang said the employee is Chinese-born and that police were still investigating. He also said there was no wrongdoing on the part of the N.B.A. Two former Coca-Cola bottling plant employees were detained in Shanghai for allegedly engaging in bribery, kickbacks and embezzlement, according to Coca-Cola. On Thursday, Kenth Kaerhoeg, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Coca- Cola, declined to say whether the N.B.A. case was linked to the Coca-Cola investigation. China Daily, the country’s largest English language newspaper, reported Thursday that Shanghai police officials had confirmed that the former N.B.A. employee was detained as part of the investigation into the Coca-Cola Shanghai bottling plant case. China Daily said a spokesman for Shanghai’s Public Security Bureau confirmed the arrest and link. Reached late Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Shanghai police said she did not know much about the case, except that it had been moved to another district. Both the N.B.A. and Coca-Cola are in the midst of aggressive expansion efforts in China. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

The announcement came just days after Coca-Cola confirmed that a middle manager at the same facility, the Shanghai Shenmei Beverage &amp; Food Co., was detained earlier this year in a bribery investigation. “We can confirm that two former employees at Shanghai Shenmei Coca-Cola bottling plant have been detained by the police,” Kenth Kaerhoeg, a Coke spokesman said in a statement Tuesday. “This matter does not involve bribery of government officials but instead allegations that the former employees extracted kickbacks from suppliers and embezzled from the bottler.” Coca-Cola said both former employees are Chinese citizens and worked as middle managers at the bottling operation, which is partly owned by Coke. One left the company in January 2008, and the other was dismissed by Coke after being detained by investigators in May of this year, the company said. Mr. Kaerhoeg declined to give further details about the case but said Coca-Cola was cooperating with the investigation. A Shanghai police spokesman did not return phone calls seeking comment and a spokesperson for Shenmei referred questions to Coca-Cola. China’s state-run news media first reported on the case last week, saying one of the detainees had worked in the marketing or advertising department and had been accused of accepting kickbacks worth about $1.5 million. Xinhua, China’s official news agency, reported late Monday that the Shanghai police said “several” employees of the bottling plant were being investigated for allegedly taking bribes and that the case had been turned over to a local prosecutor. Coca-Cola is the latest multinational corporation to become embroiled in a bribery case in China. In July, four employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, including an Australian citizen, were detained on bribery charges. They remain in custody. Rio Tinto has strongly denied its employees were involved in bribery or corruption. Control Components, a California-based company, plead guilty in the United States in July to foreign bribery charges and agreed to pay an $18.2 million fine. The company had been accused of paying bribes to officials in over 30 countries, including officials at Chinese state-owned companies. China’s government regularly announces corruption crackdowns that are mostly aimed at snaring government officials who accept bribes. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Rio Tinto PLC Go to your Portfolio » The detention of the employee from the Shanghai Shen-Mei Beverage and Food Company, a bottling plant partly owned by Coca-Cola, was reported over the weekend by China’s state-run news media, which said the employee took about $1.5 million in bribes. A spokesman for Coca-Cola, Kenth Kaerhoeg, confirmed on Sunday that a female middle manager at the plant was detained by Shanghai police this year and then dismissed by the bottling company.

The detention is the second prominent bribery case this year involving a global company operating in China. In July, four Shanghai-based employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, including an Australian citizen, were detained and later formally charged with corruption and bribery. That case emerged after tense iron ore negotiations between Rio Tinto and Chinese steel makers and after Rio Tinto scrapped a deal with a big Chinese company, leading some analysts to speculate that it was partly politically motivated. Rio Tinto has strongly denied its Shanghai employees were involved in bribery or corruption. Chinese officials have insisted the case is not politically motivated. China recently stepped up an anticorruption drive that has ensnared numerous high-ranking government officials and even Huang Guangyu, a flamboyant entrepreneur listed by Forbes as the country’s second-richest man. That corruption drive, coupled with the Rio Tinto case  which initially involved allegations of stealing state secrets  has unnerved many foreign business people working in China. But even though corruption is pervasive in China, very few executives working for global companies have been detained or arrested by Chinese police. Legal experts say that is partly because investigators focus on the government officials who accept the bribes; but they also say the government is reluctant to go after foreign companies. There have been indications in China’s state-run news media, though, that investigators could begin to target multinational corporations. And many foreign companies operating here are warning employees to use extra caution because the United States Justice Department has stepped up its enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids the paying of bribes to government officials to win or influence business deals. In July, Control Components, a company based in California, pleaded guilty to foreign bribery charges and agreed to pay an $18.2 million fine. The company had been accused of paying bribes to officials in more than 30 countries over many years, including to Chinese state-owned companies. In the Coca-Cola case, the National Business Daily, a Chinese state-controlled publication, reported over the weekend that the bottling plant middle manager had worked in the marketing department of the bottling company. Coca-Cola has huge operations in China, including about 38 bottling plants, and about 30,000 employees in China, and is pushing to expand aggressively here. This year, the company’s move to pay $2.4 billion to acquire one of China’s biggest juice makers, the Huiyuan Juice Group, was blocked by the Chinese government, which cited antitrust concerns.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ads in Quebec for Pepsi-Cola sometimes take a humorous look at life in the Canadian province. Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image An ad for Pepsi-Cola. Last month the former French president’s endorsement of a Quebec nation reappears in a television commercial selling Pepsi to the province’s French-speaking majority. The ad, which marks the soft drink maker’s 75th anniversary in Canada, is in keeping with Pepsi’s unusual history. Since the 1970s, Pepsi’s Quebec bottling unit has gone its own way, using marketing that appeals, in various ways and with different degrees of subtlety, to the nationalistic sense of the province’s French-speaking population. Quebec is one of the developed world’s few markets where the positions of Pepsi and Coca-Cola are reversed. According to ACNielsen MarketTrack, Pepsi’s main brand commands 29.9 percent of the retail soft drink market in Quebec, based on volume, compared with 12.3 percent for Coke. And all of the brands owned by Pepsi control just over 60 percent of the province’s soft drink business  a dominance that even led to a common slur. The Canadian Oxford dictionary defines “pepsi” as derogatory term for a French Canadian, “from the perceived Québécois preference for Pepsi-Cola.” Until the 1970s, Pepsi followed the approach still used by most advertisers for the Quebec market. Television spots developed for English Canada were double-shot with French-speaking actors substituted if there were speaking roles. For other ads, it was simply a matter of changing onscreen text and substituting French voice-overs. Perhaps there is no connection  certainly no one at Pepsi will draw the link  but Pepsi’s intense focus on the Quebec market coincided with the political changes of the 1970s which eventually brought the separatist Parti Québécois to power and to many English-speaking residents leaving the province. While Pepsi was being promoted by Michael Jackson in the rest of the world 25 years ago, the company hired Claude Meunier, a moderately successful member of a Quebec comedy duo, to perform tiny sketch comedy pieces as Pepsi ads. Using broad, often slapstick humor, Mr. Meunier spoofed a variety of stereotypical Quebecers, including a hockey player who seemed to have taken one too many pucks to the head. Mr. Meunier’s characters often spoke slang-laden joual, a dialect that was once mostly heard in working-class, French neighborhoods of Montreal. The ads turned Mr. Meunier into a big celebrity in Quebec and Pepsi became the province’s top soft drink. (Unusually, Mr. Meunier still appears in some of Pepsi’s Quebec ads, although since 2003 he has mainly promoted Diet Pepsi.) In recent years, the Quebec message has been more overt in ads. One mocks Quebec stereotypes from a peculiar provincial law that sets June 30 as the expiration date for most residential leases (and thus transforms July 1 into a chaotic, provincewide moving day) to a Quebec City so cold that an actor must consume a bottle of Pepsi as if it were a Popsicle. English Canadians don’t escape notice. One ad features a man that Pepsi describes simply as “a tourist” but who dresses unfashionably and acts in a manner that many Quebecers associate with English Canadians. He orders a Coke at a Quebec City restaurant, provoking evident hostility among the French-speaking patrons. Its tagline translates roughly as: “Here, it’s Pepsi.” The cameo appearance of Charles de Gaulle is not the only portion of the fast-paced and largely humorous 75th anniversary commercial (created by BBDO Montreal), which might offend some. One sequence lumps images of Queen Elizabeth II, Canada’s head of state (or more precisely her waving hand and her hat), and Pope John Paul II with Bonhomme, the snowman mascot of Quebec City’s winter carnival. While acknowledging that Pepsi’s Quebec ads sometimes push limits in the interests of humor, Sylvain Charbonneau, vice president for Pepsi’s Canadian bottling group and its director general for Quebec, said that during his 20 years with the company in Quebec, he had never known it to be second-guessed by the Canadian head office, which is in suburban Toronto. “It’s easier for us to have credibility with 60-point share, but that wasn’t the case 25 years ago,” he said in a boardroom at a recently upgraded bottling plant in an industrial area of Montreal. “They listen to us, give a chance to take risks, make mistakes. It was important for them to have someone who understands the market.” Coke has done some Quebec-specific advertising, although none for the last two years. In advance of next year’s Winter Olympics, which will be held in Canada, David M. Moran, a spokesman for Coca-Cola Canada of Toronto, said that the company would feature Quebec athletes in forthcoming commercials. He said the company had signed “a major Quebec celebrity” to act as a spokeswoman, although he declined to identify her. While tailoring its message to French-speaking Quebecers has been successful for Quebec, Mr. Charbonneau acknowledges that the approach may not be appropriate for many companies. “It’s more costly for a population of seven million to do a unique advertising campaign year after year,” he said. “It costs you more per capita than it would for the U.S. with 300 million people. But it pays out for us and Quebecers don’t mind laughing about themselves.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 4, 2009 The Advertising column on Friday, about the popularity of Pepsi in Quebec, misspelled the name of the snowman mascot of Quebec City’s winter carnival in some copies. It is Bonhomme, not Bonne Homme. More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on July 31, 2009, on page B4 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Profit topped forecasts but Coca-Cola’s stock fell slightly after the company said it expected foreign currency exchange rates to hurt its results in the third quarter, as they did in the first. Coca-Cola said it earned $2.04 billion, or 88 cents a share, up from $1.42 billion, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier, when it posted a big one-time charge. Sales in the period, which ended July 3, fell 9 percent, to $8.27 billion, from $9.05 billion. International sales are helping carry the company and are setting it up for long-term growth, said Jack Russo, an industry analyst at Edward Jones. International sales volume rose 5 percent in the quarter, with gains of 10 percent or more in China and India, while domestic sales volume fell 1 percent, reflecting the trend of North American consumers cutting back on their spending. Shares of Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, fell 68 cents, to $50.35 a share.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/business/media/16adco.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Marketing a Drink, but Never by Name<date>Published: July 15, 2009</date><text>COMMERCIALS for Coca-Cola are sometimes so completely shrouded by storytelling that viewers can make a game of brand-spotting. The game  let’s call it “Spot the Coke Can”  takes a particularly long time during the cinematic spots in movie theaters. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » In the global advertising campaign called Open Happiness that was introduced in January, the Coca Cola Company takes the game to a logical last step by omitting any reference to the brand in a catchy song it created and sold last winter. With the title “Open Happiness,” the song is an advertisement by association.  Coca-Cola signed a crew of well-known band members and performers to record the single. It also produced several different language versions for other countries. On Thursday morning, the song will take another promotional step forward when MTV is expected to show the premiere of the music video for “Open Happiness.” Coca-Cola said it did not pay MTV for the showing. As is the case with the song, viewers of the video will be hard-pressed to spot the Coca-Cola brand. “I studied the video like the Zapruder film,” said a Coke spokesman, Petro Kacur, and the Coke reference “is so super-fast that you really have to be looking for it.” Umut Ozaydinli, the global music marketing manager for the Coca-Cola Company, said the upbeat song pulled consumers into the Open Happiness campaign, rather than pushing it on them like traditional advertising. “Coca-Cola is such a strong and magical brand that we can come out with something with no branding or very little branding,” he said in a telephone interview from Turkey on Wednesday, where the company plans to release a Turkish-language version of the song. “All the communications we are doing around the song enable consumers to connect the song with the brand.” While Coca-Cola has produced songs in the past  before the Summer Olympics in Beijing last year, the company released eight song remixes by D.J.’s  “Open Happiness” stands out because the company is charging for the single on iTunes and Amazon.com. The musical strategy may remind some of “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing,” the jingle-turned-pop-hit that was first featured as a part of Coca-Cola’s classic 1971 commercial known as “Hilltop.” In the commercial, young people sang about wanting to “buy the world a Coke.” “I think they have been looking for something that has that kind of impact,” said John Rudolph, the chief executive of Bug Music, which licenses songs for commercial uses. Music is, of course, an important part of many advertisers’ messages. Last year, for instance, the R&amp;B singer Chris Brown released a hit song, “Forever,” that doubled as a jingle for the Doublemint brand of gum. The song even incorporated the product’s slogan, “double your pleasure, double your fun,” into the lyrics. Mr. Rudolph noted that few companies are able to afford the production of an original song that doesn’t even mention the brand. But if any company can, it’s Coca-Cola. For “Open Happiness,” the company collaborated with Atlantic Records and signed Cee-Lo Green of Gnarls Barkley, Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, Brendon Urie of Panic at the Disco, Travis McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, and Janelle Monae to lend their voices to the song. Ms. Monae, a Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter, said it “was promoting a good cause,” happiness, that all people could agree on. Being able to work with fellow artists and “write the words and lyrics that we like without feeling like the company was saying, ‘Sing about Coca-Cola,’ it made it more true to my core values,” she said.  The lyrics for the “Open Happiness” song are as sweet and bubbly as the soft drink. “C’mon and lift me up, it’s a brand new day, open up a lil’ happiness today, so I can be someone new,” goes the chorus. The single was released in the United States in March. Tying the music video to the Coke commercials for the campaign is the same five-note melody. Mr. Ozaydinli speculated that the lack of an in-your-face Coke message is “one of the key reasons” consumers have shown interest in the song. On MySpace, it has been streamed more than 600,000 times. According to Coca-Cola, the single reached the No. 1 spot on the top 100 music download chart of Baidu.com, a leading Chinese Web site. But it has not found as many fans in the United States: it reached No. 37 on Apple iTunes pop chart for a short period of time, the company said, and no longer appears on the iTunes lists. Mr. Ozaydinli acknowledged that the song did not perform as well in the United States, but said that “chart success is only one element of the equation.” Mr. Ozaydinli said Coca-Cola may sell copies of the single in some markets. Coca-Cola said it would consider producing future songs for the Open Happiness campaign in the coming months. A half-French, half-English-language version of the tune will be released in time for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver next year.

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/business/11energy.html?ref=cocacolacompany">‘Energy Shots’ Stimulate Power Drink Sales<date>Published: July 10, 2009</date><text>COLLEGE PARK, Md.  The power drink of the moment costs 20 times as much per ounce as Coca-Cola, comes in a tiny bottle and tastes so bad that most people hold their noses and down it in a single gulp. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Steve Ruark for The New York Times Million Mekonen, the stores owner, said that sales spiked to 400 a week during finals in May. Despite all that, sales of “energy shots” are soaring in the middle of a recession. The two-ounce drinks, which give people a concentrated dose of caffeine, B vitamins and amino acids, were all but unheard-of four years ago. Today they are the hottest drink category in the country, with sales expected to almost double this year from last, to about $700 million. The shots are meant for people who want a jolt of caffeine without having to drink a big cup of coffee or one of the 16-ounce energy drinks that have become ubiquitous. They go down fast, more like medicine than a beverage. That is part of the appeal to their most devoted consumers: students cramming for exams or partying into the night, construction workers looking for a lift and drivers trying to stay awake. Near the University of Maryland the other day, students thought nothing of paying $3 or more for a shot. That is $1.50 an ounce; at that price, a 20-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola would sell for $30. “It helps me stay up all night when I have work to do,” said Matt Sporre, 20, a sophomore chemical engineering major who said he drank shots three or four nights a week when school was in session. “Those things are going to be the death of my generation,” he added. “Too much caffeine.” Mr. Sporre and several others students said the shots worked well in combination with Adderall, a prescription drug for attention deficit disorder that is popular on college campuses. The Adderall helps them focus, they said, and the shot keeps them awake. Several students said they sometimes downed an energy shot before going out drinking. Others said the shots helped them stay awake during long drives home from school. Two members of the university’s wrestling team said some of their teammates drank the shots before matches to get an energy lift. A 7-Eleven store on Knox Road, just off the Maryland campus in College Park, has become one of the top sellers of energy shots among the 5,700 United States stores in the 7-Eleven chain. The store’s owner, Million Mekonen, said that sales spiked during finals in May, when the store sold close to 400 shots in a week. But students are not the only users. Steve Cisko, 26, a construction worker renovating a dormitory, stopped in at the 7-Eleven and bought a shot made by AriZona Beverage for $3.99. “I do demolition; it wears you out,” he said. “Sometimes I’ll take two at a time in the afternoon. Every guy I work with uses them.” Sales of the shots are rising even as sales of traditional energy drinks like Red Bull have flattened out. Bill Pecoriello, chief executive of Consumer Edge Research, estimated that shot sales could reach $700 million this year, nearly double last year’s $370 million, not counting sales by Wal-Mart Stores. The estimate was based on sales data collected by Information Resources, a market research firm. The market is dominated by a tiny company in suburban Detroit called Living Essentials, which began test sales in late 2004 of a product called 5-Hour Energy, packaged in small plastic bottles. Today, 5-Hour Energy accounts for about 80 percent of the rapidly expanding market, according to Mr. Pecoriello. The company’s unlikely success  it has only one other product, an antihangover pill called Chaser  has forced the big beverage makers to play catch-up. Last month, Red Bull introduced a two-ounce shot, and Dr Pepper Snapple began test-marketing a three-ounce version of its Venom energy drink, called Venom Bite. Coca-Cola introduced a shot last year based on its NOS energy drink. Many smaller companies have jumped in too, often offering products with similar names, like 6 Hour Power, Fuel 7 Hour Energy and Mr. Energy 8-Hour Energy. Living Essentials has spent heavily on advertising to build the market and hold its position against newcomers. It expects to spend $60 million this year on television advertising for 5-Hour Energy. It has also gone after several of its competitors in court, challenging labels or product names it said were too close to its own. The most vigorous legal battle pits Living Essentials against a Texas company called Custom Nutrition Laboratories and includes accusations of betrayal, stolen secrets and other skullduggery. The two companies worked closely together from 2004 through 2007. At Living Essentials’ request, Custom Nutrition developed the formula for 5-Hour Energy and then manufactured and bottled it. Living Essentials handled the marketing, distribution and sales. Then, in late 2007, Living Essentials fired Custom Nutrition and replaced it with another manufacturer. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on July 11, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/fashion/24nice.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Back by Popular Demand<date>Published: May 22, 2009</date><text>IN the hit comedy “I Love You, Man,” Paul Rudd plays Peter, a sunflower of a guy: cheerful, welcoming and reassuring, if a little squeamish. Peter blushes over references to pubic hair, winces at flatulence and refuses to kiss and tell, even when the girls do. Mr. Rudd has made a career of playing soft-spoken nice guys, and in another era that persona might have relegated him to a second tier of celebrity status, along with the likes of Donny Osmond and Pat Sajak. But today he is a leading man, even a matinee hunk, who has appeared in a string of Judd Apatow romantic comedies like “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Knocked Up,” as well as the current “I Love You, Man,” which has taken in just over $70 million at the domestic box office as of May 22. Or what about Kris Allen, the polite and aw-shucks singer from small-town Arkansas, who has been called a latter-day Pat Boone, and who on Tuesday was voted by the public, casting almost 100 million ballots, a record, as its latest American Idol. That amiable guys and uncomplicated sweethearts could be today’s pop heroes is one sign of an outbreak of niceness across the cultural landscape — an attitude bubbling up in commercials, movies and even, to a degree, the normally not-nice blogosphere. “We are now in an age of nice,” said Eric G. Wilson, an English professor at Wake Forest University, who, as the author of “Against Happiness: In Praise of Melancholy,” qualifies as a professional curmudgeon. But even Mr. Wilson sees no end of smiley faces. He cites as avatars of a new niceness the Obama administration, which has been criticized for being too friendly to some repressive world leaders; advocates of political correctness who still hold sway in many public forums; and the director-writer-producer Mr. Apatow, whose era-defining comedies feature “nice guys who finish first — a great hope for non-threatening puerile males,” Mr. Wilson said. "There’s more spark to nice — it is really in,” said Graceann Bennett, the director of strategic planning at the Chicago office of the advertising agency Ogilvy  Mather. She said clients are shying away from the arch and sardonic campaigns that were in vogue when the economy was flush. Ogilvy recently pitched an ad for Truvia, a new sweetener, showing two mounds of white powder meant to suggest female breasts, one more perfectly shaped than the other. The proposed tagline: “The difference between real ones and fake ones is obvious.” The agency wanted to make the point that Truvia is derived from stevia leaves, a South American herb, not from a laboratory. But executives at Truvia’s manufacturer, Cargill, thought the ad was mean to the competition and to women with breast implants. They rejected it. “I’m in marketing meetings with clients all the time,” Ms. Bennett said, “and they’re always coming back with, ‘I don’t want mean.’ ” Other brands seek to be known for putting on a happy face rather than having an attitude. Pepsi labored for decades to position itself as the younger, sexier alternative to Coca-Cola, but last fall it unveiled a logo that has been widely interpreted as a stylized smiley face (some thought it mimicked the logo for the Obama campaign, which arguably makes the same point in a different way). Volkswagen, too, shifted away from a series of sardonic commercials featuring an acerbic German narrator; the current campaign stars Max, a cute talking 1964 Beetle, and his talking Microbus friend. The black bug is so innocent it blushes when Heidi Klum makes a suggestive remark. And then there are Internet companies that embrace positivity. On Twitter, every user who uploads a photograph from that latest trip to Cancún is greeted with a pop-up message that chirps, “That’s a nice picture!” Skype, the Internet telephone service, greets users with cutesy cloud motifs and bubble-letter graphics, as if the entire brand image was lifted out of a 13-year-old girl’s bedroom. Niceness in the culture spikes when the real world is full of trouble, theorized Catherine Ryan Hyde, the author of “Pay It Forward,” the 1999 novel that gave a marketable name to the idea of doing good deeds for strangers with the expectation that they would then do the same for others. (The book inspired a 2000 movie starring Kevin Spacey and a charitable foundation, run by Ms. Hyde.) When Ms. Hyde’s book was published, during the gilded dot-com era, many people responded to its overweening earnestness with a collective groan, she said. But in the months after 9/11, earnestness and altruism were in fashion, and Ms. Hyde saw a surge in interest in her foundation, as well as a proliferation of other like-minded grass-roots groups. The same thing happened again after the financial crisis escalated last fall, she said. “When do you ever see people making sweeping changes when everything is going fine? They don’t. They change when the roof caves in.” Yes, there is no shortage today of brands and famous people who are sticking with sarcasm as their public image. A few recent campaigns, including those for Miller High Life and JetBlue, are cutting against the grain and trying mocking ads, which some analysts believe will tap into people’s frustrations over the economy. And for every star like Paul Rudd and Kris Allen who kill audiences with kindness, there is an adder-tongued Simon Cowell or Bill O’Reilly. </text></article>

The company suspended share repurchases in September to help pay for its $2.3 billion offer for China Huiyuan Juice Group, the country’s biggest maker of pure juice. The Chinese government rejected the deal last month as anticompetitive. Coca-Cola may use its cash for other acquisitions or hold onto it in case debt markets deteriorate, the company’s chief financial officer, Gary Fayard, said. Executives will discuss a possible share repurchase with the board on Thursday. The company also reported that first-quarter net income declined 10 percent, to $1.35 billion, or 58 cents a share, compared with $1.5 billion a year earlier.

The beverage giant has offered $6 billion to buy back the bottling companies it spun off in the late 1990s. Skip to next paragraph Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News Jamie Dimon, chief of JPMorgan Chase, called TARP money a scarlet letter. The deal should give Pepsi more control over its distribution, a smart move in light of changes in its business. Plus, the bottling spinoff fad, begun the previous decade by its rival, Coca-Cola, was based largely on financial engineering, and its logic has largely failed. The 17 percent premium that Pepsi is offering for the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas looks fair. Pepsi already owns a large part of each business, and the bottlers’ stock prices have rebounded from recent lows. Still, Pepsi could raise its bid a bit; analysts think it can squeeze out more than the $200 million in synergies it expects from the deal. But more broadly, the deal is a strategic about-face for Pepsi. Separating the business that bottles and distributes its soda from the one that actually concocts the beverage and its marketing strategies was once a smart idea. It was started by a former chief executive of Coca-Cola, Roberto Goizueta. The logic: the bottling business was industrial and offered lower margins. Spinning it off gave the main beverage business’s shareholders a boon. Part of that logic still holds true. The financial metrics for Pepsi’s soda business could be weighed down as a result of this combination. Nevertheless, the latest deal still makes sense. First, Pepsi is no longer just a soda company. It sells sports drinks and fruit juices, which don’t necessarily have the same bottling system as its soda does. Getting its sodas and Gatorade to, say, Wal-Mart will be more efficient if Pepsi combines its different bottling and distribution channels. Also, many saw Pepsi and its bottling companies as separate in name only. Shareholders often looked at their metrics as if the companies were combined, since their fortunes certainly were. Pepsi also backs the bottlers’ debt. The deal might put Coca-Cola in the hot seat. Pepsi copied its biggest competitor’s decision to separate its businesses. Coca-Cola may now find itself under pressure to follow in its rival’s footsteps. A ‘Scarlet Letter’ The Obama administration may want to place conditions on the repayment of bailout funds by banks, but it shouldn’t go too far. Relatively strong firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have been agitating to shuck off what JPMorgan’s boss, Jamie Dimon, recently called a “scarlet letter.” If they have adequate capital, or can raise it privately, the banks should be allowed to pay the government back. The conditions that lawmakers retroactively attached to the Troubled Asset Relief Program from the Treasury have chafed, especially the politically charged limits on executive pay. Bankers, dismayed by these, the potential for more Congressional meddling and the reputational concern that Mr. Dimon referred to, want to pay the TARP funds back despite the higher cost of raising money in the open market. This should not be discouraged. It could understandably put banks that cannot pay TARP back under an uncomfortable spotlight. But the results of the government’s stress tests should do that anyway if the tests are meaningful and the results are disclosed. And by proving that they can do without TARP, stronger banks might be able to attract private capital on somewhat better terms, exactly the sort of development the government should encourage. Meanwhile, getting some capital back would help replenish the Treasury’s bailout coffers, which will probably be called on again soon to prop up weaker banks and automakers, among others. Finally, the government should not worry too much that allowing banks to pay back TARP will allow them to wriggle free of oversight. It may release them from executive compensation limits. But aside from their everyday regulation, banks have issued immense amounts of government-guaranteed short-term debt and benefit from a range of new emergency lending facilities. Those are levers that regulators  and Congress, if it chooses  can use to influence banks’ behavior. And it’s most likely that any new oversight regime will be tougher. Even if banks repay TARP capital, they will be under regulators’ thumbs for some time to come.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » In its first detailed explanation of the March 18 ruling, the commerce ministry said it looked at China’s beverage market and concluded that Coca-Cola’s dominance in carbonated drinks could be used to promote sales of Huiyuan Juice Group, stifling competition and leading to higher prices. The rejection was China’s first on antimonopoly grounds since a new law took effect Aug. 1. “Whether Huiyuan is a national brand is not a factor that needs to be considered in an antimonopoly investigation and has nothing to do with the commerce ministry’s rejection of this acquisition,” a ministry spokesman, Yao Jian, said in statement on its Web site. The rejection of the $2.5 billion deal ignited concern that Beijing was trying to keep Chinese brands out of foreign hands. Industry analysts questioned the brief announcement last week that cited antimonopoly concerns, noting that Coca-Cola and Huiyuan were in different lines of business. Coca-Cola’s “dominant position in the carbonated beverage market could be transferred to the fruit juice market,” Mr. Yao said. “This would seriously cripple or deprive other fruit juice producers of the ability to compete. It would harm competition in the fruit juice market, forcing customers to accept higher prices and fewer products.” He said Coca-Cola might have used its carbonated beverage brands to promote Huiyuan or bundle products together for sale. Coca-Cola said last week that it thought such competition issues were resolved after a review process that began in September. The company has a 16 percent share of China’s soft drink market  which also includes fruit and vegetable juices, bottled teas and sports drinks  and adding Huiyuan would have raised that to 18 percent, according to the consulting firm Euromonitor. On Sunday, the commerce minister, Chen Deming, tried to reassure foreign companies that they were welcome to come “carry out investment and development.” He said the government still wanted to see Coca-Cola grow in China. Huiyuan’s founders and major shareholders welcomed the Coca-Cola offer, which would have been the biggest foreign acquisition in China to date. But nationalists objected to the loss of a successful Chinese brand to foreign owners. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

The move blocked what would have been the biggest foreign takeover of a Chinese company and suggested Beijing was still uneasy with the idea of foreign ownership. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Reuters Products from the China Huiyuan Juice Company on shelves with Coca-Cola in Jinan, Shandong Province. Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » The ministry of commerce said Coke’s bid to acquire the China Huiyuan Juice Company was rejected on antitrust reasons. The government said the deal would allow Coke to dominate a huge segment of the beverage market. In a statement released Wednesday, the commerce ministry said it was worried that Coke would “set up some exclusive terms to restrict competition in the juice market,” drive up the consumer prices and squeeze out smaller beverage makers. Shares in Huiyuan fell sharply and then trading was halted early Wednesday in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement, while shares of other Chinese beverage makers, which could have also been takeover targets, also tumbled on speculation that the deal would be rejected by regulators. On Thursday morning, Huiyuan’s shares extended their fall, plunging more than 40 percent. Shares of Huiyuan have lost about 30 percent of their value since the deal was announced in September. In a statement, Muhtar Kent, the president and chief executive of Coca-Cola, said he was disappointed but respected the Chinese government’s decision, adding that the company’s commitment to China remained strong. “We will now focus all of our energies and expertise on growing our existing brands and continuing to innovate with new brands, including in the juice segment,” he said in the statement. Executives at Huiyuan, which is based in Beijing, could not be reached. The deal is considered not only an early test of China’s new antimonopoly law but also of Beijing’s willingness to give foreign companies greater latitude to acquire big Chinese companies. Few foreign companies have taken full control of a major Chinese company. But many legal analysts said they had expected the deal to be approved because China itself is moving aggressively this year to acquire foreign assets during the global economic downturn. Steve Dickinson, a China-based lawyer at Harris &amp; Moure, said China usually restricted foreign takeovers because of a belief that state assets should not be controlled by foreign entities. “China’s very open to green field investments, allowing foreign companies to start up businesses,” Mr. Dickinson said. “But China strongly discourages outright purchases of existing Chinese companies to enter the China market.” Huiyuan Juice, which had revenue of about $380 million in 2007, is one of China’s biggest producers of fresh apple, orange and pear juice. The company is privately owned and two foreign companies hold minority stakes: Groupe Danone of France and Warburg Pincus, the American private equity firm. The bid by Coke was part of the company’s aggressive expansion effort in China, where it already has a large presence. The company sells more than a billion bottles of Coke a year. Just a week ago, Coke pledged to further expand its presence in China, despite the economic downturn, by investing an additional $2 billion in China over the next three years.

Skip to next paragraph George Frey/Bloomberg News Coca-Cola is dropping Classic. These cans await soda at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in West Valley City, Utah. Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » The Coca-Cola Company is dropping the “Classic” from its red labels in some Southeast regions, and the word will be gone from all of its packaging by the summer, the company said Friday. The story was first reported by the trade publication Beverage Digest. The “Classic” designation  which appears under the “Coca-Cola” script on labels  was added to the packaging in 1985, to distinguish the original formula from a sweeter, wildly unpopular new version of Coke. New Coke has long since disappeared from shelves, making the “Classic” qualification unnecessary. The font size of the “Classic” has been shrinking in the last decade, and the company removed it from labels in Canada in 2007. “When people think Coke, they think classic, so more than two decades after introducing the word classic, the reason for being  quote unquote  for that word as a descriptor has disappeared,” said Scott Williamson, a Coca-Cola spokesman. With the introduction of a new global advertising campaign, called “Open Happiness,” Coca-Cola decided it was time to make its American product match what it was called elsewhere. (The language on the side of the label where it now says “Coke original formula” will change to say “Coke Classic original formula.”) “Every place else in the world it is called Coca-Cola, except for in North America,” Mr. Williamson said. The new-Coke introduction was one of the more noteworthy debacles in marketing history. Coca-Cola had concocted a sweeter formula for its cola soft drink, and it replaced the original formula in April 1985. It had spent four years testing the new recipe and conducting taste tests with more than 190,000 people. Coca-Cola found people chose the new formula 55 percent of the time, and the original one 45 percent of the time. But Coca-Cola forgot to ask how people would feel about losing the traditional soda. “It’s been, probably, one of the most talked-about case studies ever,” said Paul Worthington, the head of strategy for the branding firm Wolff Olins. “They failed to understand the emotional significance to people that messing with Coke would have, and that’s gone down in history.” As soon as new Coke was introduced, Coca-Cola began getting hammered. Employees had to work overtime on its complaints hotline, where it was receiving an average of 1,500 calls a day. People started hoarding containers of the classic formula, formed groups like the Old Cola Drinkers of America, and even boycotted the company in protest. Ten weeks after introducing the new Coke, and after publicly vowing that the original formula was gone for good, company executives brought it back. They added a “Classic” underneath the script Coca-Cola lettering to distinguish it from the new formula. Coca-Cola Classic began to outsell new Coke almost immediately, and revived the company’s sales. It was “a humbling experiment,” Donald Keough, Coca-Cola’s president, said at the time. “Some cynics say we planned the whole thing. The truth is, we’re not that dumb, and we’re not that smart.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 31, 2009, on page B2 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Approves 2 New Sweeteners<date>Published: December 17, 2008</date><text>Federal regulators have approved two versions of a new zero-calorie sweetener developed by the Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, paving the way for new products. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Cargill, which is marketing the sweetener Truvia from Coca-Cola, said on Wednesday that it had received notification from the Food and Drug Administration that it had no objection to the product, calling it “generally recognized as safe.” PepsiCo said it also had received a no-objection letter and the same designation from the agency related to its sweetener, PureVia. Both products use rebiana, an extract from the stevia plant. This week, Coca-Cola said it would begin selling products made with the new zero-calorie sweetener despite not yet receiving the official word from the government. PepsiCo said it would not follow suit until the F.D.A. issued the designation. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., said Wednesday that it would be releasing three new zero-calorie SoBe Lifewater flavors: Fuji Apple Pear, Black and Blue Berry and Yumberry Pomegranate. The products will be in stores this year, the company said. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, said Wednesday it would introduce an extension of its Sprite line with the Truvia sweetener.

Crude oil has plunged and so have shares of the soft drink maker Coca-Cola. Coke’s decline has captured less attention, but it seems to have much in common  beyond color coordination  with crude’s reversal of fortune. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » The weakness in oil has been attributed to reduced expectations for growth in the global economy, especially emerging markets, and to the recovery in the dollar. Both developments are considered bad for Coke, too, because three-fourths of its revenue originates overseas; lower growth could mean lower foreign sales, and weaker currencies cut the dollar value of those sales. The result is a stock that has lost about 15 percent in the last six months, approximately double the loss of the broad market. What shareholders must find especially disheartening is that this is the sort of environment  a recession or something close to it  in which producers of consumer staples like Coke are supposed to display resilience. Coca-Cola’s troubles are not confined to the last few months, and they are not all caused by the unraveling of the global economic boom. Repeated missteps by senior management have made the stock a long-term underperformer. It is down about 20 percent since the start of 1998, a period in which the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index has risen about 35 percent. Some investment advisers think shareholders have gotten what they deserved. Jim Huguet, a portfolio manager specializing in blue-chip stocks for Huguet Associates, has been a longstanding critic of Coke’s management. Rivals like PepsiCo were quick to catch the trend toward bottled water and sports drinks and positioned their companies to benefit, he said. Over the last decade, he said, Coke continued to rely heavily on carbonated drinks and paid a price in stagnant sales. “They could have bought Gatorade, which was up for sale and which Pepsi bought,” Mr. Huguet said. He called Pepsi “a much more innovative company than Coca-Cola” and added, “When you talk about innovative leaders, Coke doesn’t pop to the top of the list.” But even he concedes that the company has taken steps to move farther from the bottom. The recent agreement to pay $2.5 billion for China Huiyuan Juice is a wise move, in his view, because it chisels away at Coke’s dependence on carbonated drinks and expands the company’s presence in a huge, fast-growing economy. That opinion is widespread. John Faucher, who follows Coca-Cola for JPMorgan, called the deal “a long-term strategic positive” in a note to the bank’s clients and lauded the “long-term growth opportunities and the potential for some manufacturing synergies.” He cautioned, however, that some investors might worry that Coke would buy back fewer of its own shares in order to have cash for the acquisition. Ken Gau, an analyst at Waddell &amp; Reed, is another fan of the acquisition. He described the announcement as “one of the first things we’ve seen out of them in a while that’s encouraging for longer-term growth.” Mr. Gau joined Mr. Huguet in criticizing the decisions made by Coke’s bosses during the last decade and the sense of aimlessness that it produced. But he tends to see the bottle as half full rather than nearly empty. HE commended the firm’s chairman, E. Neville Isdell, for overhauling top management  including himself, when he stepped down as chief executive in July, placing Muhtar Kent in the post  and for setting the company in a direction likely to improve growth well into the future. Waddell &amp; Reed holds more than 10 million Coke shares in its portfolios. Mr. Gau contends that the stock’s valuation, about 15 times the earnings that analysts expect for this year, fully takes account of the company’s difficult history. But at that level, he said, investors are not factoring in the positive developments that he foresees. “It’s a pretty inexpensive stock for what it has to offer,” he said. The management changes and China move are signs of “Coke being on offense for a change. They’re taking the focus beyond carbonated drinks, thinking ahead. It’s encouraging to see them taking charge of their destiny.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 13, 2008, on page C6 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF143CF937A3575AC0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=cocacolacompany">Coke Offers To Acquire Juice Firm In China<date>Published: September 4, 2008</date><text>SHANGHAI -- The Coca-Cola Company said on Wednesday that it had made a bid to acquire one of China's largest beverage makers for about $2.5 billion. The deal for the China Huiyuan Juice Company, if completed, would be one of the biggest foreign takeovers of a Chinese company, at a time when more American companies are investing in the country's fast-growing food and beverage industries. Goldman Sachs now owns major stakes in two large Chinese meat companies. Earlier this year, Smithfield Foods, the large American meat producer, acquired a stake in a Chinese agriculture company. And McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut and Starbuck's are all expanding aggressively here. Coca-Cola, which is also making its own big push into China, announced the deal in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning, calling Huiyuan, a ''long-established and successful juice brand in China.'' Huiyuan, which is based in Beijing and had revenue of about $380 million in 2007, is widely recognized in China as one of the country's biggest producers of fresh orange, apple and pear juice. The deal could give Coke a strong presence in that market. Coke was an official sponsor of the 2008 Olympics and aggressively marketed itself in Beijing this summer. The company already sells the equivalent of more than a billion bottles of Coke annually in China, and also markets Sprite and Minute Maid orange juice here. Food prices have been rising sharply in China, partly because of a fast-growing middle class that is turning more and more to modern supermarkets and fast-food restaurants. But only a small number of food and beverage makers in China are national powers, partly because of political and logistical problems. Huiyuan, pronounced HWEY-yew-en, is one of those companies. Founded in 1992, Huiyuan has 31 beverage factories around the country and a strong presence in China's biggest cities, like Beijing and Shanghai. Sales of Huiyuan beverages have doubled in the last few years. Huiyuan went public in Hong Kong in 2007, but its shares fell sharply this year, along with the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets. After Coke made its takeover offer Wednesday, the company's Hong Kong shares soared more than 164 percent, nearly tripling to 10.94 Hong Kong dollars a share from $4.14. ''This is a major transaction, and an interesting one since it's primarily an acquisition of a Hong Kong-listed company,'' said Steven Xiang, China managing partner at Weil Gotshal who was involved in Lenovo's $1.2 billion acquisition of I.B.M.'s personal computer business in 2005. ''But they'll most likely have to go through approvals with the Chinese government under the new antimonopoly law.'' Huiyuan says that it has about 46 percent of China's fresh juice market, according to A. C. Nielsen, and that it exports beverage products to 30 countries, including the United States and Japan. Geoff Walsh, a Coca-Cola spokesman in Hong Kong, said Huiyuan had a compound annual growth rate of 31 percent over the last three years, while the Chinese juice market has grown by about 12 percent a year. ''It's just so complementary to our business in China,'' Mr. Walsh said. Danone, the French food giant, owns a large stake in Huiyuan, and Coke said Danone and other large shareholders have already agreed to sell their about two-thirds stake in the juice company. Danone's experience in China also shows some of the pitfalls of doing deals here. Danone is now in a fierce and high-profile legal battle with Wahaha, China's biggest beverage maker, over who controls the joint venture between the two companies. As for Coke's $2.5 billion offer, only a handful of Western companies have made larger investments in a Chinese company, and most of them have involved banks, according to Dealogic, which tracks merger and acquisitions in China. For instance, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Merrill Lynch and others paid $3.1 billion in 2005 for a 10 percent stake in the Bank of China ahead of its initial public stock offering.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, said it would pay 17.92 billion Hong Kong dollars, or 12.20 Hong Kong dollars a share, for Huiyuan. The price is about triple Huiyan’s closing share price of 4.14 Hong Kong dollars on Friday. “Huiyuan is a long-established and successful juice brand in China and is highly complementary to the Coca-Cola China business,” said Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, the world’s largest beverage company. Huiyuan, the country’s biggest maker of pure-juice drinks, is 23 percent owned by the French food company Groupe Danone and 6.8 percent by the private equity firm Warburg Pincus of the United States. Coca-Cola will buy all the outstanding shares, bonds and options of Huiyuan and take the company private. “They are in the same industry and it would take a lot of effort to build a brand name, especially in China, such a huge market,” said Andrew To, sales director at the Tai Fook Securities Company. Huiyuan controls about 43 percent of China’s pure juice market, according to AC Nielsen figures cited by Huiyuan.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Lars Klove for The New York Times Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Some members of the My Coke Rewards program complain that they have amassed hundreds of bottle-cap codes in exchange for points, only to have some of the expensive items that they have been saving for become suddenly unavailable. Eric Bellville, a 20-year-old lifeguard in Clermont, Fla., has collected about 6,000 points (that’s around 2,000 standard Coke caps). Instead of being able to get some of the most expensive items by using his points, he is now only able to enter a sweepstakes to win them. “I don’t like the change with the system,” Mr. Bellville wrote in an e-mail message. “It seems that Coke is being a bit misleading, because now it is much harder to get higher value prizes.” A high-definition television, for example, was once available for some 20,000 points. Because people can enter only 10 codes a day online, it would have taken about two years of nonstop participation to win the television. Now, members can still win the TV, but only three points are required to enter the drawing. Coca-Cola executives said the company was not trying to mislead its loyalty-program members, but to make top prizes available to more of them. “For those very large aspirational prizes, a lot of our members said, ‘You know what, I don’t know that I’ll be able to collect the points to get there, but I would like to have an opportunity to win those,’ ” said Scott Williamson, a Coke spokesman. Complaints, he said, tend to come with the territory of loyalty programs. “My Coke Rewards members are very willing to share their points of view on the programs,” he said. Still, the program seems to be strong and has 10 million members. In July, MyCokeRewards.com had 4.1 million unique users, according to comScore. That is significantly more than for most promotional sites, and is about the same number as the Web sites for Weather Underground and Shutterfly that month. As for Mr. Bellville, while the high-definition TV may no longer be a buying option, he can spend his points on a golf bag (4,540 points), a telescope (2,080 points), or, most loyally of all, 250 bottles of Coke.

The soccer player Julie Foudy is promoting Cabot cheese and Kleenex, and the track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee is working with Medco, the health benefits manager. One swimmer, Janet Evans, is with John Hancock, while another, Josh Davis, is with Mutual of Omaha. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » The Olympics are not just moneymakers for the current athletes, but for former ones as well. Even for the alumni, the ability to cash in on one’s former fame peaks every four years, because corporate sponsors prefer to work with athletes when their signature sports are in the news. “My husband and I plan everything around the Olympics,” said Ms. Evans, who earned gold medals at the 1988 and 1992 Games. She is working with Speedo, the Canola Council (a trade group for canola growers), Johnson &amp; Johnson and John Hancock. “We planned our wedding around the ’04 Olympics; we planned our little girl being born at the end of ’06, when ’07 wasn’t as busy,” Ms. Evans added. “My husband teases me, we plan in quadrenniums,” she said, using the International Olympic Committee’s term for four-year periods. For the companies, the endorsements offer an instant way to evoke nostalgia, whether it is among baby boomers who remember watching Ms. Comaneci score her perfect 10, or among younger fans whose early Olympic memories are of Ms. Foudy’s days as one of the Fab Five of women’s soccer. Many retired Olympians make a living out of their former glory, giving motivational speeches and making appearances for corporations. As time passes, the less picky they can be about opportunities. “If it’s soon after their retirement, maybe they’re appealing to and familiar to a much broader audience,” said Peter Carlisle, managing director for Olympic and action sports at Octagon, a talent management agency. “You may be able to keep that going for a while, but it would generally probably diminish over time,” said Mr. Carlisle, whose clients include Michael Phelps. “As it diminishes, I think the opportunities are still there, but the market gets more and more restricted.” Often, the former athletes depend on Olympics meet-and-greets to attract new sponsors and earn a little cash. The one-time appearances can bring in thousands of dollars  and, more important, can lead to longer-term endorsements. For a retired Olympian, showing up at the current Games is “make-or-break if you want to do business with AT&amp;T, for example,” Mr. Carlisle said. “It’s a one-time thing that, if it goes well, will mean you’ll have repeat opportunities in the future.” Dominique Dawes, the three-time Olympic gymnast, has a busy schedule in Beijing. Her agenda includes a breakfast with Coca-Cola executives, with whom she will later watch the women’s gymnastics finals. She will do commentary for Yahoo Sports and represent a Johnson &amp; Johnson campaign that enrolls former Olympians as inspirational speakers. In an interview, Ms. Dawes said that most Olympians do not go on to become professional athletes, which means that “the majority are not going to get multimillion-dollar endorsements.” “My goal is to work with a number of sponsors, not just at the Olympic Games, but more importantly, even afterwards,” Ms. Dawes said. While she makes some money from speeches and motivational CDs, her goals include opening a gymnastics camp and clinic, “and to get those things off the ground, it’s important to get sponsorship,” she said. The corporations that spend millions to sponsor the Olympics hold plenty of events during the Games for their clients and employees, and the presence of former Olympians adds some glitter. “They seem to resonate because they let us almost escape to what we believe to have been a better time in sports,” said David M. Carter, executive director of the University of Southern California’s Sports Business Institute. For the athletes, these appearances are a good way to make thousands for a few hours’ work. Ms. Evans, for example, gets $5,000 to $15,000 for an appearance, according to her agent, Evan Morgenstein of the Premier Management Group, while the swimmer Rowdy Gaines fetches just under $10,000. A variety of product endorsements is on display at this year’s Olympics, but the one that has raised the most eyebrows is Botox (eyebrows, that is, that have not been injected with the drug). Ms. Comaneci, who represents Botox, said she understood the controversy, but was brushing it aside. “Why shouldn’t it be available for athletes?” she said. “We are human beings, and then we grow up and we age like anybody else.” Crystal Cienfuegos, a spokeswoman for Allergan, which markets Botox, said that Mr. Spitz, who is 58, and Ms. Comaneci, who is 46, “appeal to our target demographic.” Mr. Morgenstein of Premier Management, who arranged Mr. Spitz’s work for Botox, said he was not concerned about negative implications. His client, he said, “had the opportunity to use their product successfully.” “By the end of the year, Spitz is going to make seven figures,” Mr. Morgenstein said. That is impressive, he added, considering “your best day at work was 36 years ago.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 14, 2008 The Advertising column on Tuesday, about former Olympians who parlayed their athletic success into marketing work, misstated the name of the university that founded the Sports Business Institute, whose executive director commented on the durable popularity of Olympic stars. It is the University of Southern California, not the University of South California.

For more than a century, Coke has fiercely guarded its recipe, created in 1886 by John S. Pemberton, a druggist in Atlanta who was trying to concoct a health drink. In recent decades the company has spun an aura of mystery around the formula -- partly for competitive reasons, but also as a marketing tool. In a campaign introduced last month in Britain, Coke divulged a few facts about the formula. It has ''no added preservatives or artificial flavors.'' Its mastermind, Dr. Pemberton, selected ''the best spices from around the world.'' And Coke says that the recipe has not changed in 122 years. That final detail has cut both ways for Coca-Cola, which faced near-insurrection in the 1980s when it tried to tinker with the formula but now confronts public perceptions that its flagship drink is unhealthy or unnatural. ''When we talked to consumers about Coke, we realized they didn't know that it has no added preservatives or artificial flavors,'' said Cathryn Sleight, marketing director of Coca-Cola Great Britain. ''We felt it was important to reassure Coke drinkers of this fact.'' Coca-Cola Great Britain will print the line ''no added preservatives or artificial flavors'' on the tens of millions of cans and bottles of Coke it sells each year in Britain. It has also set up a Web site, letsgettogether.co.uk, where it answers questions about the formula -- without giving away any secrets, of course. One consumer put the question to the Web site bluntly: ''What are the ingredients?'' The answer was: ''You'll find all the ingredients in Coke and all the other drinks we sell on their can or bottle.'' For Coca-Cola, the site says, that means carbonated water, sugar, caffeine, phosphoric acid, caramel for color and ''natural flavorings.'' -- The Web site is part of a campaign called ''Pemberton.'' It was created by Santo, an Argentine agency, and is being introduced around the world this year. The campaign, which has television and print components, opened in Austria and Switzerland in April, and in Britain in July. In the United States, it began July 4 and will run through the Olympics on NBC. '' 'Pemberton' is more fact-based, affirming for consumers that Coca-Cola never has had, and never will have, added preservatives or artificial flavors,'' said Cristina Bondolowski, global brand director for Coca-Cola. Carbonated soft drinks have waned in popularity as people have turned to alternatives that they consider more natural, like waters and teas. Coca-Cola and its rivals have also been under pressure from health lobbies and government officials over concerns of obesity in children. The Pemberton campaign is not aimed at depicting regular Coke as a diet drink. The Web site says that a 250-milliliter serving -- about 8.5 ounces -- has 105 calories, or 5 percent of the recommended daily intake for an adult. Tim Ambler, a senior fellow on the marketing faculty of the London Business School, said he did not see what Coke gained from the message of the Pemberton campaign. ''Focusing on no added preservatives or artificial flavors is an odd thing for Coca-Cola to do,'' he said. As for the rationale that consumers did not realize that Coke had no added preservatives, ''my response to that would be that maybe consumers didn't know -- but they didn't care,'' Mr. Ambler said. ''People don't go looking for a soft drink with no additives.'' The campaign is a bit of a departure for Coke, which usually tries to link its brand to the image of young, vibrant people having fun. Many previous campaigns have celebrated the drink's taste, saying that it is ''less sweet'' than Pepsi, but this is the first time the company has focused squarely on the ingredients. The change of tack may have something to do with a new drink, Pepsi Raw, that was introduced in the Britain in February. PepsiCo says that by replacing corn syrup with cane sugar in Pepsi Raw, it has reduced the calorie content of a 300 milliliter serving -- about 10 ounces -- to 90 calories from 120 calories.</text></article>

KEOUGH, a former top executive at the Coca-Cola Company, has been delivering a cautionary speech for decades about how to fail in business. Some of his most colorful examples are his own failures  like New Coke. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Matthew Staver/Bloomberg News Donald R. Keough Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Now, at the urging of his lifelong friend, the investor Warren E. Buffett, he has turned the speech into a book, “The Ten Commandments for Business Failure,” which was published by the Portfolio imprint of the Penguin Group this week. Mr. Keough, who became president and chief operating officer of Coca-Cola in 1981, has been the chairman of the investment bank Allen &amp; Company since retiring from Coca-Cola in 1993. The following are excerpts from a recent interview: Q. Why did you decide to focus this book on the mistakes that can lead to business failure, rather than on the much more common theme of business success? A. The word “success” has always made me nervous, because I believe built into that word are a couple of viruses  arrogance and complacency  and left unchecked, they can ensure failure. Ultimately, it is when mistakes are made that life takes its turns. If you watch a tennis match, it is the mistakes that determine who is going to win. Q. You listed several examples of mistakes that you made at Coca-Cola, chief among them New Coke. But you also wrote that the best way to fail was to quit taking risks. So was New Coke worth the risk? A. I wouldn’t want to do it again. But it was an enormous learning experience, and oddly enough, it turned out to be positive for the Coca-Cola Company. Our sales increased when we brought the original formula back. The reaction from our customers was overwhelming. Once we realized that we had made a mistake, I went on television and simply said that we don’t own this brand, you do. You’ve made it clear that you want the original formula back, and you’re getting it back. Q. Why were you tempted to fiddle with the formula in the first place? A. When Roberto Goizueta and I took over in 1981, he said to the top executives that we were going to kill a sacred cow every day. Everything is up for grabs, he said, including the formula. Saying that at the Coca-Cola Company was really heresy. Q. You were highly critical in your book of the role that consultants played in the New Coke episode. Do they really deserve so much of the blame, if management was responsible for calling the shots? A. Consultants will probably not be great purchasers of this book. There is nothing wrong with outside help. But they have to be there for a specific purpose, for some knowledge that you don’t have. These are usually very smart people, and they are very good at PowerPoint presentations. But you shouldn’t rely on them more than the people in your own company. Q. Why did you hesitate to invest in Eastern Europe after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989? A. That was one of those times when I almost succumbed to the view that I was infallible. The man in charge of Europe asked us to invest a huge amount of money in Eastern Europe. Apparently, I was unpleasant about it. His boss, who was in charge of international operations, came into my office afterward and said to me, “You haven’t got the right to shoot him down, because you haven’t been there and you don’t know what’s going on.” It hit me like a brick that he was right. We went all over Eastern Europe together, and three months later, we announced that we would spend a billion dollars there. And if he hadn’t had the guts to come into my office and tell me how stupid I was being, we wouldn’t have the kind of business that we have there now. Q. Why do you think there have been so many scandals at large public companies in recent years? A. The focus has moved from managing the company to managing the stock. If you look back, 20 or 30 years ago, the typical annual report was four or five pages and had no pictures, just the facts. But as the bull market developed, the annual reports became sexier. And the chief financial officer was no longer there to add and subtract the numbers. He was encouraged to be creative. The C.E.O. might say to him: “The Street is expecting 5 more cents. Can you find it?” The pressure in that bubble was so intense. The bubble ended in 2001. But it still takes a rare C.E.O. to say: “I am not going to pay attention to my quarterly results. I am going to run the company on the basis of long-term return to my shareholders.” Q. You had a colorful childhood, working with your father in the Sioux City, Iowa, stockyards. How do you think that influenced your executive career? A. When I was 15 or 16 years old, I got a job buying bulls to ship to processing plants back East. I worked for a man named Doyle Harmon, and my first day on the job, he chastised me for paying too much. He said “concentrate on the bull, not on the language of selling.” I’ve made most of the mistakes in my career by not concentrating on the bull. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Enterprises Incorporated Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Problems at the bottler also hurt the Coca-Cola Company’s bottom line, because it owns about 35 percent of that business. Coke said Thursday that its profit fell 23 percent in the second quarter, when it took a charge because of the bottler’s woes. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which has about 80 percent of the United States market for Coke, said it would raise prices after Labor Day because of higher commodity costs and declining American soda sales. It said prices would go up by a percentage in the mid-single digit to high-single digit range. Bottlers set prices for retailers like grocery stores. At the Coca-Cola Company, results were again led by the international operations. The company managed to keep United States sales volume steady in the second quarter with help from Glacéau’s Vitaminwater, which it bought for $4.1 billion last June. International sales rose 5 percent despite natural disasters in Asia and labor strikes in Europe. “I know what is top of mind for all of you  the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on our results,” said Coke’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, who succeeded E. Neville Isdell on July 1. “It is clear we will face some challenges around the globe.” The company, based in Atlanta, earned $1.42 billion, or 61 cents a share, down from $1.85 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The results included a charge of 40 cents a share related to Coca-Cola Enterprises. Excluding one-time items, the figure came to $1.01 a share. Revenue rose 17 percent, to $9.05 billion, from $7.73 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had expected a profit of 96 cents a share on revenue of $8.93 billion, on average. Coca-Cola Company shares fell $2.00, or 3.8 percent, to close at $50.34. Shares in Coca-Cola Enterprises fell 1 cent, to $16.83. The bottler posted a second-quarter loss Thursday of $3.17 billion, or $6.52 a share, in contrast to a profit of $270 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The company said the loss included a $5.3 billion write-down in the value of a franchise license in North America because of an expected decline in operating income, higher commodity prices and its falling share price.

These Characters Still Find Work in Ads<date>Published: June 18, 2008</date><text>THE characters on the Fox television series ''Family Guy'' make tasteless jokes about sex, AIDS, religion and bodily functions, purposely offending just about every group of people you could name. So why are they all of a sudden the darlings of Madison Avenue? Mainstream advertisers normally gravitate toward wholesome characters from mainstream shows that steer clear of hot buttons. Think Snoopy, the Flintstones and the Jetsons rather than Stewie, the diabolical infant from ''Family Guy''; Peter, the buffoonish patriarch of the Griffin family; and Brian, the family dog who behaves like a person -- a person who smokes and drinks martinis. But in recent months, big brands like Coca-Cola, Subway and White Castle have been borrowing for their marketing efforts characters from ''Family Guy,'' which has been criticized for everything from anti-Semitism and sexism to homophobia and overall disgustingness. ''Looking at who our customers are and what programming they like, 'Family Guy' fell into that,'' said Kim Bartley, vice president for marketing and site development at White Castle System in Columbus, Ohio. ''We're looking for teens and young adults and young-at-heart adults,'' she added, ''who are interested in being a part of something different.'' Beginning this week, the White Castle restaurant chain is introducing a campaign that features members of the animated cast of ''Family Guy'' like Stewie and Brian. There will be cups bearing likenesses of the characters, posters in stores and radio commercials by JWT, part of the WPP Group. ''Our brand is quirky,'' Ms. Bartley said, ''not a brand like Burger King or McDonald's.'' That made the agreement to use the ''Family Guy'' cast for the campaign ''a good fit,'' she added. The trend on Madison Avenue to develop ads with cartoon characters that not so long ago would have had their anthropomorphic mouths washed out with soap is fairly recent. The concept gained popularity with ''The Simpsons,'' accelerated with ''South Park'' and continues with the dysfunctional Griffins from ''Family Guy,'' which along with ''The Simpsons'' is part of the Sunday night lineup on Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation. ''The Simpsons'' is probably the mildest of the three, with ''South Park'' at the other extreme. Hiring rude, crude 'toons instead of warm and fuzzy animated characters ''goes with the times,'' said Ira Mayer, president and publisher at The Licensing Letter, a newsletter in New York owned by EPM Communications. ''Edginess is acceptable,'' Mr. Mayer said, particularly in appealing to teenagers. He offered as an example the fact that girls are wearing T-shirts in public with provocative slogans ''that 10 years ago girls never would have worn.'' As unusual as it may be to license animated misfits for ads and merchandise, Mr. Mayer said, ''with a cartoon character you still have a certain level of control and can control the offensiveness.'' With an actor or a rock star, on the other hand, you take your chances, he said. The Subway chain of sandwich shops used Peter Griffin -- a working-class guy with a New England accent -- in a campaign at the end of last year that included television commercials and signs in stores. The ads promoted a new menu item, the Subway Feast, that would appeal to the character if he were real, because it is ''a large sandwich with lots of meat,'' said Tony Pace, chief marketing officer at the marketing arm of Subway in Milford, Conn., known as the Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust. ''Peter's a good representation of the people who are interested in the Feast,'' Mr. Pace said, and ''Family Guy'' is a show ''that appeals to that target audience.'' Still, there was ''definitely a cadre of folks who thought it was a little controversial,'' he added, particularly ''some customers and some people in our system who were not big fans of being involved with it at all.'' So Subway and its national agency, MMB, which was involved in the campaign, were careful in development to make sure that ''relative to the content of the show, it was pretty tame,'' Mr. Pace said. For instance, of the half-dozen scripts that were considered for the commercials, ''four we couldn't use,'' he added, laughing, because ''we're still a family restaurant.''</text></article>

The company also said it would be hard to meet its full-year earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.55 a share if current economic and market trends failed to improve. Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world’s largest bottler of Coca-Cola Company beverages, said the weakening North American economy was cutting into sales volume, especially in 20-ounce bottles, which are sold in convenience stores. Higher gasoline prices have cut into convenience store traffic, analysts said.

Skip to next paragraph Stuart Bradford Well Are energy drinks harmful for teens? Join the discussion. Go to Well » RSS Feed Get Health News From The New York Times » Super-caffeinated energy drinks, with names like Red Bull, Monster, Full Throttle and Amp, have surged in popularity in the past decade. About a third of 12- to 24-year-olds say they regularly down energy drinks, which account for more than $3 billion in annual sales in the United States. The trend has been the source of growing concern among health researchers and school officials. Around the country, the drinks have been linked with reports of nausea, abnormal heart rhythms and emergency room visits. In Colorado Springs, several high school students last year became ill after drinking Spike Shooter, a high caffeine drink, prompting the principal to ban the beverages. In March, four middle school students in Broward County, Fla., went to the emergency room with heart palpitations and sweating after drinking the energy beverage Redline. In Tigard, Ore., teachers this month sent parents e-mail alerting them that students who brought energy drinks to school were “literally drunk on a caffeine buzz or falling off a caffeine crash.” New research suggests the drinks are associated with a health issue far more worrisome than the jittery effects of caffeine  risk taking. In March, The Journal of American College Health published a report on the link between energy drinks, athletics and risky behavior. The study’s author, Kathleen Miller, an addiction researcher at the University of Buffalo, says it suggests that high consumption of energy drinks is associated with “toxic jock” behavior, a constellation of risky and aggressive behaviors including unprotected sex, substance abuse and violence. The finding doesn’t mean the drinks cause bad behavior. But the data suggest that regular consumption of energy drinks may be a red flag for parents that their children are more likely to take risks with their health and safety. “It appears the kids who are heavily into drinking energy drinks are more likely to be the ones who are inclined toward taking risks,” Dr. Miller said. The American Beverage Association says its members don’t market energy drinks to teenagers. “The intended audience is adults,” said Craig Stevens, a spokesman. He says the marketing is meant for “people who can actually afford the two or three bucks to buy the products.” The drinks include a variety of ingredients in different combinations: plant-based stimulants like guarana, herbs like ginkgo and ginseng, sugar, amino acids including taurine as well as vitamins. But the main active ingredient is caffeine. Caffeine content varies. A 12-ounce serving of Amp contains 107 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 34 to 38 milligrams for the same amount of Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Monster has 120 milligrams and Red Bull has 116. Higher on the spectrum, Spike Shooter contains 428 milligrams of caffeine in 12 ounces, and Wired X344 contains 258. Mr. Stevens points out that “mainstream” energy drinks often have less caffeine than a cup of coffee. At Starbucks, the caffeine content varies depending on the drink, from 75 milligrams in a 12-ounce cappuccino or latte to as much as 250 milligrams in a 12-ounce brewed coffee. One concern about the drinks is that because they are served cold, they may be consumed in larger amounts and more quickly than hot coffee drinks, which are sipped. Another worry is the increasing popularity of mixing energy drinks with alcohol. The addition of caffeine can make alcohol users feel less drunk, but motor coordination and visual reaction time are just as impaired as when they drink alcohol by itself, according to an April 2006 study in the medical journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. “You’re every bit as drunk, you’re just an awake drunk,” said Dr. Mary Claire O’Brien, associate professor in the departments of emergency medicine and public health services at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. Dr. O’Brien surveyed energy drink and alcohol use among college students at 10 universities in North Carolina. The study, published this month in Academic Emergency Medicine, showed that students who mixed energy drinks with alcohol got drunk twice as often as those who consumed alcohol by itself and were far more likely to be injured or require medical treatment while drinking. Energy drink mixers were more likely to be victims or perpetrators of aggressive sexual behavior. The effect remained even after researchers controlled for the amount of alcohol consumed. Energy drink marketers say they don’t encourage consumers to mix the drinks with alcohol. Michelle Naughton, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, which markets Amp, said, “We expect consumers to enjoy our products responsibly.” well@nytimes.com More Articles in Health »</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/25/business/25adco.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Companies Return Criticism From Darfur Group<date>Published: April 25, 2008</date><text>AFTER taking criticism from activist groups over the last few months, some Olympic sponsors are starting to criticize right back. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Adrian Bradshaw/European Pressphoto Agency A Coca-Cola stall in front of the National Stadium in Beijing. Dream for Darfur has criticized the beverage maker and others. On Thursday, Mia Farrow’s activist group, Dream for Darfur, issued a report card that roundly criticized most of the major Olympic sponsors. The group had been asking the sponsors for months to comply with requests both tame (meet with Mia Farrow) and more involved (contact the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee regarding Darfur). Even after 9 of the 19 sponsors it had singled out agreed to meet with Ms. Farrow, the group said it had seen little progress from the corporations. In the report card, it gave 16 of 19 sponsors a D or an F. The highest marks were earned by Adidas, McDonald’s and Eastman Kodak. The group was “really not pleased with the progress,” said Dream for Darfur’s executive director, Jill Savitt. In response, some sponsors began criticizing the group’s approach. “For an organization that has not eased the suffering of a single individual on the ground in Darfur to criticize those who are helping thousands every day is more than ironic,” a Coca-Cola spokesman, Kelly Brooks, wrote via e-mail. “This is not a report card on sponsors’ good works, this is simply a report card judging companies solely on the basis of the Dream for Darfur yardstick  a company’s willingness to publicly pressure a sovereign nation to intervene in the activities of another country.” Coca-Cola’s chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, wrote a column published last week in The Financial Times with similarly harsh words for the organization.  Johnson &amp; Johnson also issued a sharp response to the report card. “At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we’ve worked hard for years to help the people of Darfur, which is consistent with the commitment of Johnson &amp; Johnson to contribute to better health around the world. Given the complexities of the tragedy in Darfur, we are disappointed that Dream for Darfur has used such a narrow context by which to evaluate the company’s response,” a spokeswoman, Lorie Gawreluk, wrote via e-mail. General Electric joined the chorus. “We commend Dream for Darfur for raising awareness of this tragic situation, however we strongly disagree with the organization’s approach as well as the use of the Olympic Games as a political platform and the assertions made in the report card,” Deirdre Latour, a G.E. spokeswoman, wrote via e-mail. The three companies pointed to their efforts in Darfur. Ms. Gawreluk said that Johnson &amp; Johnson donates cash and products to the region through organizations such as Unicef and the International Rescue Committee. Mr. Brooks said that Coca-Cola has pledged more than $5 million to providing water in the Sudan, among other efforts. Ms. Latour noted the GE Foundation has donated $4 million to humanitarian aid for refugees. The sparring comes after weeks of a near impasse between activist groups opposing China’s involvement in the Games and the companies that have paid giant amounts to sponsor the event. Most of the sponsors have a significant stake in China. Adidas, for example, manufactures 49 percent of its shoes in China. For Coca-Cola, the country is its fourth-biggest market. China was the fastest-growing region for Panasonic in its most recent quarter, with sales growth at 17 percent. McDonald’s expects to open 125 restaurants in China this year. United Parcel Service has invested $600 million in China over the last five years. Anheuser-Busch has invested $1.8 billion there. Activist groups, including Students for a Free Tibet, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders and Dream for Darfur, have been sending letters to the sponsors asking them to take a stance on human-rights issues. The groups are threatening increased pressure, ranging from protests at shareholder meetings and offices to a turn-off-the-commercials campaign during the Olympics.  So far, almost none of the sponsors have changed their stance, most saying that political issues are not within their purview, as Visa did Thursday. “While we appreciate Dream for Darfur’s efforts to bring attention to the situation, Visa believes a lasting resolution to the crisis can only be achieved through governmental and diplomatic channels and not by Olympic Games sponsors,” Visa said in a statement. A few, such as Anheuser-Busch, have offered more specific suggestions. “The situation in Darfur is abhorrent, and we support efforts to bring awareness to this crisis. We believe diplomatic dialogue between governments within the United Nations and dispatching additional peace-keeping troops to Darfur are essential steps in the process of improving conditions in this region, and we have expressed our position on this topic with the International Olympic Committee and support dialogue to affect change,” Francine Katz, vice president of communications and consumer affairs for Anheuser-Busch, wrote in an e-mail message. Even one of the companies praised in the report, Adidas, was tepid in its response to the group. Dream for Darfur had awarded it a B+ rating for a letter it had written to the United Nations regarding the Darfur conflict. Adidas began its Olympics advertising campaign in China last year and is outfitting Games employees and officials along with the Chinese Olympic team. “The Adidas Group welcomes the rating it received from the second report card by Dream for Darfur,” Anne Putz, a spokeswoman for Adidas, wrote in an e-mail message. “We will continue to take action where we can. At the same time we need to stress that as a business we also understand our limitations and recognize that we have the greatest impact on those areas where we have the most influence.” Dream for Darfur also gave high marks to Kodak and McDonald’s, Kodak for writing a letter to the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations, and McDonald’s for a “private action.” McDonald’s had no comment Thursday and Kodak did not return a request for comment. Nine sponsors  Anheuser-Busch, Atos Origin, BHP Billiton, Manulife Financial, Panasonic, Staples, Swatch, U.P.S. and Volkswagen  received an F, which largely meant they had not responded to Dream for Darfur. Even if a sponsor wanted to cancel a contract, it would not be simple. Payments are made in regular installments over four years, and nine sponsors are contracted through 2012, three to 2016 and one to 2020, according to Ben Seeley, an International Olympic Committee spokesman. “Only for gross breach could these contracts not run through until their end point," Mr. Seeley wrote in an e-mail message.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/business/17coke.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Coca-Cola Faces Critics of Its Olympics Support<date>Published: April 17, 2008</date><text>It is getting tougher to be a global brand these days. Just ask Coke. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Coca-Cola Enterprises As one of the most prominent sponsors of the Olympics, Coca-Cola found itself on the hot seat on Wednesday at its annual shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Del. Outside, protesters chanted and waved picket signs. Inside, they engaged the chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, in a rare public dialogue about China’s human rights record in Tibet. “Will you tell the I.O.C. to stop taking the Olympic torch relay into Tibet, because Tibet belongs to Tibetans?” asked one protester in the audience, Lobsang Choefel, who described himself as a native Tibetan. He was referring to the International Olympic Committee. Mr. Isdell  who had just described first-quarter results that rose on the strength of international sales in countries like China  stood firm. The torch relay “has symbolized openness, it has symbolized hopes,” he said. “I don’t believe that stopping the torch run is in any way over the long term going to be the right thing to do.” The moment seemed to encapsulate the quandary the Olympics sponsors face as protests unfurl across various continents. In India, home to more than 100,000 Tibetans in exile and their religious leader, the Dalai Lama, even the official corporate sponsors avoided buying television and radio ads that were timed to the Olympic torch relay on Thursday, media executives there said. And in China, a different sort of backlash has been taking shape  against the companies from countries that seem to be putting pressure on China. French companies like Carrefour are a particular target because of the mayhem during the Paris leg of the torch relay and because the French president has said he may skip the opening ceremony in Beijing over China’s human rights record. “I think boycotting Carrefour is a peaceful and polite way to express our anger, our Chinese feelings got deeply hurt by France,” said Li Meng, a 25-year-old mechanic who is selling T-shirts in support of the boycott movement in the city of Yantai, in eastern China. “France humiliated China during the torch relay and keeps making trouble for the Olympics.” American brands like McDonald’s and KFC have also been named as targets of a boycott because some American politicians seem to be supporting the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing blames for instigating violence in Tibet to disrupt plans for the Olympics. No one knows whether there is widespread support for the boycotts, but the opposition comes at a time when many of the world’s biggest brands  including Coke  are expanding aggressively in China and planning huge sales and marketing campaigns to coincide with the Olympics. Coca-Cola’s most recent quarterly results suggest the extent of its reliance on the Chinese market. During the first quarter, Coke’s unit case volume sales in China were up 20 percent in the quarter, one of the highest figures from any country. Over all, the company’s net income rose 19 percent in the quarter, to $1.5 billion, from $1.26 billion a year ago. Bill Pecoriello, research analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that 5 to 6 percent of Coke’s total revenue comes from China (Coca-Cola does not break out the figure). The importance of China for Coke should increase, Mr. Pecoriello said. He estimated that Coke sold 1.2 billion cases in China in 2007 and forecast that it would sell 1.5 billion cases there in 2008. That compares with larger but slower-growing sales in the United States: 5.4 billion cases in 2007 and 5.45 billion cases in 2008, Mr. Pecoriello said. Neither Coca-Cola nor any of the other Olympic sponsors has flinched in its public support for the games, but the groups that are protesting China’s policies in Tibet and Darfur are vowing to step up their pressure. This could lead to showdowns, or even to a possible whipsaw for the companies if Chinese youths start protesting en masse in the other direction. “We’re not asking Coke to solve Tibet’s problems,” Lhadon Tethong, the director of an organizing group called Students for a Free Tibet, told Mr. Isdell at the shareholder meeting on Wednesday. “We’re not asking you to do anything else but tell the I.O.C. this is not the time for the torch to go to Tibet.” Ms. Tethong added, “You have influence, and you know you have influence. Please don’t hide behind a spin.” Mr. Isdell  who will be succeeded by the company’s president and chief operating officer, Muhtar Kent, by the time the Olympics start in August  responded politely and at some length. “I want to thank you for your clarification and also for your declared integrity,” he said, adding that, technically, the route of the torch was not governed by the I.O.C., but by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. On a philosophical note, Mr. Isdell added, “We still believe that the torch is a light of hope, and we trust that’s what it will be as it goes every single place in the world.” In the future, Mr. Isdell suggested, the company does still want to buy the world a Coke. “We are already a sponsor of the Olympic games  wherever they may go  through 2020, and I trust that will continue through 2028,” he said. Last week, several other sponsors, including Visa International, McDonald’s, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Anheuser-Busch, Bank of America, Home Depot, United Parcel Service and AT&amp;T reaffirmed their support of the Olympics and said that their marketing plans had not changed because of the protests. “As critical as Tibet is, I think sponsors are looking at the situation saying, ‘We’ve still got days to go,’ ” said Damien Ryan, director of Ryan Financial Communications, a Hong Kong media relations firm that has sponsors as clients. “Things can change quite quickly, and from their point of view, they realize that Beijing has got a long memory.” David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai and Heather Timmons from New Delhi.

In her right sleeve was tucked a Tibetan flag. Majora Carter was ready. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ron Harris/Associated Press Majora Carter not long after she waved a Tibetan flag while carrying the Olympic torch. Run in place, swing arms, slip fingers into sleeve, wiggle wrist and  voilà!  out comes flag. This was the scene in a hotel room in San Francisco on Tuesday, where Ms. Carter, an environmental activist from the Bronx, was practicing for a pro-Tibet protest she had planned for Wednesday during the Olympic torch run. But she was not one of those trying to disrupt the procession. She was one of the torchbearers who would be leading it. She would wave the Tibetan flag while carrying the very flame that Olympic authorities had worked so meticulously to keep demonstrators away from, adding extra security officers and occasionally making last-minute changes to the route. Only a handful of people knew of Ms. Carter’s plan. The relay organizers certainly were not among them, though Ms. Carter had dropped a very public hint during a passionate speech she made before thousands of Tibet supporters in San Francisco on Tuesday night. “Think of me as I’m carrying that torch and understand what’s in my heart as I do,” she said, “and understand I am with you in your fight and in your struggle and that I love you and that I love the people of Tibet.” Coca-Cola, one of the sponsors of the relay, chose Ms. Carter, 41, to carry the torch in San Francisco, its only United States stop, because of her environmental activism. Ms. Carter started an environmental action group, Sustainable South Bronx, in 2001. She won one of the MacArthur “genius awards” in 2005, which come with $500,000 grants and are awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to people who show exceptional creativity, originality and potential in their fields. Ms. Carter agreed to meet on Tuesday with someone from a group called Students for a Free Tibet, who gave her two Tibetan flags  one to go up her sleeve, one to go down her pants as a backup. The moment arrived about 2 p.m. on Wednesday, Pacific time. Her leg of the run was only about 200 yards, and she would be surrounded by Chinese guards. She knew she had to act fast. Some people would have been scared, or at least nervous. Ms. Carter said she was neither. “I really felt a total, complete sense of oneness with the people of Tibet,” she said. She added that as “a civil rights activist in this country,” she could not stand in support of China. Five seconds into her run down Van Ness Avenue, Ms. Carter pulled the Tibetan flag from her sleeve and began waving it. There she was, a mole at the head of the procession. She waved the flag for roughly five seconds, until a Chinese guard saw her. He lunged at her. She dodged him. He lunged again and soon wrested the flag from her hand, saying, “Sorry, I can’t let you do this.” She said she was pushed toward a group of San Francisco police officers, who then pushed her into a crowd of bystanders. Her time in the spotlight was over. The torch kept moving. On Thursday, staff members at the office of Sustainable South Bronx, the organization Ms. Carter started, sifted through hundreds of e-mails, most of them praising her protest. But some said she had acted disgracefully. A Coca-Cola spokesman, Kelly Brooks, said, “It’s unfortunate that Ms. Carter used an invitation to participate in the torch relay as a platform to make a personal political statement. We firmly believe the Olympics are a force for good that celebrates the best in sports, and we are proud to support the Beijing 2008 Olympics.” Ms. Carter, who signed a code of conduct agreement before carrying the torch, said she did not believe she had been prohibited from protesting. A man who carried the flame in San Francisco said that the code prohibits torchbearers from displaying political or religious signs. At a rally in San Francisco on Wednesday, Ms. Carter was brought to the stage by an escort for the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who fled Tibet during an uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. People bowed, hugged her, kissed her and cried. They threw scarves around her neck. One person told her she must be related to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “Oh my gosh,” Ms. Carter recalled thinking. “Just that one little act that I did was seen as so substantial.” More Articles in New York Region »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Erik S. Lesser for The New York Times The trauma center at Grady Memorial Hospital on a recent weekend night. It is the lone Level 1 trauma center in the Atlanta metropolitan region. The gift is the largest on record to a single public hospital, according to the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. The gift, from the Woodruff Foundation, is a major component of the rescue and reorganizing of Grady, which was on the brink of financial failure when business leaders, politicians, doctors and other Atlantans intensified an effort to save the hospital last year. A second part of the bailout did not come through. Last week, the Georgia legislature ended its session without approving a system to finance trauma care, one of Grady’s most important functions and largest money losers. Budget shortfalls also prompted Fulton County to cut its subsidy to the Grady emergency medical service, the sole emergency ambulance fleet in Atlanta. The Woodruff gift and the trauma-care bill were incentives offered to the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, which oversees Grady but is widely perceived as weak and inefficient, to turn over hospital operations to a new corporation. The change is intended to improve expertise and flexibility at the hospital. Grady, which is staffed by doctors from the Emory University School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine, records almost a million outpatient visits a year and is the region’s sole Level 1 trauma center. Almost 30 percent of its patients are uninsured, and 40 percent are Medicaid or Medicare recipients. Grady ended the last year $48 million in the red and is fighting to keep its accreditation after a review in November. Inpatients cost, on average, almost two times the amount they bring in reimbursements. Grady has been squeezed by trends like the increasing cost of medical care, the increasing number of uninsured patients and flat or declining government spending on health care. A Bush administration rule scheduled to go into effect in May would deny Grady and many similar hospitals millions of federal dollars designated for hospitals that serve the poor. Many community leaders were skeptical of the proposal to turn over Grady to a nonprofit entity from a public board. Some critics called it a white takeover of the hospital, a majority of whose patients and leaders have traditionally been black, or said the change would lead to cuts in services. Ultimately, the plan moved forward with guarantees of increased aid. State lawmakers did not approve a $10 fee on license renewals that was to have gone to the state trauma network. But the legislature did make a one-time appropriation of $58 million to trauma care, with $24 million expected to go to Grady. Medicaid reimbursement rates and medical education grants also increased. On Monday, State Senator Vincent D. Fort, Democrat of Atlanta and one of the most vocal critics of the change, interrupted the meeting of the new nonprofit board to argue that officials had not fulfilled their promises. “You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for tricking the community into this hostile takeover and not following through with your commitments,” Mr. Fort said. A prominent member of the new board, Dr. Louis Sullivan, a black doctor and a secretary of health and human services under President George Bush, was not pleased. “We want to save Grady Hospital as much as you do,” Dr. Sullivan said, “if you will let us have this meeting.” More Articles in US »</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/worldbusiness/29torch.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Corporate Sponsors Nervous as Tibet Protest Groups Shadow Olympic Torch’s Run<date>Published: March 29, 2008</date><text>Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Olympic Games (2008) The disruption of a Chinese official’s address during the Olympic torch lighting ceremonies in Greece last week was just the beginning of a string of protests planned to coincide with the torch’s trip around the globe. Monday’s incident was “like lighting a fuse that is going to burn from now until the Olympics in Beijing,” said Paul Bourke, an officer of the Australian Tibet Council, a pro-Tibet group. The torch relay is “really giving a focus to groups like ours around the world for the next three months.” Groups have decried China’s policies in other areas, particularly Darfur. But the pro-Tibet network, spread around the world, is more organized and interconnected than other groups, and advertising consultants and political scientists, say its influence is expected to keep the issue of autonomy and violence in Tibet front and center for weeks. That is troubling news for sponsors of the torch relay, including Coca-Cola, Lenovo and Samsung Electronics. Advertising analysts estimate the companies have paid as much as $15 million each to sponsor the relay. “What started off as a small number of organizations threatening to create some disruption has escalated significantly,” said Dan Parr, the head of Asia-Pacific for brandRapport, a marketing consulting agency. “This must be taking some of the gloss off for some of these sponsors.” A well-organized and far-reaching band of Tibet support groups is galvanizing around the torch relay. The torch moves next to Beijing, then to Almaty, Kazakhstan; Istanbul; St. Petersburg, Russia; London; Paris; San Francisco; and Buenos Aires, before heading to Africa and the Middle East. It then goes through Asia and Australia, before winding its way through Chinese provinces, including Tibet, before the start of the Olympics in August. Planning is under way for protests in most of the major cities outside China. The communications manager for Coca-Cola, Kerry Kerr, said, “We are keeping an eye on the situation,” but added that the company was not involved in picking the cities involved in the relay. “We feel that using the torch relay to put political pressure on China is not appropriate,” Ms. Kerr said. Still, Coke has had several meetings with protest groups, she said, and is sharing the groups’ concerns with the International Olympic Committee. Coca-Cola is not speaking directly with the Chinese government on the issue. In a written statement, another sponsor, Samsung Electronics of South Korea, said the company “has been in good-faith dialogue with activist groups, and has also been in regular communication with the International Olympic Committee.” Lenovo, a Chinese PC maker, did not respond to several requests for comment. “These type of protests can cause deep heartache,” even though they may not always translate directly into sales figures, said Eric Denzenhall, the president of a crisis public relations firm in Washington. Companies have changed everything from benefits packages for same-sex couples to animal testing practices to where they obtain their lumber in response to protests. Some have cut ties to countries. Barclays Bank, for example, was the first British company to pull out of South Africa, in 1986, after anti-apartheid activists and students protested its investments there. The bank’s share of the student loan market in Britain had fallen significantly while protesters were pressuring it to withdraw. None of the dozen advocates contacted suggested that Coca-Cola or other sponsors should pull out of the torch relay. But even former members of pro-Tibetan groups say they are looking for some sign the sponsors are aware of the criticisms of the Chinese government. Advertisers like Coca-Cola “have to have some responsibility to humanity” and have to react to current events, said Ramneek Bhogal, an assistant professor at the Palmer College of Chiropractic, in Davenport, Iowa, who as a student, led a chapter of Students for a Free Tibet. Protest groups have been particularly incensed at the relay’s planned route through Tibet and over Mount Everest, saying that is sure to ignite more violence. Many groups are calling for a route change, but so far both the Beijing organizers and the International Olympic Committee say it will continue as planned. From the beginning, sponsors and planners of the Beijing Olympics have worked out their marketing campaigns with care, often emphasizing social causes. Coca-Cola’s torch campaign, for example, focuses on environmental champions. General Electric ads promote clean-water technologies and solar power. Analysts say the focus on social responsibility is aimed at deflecting possible criticism from being associated with China’s more controversial environmental and human rights policies. Violence flared in Tibet after monks staged protests on March 10, the anniversary of a failed uprising against China. Tibetan groups say protesters were beaten, arrested and in some cases killed. They assert that more than 100 have been killed since March 10. The Chinese government puts the number of dead at 19. Violence spread through the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, and shops and buildings were burned. Reports of violence in Tibet and a heavy-handed Chinese reaction spread quickly, pushing Tibetan support groups to action. Assessing the total number of active Tibetan supporters worldwide is difficult. One umbrella organization, the International Tibet Support Network, connects more than 150 support groups worldwide, and estimates that its groups alone have 250,000 paid-up members. “To a lot of people, Tibet has this mythic power, this Shangri-La image,” said John Ackerly, president of the International Campaign for Tibet, which is based in Washington.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ben Garvin for The New York Times CONFAB In Montreal, from left, the Guru partners Joseph Zakher, Eric Graveline, Raymond Jolicoeur, François Bazinet and Eric Tomeo. A 36-year-old with a master’s degree in industrial psychology, Mr. Margulies left a corporate career to become a sales representative for Guru energy drinks, a new company started by a bunch of old Canadian high school pals. It might seem like a strange career switch, until you consider that the investors in the last beverage sensation in Manhattan  Glacéau, the makers of Vitaminwater  split $4.1 billion last year after Coca-Cola bought it. “Bust my hump and get some equity in the company,” Mr. Margulies explained. “That’s what we are all here for.” Guru, which is already selling in Canada, is trying to crack the New York market by zipping around the city in electric minicars painted like Guru cans and hiring cheerful, attractive young women to offer samples at convenience stores, health clubs, supermarkets and delis. But most of all, it is relying on the skills of salesmen like Mr. Margulies, who in three months on the job has received a quick education on how to win coveted shelf space in beverage cases around the city. It requires a gift for schmoozing, a comfortable pair of shoes and armorlike skin. The nonalcoholic beverage market, in New York City and elsewhere, is tough. For decades, it was dominated by the soft-drink giants Coke and Pepsi, with a few other brands scrambling for the leftovers. But the industry has radically changed in the last decade, as consumers have turned away from soft drinks amid concerns about their impact on health. Since 1998, Americans have been drinking about 33 fewer cans of soda per person per year, according to Beverage Digest, a trade magazine. An enormous variety of drinks, a hundred or more even in small delis, have picked up the slack. Bottled water and Gatorade are big sellers, but there’s also a rainbow of teas, flavored waters, sparkling waters, carbonated juices and yogurt smoothies. And energy drinks, where Guru believes it has found an opening offering products with all natural and organic ingredients. The explosion of new beverages has been marked by stories of regular folks who started small and made it big with a new drink that they hustled to local stores. Three New York friends created Snapple, which was sold to Quaker Oats Company in 1994 for $1.7 billion. Arizona tea was mixed up by a couple of Brooklynites who first tried flavored seltzer and malt liquor. Glacéau’s Vitaminwater was the brainchild of J. Darius Bikoff, who insisted on selling his vitamin-spiked flavored water beside regular bottled water rather than in the soda section. The four founders of Guru Beverage have a pretty good story, too. But the ending remains far from certain. While creating a drink in a blender and finding a bottler is relatively easy and inexpensive, making it a successful brand is difficult. “Frankly, some of it is luck,” said Gary Hemphill, managing director of the Beverage Marketing Corporation. “Being at the right place with the right product at the right time.” Guru’s founders met in high school in Montreal, at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, and became close as their paths crossed again in later years. Eric Graveline became an investment banker and moved to New York, where he roomed with François Bazinet, a fashion model. When Mr. Bazinet moved back to Montreal, he and Joseph Zakher opened several nightclubs. Raymond Jolicoeur worked in Canada for several food and beverage companies, including Kraft and Allied Domecq, now part of Pernod Ricard. (A fifth partner, Eric Tomeo, joined later.) In the late 1990s, Mr. Bazinet noticed energy drinks for sale in his travels in Europe and Japan and suggested to Mr. Jolicoeur that they introduce one in Canada. They began experimenting with drinks in Mr. Jolicoeur’s Montreal apartment, mixing in botanical ingredients, like ginseng and guarana, that Mr. Bazinet had discovered during his travels. The inspiration for the name came from an article on Bill Gates, which described him as “the guru of technology.” “It was like, wow, you know, this should be the guru of all drinks, as strong as we can make it, as healthy as we can make it,” Mr. Bazinet said. Bankrolled by the founders’ savings accounts, the company sold its first can of Guru at a small deli in Montreal in 2000. By the end of the first year of production, nearly one million cans had been sold, mostly in Montreal. By 2005, Guru was being sold throughout Canada, and the company was looking to sell in the United States. New York City was selected because it was the largest market, it was fairly similar to Montreal in terms of its many independent retailers, and Mr. Graveline was living there and preparing to retire from Wall Street. “If it doesn’t make it there, we would rather know up front rather than later,” Mr. Jolicoeur said. “But if it does make it there, we would feel like we can make it in other cities, not just in America but elsewhere.” He said it was important for the company to prove to itself “that the Guru concept has legs.” Guru set up an office in the foyer of a two-bedroom apartment on Wall Street that doubles as Mr. Jolicoeur’s residence and a crash pad for the other partners when they visit from Montreal. Mr. Jolicoeur shares the apartment with a cat named Chloe. “It’s the good-luck cat,” he said, explaining that he found Chloe abandoned on a highway around the time Guru was being introduced in Canada. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/business/16obese.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Conflict on the Menu<date>Published: February 16, 2008</date><text>New York City’s new rules for menu labels at chain restaurants have set off a food fight among the nation’s obesity experts. Skip to next paragraph Related Court Filing (pdf) Enlarge This Image Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency French fries at a McDonalds. A new rule would force many New York restaurants to post calorie information in noticeable places. Most support the theory of the city’s health commissioner that forcing chain restaurants to list the calories alongside menu items  flagging that a Double Whopper With Cheese has 990 calories, for example  will make patrons think twice about ordering one. The rules are set to take effect at the end of March. There is a countertheory, however, set forth by Dr. David B. Allison, the incoming president of the Obesity Society, a leading organization of obesity doctors and scientists. An affidavit he recently submitted to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has ignited a controversy within his organization. In the filing, Dr. Allison argues that the new rules could backfire  whether by adding to the forbidden-fruit allure of high-calorie foods or by sending patrons away hungry enough that they will later gorge themselves even more. “What harms (if any) might result” from the new rules? Dr. Allison wrote in the court filing. “That is difficult to predict.” It might be only a scientific debate among nutrition experts, except for the fact that Dr. Allison was paid to write the document on behalf of the New York State Restaurant Association, which is suing to block the new rules. Dr. Allison’s role in the debate has angered some members of the Obesity Society, setting off an e-mail fury since word of his court filing began to circulate. Some have pointed to Dr. Allison’s other industry ties, which have included advisory roles for Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods and Frito-Lay. Many of the group’s 1,800 members are “completely mad that a president-elect of the Obesity Society, an organization that cares about obesity and cares about healthy eating, wants to hold back information from people that helps them make healthy choices,” said Dr. Barry M. Popkin, a member of the organization, who is director of the Interdisciplinary Obesity Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Dr. Popkin has filed his own affidavit in the lawsuit, defending the city’s menu labeling plan. The controversy highlights unresolved issues in the obesity field about industry ties and conflicts of interest, said Dr. Kelly D. Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University. “The field is incapable of policing itself,” Dr. Brownell said. Spurred by Dr. Allison’s affidavit, the obesity group released a statement on Tuesday supporting calorie labeling on menus. “The Obesity Society believes that more information on the caloric content of restaurant servings, not less, is in the interests of consumers,” said the statement by the society, which is based in Silver Spring, Md. Dr. Allison, a professor of biostatistics and nutrition at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, is scheduled to start a one-year term as president of the Obesity Society in October. He has defended his affidavit. In a telephone interview, he said he did not take a position for or against menu labeling in the document but merely presented the scientific evidence that the labeling might deter over-eating but might not and, in fact, might be harmful. He also defended his work for the restaurant industry, but would not disclose how much he was paid for his efforts. “I’m happy to be involved in the pursuit for truth,” Dr. Allison said. “Sometimes, when I’m involved in the pursuit for truth, I’m hired by the Federal Trade Commission. Sometimes I help them. Sometimes I help a group like the restaurant industry. I’m honored that people think my opinion is sufficiently valued and expert.” The executive vice president for the restaurant association’s metropolitan New York chapters, E. Charles Hunt, said that Dr. Allison was retained by the association’s lawyers. “Obviously, a lot of it was in favor of our position,” Mr. Hunt said, “although he didn’t come right out and say that.” Dr. Allison’s 33-page affidavit cites a study that found that dieters who were distracted while eating and presented with information that food was high in calories were more likely to overeat. “To the extent that many NY diners consume food from restaurants while in a state of distraction or performing distracting tasks,” he writes, “we might hypothesize that the belief that the food is especially high in calories would trigger disinhibited increased consumption.” He also says that for some people, the deterrent of a high-calorie label might be short-lived and end up making them even hungrier and likely to eat even more later  “inadvertently encouraging patrons to consume lower-calorie foods that subsequently lead to greater total caloric intake because of poor satiating efficiency of the smaller calorie loads.” Dr. Allison was quoted advancing similar arguments in 2006 during a breakfast meeting sponsored by Coca-Cola at an international conference of obesity experts in Sydney. Dr. Allison, who disclosed at the meeting that he was a consultant to Coca-Cola on obesity issues, warned that policies to restrict certain foods might backfire, citing research showing that birds put on weight when food is scarce, according to a newsletter article about the conference. The new labeling rules by New York City’s Board of Health have support from a cross section of organizations, including consumer groups like Public Citizen and the Center for Science in the Public Interest, as well as doctor groups like the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association. While some chains already post calorie information on posters, fliers or on the Internet, public health officials argue that people may change their ordering habits or restaurants might change their menus if calorie labeling is more conspicuous. The New York rule would require that chains with 15 or more restaurants nationally, including fast-food restaurants, put the information on their menus or menu boards. This is the city’s second attempt to adopt such regulations. A judge struck down a menu-labeling plan last year, saying the law needed to be reworded. It has since been revised to comply with the judge’s order. Similar requirements have been adopted in King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, and are under consideration by 21 other state and local governments. New York’s health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, likened Dr. Allison’s claims to an argument that the world is flat. “We don’t have 100 percent proof that it’s going to work, but we have a reasonable expectation it will be successful,” Dr. Frieden said. “When places have to put ‘2,700 calories’ next to an appetizer,” Dr. Frieden said, “they might not have a 2,700-calorie appetizer anymore.” More Articles in Business »</text></article>

But some investors were disappointed that overall international volume rose only 7 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 8 percent in the third quarter and 9 percent in the first two quarters, and Coke shares fell. “The Street may look at that as a slowing down, but I look at it as still very good growth, being led by the emerging markets,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, which owns Coke shares in separately managed accounts, but not in its mutual fund. Coca-Cola said fourth-quarter net income jumped 79 percent, to $1.21 billion, or 52 cents a share, from $678 million, or 29 cents a share, a year ago, when the company took a big charge. Excluding charges in the latest quarter, Coke earned 58 cents a share, topping analysts’ average estimate of 55 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net operating revenue rose to $7.33 billion, from $5.93 billion a year ago, helped by a 6 percent increase in sales of drink concentrate, the company’s main business. Currency exchange rates bolstered revenue 8 percentage points. Unit case volume rose 5 percent in the quarter, supported by acquisitions and strength in emerging markets like China, India, Brazil and Turkey, which all had double-digit growth. By contrast, volume rose 1 percent in both North America and Japan and 2 percent in the European Union. Carbonated drinks rose 4 percent in the quarter. Noncarbonated drinks, including Vitaminwater, Powerade and Dasani bottled water, grew 11 percent in the quarter. Coke shares closed down 53 cents, or nearly 9 percent, to $59.39. .

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/business/07coke.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Chief of Coke to Step Down After Steering Its Recovery<date>Published: December 7, 2007</date><text>In the annals of Coca-Cola’s history, E. Neville Isdell may well be remembered as the man who stopped the bleeding and sutured the wounds. Skip to next paragraph Pascal Lauener/Reuters Muhtar Kent was chosen to take over as chief executive of Coca-Cola next July. We still have a lot of work to do, he said. Mr. Isdell, who is 64, announced yesterday that he would resign as chief executive next July, though he would continue as the company’s chairman until 2009. Since taking over Coca-Cola in 2004 at a time of management disarray and lackluster performance, Mr. Isdell is credited with stabilizing the company and reinvigorating it with a new sense of purpose. The challenge for his successor, Muhtar Kent, the president, chief operating officer and longtime heir apparent, will be building on Coca-Cola’s success and raising sales in North America, where soda is losing favor to bottled water, energy drinks and other beverages. “I think the bottom line is Coke is really performing well in a lot of its international markets,” said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication. “It has to be even faster on innovation in some of its markets, and unlock the formula for growth in its North American markets.” Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup, said the announcement was not a surprise but came a bit earlier than she expected. She praised Mr. Kent, calling him a Coke veteran with the “style of an outsider.” “What’s positive about it is Muhtar, relative to Isdell, is more aggressive in the right way and willing to look outside of the Coke system and make acquisitions when it makes sense,” she said. For instance, she noted that Coke had innovative products in Japan that it could offer in the United States but that it had not yet done so. “Muhtar gets that,” she said. “He’s not shy.” Shares of Coca-Cola closed up 2 cents yesterday, at $63.07. The board chose Mr. Kent at the behest of Mr. Isdell; the two men have known each other more than 20 years. “I felt Muhtar is ready,” Mr. Isdell said. “To do it smoothly, you have to get ahead of speculation that tends to come in these instances.” Mr. Kent, 55, is known for his energetic and aggressive manner and broad international experience, a crucial factor given that much of Coke’s growth is in developing markets overseas, like Russia and China. The son of a Turkish diplomat, Mr. Kent was born in the United States, grew up in Asia and attended college in England. He began working for Coke in 1978. In 1996, while Mr. Kent was working for a Coke bottler, Australian regulators accused him of insider trading after he sold 100,000 shares of the company just before a profit warning. He repaid $400,000 in profits to settle the incident, without admitting guilt, and later described it as an honest mistake. Mr. Kent returned to Coca-Cola in May 2005 and was named president and chief operating officer a year ago. “Our portfolio is getting stronger. Our brands are winning in the marketplace,” Mr. Kent said. “The strategy is in place. What we need to do is execute that strategy better.” Mr. Kent said he planned to develop a deep bench of leadership at Coke and to improve productivity and innovation. “We still have a lot of work to do,” he said. In his continuing role as chairman, Mr. Isdell said he would focus on Coke’s programs in corporate social responsibility. A native of Ireland who was partly reared in South Africa, Mr. Isdell began working for a Coke bottler in Zambia in 1966 and spent the next 35 years with the company and its bottlers; he was a candidate for the top job in the late 1990s. When he was summoned back to run Coke in 2004, he took over a company that had fallen hard after years of high turnover, lackluster advertising and management squabbling. Coke’s board passed at a chance to buy Gatorade (which PepsiCo snatched up), and the company, known for its insular culture, was slow to adapt as consumers turned to bottled water and other beverages, rather than soda. Coke’s downturn came after more than a decade of dazzling growth under Roberto C. Goizueta, who died of cancer in 1997. Mr. Isdell created a “Manifesto for Change” that included reinvigorating the Coke brand and spending more money on advertising and product development. It took some time, but Coke’s stock has steadily increased since the start of 2006, when it hovered just above $40. The question now is whether Coke has become nimble and entrepreneurial enough to dominate overseas and respond to the rapidly changing beverage landscape in the United States and other developed countries. Ms. Herzog said she believed that last spring’s $4.1 billion acquisition of Glacéau, the maker of vitamin-enhanced water, showed that Coke was moving in the right direction. Mr. Kent is “a little bit more of a cowboy,” she said, “and that’s what the Coke system has needed.” More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image CC Metro, the virtual world beginning today at there.com, where visitors create an avatar to shop for Coca-Cola products. At CC Metro, the name of the island, visitors can set up a virtual alter ego known as an avatar, which can then shop and dance at the Coca-Cola diner, visit a movie theater to watch short films and soar around on a hoverboard like the one in the 1989 movie, “Back to the Future Part II.” Coke is introducing its online island within a larger virtual world site called there.com that tries to filter out unsavory content. The company that operates there.com, Makena Technologies, uses software to censor user postings for foul language and employs a team of people to filter out content that might infringe on copyrights or fall outside a PG-13 rating. Makena, of San Mateo, Calif., says that these practices make its site desirable to advertisers. At CC Metro, Coca-Cola customers can buy clothing and accessories for their avatars using reward points culled from codes on Coke bottle caps, which can also be used at mycokerewards.com. Customers can dress up their avatars as they move them around the island. “It’s really bringing the offline world, where you’re drinking our products, and the online worlds together,” said Carol Kruse, vice president for global interactive marketing at the Coca-Cola Company.  There.com is not as famous as the virtual world Second Life, where companies like Adidas and Dell are advertising and selling products. About 573,000 people visited Second Life in October, while the traffic at there.com was too sparse to be picked up by the Web measurement company Nielsen Online. Coke was an early mover in the realm of virtual worlds, viewing them as ways to engage their customers and build their brands. Five years ago, it opened a world called Coke Studios on myCoke.com. Ms. Kruse says that about 112,000 people have visited Coke Studios each month and that the average visitor logged on three times a week for 16 minutes at a time. Coke consistently finds that some of its popular rewards offered from bottle cap points are digital goodies like virtual patio furniture for visitors’ virtual rooms. A number of consumer brands are designing virtual worlds that may resemble Coke’s new island, said Reuben Steiger, the chief executive of Millions of Us, an advertising agency that focuses on virtual worlds. “The ones that are going to prosper are going to be the ones that don’t feel like advertising. No one really wants to go hang out in an ad,” Mr. Steiger said. Several advertisers have approached there.com about purchasing virtual billboards on the site, but the site has turned them down to avoid irritating its users, said Michael Wilson, chief executive for Makena Technologies. Creating a good use of virtual worlds takes a bit of creativity, he said. People cannot actually taste Coke drinks, after all, if their avatars take a gulp. When Procter &amp; Gamble wanted to promote its Secret deodorant brand in MTV’s Virtual Laguna Beach, Mr. Wilson said his first reaction was “my avatars don’t sweat.” Procter ended up running a promotion on the site where users shared their secrets. Skeptics of virtual worlds point out that they have far less traffic than social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook. And while people who frequent social networks tend to depict themselves truthfully (more or less), people setting up avatars in virtual worlds are probably creating fantasy figures so their actions may be less useful to advertisers. Mr. Wilson said even fantasy-driven avatars should provide helpful information to advertisers because they reflect their creators’ interests. “It’s you who decide what your avatar is like,” he said. “That’s part of who you are because you chose to do that.”  In addition to building there.com, Makena Technologies has created seven virtual world sites for MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom. MTV hired a market research firm, MauroNewMedia, to study the behavior of half a million avatar users over six months (using only their avatar names, not their real names) and determined that there was value in collecting the data and using it for targeted marketing. “These platforms like Makena are designed to provide market research on steroids,” said Charles I. Mauro, president of MauroNewMedia. “This level of research allows us to be extremely accurate in a way that was never possible before to pinpoint when avatars are looking at advertisements, looking at products.” Children are using virtual worlds in larger numbers than the general population, which could bode well for the future popularity of these sites. Disney’s Club Penguin had nearly 3.9 million unique visitors last month, and Webkinz had nearly 7.3 million. Those sites are advertisement-free; people pay for some of the content, either by subscription (in the case of Club Penguin) or for a stuffed animal with a code to the site (Webkinz). Ms. Kruse of Coca-Cola said she thought the online universe was likely to include as many varieties of ad placements as the offline world does with television, radio, print and radio. CC Metro, she said, is supposed to complement Coke’s efforts on Facebook as well as Sprite Yards, the social networking site for cellphones that the company introduced last spring.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/business/media/14adco.html?ref=cocacolacompany">For Olympics, China’s Marketers Are Showing Their Pride<date>Published: November 14, 2007</date><text>THERE are those who consider the Summer Olympics a quadrennial exercise in hyperbolic marketing, a five-ring circus of commercialism interrupted occasionally for televised glimpses of muscular youth doing something with batons or volleyballs. Still, the coming Games in Beijing, now less than nine months away, promise to be an important moment for Madison Avenue, if not for furthering understanding among nations. The billions of dollars that will be spent on Olympics-related advertising  directly by sponsors, and indirectly by marketers seeking to bask in the reflected glow  could smooth the bumpy ride the advertising industry is now enduring. With fears that the tumult in the American economy may lead marketers to cut budgets for next year, the Olympic campaigns could make the forecasts of growth in global ad spending in 2008 come true. For instance, a prediction in June by the Universal McCann media agency saw a 5.5 percent increase in worldwide ad spending next year compared with 2007. Industry executives are also excited about the choice of location for the Summer Games (even if some political activists are not). They look forward to the Olympics shining a brighter spotlight on China as the countrys consumer economy becomes increasingly powerful. The recent Global Entertainment and Media Outlook report from PricewaterhouseCoopers is forecasting that ad spending in China in six major media will increase to $22.5 billion in 2011, from $13 billion this year. The ardent embrace of the Olympics by the Chinese government  and, by extension, its citizens  also promises to raise the profile of the campaigns surrounding the Games. For instance, the Olympic torch relay, scheduled to begin in March, is planned as the longest ever. The sponsors are a Chinese company, the Lenovo Group, along with Coca-Cola and Samsung.  The Chinese are very proud of the fact theyre hosting the Olympics, said Susan Towers, managing director at Chandelier, an agency that has offices in Hong Kong, London and New York and that hopes to open in Beijing or Shanghai next year. The national pride is being expressed as We can do anything, she added. As a result, the competition among agencies for work from Chinese advertisers is taking on Olympian overtones. JWT, part of the WPP Group, is to announce today that it has landed five assignments to create campaigns in China to appear during the Summer Olympics, two of them after reviews that involved other agencies. Three of the assignments for JWT are from Olympic sponsors: Lenovo, the computer maker, which is a top-tier sponsor though the International Olympic Committee; China Unicom, a mobile phone network, which is a national sponsor; and another national sponsor, the Yili Group, which is Chinas biggest dairy. The remaining two assignments are from Chinese companies that are not official Olympic sponsors but will run campaigns in the country during the Games. If consumers who see the ads somehow come to think of the companies as official sponsors, well, as someone once said, all is fair in love and advertising. One of those two assignments is from Anta Sports Products, which sells athletic footwear and apparel. The other is from Lilang, a maker of mens wear like suits. Anta, Lenovo and Yili were JWT clients before the assignments were made. For the Chinese, the Summer Olympics is way more than just an extravaganza of sporting spirit, Tom Doctoroff, chief executive at JWT Greater China and the Northeast Asia area director for the agency, said in a telephone interview. It signals to them the emergence of China, standing next to the United States and assuming its rightful place as a center of gravity, he added. Mr. Doctoroff, who is based in Shanghai, said he had not detected one iota of cynicism among the Chinese about the arrival of the Olympics. He compared that with the negative attitudes of many Westerners whose cities are playing  or hoping to play  host to the Summer or Winter Games. He ruefully recalled my brother, who got all New York not behind him. The reference was to Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development in New York City, whose bid to land the 2012 Summer Games lost to Londons. That type of feeling  Its a waste, We dont need the Olympics  its not there in China, Tom Doctoroff said. As a result, he predicted that an Olympics has never come as close to harnessing the emotions of a country as this one will. That means the stakes will be extraordinarily high for advertisers, official or otherwise, who pay for campaigns to appear during the Summer Games  as well as for the agencies that will create those campaigns. The good ones will be devoured and celebrated by the entire nation, Mr. Doctoroff said of the ads. The bad ones, the ones that make China look bad, feel bad about itself, will engender hostility, he added. Mr. Doctoroff praised the preliminary Olympics campaigns now appearing in China for two official sponsors that are not JWT clients. One, Coca-Cola, has a promising platform, he said, that celebrates refreshment, physical and spiritual. The other, Johnson &amp; Johnson, is centered on the spirit of winning, he added, infused with the warmth of J.&amp; J. As the JWT work for Lenovo and Yili gets under way, Mr. Doctoroff said, the challenge the agency faces creatively is to marry the product characteristics with the spirit of the Olympics in a way that makes the brands bigger and bolder.  For Lenovo, which is supplying computers and other equipment to the Beijing organizers, there is an additional challenge, he added, which is to reflect a responsibility to help ensure the successful management of the Games. The work for Lilang, also being developed, will express the idea that in China, business is a competitive sport, Mr. Doctoroff said, so having your eye on the prize is as relevant in business as in an athletic competition. JWTs work for Anta has already started to appear. The ads feature Olympic athletes like Wang Hao, a table tennis player, but do not include Olympic logos, because the company is not an official sponsor. The brand vision is Forge yourself, Mr. Doctoroff said, that from sweat, talent and hard work, glory emerges. It is a vision statement that could come as readily from advertising executives as from muscular youth with batons or volleyballs.

Skip to next paragraph NAMES CAN MISLEAD Coke and others are switching to refrigerants with hidden virtues. Which means that sellers of cold foods may soon have a public relations problem on their hands. Hydrofluorocarbons, better known as HFCs, have been the refrigerants of choice since their predecessor, chlorofluorocarbons, were proved to hurt the ozone layer. But refrigeration equipment can leak, and HFCs are a powerful greenhouse gas. So Coca-Cola, McDonalds and other companies are switching to another gas to keep their vending machines, trucks and in-store freezers and soda machines cold. That gas is carbon dioxide. Thus the perception problem. Thanks to the language of climate change  carbon offsets, carbon neutral, carbon intensive, carbon tax and the like  most people think carbon dioxide is far and away the worst, if not the only, greenhouse gas around. But pound for pound, HFCs, among other gases, are far more potent when it comes to trapping the earths heat. So using carbon dioxide in place of HFCs in refrigeration equipment poses less environmental risk. CO2 as a good thing? Even Martha Stewart might have trouble explaining that. Really understanding this issue requires a level of scientific knowledge and sophistication that is beyond most people, said Kert Davies, research director of Greenpeace, which spearheaded Refrigerants Naturally, an industry coalition that has been exploring alternatives to HFCs for several years. The result, marketing experts warn, could be reputation chaos. The man in the street just assumes that carbon dioxide is the killer, said Michael Watras, president of Straightline International, a brand consulting firm. Those companies better be ready for a huge image issue. The issue hasnt arisen yet, for various reasons. Unilever, which owns Ben &amp; Jerrys, switched to another less-risky gas, propane, for refrigeration, thus dodging the carbon dioxide bullet. McDonalds is so far testing carbon dioxide as a refrigerant only in Europe, where consumers are far more attuned to the scientific issues, said Bob Langert, McDonalds vice president for corporate social responsibility. And companies that normally promote their greenness are keeping an uncharacteristically low profile on their use of CO2. In September, for example, Greenpeace and Coca-Cola mailed a press release publicizing the HFC-free coolers Coke will use at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The identity of the replacement refrigerant was not revealed until halfway down, in passing. We hadnt even asked ourselves if there will be a stigma attached to this, because we are so sure it is a strong solution to a climate problem, said Jeff Seabright, vice president for environment and water resources at Coca-Cola. But CO2 has developed such a bad reputation as the cause of climate change that we have to really explain how harnessing its attributes is part of the solution, not the cause. But can Coke and its confreres prevent the inevitable  if unfair  bad buzz? Marketing experts say yes. But they offer highly divergent and often mutually exclusive ideas about how. Eric Hirshberg, chief creative officer of Deutsch/LA, a unit of Interpublic Group, suggests using placards in stores, stickers on refrigerated trucks and other visual methods to stress the end results while playing down the means. They have to stay on message, which is that they are voluntarily lowering the climate impact of their refrigerants at their own expense, he said. They dont have to mention carbon dioxide at all. And if they do, they certainly should not try to justify its use, added Jan-Benedict Steenkamp, a professor of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina. Its a losing proposition to try to explain that you are exchanging something very bad for something mildly bad, he said. The companies should just calculate their carbon footprint, and specify that this change is reducing it by X percent. Conversely, Dan Becker, a former Sierra Club official and a consultant to environmental groups, says he thinks carbon dioxide should be front and center  but that the companies should defuse the issue by letting Greenpeace do the talking. If an environmental leader says that irony of ironies, carbon dioxide is the safest refrigerant, it has a lot more credibility than if companies say it, he said. Others suggest that companies simply position the switch as a way of saying they are reusing carbon dioxide, thus keeping it out of the atmosphere. The idea of recycling carbon will be a much easier sell than the idea that other gases are worse than CO2, said Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Watras, the brand consultant, disagrees with all the tactics. He thinks the companies should mount a straightforward advertising campaign, preferably on prime time television, explaining in simple terms why carbon dioxide is not the gaseous equivalent of the devil incarnate. But he thinks they should speak with one voice  that of Refrigerants Naturally  rather than as individuals. A company advertising alone looks like it is pushing an agenda, but a consortium of companies looks like it is tackling an issue, he said. And as any brand specialist knows, perception trumps reality every time. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/us/23drought.html?ref=cocacolacompany">New to Being Dry, the South Struggles to Adapt<date>Correction: October 24, 2007Published: October 23, 2007</date><text>Correction Appended ATLANTA, Oct. 22  For more than five months, the lake that provides drinking water to almost five million people here has been draining away in a withering drought. Sandy beaches have expanded into flats of orange mud. Tree stumps not seen in half a century have resurfaced. Scientists have warned of impending disaster. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image John Bazemore/Associated Press Low levels this month at Lake Lanier, which supplies water to Atlanta. The Southeast has been slow to respond to its drought. And life, for the most part, has gone on just as before. The response to the worst drought on record in the Southeast has unfolded in ultra-slow motion. All summer, more than a year after the drought began, fountains sprayed and football fields were watered, prisoners got two showers a day and Coca-Cola’s bottling plants chugged along at full strength. On an 81-degree day this month, an outdoor theme park began to manufacture what was intended to be a 1.2-million-gallon mountain of snow. By September, with the lake forecast to dip into the dregs of its storage capacity in less than four months, the state imposed a ban on outdoor water use. Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia declared October “Take a Shorter Shower Month.” And Saturday, Mr. Perdue declared a state of emergency for more than half the state and asked for federal assistance, though the state has not yet restricted indoor water use or cut back on major commercial and industrial users, a step that could cause a significant loss of jobs. These last-minute measures belie a history of inaction in Georgia and across the South when it comes to managing and conserving water, even in the face of rapid growth. Between 1990 and 2000, water use in Georgia increased 30 percent. But the state has not yet come up with an estimate of how much water is available during periods of normal rainfall, much less a plan to handle the worst-case event  dry faucets. “We have made it clear to the planners and executive management of this state for years that we may very well be on the verge of a systemwide emergency,” said Mark Crisp, a water expert in the Atlanta office of the engineering firm C. H. Guernsey. But a sense of urgency has been slow to take hold. Last year, a bill died in the Georgia Legislature that would have required that low-flow water devices be installed in older houses before they are resold. Most golf courses are classified as “agricultural.” Water permits are still approved first come first served. And Georgia is not at the back of the pack. Alabama, where severe drought is even more widespread, is even further behind in its planning. A realistic statewide plan, experts say, would tell developers that they could not build if no water was available, and might have restricted some of the enormous growth in the Atlanta area over the last decade. Already, officials have little notion how to provide for a projected doubling of demand over the next 30 years. The ideas that have been floated, including piping in water from Tennessee or desalinating ocean water, would require hundreds of billions of dollars and painful decision making the state has been reluctant to undertake. “It’s been develop first and ask questions later,” said Gil Rogers, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center. Instead, Georgia has engaged in interminable squabbles with neighboring states over dam releases and flow rates. The latest effort at mediation with Alabama fell apart just last month. And Georgia officials insist that Atlanta would have plenty of water were it not for the Army Corps of Engineers, which they say has released more water from its main source of water, Lake Lanier, than is necessary to protect three endangered species downstream. Last week, Mr. Perdue filed for an injunction against the corps to stop the release of water. (Downstream, Alabama officials responded in protest, saying they need the releases.) “We are not here because we consumed our way into this drought, as some would suggest,” said Carol Couch, Mr. Perdue’s director of environmental protection. Those making that argument against Georgia include many people in Florida, the only state in the region to have adopted a water plan and home to the downstream end of the basin that includes Lake Lanier. An editorial Friday in the St. Petersburg Times said that the blame lay not with the corps but with “a record drought, unrestrained population growth and poor water-conservation habits.” 1 2 Next Page » Correction: October 24, 2007 An article on Tuesday about the drought in the Southeast misstated the name of a group that provides employees to the city of Atlanta’s water planning district.

The company, which produces Powerade sports drink and Dasani bottled water as well as its soft drinks, also gave a positive outlook for the global economy and commodity costs, sending its shares up sharply. Coke said it expected costs for materials like corn syrup and aluminum to be flat to down slightly. We are starting to see a moderation in commodity costs impacting beverage companies, both globally and in North America, and we believe the worst is behind us, the chief financial officer, Gary P. Fayard, said in a conference call. Coke said net income rose to $1.65 billion, or 71 cents a share, for the third quarter, which ended Sept. 28, up from $1.46 billion, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 68 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Coke lowered its expected full-year tax rate to 22 percent, from 22.5 percent, providing a benefit of 1 cent a share in the quarter. Net operating revenue rose 19 percent, to $7.69 billion. Worldwide case volume rose 6 percent, with increases of 4 percent for carbonated drinks and 14 percent for noncarbonated beverages. Volume rose 1 percent in North America, the first quarter of growth there in five quarters. Volume of carbonated drinks fell 2 percent as consumers opted for drinks they considered healthier, but the popularity of the new Coca-Cola Zero helped the company gain market share. Volume grew more than 4 percent in Japan, but fell 2 percent in Europe, partly because of unfavorable weather in Western Europe. The company had double-digit growth in developing markets, including China, Turkey, Russia and India. Analysts have cited the success of Coke Zero and the recent acquisitions of Glaceau and Fuze, as evidence that the chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, is turning around the company. Coke shares were up 2.3 percent, or $1.33, at $59.09. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

In the place of soda and sugar-laden beverages, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cadbury Schweppes agreed that only water, low-fat milk and 100 percent juice would be offered in elementary and middle schools. In high schools, sports drinks, light juices and diet drinks would also be allowed. The announcement was brokered by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a collaboration of the American Heart Association and the William J. Clinton Foundation, and it was widely praised. Former President Bill Clinton, who attended the press conference, called the decision courageous. Shrewd was probably a better word. The truth is that full-calorie soda would have been forced out of schools eventually, either by litigation or legislation. And the beverage companies were lucky to get sports drinks in the deal since many nutritionists believe there is no reason for kids to be drinking them unless they are vigorously exercising. But that wasnt the end of it. After the deal was signed and the editorials written, the beverage makers sought a change. Under the original terms of the agreement, only sports drinks and light juices with no more than 66 calories per eight ounces were allowed to be sold in high schools. But because of a quietly executed amendment in late April, other drinks with no more than 66 calories per eight ounces are now allowed. By doing so, the beverage companies opened the door for beverages like Vitaminwater and Propel, both considered enhanced water, to be sold. Sports drinks are generally defined as sweetened drinks with electrolytes; enhanced waters have vitamins instead. The change is significant because teenagers are rejecting soda in droves in favor of a huge new variety of mid-calorie beverages like sports drinks, enhanced waters, sparkling juice and sweetened teas. The market for such beverages in the United States is so bullish that Coke forked over a whopping $4 billion in June for Glacéau, which makes Vitaminwater. The beverage industry and its nonprofit partners describe the amendment as a minor tweak  so minor that they didnt bother to tell the people who applauded them the previous year for striking such a bold deal. Nutrition advocates accuse the beverage industry of gutting the agreement. This is a huge loophole that will bring lots more sugar and calories into kids diets, said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Ms. Wootan says enhanced waters are simply sugar water with vitamins tossed in, most of which children dont need. Dr. Carlos A. Camargo, associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Harvard Medical School, says if people are concerned about teenagers consuming too many liquid calories, they should fix school drinking fountains. It has zero calories, zero artificial sweeteners, zero stimulants and  if the schools made sure that their drinking fountains actually worked  it could be provided throughout the school day at NO COST to students, Dr. Camargo wrote in an e-mail message. Dr. Camargo was part of an Institute of Medicine panel that suggested last spring that schools should offer only water, low-fat milk or 100 percent fruit juices during the school day. The beverage industry rightly points out that getting soda out of schools is a large improvement. Its much ado about nothing, said Kevin Keane, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association. All youre doing is simplifying the language to base it around calories rather than products. He noted that some juices allowed in schools contain far more calories than enhanced waters and sports drinks do. Mr. Keane also said that the amendment didnt change the calorie mix offered in schools: the deal continues to require that 50 percent of the beverage offerings in high school are water or contain 10 calories or less for eight ounces. BUT the problem is, even if 50 percent of the vending machine offers Gatorade and vitamin water, and the rest is diet soda and water, which drinks do you think most teenagers will pick? My kids would pick vitamin water or Gatorade, and I suspect most others would too. Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, has tried repeatedly to pass legislation that would allow the Department of Agriculture to update its standards on what kinds of foods and beverages can be sold in school vending machines and school stores. In the past, the beverage industry has been among his biggest foes. But this time around, the beverage industry isnt opposing the bill  it is encouraging Senator Harkin to adopt its standards (with the amendment included, of course) on beverage sales in schools. Voluntary nutrition standards were announced just over a year ago with great fanfare, but in a short time, there was quiet backsliding to sneak sugary beverages into our schools again, said Kate Cyrul, a spokeswoman for the Senate agriculture committee, of which Senator Harkin is the chairman. For the sake of our childrens health, Congress should pass science-based school nutrition standards that cannot be altered at the request of just a few parties and without public input. Its not so surprising that soda makers would push for such a change given their struggle to keep pace with the changing tastes and demands of the public. Like most food and beverage companies, they are trying to figure out how to promote healthy lifestyles in ways that dont discourage customers from buying their products. But you would think that an organization called the Alliance for a Healthier Generation would be more concerned with kids health than corporate profits. The deal was already signed. Why give in to the beverage companies? Robert S. Harrison, the alliances executive director, said the intent of the original agreement was to remove high-calorie drinks from schools and reduce portion sizes. Now, for instance, only 12-ounce sports drinks can be sold in high school rather than 20 ounces. The amendment is a technical amendment that is completely consistent with the original agreement, he said. We are trying to move the needle to improve the offerings that are available to kids in schools. The alliance deserved credit for moving the needle. But it could have pushed it further. I guess thats why its not called the Alliance for the Healthiest Generation. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

How is an advertiser, even an official sponsor, supposed to stand out? Olympic sponsors like Coca-Cola, McDonalds and Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker that bought I.B.M.s PC business, celebrated the start of the one-year countdown to the opening ceremonies, on Aug. 8, with marketing initiatives intended to break through the Olympics ad hype. Coca-Cola took over about a third of the bus shelters in Beijing  2,008 of them, to be precise  in what it called the biggest outdoor advertising presence ever seen in China. McDonalds announced, along with new menu items and ads aimed at Chinese consumers, an international competition for children to win trips to the Games. Lenovo detailed a partnership with Google to use the Internet to find participants for the Olympic torch relay. Aug. 8 was a big day in China, said Michael Birkin, the chief executive for the Asia-Pacific region at the Omnicom Group, whose advertising agencies work with several Olympics sponsors. I think it created a stir with a number of clients, who have launched programs with more of an Olympics focus. A report last week from Group M, the media buying division of the WPP Group, underlined the importance of the Beijing Games to the global advertising economy. China is set to take over from the United States next year as the biggest source of growth in global ad spending. Although the United States remains a much larger advertising market over all, China will account for 24 percent of new spending worldwide, compared with 20 percent for the United States. As recently as last year, the United States provided 29 percent of growth, and China 18 percent, the report showed.  Even while China gains ascendancy in new ad spending, a recent dispute about a joint venture between Groupe Danone of France and its local partner in China, the Wahaha Group, has raised concern among some Western companies about a rise in Chinese nationalism, perhaps linked to the Olympics. So, even as the Chinese prepare for the international scrutiny that the Games will bring, international marketers are honing their local credentials. Earlier on, it was seen as the Beijing Games, said Michael Wood, chief executive for the China region at the ad agency Leo Burnett. Now there is very much of an increase in them being perceived as the Chinese Games. On Aug. 8, McDonalds introduced the China Mac, which resembles a Big Mac but is adapted to appeal to Chinese tastes. McDonalds is advertising the China Mac, which is made with marinated beef, with a television spot created by Leo Burnett that shows cartoonlike athletes morphing into ingredients in the burger. The McDonalds competition will allow 100 children from China, among 300 worldwide, to make four-day visits to Beijing during the Games. McDonalds has reached an agreement with CCTV, the state broadcaster in China, to put on a reality television show based on the selection process, said Gary Rosen, McDonalds chief marketing officer in China. Coca-Cola is basing its efforts on shuang, a Chinese word that the company says means physical, emotional and spiritual refreshment. More than 50 designs in the billboard campaign feature Chinese athletes like Yao Ming, the N.B.A. basketball player, with a Coke.  While American companies like Coca-Cola and McDonalds are trying to raise their profiles in China, Chinese companies like Lenovo are trying to use the Olympics to spread brand awareness elsewhere. Lenovo says it is looking for three new thinkers who symbolize the ideals of the Olympics to take part in the torch relay, said Alice Li, vice president for Olympics marketing at Lenovo. Candidates must submit 50-word essays online to show they are such thinkers. Finalists will create 30-second videos for posting on YouTube, which is owned by Google. The one-year countdown will not be the last marketing milestone of these Olympics. The six-month mark, in February, coincides with the Chinese New Year, providing a chance for fresh marketing fireworks. More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/arts/design/30muse.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Ingredients: Carbonated Water, High-Fructose Corniness ...<date>Published: July 30, 2007</date><text>ATLANTA  You cant beat the feeling. Life tastes good. Its the Real Thing. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Erik S. Lesser for The New York Times The lobby of the New Museum of Coca-Cola in Atlanta. More Photos » Multimedia Slide Show A Large Taste of Pop I have just emerged from the Coke side of life here, where the Coca-Cola Company had its origins in a patent medicine concocted by an eccentric, ailing and possibly drug-addicted entrepreneur in 1886. And after visiting the companys new museum; after sitting in a theater, wearing 3-D glasses, feeling floating bubbles pop against my skin from well-timed puffs of air; after strolling through an exhibition hall with antique Coke ashtrays, vending machines and vintage ads; after watching a fully operational bottling facility produce the magic liquid; and after sampling nearly 70 different sodas made by the company, I can readily testify: Coke is It. Coke, adding to all those slogans, must now be the only soft drink in the world with its own shrine: a tabernacle for the faithful, constructed by its creator. I cant compare the New World of Coca-Cola  as this 92,000-square-foot, $97 million museum calls itself  with the old (which opened in 1990 and closed in April, a month before this resurrection). But if you want to have a Coke and a smile, and you dont mind being engulfed by an enormous commercial (at $15 for adults), this museum offers its own puzzles and pleasures. It stands in Atlantas once-blighted downtown, on a 22-acre plot that the company purchased in the early 1990s. Coke donated nine of those acres for construction of the Georgia Aquarium, which opened next door in late 2005. Then, in October, the company announced it would donate 2.5 acres to the City of Atlanta for a civil- and human-rights museum. Nearby CNN offers tours of its headquarters. Media, liberty, fish and Coke. Maybe only fish spoils the composite image. But image is what this is all about, for as good as Coke is (and you are regularly told how extremely good it is), this mixture of caffeine, vanilla, cola, sugar and flavors (which are said to include oils of orange, nutmeg, cinnamon and coriander) would hardly be worth such devotion if there were not what is called in the marketing world added value. The added value comes from associations that have accumulated over the course of a century. This exhibition space is devoted to them. You enter by walking under a 27-foot-tall bottle of Coke that hovers in a 90-foot-high glass pillar; the walls glimmer like chipped ice and are made bracingly cold to the touch even on a 90-degree day. In the lobby one of the few misjudgments of tone can be found, as on the wall you read what seem to be corporate goals:  To Refresh the World, Mind and Spirit; To Inspire Moments of Optimism Through Our Brands and Our Actions; To Create Value. The business school homily is flat, off-putting, like soda without fizz. The problems persist in a welcoming film, a computer-animated commercial that is a frenetic paean to the company and its mission: Inside the Happiness Factory. Eccentric creatures speak with the voices of real employees, testifying to camaraderie and mission, promising happiness to all who are prepared to drink deep. It was only during these saccharine opening messages that I was apt to rebel. I recalled the controversies that dogged the company in the 1980s and 90s, from which it has been distancing itself in recent years. Was Coke fair back then to its African-American employees? Was it violating antitrust statutes in its aggressive attempt to control its independent bottlers? What about the Belgian contamination claims a few years ago? Or the overwhelming circumstantial evidence that Coke was originally made with cocaine  something the company denies? But no company, particularly one that thinks of itself as a happiness factory, should be expected to tout possible flaws. Anyway, soon enough comes a pause that refreshes: an enormous entrance hall through which you can move into different exhibition spaces. In one, a survey of Cokes presence in pop culture demonstrates the populist nature of Andy Warhols obsession. (A Coke is a Coke, he said, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.) There are videos showing collectors in Taiwan and Switzerland, whose private lairs are stocked with bottles and ephemera, all bearing the logo and promising ... what? Yes, what is being promised? In the drinks first decades its medicinal properties were featured; one early label calls it a Tonic and Nerve Stimulant. Then its formula and reputation were largely stripped of such associations, but Coke, still laced with caffeine, remained refreshing. Now, at the museum, nostalgia seems to flow freely; the main historical exhibition, Milestones of Refreshment, begins with an extraordinary onyx and alabaster soda fountain bar from 1880s Toomsboro, Ga., at which a statue of John S. Pemberton, the secret formulas inventor, holds aloft a bronze-colored glass of Coke. The objects in the display cases also come from that supposedly simpler era and its successors: a Coke calendar sporting a silent movie star, or a Norman Rockwell painting in which the soft drink gets pastoral product placement. 1 2 Next Page » The New World of Coca-Cola is at 121 Baker Street, Atlanta; (404) 676-5151.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/business/27coke.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Coca-Cola Bottler Improves Its Outlook<date>Published: July 27, 2007</date><text>Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler of Coca-Cola drinks, posted higher-than-expected quarterly profits yesterday and raised its full-year outlook, citing cost controls, price increases in North America and the weak dollar. Second-quarter net income fell 20 percent to $270 million, or 56 cents a share, from $339 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier, when a tax benefit improved results. Excluding revamping charges and other items, profit was 58 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting 55 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, which sells Coca-Cola drinks in Belgium, France, Britain and the Netherlands, said the weak dollar added 2 cents a share to earnings. Quarterly net operating revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $5.67 billion, as price increases offset volume declines. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bottles, sells and distributes more than three-quarters of the Coca-Cola drinks sold in North America, said it expected to earn $1.27 to $1.32 a share for the full year.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/business/25pepsico.html?ref=cocacolacompany">For Less-Active Athletes, a Low-Calorie Gatorade<date>Published: July 25, 2007</date><text>At a time of relatively sluggish sales and a profusion of new competitors, PepsiCo, the maker of Gatorade, said yesterday that it would introduce a lower-calorie version later in the year for athletes when they are not breaking a sweat. Volume growth of Gatorade, which commands 80 percent of the sports drink market, declined slightly in this quarter compared with the same period a year ago. By comparison, Powerade, from Coca-Cola, experienced double-digit volume growth during the second quarter. “There is certainly a movement towards no- and low-calorie beverages, so trying this new version of Gatorade is certainly at least worth a shot,” said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication. But he noted that a lower-calorie version of Powerade introduced a few years ago had not sold well. PepsiCo’s chairman and chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi, said consumers had consistently requested a lower-calorie version of Gatorade. While the drink is formulated for athletes while they are working out, she said the lower-calorie version would be marketed to athletes for use when they were less active. The new beverage will be released later this year. A recent survey of 2,500 adults by Goldman Sachs suggests that there is a market: 43 percent of those who reduced their consumption of Gatorade said they were concerned with calorie content. While Gatorade remains a huge seller, it is competing with an ever-growing list of competitors, from new sports drinks to bottled water and “enhanced” water with added ingredients to increase its nutritional value. Coca-Cola is aggressively trying to expand its noncarbonated portfolio. Last month, for instance, Coke acquired Glacéau, the maker of the popular VitaminWater, an enhanced water drink. Still, Ms. Nooyi predicted that the new lower-calorie sports drink would thrive because of the Gatorade name and the brand’s marketing prowess. “It will cut through the clutter, and people will know about it,” she said. The Gatorade announcement was made as PepsiCo announced stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, fueled by vigorous overseas sales of snacks and beverages. The company reported a 13 percent increase in profit compared with the same period last year, while earnings increased 15 percent, to 94 cents a share. Sales volume of beverages sold in Pepsi’s North American division declined, however. The decrease, less than 1 percent, was caused primarily by a 4 percent drop in soft drinks and by “modest” declines in Tropicana and Gatorade for the quarter, the company said in a release. PepsiCo’s shares closed down 33 cents yesterday at $66.26. More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/business/18coke.html?ref=cocacolacompany">Coke Exceeds Expectations for Quarter<date>Published: July 18, 2007</date><text>The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose more than analysts had expected as demand for Coca-Cola Zero soda and Dasani bottled water spurred the biggest sales increase in almost 13 years. Net income increased 0.8 percent, to $1.85 billion, or 80 cents a share, from $1.84 billion, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales rose 19 percent, to $7.73 billion, as consumers bought soda including Sprite in China and India as well as noncarbonated drinks like Powerade in Europe. In addition, the company introduced its no-calorie Coca-Cola Zero in more countries. “They’re pushing Coke Zero into Austria and Greece, and more established countries have done nicely for them,” said Pete Hastings, a fixed-income analyst at Morgan Keegan &amp; Company in Memphis. Coca-Cola said that soda case sales climbed 4 percent and that sales of noncarbonated beverages rose 12 percent as consumers drank more bottled water, tea and sports drinks. Coca-Cola gets about 80 percent of its revenue from soft drinks. Revenue was also helped by Coca-Cola’s acquisition of a Philippines bottler and by the dollar’s weakness against the euro. About 70 percent of the company’s sales are outside North America. Stock in Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, fell 68 cents, to $53.17 a share. Excluding reorganization and other one-time expenses for bottlers in which it owns stakes, the company earned 85 cents a share. Analysts had forecast a profit of 82 cents a share on revenue of $7.26 billion. Shipments in North America fell 2 percent, the fourth straight decline, on higher pricing and fewer purchases by bottlers. Soft drink volume fell 3 percent. Noncarbonated drinks like Powerade gained in sales, and sales of Coca-Cola Zero rose more than 10 percent, helped by the introduction of a cherry-flavored version. To bolster its operations outside the soda market, Coca-Cola bought Energy Brands for $4.1 billion in June, to add Glacéau Vitaminwater, Smartwater and Fruitwater.

When it comes to advertising on the mobile Web, though, they are treading carefully. On the one hand, executives and analysts said, online retailers are right to be cautious. After all, few consumers are buying items through their mobile devices. But at least some online retailers say they have found enticing success from early marketing efforts, as long as those initiatives are aimed at simply keeping themselves on the radar of customers as opposed to trying to prompt an immediate purchase or a visit to the companys Web site. Take Moosejaw Mountaineering, for example, an outdoor goods retailer based in Madison Heights, Mich. Earlier this year, Moosejaw began sending out text messages to more than 1,000 of its customers who had signed up to receive them. The campaign caught on quickly, with recipients often sending messages back to the retailer and receiving loyalty program points as a reward. A recent message sent to customers, for instance, conveyed the news that someone had told Robert Wolfe, one of Moosejaws founders, that he looked like Ben Stiller. It then asked customers whether that was a good thing and promised points in the companys rewards program for those who answered correctly (meaning yes). Sixty-six percent of the customers who received the message voted. Mr. Wolfe said he tested a text messaging campaign two years ago with his customers (largely college students and recent graduates), but messages were too costly to send and receive, so he abandoned the idea. Now, with cellphone service carriers offering unlimited texting plans, he thinks the time is right to try again. With our customer base, we have to be first to market with this type of stuff, he said. The content of the messages was, Mr. Wolfe said, in keeping with the companys mission to have as much fun as possible with our customers. The next contest will ask customers which Kelly they prefer, the one from Beverly Hills 90210 or the one from Saved by the Bell. We try to be as dumb as you can possibly be, he said. Mr. Wolfe said the campaign is helping sales, although he declined to say how much. In future versions of the texting campaign, he said, the company would take a page from past marketing initiatives and include coupon codes for those who reply. The logic of that approach, he said, may be lost on more mainstream e-commerce executives. We sent out a mailer once that said text us back for a coupon code to get a free Moosejaw T-shirt with any order, Mr. Wolfe said. A real Internet business person would say its a mistake to do that, because the customer has to receive the e-mail, get on the phone and text us, then wait for the reply to get the code, then go back to the computer to put in their order. We couldve just sent out a coupon code in an e-mail, Mr. Wolfe continued. But texting is cool enough that we were willing to risk some friction, knowing the upside was that people would talk about it in their dorm rooms. Mr. Wolfe said he would consider buying graphical advertisements for mobile Internet devices, but with the exception of iPhones, he said, screens are not sufficient to render ads effectively. Of the roughly 230 million Americans with cellphones, about half have used them to send or receive text messages, while only about 32 million use them to browse the Web, according to Greg Sterling, an analyst with the Internet consultancy Sterling Market Intelligence. Thirty two million is still a significant number, he said, but text is where most of the volume is. While e-commerce companies take their time exploring mobile advertising, some of the biggest offline marketers, like Visa, American Express and Coca-Cola, have been more aggressive. That is partly because online merchants typically pursue different goals with their marketing dollars than, say, consumer goods manufacturers, who chiefly want people to remember their brands when they shop at the supermarket. Online merchants, by contrast, try to generate purchases or Web site visits with their ads. The fact that big brand marketers are actually ahead of e-commerce companies in this respect is a big switch, said Thomas Burgess, chief executive of Third Screen Media, a mobile advertising technology company that is a subsidiary of AOLs Advertising.com. Its been the opposite of the early days of the Internet, he said. Only now, when were two and a half years into the real buying, are we seeing e-commerce companies come and say, This can drive traffic to our sites.  Online retailers with less technologically aware customers than those of , say, Moosejaw have ignored even text messaging as a marketing tool. William Strauss, chief executive of Provide Commerce, the parent company of, among others, the online flower seller ProFlowers, said he might consider a texting campaign like that used by Moosejaw if customers opted to receive the messages. But Id rather advertise in a more traditional place, where people drive by billboards or see it on the Internet, Mr. Strauss said. On a mobile phone, its on my ear, not in front of my eyes. Mr. Strauss said the iPhone could change that because of how well the devices screen displays Internet pages. All bets are off in terms of what behaviors the iPhone might create, he said. Its something well watch very closely. Whether it is from e-commerce companies or traditional marketers, consumers should expect more ads on their cellphones in the coming year, industry executives said. Membership in the Mobile Marketing Association, an industry trade group, has nearly doubled in the past year, to about 500 companies. And businesses like Third Screen and others have helped build the business infrastructure necessary to help marketers, publishers and cellphone carriers negotiate and mount advertising campaigns. This is going to ramp up much faster than the Internet did, said Mr. Sterling, of Sterling Market Intelligence. It took 10 years and the proliferation of broadband for marketers to do things online that were predicted early on. This will take half the time or less. More Articles in Business »</text></article>
