There’s an app for that. Many apps, in fact. In the past year, most major automobile insurance companies have developed applications for smartphones that allow motorists to document data about a crash and the people involved in it, photograph the damage, pinpoint the location via the phone’s GPS feature and, in some cases, initiate a claim. The iPhone interface for the Liberty Mutual Mobile Claims app. Many of the apps are for the iPhone but there are also apps for Android phones as well. Some allow customers to examine their policies, call up an insurance card and pay bills. “We are really pleased with the success of this, it’s an enhancement for our customers,” said Courtney Quinn, a spokeswoman for Liberty Mutual Insurance in Boston, in a telephone interview. That company unveiled its first accident app in October. “It helps us get accurate information and helps to process the claims,” Ms. Quinn said. The four-megabyte Liberty Mutual Mobile Claims app for the iPhone — as well as for iPads and the iPod touch — prompts a user to collect information that may have been neglected in the stress of the moment, and to record a voice memo about what happened. The app does not display the policyholder’s insurance card or policy information, however. A report issued last month by Key Lime Interactive, a consumer research firm, looked at apps from the country’s four largest auto insurers based on market share: Allstate Mobile, Geico GloveBox, Progressive and the State Farm Pocket Agent. The firm rated the Progressive app highest among iPhone-compatible services, while Allstate’s was rated best for Androids. “The tasks we identified as most important were the ability to document accident details, make bill payments, view policy details and get multiple estimates for new quotes,” said Eugenio Santiago, a researcher at the New York office of Key Lime Interactive, in a telephone interview. Some of the accident-focused apps also offer data on tow-truck services, car rentals and nearby hotels, as well as a button to dial 911 directly. Others bundle general maintenance and safety information. Allstate’s Good Hands Roadside Assistance app — available, as are most of these apps, to noncustomers as well — offers advice for dealing with an overheated engine or a dead battery. None of the apps, however, negate the need to file a police report if one is warranted.</text></article>

Allstate will buy Esurance, an online provider of auto insurance quotes, and Answer Financial, which provides quote comparisons from among 20 insurance companies, for $700 million “plus the tangible book value of the entities acquired at close.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release “Our strategy is to focus on individual preferences and utilize different value propositions for distinct consumer segments,” Thomas J. Wilson, Allstate’s chief executive, said in a statement. It would be Allstate’s biggest acquisition since 1999, when it bought the American Heritage Life Investment Corporation, a life insurance company specializing in the workplace, for $1.1 billion, according to Capital IQ data. White Mountains, a Bermuda-domiciled property and casualty insurer and reinsurance company, acquired a majority stake in Esurance for $60 million in 2000. Shares of White Mountains surged in trading on Wednesday. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is expected to close this fall.

Updated, 4:14 p.m. | Appearances sure can be deceptive. This video appears to show a heroic chain of events: a tractor-trailer overturns, terrifyingly, speeding around a curve on the Bronx approach to the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, crushing a van against the guardrail. Within a few seconds, a man in a black sport utility vehicle drives around the crash scene, parks in front of it, races out, checks on the drivers of both vehicles, runs back to his S.U.V., gets out some kind of implement and runs back to the truck to help other Samaritans extricate the driver from its overturned cab. But after the cameras stopped rolling last Sept. 22, the police say, the driver of the S.U.V., Gabriel Leon Hernandez, did something decidedly less heroic: falsely claimed that he was rear-ended by the truck, and got his insurer, Allstate, to pay $21,000 in medical bills and $1,200 for work on his Ford Expedition. Moments after the accident, he told the authorities that the truck had pushed his vehicle into the guard rail, the police said. Mr. Hernandez, 33, was arrested in front of his house in Soundview in the Bronx on the way to his construction job Wednesday morning and charged with insurance fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records, the police said. The police said that the driver of the truck suffered a broken arm and was out of work for two months, and that the driver of the car that got pinned to the guardrail was hospitalized for two days with neck and back injuries. The police said that Mr. Hernandez and his car really did undergo some if not all of the body work he billed Allstate for, but that it was for pre-existing injuries and damage, respectively. He had shoulder surgery shortly after the accident, said Lt. Edwin Martinez, head of the police department’s fraudulent-accident investigation squad. The police said that Mr. Hernandez had also hired a lawyer and initiated a lawsuit against the tractor-trailer’s insurer. When Mr. Hernandez was arrested, Lieutenant Martinez said, “he sort of implicated himself.” He added: “When he was shown the video by the arresting detective, he pretty much said that he hurt his shoulder while trying to remove one of the occupants of the car.” The police would not say whether they believed that claim.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/business/10insure.html?ref=allstatecorporation">Profits Fall for Major Life Insurers<date>Published: February 9, 2011</date><text>Major insurers posted mixed results on Wednesday as the Allstate Corporation fell short of estimates because of catastrophe-related losses, while the life insurers MetLife and Prudential Financial had stronger results, helped by returns on their annuity businesses.Allstate’s catastrophe losses rose 64 percent in the quarter compared with a year earlier. The company’s auto premiums also declined. The catastrophe-related losses had been expected as a result of the high number of storms late in the year, but had not been taken into account in market forecasts. While MetLife and Prudential reported smaller profits than a year ago, both managed to beat expectations. MetLife had record variable annuity sales and a 23 percent rise in retirement product fees. MetLife posted a net profit of $51 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $289 million, or 35 cents a share. Operating earnings were $1.14 a share, better than the $1.10 expected by analysts. MetLife said net income fell in the quarter because of a number of factors, including hedging related to its variable annuity business and higher amortization of costs related to its acquisition of new business. Stock in MetLife, which is based in New York, fell 87 cents, to $47.60 a share. Prudential reported a net profit of $213 million, or 45 cents a share, against a year-earlier profit of $1.79 billion, or $3.78 per share. Adjusted operating earnings were $1.78 a share. Analysts expected earnings of $1.48 a share for the period. Net profits sank on nearly $1 billion in realized losses and related adjustments, tied largely to the falling value of derivatives used in the company’s hedging programs. Prudential blamed fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies for the losses. Stock in Prudential, which is based in Newark, fell 88 cents, to $63.13 a share. Allstate had a net profit of $296 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $518 million, or 96 cents a share. Operating earnings of 50 cents fell short of the 88 cents expected by analysts. Allstate’s declines were tied mostly to the higher catastrophe losses and a rise in claims and claims expense, plus a jump in operating costs. Allstate’s chief executive, Thomas J. Wilson, said the company was still working to get the right pricing and customer mix in its homeowners’ operations. Stock in Allstate, which is based in Northbrook, Ill., fell 20 cents, to $32.36 a share. ”We still have a ways to go before we get a return on that business,” Mr. Wilson said in an interview, adding that he thought the goal was 12 to 18 months away.Major insurers posted mixed results on Wednesday as the Allstate Corporation fell short of estimates because of catastrophe-related losses, while the life insurers MetLife and Prudential Financial had stronger results, helped by returns on their annuity businesses.</text></article>

There’s a chance that those tow truck drivers will offer services at an extremely high price and or may keep your car hostage until you pay high towing and storage fees. A tow for a simple flat tire, for instance, could result in a $1,600 bill for towing and storage. The insurer Allstate recently issued a warning about the rise of such scams. It said its insurance adjusters frequently encountered these cases, which it called bandit tow scams, and offered tips to help consumers avoid falling victim to them. To be sure, Allstate has a vested interest in encouraging consumers to stay away from such tows because insurers may have to pay for such claims under drivers’ comprehensive or collision coverage. The fees, according to Allstate, can run up to thousands of dollars. “When Allstate pays claims for fraudulent charges, it can certainly impact the price of insurance for everyone,” said Christina Tyler Loznicka, a spokeswoman for the company.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/business/media/21adco.html?ref=allstatecorporation">Allstate Adds a Villain, With Car Insurance as the Hero<date>Published: June 21, 2010</date><text>THE executives at Allstate, known, after their familiar slogan, as “the ‘good hands’ people,” are adding a bad cop to their car advertising good cop.The actor Dean Winters, who plays dark characters in series like “Oz,” “Rescue Me” and “30 Rock,” will appear in an Allstate campaign as Mayhem, personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers. Teaser commercials that began on Friday are intended to pique curiosity for the campaign, which is likely to start in early July. Another Allstate pitchman, the actor Dennis Haysbert, has appeared in the insurer’s ads since 2003. Mr. Winters is on camera in the teaser commercials without Mr. Haysbert, but in a rough version of a spot that is part of the campaign, Mr. Haysbert is not seen; his voice is heard at the end. Allstate executives insist that Mr. Winters is not supplanting Mr. Haysbert, who, they say, is a “strong asset” for the company and will continue as its primary spokesman, appearing in new ads later in the summer. The same agency that creates the Haysbert ads — Leo Burnett in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe — is creating the Winters ads. The Mayhem campaign is meant to open a second front for Allstate in the insurance wars, say executives from Burnett and Allstate, to compete more effectively with price-oriented rivals like Geico. “The intense focus on price played well during the recession,” said Mark LaNeve, who joined the Allstate Corporation in Northbrook, Ill., as chief marketing officer in October. “But we’re sensing a return to value along the lines of ‘The company you do business with matters; you get what you pay for.’ ” Other marketers say they see similar shifts in consumer attitudes. “For many people, value isn’t just based on absolute price,” said Brad Casper, president and chief executive at the Henkel Consumer Goods division of the Henkel Corporation, whose products include home care and personal care. “Low price isn’t necessarily a good value if quality and performance are not where their expectations were.” Mr. Haysbert appears in some ads that challenge Allstate’s competitors, but is better known for uplifting image ads carrying themes like “That’s our stand.” For instance, Mr. Haysbert closed commercials during the Winter Olympics that invoked the 1933 inaugural address of Roosevelt by declaring, “Uncertainty will not rule our lives when we put our lives in good hands.” The Mayhem campaign will be “disruptive,” Mr. LaNeve said. “You need to experiment with new things.” The new character “tested unbelievably well across numerous targets,” he added, “including a young target.” Allstate joins a long list of insurers running more than one campaign at a time to stand out amid the clutter. For example, State Farm recently introduced a second campaign, featuring the actor Eddie Matos, which takes a feistier approach on the price front than its commercials carrying the theme “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.” Geico is running a half-dozen campaigns at once, including commercials with geckos, cavemen, a “googly eyes” character and celebrities like Charlie Daniels. “There are different mechanisms for different messaging,” Mr. LaNeve said, and using Mr. Haysbert’s voice at the end of the Mayhem commercials “will help brand the ads as Allstate.” The Mayhem campaign is part of efforts by Mr. LaNeve, who joined Allstate from General Motors, to reposition the company as selling not just insurance but also protection. That is underlined by what Mr. Haysbert says at the end of the rough commercial: “Dollar for dollar, nobody protects you from mayhem like Allstate.” Mayhem is a throwback to a kind of ad character that was once hugely popular: the bad guy who causes problems that the product being advertised solves. General Foods had a nefarious character, Mr. Coffee Nerves, in ads for its Postum grain beverage, who stood for the difficulties caused by the caffeine in coffee. Other examples include the Noid in ads for Domino’s Pizza, who symbolized how problematic it was to order from other chains, and the Spotmaker, who wreaked havoc inside dishwashers until banished by Calgonite. “I’m the key against your side door,” Mr. Winters, as Mayhem, says in a teaser commercial. “I’m a wild deer.” On screen these words appear: “Mayhem is coming. Are you in good hands?” In a second teaser, Mayhem says, “I’m the puppy that ate your back seat” and then spits out a piece of foam. In a third teaser, in which Mayhem drives a pink sport utility vehicle, he declares, “I’m a typical teenage girl,” then looks down at a mobile device, crashes into a car, tosses the device and drives off. “A good villain is a lovely thing,” said Jeanie Caggiano, executive vice president and executive creative director at Burnett. “Mayhem is a great way to take a shot at the competition, which you can’t really do if you’re Dennis.” The idea is that if “Dennis represents Allstate and everything that is protection, Mayhem is the opposite, uncertainty,” she added. “This guy’s trouble with a charming smile, and represents everything Allstate protects you from.” “With Mayhem, we’re striking back and saying: ‘Wait a minute, depending on what kind of mayhem you encounter, you may find yourself cheaped out from the coverage you might need’ ” without Allstate, Ms. Caggiano said. “You might pay a couple dollars more, but you also will get better coverage.” The Mayhem campaign could cause, well, mayhem for Allstate if consumers perceive that the popular Mr. Haysbert is being shown the door. In an article about Mr. Winters in The New York Post on Friday, the Mayhem campaign was described as “replacing ads that featured Dennis Haysbert.” Mr. LaNeve said, “We’re not dropping” Mr. Haysbert, adding, “We’ll continue to run some current Dennis work and do some new work with Dennis on the dollar-for-dollar value positioning.” Ms. Caggiano said: “Good advertising invites you into the brand. Dennis does it one way, Mayhem does it another.” As the Mayhem campaign gets under way, Mr. LaNeve said, Allstate plans to “substantially” increase ad spending for the rest of the year. Its ad spending in the first quarter totaled $85.9 million, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, up 23.7 percent from the $69.4 million spent in the same period a year earlier.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E2D7163DF936A15750C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=allstatecorporation">ADVERTISING; With a Little Star Power, the Top Brass Ask for Ideas<date>Published: March 25, 2010</date><text>EXECUTIVES at Allstate, known, after their famous slogan, as ''the 'good hands' people,'' are looking for a few good advertising ideas -- and are making that clear in attention-getting fashion. Three top managers of the Allstate Corporation came to New York from the company's Northbrook, Ill., headquarters to make a presentation to senior sales executives from dozens of major media companies. They were joined by a surprise guest: Dennis Haysbert, the actor and Allstate spokesman. The message, delivered by the Allstate leaders on Wednesday under the title ''The New State of Allstate,'' was this: Help us advertise more effectively by developing, for all types of media, better ways to tell consumers that Allstate sells protection, not just insurance. To encourage the submission of ideas, Allstate is setting up a Web site (AllstateIdeaPortal.com) to which potential media partners can send proposals. The meeting, at the Jazz at Lincoln Center Theater at the Time Warner Center, drew an estimated 200 sales executives from the likes of AOL, BET, CNN, Discovery Communications, ESPN, Google, NBC, The New York Times, Parade, Rainbow Media Holdings, Time Inc., Univision and The Wall Street Journal. Senior managers from the longtime Allstate agencies in Chicago that are part of the Publicis Groupe -- Leo Burnett, for creative, and Starcom, for media -- were also present. The meeting was not unprecedented, in that marketers like Ford Motor, General Motors, I.B.M., Nike and Unilever have made similar presentations. But it was out of the ordinary because of how far up on the organizational charts of Allstate and the media outlets those who attended could be found. The executives from Allstate making the 90-minute presentation were Thomas J. Wilson, chairman, president and chief executive; Mark LaNeve, who joined Allstate in October as chief marketing officer from G.M., where he had been vice president for sales, service and marketing; and Lisa Cochrane, vice president for marketing. ''Rarely do you have the senior-level involvement and orchestration that Allstate had this morning,'' said one media executive there, David S. Morris, chief client officer at CBS Interactive, part of the CBS Corporation. Another attendee, Dave Kupiec, said, ''What really struck me is that even though there were 200 people in the room, you felt you were getting to know the personalities of the people running the company and, by default, the company.'' Even the participation of Mr. Haysbert worked, said Mr. Kupiec, executive vice president for sales and marketing at National CineMedia in New York. ''It could have been hokey,'' he said, but it became ''another way to bring us into the building of the Allstate brand.'' Within an hour of returning to his office, Mr. Kupiec said, he and staff members in New York and Chicago were brainstorming ad ideas for Allstate. Allstate spent almost $273.6 million to advertise in major media last year, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP. That is less than rivals in the intensely competitive insurance category, among them Geico, Progressive and State Farm. One reason ad spending in the category has increased an estimated 125 percent in the last five years, to more than $3 billion, is to overcome the fact that insurance is a ''low engagement'' purchase for consumers, Mr. Wilson said, compared with something like the AppleiPad. ''If we launch a new product, we don't see people lining up at the door,'' he added. Another reason there are so many insurance ads is a price war that has broken out, particularly for automotive policies, during the economic downturn. Allstate's goal is to ''fight the commoditization'' of insurance, said Susan Credle, chief creative officer at Burnett, and use marketing to increase sales and market share rather than wooing customers interested in ''cheaping out'' their insurance purchases. As part of what Mr. Wilson called Allstate's ''desire to win,'' he said the company was looking for ways to ''take risk'' in approaching consumers, adding, in a reference to his principal business, ''We've got billions of dollars of risk every day.'' Mr. LaNeve illustrated that with an anecdote about an initiative at Allstate -- an Insights, Design and Innovation Center to develop additional products the company could sell. Mr. LaNeve said he told Mr. Wilson he was worried about the cost, and Mr. Wilson replied, ''We had a hailstorm in Indianapolis last week that cost us 60 million bucks. Don't sweat it.'' ''At Allstate, we want to be known in your circles as the company where good ideas win and get funded,'' Mr. LaNeve said. To stimulate the audience, the attendees got a sneak peek at a coming television commercial for Allstate on the issue of driving while distracted. The spot promotes a section of the Allstate Web site (allstate.com/xthetext) devoted to urging the public to ''delete text driving.'' ''We are holding it back,'' Ms. Cochrane said of the spot, ''for a special partnership'' with a media company. That the commercial was made for television does not mean Allstate is not interested in ideas for other media, she added, because ''Allstate needs to be everywhere with the consumer.'' Examples included Web video, sports sponsorships, smartphone applications, social media, online ads and print ads. Mr. Haysbert's role in the presentation included some jokes, a discussion of his acting career and intoning, with his inimitable delivery, the current Allstate slogan, ''Are you in good hands?'' Asked afterward how he became involved with Allstate, Mr. Haysbert said one reason was, ''My parents have been Allstate customers for 51 years.'' Mr. LaNeve said the last celebrity he worked with before Mr. Haysbert was Tiger Woods, who for many years was the Buick spokesman for G.M. ''Obviously, Dennis has worked out a lot better than that deal,'' Mr. LaNeve said, laughing.

The department said the Hartford Financial Services Group, Prudential Financial, Lincoln National, Allstate, Ameriprise and Principal Financial Group have all received approval for capital infusions, subject to terms still to be negotiated. The Hartford, in a statement released late Thursday, said it was told it could receive $3.4 billion under the program. Applying for the additional capital ''was a prudent step for the Hartford, particularly given the continued economic uncertainty,'' said Ramani Ayer, the company's chairman and chief executive. ''These funds would further fortify our capital resources and provide us with additional financial flexibility during one of the most volatile market climates in our nation's history,'' Mr. Ayer continued. The other companies did not immediately provide details about the status of their application. Under the program, each company is eligible to receive investments worth up to 3 percent of its total assets. Based on the Treasury formula, the amount of capital available to the other companies would be at least several billion dollars each. While the extension of additional capital to insurers had been widely expected, these are the first companies that have been identified to receive aid after the near-collapse of American International Group. According to the Treasury spokesman, Andrew Williams, these insurers qualified for capital infusions under the department's Capital Purchase Program because each had restructured itself as a bank holding company and met the November deadline for the program. Hundreds of other financial institutions are still in the pipeline for review and will be approved on a rolling basis, the Treasury Department said. As the financial crisis erupted last fall, A.I.G. became the first insurer to receive substantial government aid before a broad-based program to help financial firms was established. Its problems stemmed from complex derivatives that greatly increased its obligations to its trading partners. This recent group of insurers is far less troubled than A.I.G., but they still have been hurt by the collapse in real estate prices. Amid the housing boom, many insurers invested in complex mortgage-related securities that have since turned sour, weakening their balance sheets. Indeed, several insurance companies took extraordinary steps to qualify for taxpayer money, which has become even more attractive as the economic environment has worsened. For example, Lincoln National and the Hartford both bought up smaller banks to qualify as savings banks, which made them eligible for government support. The insurers followed investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which received emergency waivers from the Federal Reserve to become bank holding companies last fall. GMAC, the auto lender, and American Express, the credit card company, also have transformed themselves into banks to qualify for government support. ''You want the regulatory program to be as broad as possible,'' said Scott E. Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Roundtable, a group of the nation's biggest financial services companies. ''If all it took was regulatory gymnastics, that expands the program.'' The Capital Purchase Program is part of the sweeping bailout of financial institutions that grew out of the panic that hit in mid-September. At that time, the Treasury Department, with the backing of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, asked Congress for $700 billion to buy up mortgage-backed securities whose value had dropped sharply or had become impossible to sell, in what he called the Troubled Asset Rescue Plan, or TARP. As the financial crisis worsened, the TARP plan was modified and expanded to include various support programs set up by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, ranging from an ad hoc temporary guarantee program for money market funds to the purchase of preferred shares in various financial institutions.</text></article>

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/fashion/14secretary.html?ref=allstatecorporation">Atop Capital’s Guest Lists, an Outsider<date>Published: December 12, 2008</date><text>The holiday bash at the Phillips Collection art museum last week brimmed with bubbly and bold-faced names. But party people in the know breezed past the senators and television personalities to hover around a striking, willowy woman with a shimmering Oscar de la Renta dress and an unfamiliar face. The woman was Desirée Rogers, the 49-year-old Chicago corporate executive and civic leader who streaked to the top of this city’s A-list last month when President-elect Barack Obama announced that she would take on the role of social secretary in his White House. Ms. Rogers, an Obama fund-raiser and an executive at Allstate Financial, will oversee every White House social event from Easter egg hunts to lavish state dinners (along with those oh-so-important guest lists). An invitation to make her acquaintance has quickly become one of the most coveted accouterments among the political elite. Ms. Rogers will be the country’s first black presidential social secretary when she settles into the East Wing in January. And the requests for her presence at exclusive social events here are already streaming in. After eight years of the Bush administration’s early-to-bed presidency, Washington hostesses are hoping the Obamas will revitalize political night life. “She’s going to get invitations hourly, truly,” said Ann Stock, who served as social secretary during the Clinton administration and dined last month with Ms. Rogers. “This is an historic moment and you have tremendous interest in the White House right now,” added Ms. Stock, a vice president of the Kennedy Center. “She really is, if you will, the face of the new administration.” Originally from New Orleans, Ms. Rogers has an M.B.A. from Harvard, a philanthropic bent, a penchant for designer fashions, a diverse and powerful group of friends and a reputation for stylish entertaining in her Gold Coast condominium. Her name appears regularly in the society pages in Chicago, where she is a fixture at fund-raising galas and is on a first-name basis with the city’s politicians, corporate executives and cultural leaders. She is a registered Democrat who has often reached across the political aisle, working as the Illinois lottery chief for the Republican Gov. Jim Edgar in the 1990s and contributing $2,000 to President’s Bush re-election campaign and $1,000 to his Democratic rival, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, federal election records show. (In the most recent election, she focused on the Democrats, raising $100,000 to $200,000 for Mr. Obama and personally contributing thousands to other candidates, the records show.) She is a well-known businesswoman who ran Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, a $1.1 billion utility in Chicago, from 2004 until June of this year, when she became president of a unit of Allstate Financial. And she is so fashion savvy — favorite designers include Isabel Toledo, Valentino and Carolina Herrera — that she was profiled in 2004 by Vogue, which praised her as “proving that executive and chic can coexist.” Still, Ms. Rogers knows little of the ways of Washington. Some former Bush administration officials say that will be a considerable disadvantage, at least initially, for someone who needs to navigate the complex and often stratified social landscape here. (Since President Clinton was elected in 1992, all of the social secretaries have had White House experience.) Ms. Rogers’s friends acknowledge that she will face something of a learning curve. “You’re going into a place where you don’t really know anybody,” said Linda Johnson Rice, head of the Chicago publishing company that owns Ebony and Jet magazines. “But she knows politicians in Chicago and she knows politics,” Ms. Johnson Rice said. “She’ll translate that to Washington.” Hailing from Chicago certainly has its advantages. Ms. Rogers has known Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for more than a decade. She is close friends with Valerie Jarrett, a member of Mr. Obama’s inner circle, and recently hosted Ms. Jarrett’s 52nd birthday party. (Special touches: orchids and yellow cake with chocolate icing.) Ms. Rogers’s ex-husband, John W. Rogers Jr., chief executive of Ariel Capital Management, which oversees $16 billion in investments, played basketball at Princeton with Mrs. Obama’s brother, Craig Robinson. The Obamas have said they would like to open the White House to Americans from all walks of life, and friends of Ms. Rogers say no one can do that better than she. Over the years, she has mingled easily with people like the opera singer Plácido Domingo and Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago as well as ordinary people there and in New Orleans, where her mother ran a preschool and her father was the popular athletic director for the city’s public schools. “I’ve not seen a world in which she’s not comfortable,” said David Mosena, president of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, where Ms. Rogers serves as a trustee along with other prominent executives. She certainly has a flair for the unconventional. How many White House social secretaries can say they regularly hosted a lottery game show on local television, as Ms. Rogers did in the 1990s? (This was one of her efforts to promote the state lottery she was running.) How many have appeared at $1,000-a-ticket fund-raisers for inner-city schools in black short-shorts, a white tuxedo jacket and sky-high sandals? (The answer to both questions: none, until now.) In New Orleans, Ms. Rogers has also garnered the distinction of twice being named Zulu Queen of Mardi Gras, one of the city’s highest civic honors. (The Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club is the city’s most prominent black social organization.) And folks in Chicago say she can certainly throw a party. In January, Ms. Rogers hosted a $1,000-a-ticket fund-raiser for Mr. Obama. She expected about 400 people; 600 showed up. “She knows everybody, and she knows what people like,” said Kevin Bell, president of the Lincoln Park Zoo, who consults regularly with Ms. Rogers on the guest list and theme of the zoo’s annual fund-raising gala. Now, Ms. Rogers needs to learn Washington. She declined to comment for this article, but Obama transition officials said that in recent weeks she had been meeting former social secretaries, expanding her Rolodex, attending a handful of social functions and reading about previous administrations. (Her book list includes several about the Kennedy White House and “An Invitation to the White House,” by Hillary Rodham Clinton.) “What we really want to do is incite some wonder, some joy, some celebration,” Ms. Rogers said last month. “You will definitely see new things.” Sally Quinn, the Washington writer and socialite who met Ms. Rogers last week at the Phillips Collection party, said she believed her appointment meant that the Obamas would take socializing seriously and use it as a diplomatic tool. But Ms. Rogers has quite a job ahead, Ms. Quinn warned. The White House social secretary must turn down requests from powerful people, who are often dying for a seat at the president’s table. “She’s going to have to have nerves of steel,” Ms. Quinn said. </text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: American International Group Inc. Add to Portfolio American International Group Go to your Portfolio » The additional assistance is on top of $85 billion in a bridge loan that the Federal Reserve extended to A.I.G. in September, but it will take a different form. A spokesman for A.I.G., Nicholas Ashooh, said the new assistance was intended to keep the company from having to draw down the Fed loan so quickly. The Fed threw A.I.G. the $85 billion lifeline shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when the financial markets were reeling and there were doubts the system could weather the demise of another big financial services company. At the time, the Fed’s loan was the most radical intervention ever by the central bank in a company’s affairs. Even as A.I.G. now works through a major overhaul, the rest of the insurance industry is still struggling with the continuing turmoil in the financial markets. Shares of MetLife, the nation’s largest life insurer, fell 27 percent on Wednesday to close at $27 a share after the company said its third-quarter earnings would be down significantly from a year ago and that it had to raise new capital. Its earnings were hurt by lower investment returns, lower fees on variable annuities, and losses on its investments in troubled companies like Lehman Brothers, A.I.G. and Washington Mutual. MetLife offered 75 million shares at $26.50 a share on Wednesday. The Allstate Corporation’s stock fell 21 percent on Wednesday amid investor concern that it, too, would have to raise new capital. The Hartford Financial Services Group said this week that it would raise $2.5 billion. The bailout of A.I.G. has not gone smoothly. Shares were greatly diluted by the Fed’s original move, and investors have been asking why they were not allowed to vote on the terms of the bailout. Then the company surprised analysts last week by disclosing that it had already drawn down $61 billion of the Fed loan. The speed of the drawdown led credit analysts to downgrade some of its debt and put other types of its debt on negative credit watch, signaling that other downgrades were possible. This week, former A.I.G. executives were questioned by members of Congress, who wanted to know whether Goldman Sachs and other business partners had benefited from the bailout. Goldman Sachs has said that it had no meaningful exposure to losses from A.I.G. A.I.G. said Wednesday that it would use the $37.8 billion from the Fed to improve the liquidity of its securities lending business, which is losing cash rapidly. By stopping that flow, A.I.G. said, it would be able to preserve more of the Fed loan and use that money more effectively to wind down the affairs of A.I.G.’s troubled structured finance division, known as the financial products unit. Under the latest agreement, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will accept up to $37.8 billion of fixed-income securities from A.I.G.’s regulated life insurance subsidiaries and will give the subsidiaries cash collateral in return. That will help the insurance subsidiaries to settle existing transactions in their securities lending business. In that business, the insurers lent securities to investors, like hedge funds, and received both the value of the securities and a fee in return. The insurers then invested those funds in other instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities. But now that the value of mortgage-backed securities has plummeted, A.I.G.’s insurance subsidiaries do not have the money to repay their securities-lending partners when they bring back the securities they borrowed and want their money back. By stepping in and permitting A.I.G. to lend the securities onward to the New York Fed, the Fed will allow A.I.G. to preserve cash. It will also keep A.I.G. from having to mark down the value of the securities at a time when their market value is constantly changing. The central bank said that the new program would help A.I.G. use cash more effectively and provide enhanced credit protection to the taxpayers, who stand behind the $85 billion loan.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Allstate Insurance Co Go to your Portfolio » Hurricane Katrina, three years ago, represented the industry’s single largest insured loss ever. Companies paid $41 billion in property losses, and the government’s flood insurance program paid an additional $18 billion. Analysts say Gustav’s punishing blow to the Louisiana coastline Monday will cost nowhere near as much  partly because the storm appeared weaker than Katrina and partly because of the hard lessons the region learned three years ago. Eqecat, a company that models risk, estimated on Monday that losses from Gustav could range from $6 billion to $10 billion. In the wake of Katrina, major insurance companies reduced their exposure to hurricanes by sharply raising premiums, adjusting the insured value of homes, and declining to insure some coastal properties. Property owners affected by Gustav will find themselves paying more out of pocket as a result. Katrina, a Category 3 storm at landfall, resulted in 1.2 million homeowner claims and 500,000 commercial claims. Gustav, a Category 2 storm at landfall, was “not a comparable event,” Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, and industry trade group, said. Perhaps remembering the public relations shellacking that the industry received three years ago, insurance companies prepared for Gustav  and eagerly promoted their groundwork  well in advance of the storm. State Farm, one of the top insurers in Louisiana, said that 1,700 “catastrophe claims specialists” were moving into the region. To a degree not possible in the aftermath of Katrina, they will be connected to their home offices using satellite-equipped vehicles and wireless-enabled laptop computers. Allstate, another leading insurer in the state, said it had activated more than 1,000 claims adjusters and 15 “mobile response units” ahead of the storm. The industry is still grappling with what was a painful surprise for some homeowners in the wake of Katrina: the fact that standard property insurance does not cover flood damage. Some residents of the Gulf Coast did not have separate flood insurance. Mr. Hartwig said Katrina and two other hurricanes in 2005, Rita and Wilma, prompted a significant rise in sales of flood insurance policies. (The number of flood insurance policies in Louisiana increased substantially, from 385,000 in 2005 to 499,000 in 2007, according to the National Flood Insurance Program.) But up to 25 percent of the policies purchased following Katrina were not renewed by the policy-holder in the second year, Mr. Hartwig said. “There is the potential for some complacency to have settled in,” he said. “By and large, though, the people of the Gulf Coast are far more aware” than they were three years ago. Some homeowners challenged insurers’ coverage decisions in court, and the companies were widely perceived as having tried to escape liability for flood damage. Some Katrina-related lawsuits still linger, said Donald Thorpe, a senior insurance analyst for the credit agency Fitch Ratings. But the industry’s position has largely been upheld. “It was a lesson for the insurance industry that it’s not really good for business to have a large number of unhappy customers who don’t understand their coverage,” Mr. Thorpe said. “I definitely see an effort underway to improve that.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 2, 2008, on page C8 of the New York edition.Insurance adjusters had good reason to feel unsettled before Gustav washed ashore Monday.

But up to 25 percent of the policies purchased following Katrina were not renewed by the policy-holder in the second year, Mr. Hartwig said. “There is the potential for some complacency to have settled in,” he said. “By and large, though, the people of the Gulf Coast are far more aware” than they were three years ago. Some homeowners challenged insurers’ coverage decisions in court, and the companies were widely perceived as having tried to escape liability for flood damage. Some Katrina-related lawsuits still linger, said Donald Thorpe, a senior insurance analyst for the credit agency Fitch Ratings. But the industry’s position has largely been upheld. “It was a lesson for the insurance industry that it’s not really good for business to have a large number of unhappy customers who don’t understand their coverage,” Mr. Thorpe said. “I definitely see an effort underway to improve that.”</text></article>

But to corporate America, they are marketing opportunities. More then 170 major corporations -- including Google, Best Buy, Pfizer, FedEx, Allstate, AT&amp;T and Hewlett-Packard -- are spending millions of dollars at the two conventions to promote their brands and their political agendas, creating a trade-show atmosphere away from the podium. General Motors, for example, is providing 700 hybrid and flex-fuel cars as the ''official vehicle provider'' to shuttle politicians around. To show off just how ''flex'' some of these vehicles are, G.M. has teamed with the Molson-Coors Brewing Company to power cars with ''waste beer,'' or beer that is damaged during production and turned into ethanol. Beer and driving usually do not mix. But this unusual combination is part of the automaker's effort to establish its ''green'' bona fides at a time when G.M. and other Detroit automakers are seeking financial support from Congress to build more fuel-efficient vehicles. ''Given the white-hot attention to the conventions,'' said Greg Martin, a G.M. spokesman, ''this is a good chance to showcase our vehicles to a wide range of delegates and opinion leaders whose influence extends beyond Washington and their communities.'' AT&amp;T set up in the parking lot of the Pepsi Center in Denver to give conventiongoers a chance to try out the new iPhone. Coca-Cola was handing out Dasani water to people standing in security lines at Invesco Field. Union Pacific has a new hybrid locomotive on display, part of a 30-car fleet it is using for parties at both conventions. A Minneapolis company that makes a fire retardant called FoamPro will have six fire trucks emblazoned with an elephant logo at the Republican convention. ''For companies, conventions are an attractive place to be,'' said Giovanna Torchio, director of business development at Jack Morton Worldwide, a marketing agency. ''You have a concentrated group that have multiple roles and share a passion.'' Major corporations help bankroll the conventions, too. A total of $112 million in private money was raised through the sale of sponsorships by host committees at both conventions to finance them. This compares to $16 million in federal money available to each venue to cover convention costs. (Each venue receives an additional $50 million in federal antiterrorist money, but it is earmarked to pay for security.) Donations to the host committees are tax deductible, and they come with a promise of political access that is harder to come by under new ethics rules passed by Congress last year. Corporations are banned from making direct political contributions, but they can write six- and seven-figure checks and receive V.I.P. credentials to the convention floor, invitations to private events with members of Congress, and space to set up logo-plastered booths at convention events. (They can even put their logo on key cards at the hotels where delegates are staying.) The companies also see the conventions as good networking opportunities with other businesses, and a chance to provide story fodder to the 15,000 members of the news media. Most companies at the conventions are already skilled Washington hands. A report from the Campaign Finance Institute, a Washington nonprofit organization that studies money and politics, found that the 173 donors to the host committees -- mostly corporations but also several trade unions -- have contributed $180 million to federal candidates and spent $1.3 billion in lobbying federal officials since 2005. At both conventions, the biggest corporate presence is Qwest, which has donated $6 million in telecommunications services to each host committee and is the ''official telecommunications provider.'' The company's chief executive, Edward A. Mueller, hosted an invitation-only reception at the Denver Art Museum.</text></article>

The insurer, based in Northbrook, Ill., said profits for the January-through-March period were $348 million, or 62 cents a share, down from $1.5 billion, or $2.41 a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $8.1 billion, down from $9.3 billion in the first quarter of 2007. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting earnings of $1.63 a share on revenue of $8.87 billion. Allstate had $568 million in catastrophe losses for the quarter from tornadoes and other severe winter weather across the country. Catastrophes are defined as events generating more than $1 million in claims to a company.

It said it raised the average rate for standard auto policies by 4.5 percent and for homeowners by 10.9 percent in the states where rates were approved. Despite the increases, property-liability premiums written declined 1.4 percent from a year earlier because of the higher cost of catastrophe reinsurance.

Skip to next paragraph Related Video Clips From Garage TV: Clip 1 | Clip 2 | Clip 3 Enlarge This Image An Allstate campaign features agents astride their motorcycles, in riding gear rather than business attire. Case in point, the Allstate Insurance Corporation, which has embarked on the second phase of a major campaign intended to build market share among motorcycle riders. The new initiative is centered on an elaborate microsite, or special Web site, under the name Allstate Garage. The campaign, which also includes print and banner ads along with promotional events, is from the longtime Allstate creative agency, Leo Burnett in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe. The budget for the campaign is estimated at $10 million. The campaign seeks to build on an effort that began last year, aimed at forging closer ties with the owners of the estimated 9 million motorcycles that are registered in this country. “We’re focusing on the customers,” says Maria McNitt, assistant vice president for integrated marketing communications at Allstate in Northbrook, Ill., “how they think of the role that motorcycles play in their lives and how we can make sure to connect with those customers.” “This is probably the most significant effort we’ve ever had,” she adds, “to create awareness that Allstate sells motorcycle insurance.” Allstate believes that it has only a single-digit percentage of the motorcycle insurance market, Ms. McNitt says, behind competitors like Progressive, which ranks first, and State Farm. Geico, whose massive spending has set off a war in the auto insurance market, is also devoting a large portion of its ad budget to motorcycles. Motorcycle sales are increasing as baby boomers, and women in various age brackets, become more interested in riding. “With the growth in the category, we want to go out and get our fair share,” Ms. McNitt says, especially of the 1.5 million Americans who own motorcycles and are already use Allstate for other kinds of insurance. The growth in the popularity of motorcycles is evidenced not only in the rising number of campaigns for motorcycle insurance but also in the rising number of motorcycle safety campaigns, meant to address the rising death rates among riders in motorcycle crashes. For instance, Minnesotans are being introduced to a campaign for 2008-9 that carries the theme “Go high-viz,” for high visibility, which addresses data showing that about half of all motorcycle accidents take place because other drivers do not see the motorcyclists. The “high-viz” campaign is being created internally by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, with assistance from the Minnesota Motorcycle Safety Advisory Committee and others. The campaign includes colorful posters and a Web site. The Allstate campaign started in 2007 with a series of striking print ads that feature some of the more than 600 Allstate agents who ride motorcycles (out of a total of what Allstate calls its 14,900 exclusive agencies and financial representatives). The ads show the agents, male and female, astride their motorcycles, in riding gear rather than business attire. The words “This is an Allstate agent” are splashed across the center of each photograph. “Our agents don’t just write motorcycle polices,” the text of the ads starts, “they ride motorcycles.” That sentence is also used as the headline for a print ad that presents 14 motorcycle-riding Allstate agents displayed across two pages. The message is that “our agents ‘speak bike,’ ” Ms. McNitt says, “that we can help protect your bike and the riders as well.” Also last year, an event known as the Allstate Mobile Garage Tour made its way around the country in a collaboration between Burnett and Octagon, a sports-marketing agency that is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The tour offered people who attended motorcycle rallies a chance to learn about motorcycle design and safety  and of course the opportunity to talk to an Allstate agent about motorcycle insurance. This year, the stops the tour will make are being more than doubled, to 14 from 6, visiting rallies in states that include Florida, Michigan, New York and Texas. The print ads are back this year, too, along with banner ads on about 50 Web sites, which include americanrider.com, ridermagazine.com and triumphrat.net. There are sound effects with some banner ads, which “play the pipes” of five motorcycles. The star of the 2007 effort is allstategarage.com, intended to offer enough content to tempt motorcycle riders off their bikes and in front of their keyboards. The Web site is “more of an experiential place,” Ms. McNitt says, “where customers could go to find out more about our products and have a little fun.” The features on Allstate Garage include a tool, “Plan a Ride,” which uses satellite imaging and mapping from Google. Visitors can create routes, compare their plans with the favorite trips posted by other computer users or choose from a list of scenic routes. Another feature on the Web site is “Build a Bike,” a 12-step process by which computer users can create motorcycles and upload the images to a gallery. There is also a calendar of coming local and national rallies and other events, video clips under the name “Garage TV” and safety tips. Oh, yes, there are also sections to get quotes on rates for motorcycle insurance and find Allstate agents. “The average user is spending six to nine minutes on the site,” says Mikal Pittman, a motorcycle rider who is a vice president and creative director at Burnett in Chicago. “It’s opening a lot of doors for us.” So far, he adds, “Plan a Ride is a hot section.” The video clips in the “Build a Bike” section, Mr. Pittman says, are from an actual bike shop, Indian Larry Legacy in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. “We spent a couple days there, filming them building a bike,” he adds. “It adds some authenticity to the site.” Indeed.

The company, Allstate Floridian Insurance, “faces the very real risk of being wiped out in the event of a bad hurricane season,” said Joseph Richardson Jr., chairman and chief executive. Allstate Floridian is a subsidiary of the Allstate Insurance Company. The testimony came on the first day of a two-day hearing into the soaring costs of Florida hurricane insurance, which has become one of the most pressing concerns for homeowners here. Executives from Nationwide Insurance Company of Florida also appeared before the Senate panel, the Select Committee on Property Insurance Accountability, and officials from two other companies were scheduled to testify on Tuesday. The hearings are the latest clash in a yearlong battle between the state and the insurance industry. After the devastating hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, insurance companies complained that they were suffering huge cost increases because of the rising prices of reinsurance, the coverage they buy for catastrophic events. In response, state lawmakers passed legislation early last year intended to lower costs for insurance companies by doubling the state’s reinsurance program, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, the pool of money that insurers can draw from to pay claims from major storms. The fund’s expansion enabled the state to provide reinsurance at lower prices than those offered by commercial reinsurers. Legislators expected the companies to pass those savings on to policyholders, especially since the last two hurricane seasons have been relatively uneventful. But over all, the companies have not reduced their rates as much as state officials expected, and some have tried to increase their rates, including Allstate. State officials have rejected all the latest requests for rate increases. On Jan. 17, Kevin M. McCarty, the state’s insurance commissioner, banned Allstate and its affiliates from selling new insurance policies in the state after the company failed to turn over records to state officials investigating insurance pricing. A state appeals court blocked the order, pending Allstate’s appeal. On Monday, Gov. Charlie Crist, in an interview from New York where he was campaigning for Senator John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination, said the pressure on the insurance industry appeared to have begun to force rates down. But, Mr. Crist said: “I still think that some in the property insurance industry in Florida have been outrageously greedy and have not conducted themselves with a corporate ethic that would make their mothers proud. How much money do they need?” At Monday’s hearings, the insurance executives were questioned under oath, and the proceedings were broadcast on a state-run cable channel. In their defense, Allstate executives said the hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 had nearly bankrupted their company and several other insurers. Mr. Richardson, of Allstate Floridian, said his company had paid out about $1 billion more in claims in those two years than it made in premiums. Only a bailout by its parent company saved it from bankruptcy, he said. He also said the company was bracing for an increase in destructive hurricane activity because of rising ocean temperatures, a possibility that the state’s hurricane loss projection models do not take into account. “Prudent business judgment dictates that this increased risk of hurricane formation should be taken into consideration in determining the appropriate rate for the risk being insured,” he said. During Allstate’s four hours of testimony, the senators repeatedly expressed frustration with the insurance executives’ answers. “I haven’t seen so much bobbing and weaving since Muhammad Ali did the rope-a-dope,” said State Senator Bill Posey, a Republican from Rockledge.

A Song for Car Insurance Makes the Charts<date>Published: December 31, 2007</date><text>It would be unremarkable that the song “From Where You Are” by Jason Wade, a singer in the band Lifehouse, had cracked the Billboard top 100 list  except that it was written for an Allstate commercial. Unavailable on any album, the song has received little airplay on the radio but it had wide exposure in a 60-second Allstate spot promoting the insurance company’s safe driving program for teenagers. The commercial first ran after an episode of “Friday Night Lights” on NBC in late October that had a teenage driving theme. On Nov. 6, “From Where You Are” was made available on iTunes, where it sold briskly enough to hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts for the week ended Nov. 24. It fell to No. 100 for the week ended Dec. 8. By all accounts, “From Where You Are,” a melancholy ballad inspired by Mr. Wade’s experience of having a teenage friend who died after falling asleep at the wheel, is the first commercial jingle in years to make the charts, and certainly the first to do so on the strength of Internet downloads. “We’re in a different age,” said Silvio Pietroluongo, associate director for charts at Billboard. “For something to have charted before, you really needed significant airplay or for the record label to release it as a single. It’s easy now for someone to post something on iTunes and have it sell enough to make it onto the chart.” Digital sales have counted toward Billboard rankings since February 2005. Other songs written expressly for commercials that have made the charts include “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony)” for Coke, which reached No. 7 in the United States in 1972 after it was reworked to remove the brand references. Reaching further back, the T-Bones had a hit in 1966 with a remake of “No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach’s In),” from an Alka-Seltzer commercial. Mr. Wade wrote the song after viewing a copy of the commercial sent to him by Leo Burnett, an agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe. “I was skeptical at first because I’d never written for a commercial before,” he said in a telephone interview. “But then I saw it and was really moved. I watched it 30 or 40 times and wrote the song that night.” The commercial features a long line of cars filled with teenagers driving over a horizon. The voice-over says, “Every year, nearly 6,000 teenagers go out for a drive and never come back. Just talking to them can change that.” More Articles in Business »It would be unremarkable that the song “From Where You Are” by Jason Wade, a singer in the band Lifehouse, had cracked the Billboard top 100 list  except that it was written for an Allstate commercial.

Foti Jr., is suing the state’s largest property insurance companies, accusing them of conspiring to limit payments to policyholders after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and engaging in an elaborate price-fixing scheme. Mr. Foti’s wide-ranging lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a state court in New Orleans, claims that Allstate, State Farm Fire and Casualty and other insurers worked together to manipulate damage estimates and offer reduced claims payments after the 2005 hurricanes. The lawsuit claims the companies coerced policyholders into settling damage claims for less than their actual value by editing engineering reports, delaying payments and forcing policyholders to go to court to challenge the estimates. In Mississippi, Judge Michael T. Parker of Federal District Court extended on Wednesday a restraining order that prevents that state’s attorney general, Jim Hood, from continuing a criminal investigation into State Farm’s handling of Hurricane Katrina claims, a company spokesman said. State Farm sued Mr. Hood in September to keep him from reopening a criminal case or continuing grand jury hearings over charges that the company fraudulently handled policyholders’ claims after Katrina. In addition to State Farm and Allstate, the Louisiana lawsuit names Lafayette Insurance, USAA Casualty Insurance, Farmers Insurance Exchange, Standard Fire Insurance and several companies that worked with the insurers on handling claims after Katrina and Rita. A State Farm spokesman, Phil Supple, said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on Mr. Foti’s accusations, but he defended the company’s handling of Katrina claims. “At State Farm, each claim is handled individually, and we pay what we owe based on our contract with our policyholders,” Mr. Supple said. An Allstate spokesman, Michael Siemienas, also said he had not seen the lawsuit and would have no immediate comment. Robert Hartwig, president of the industry-financed Insurance Information Institute in New York, called it “ludicrous” to accuse companies of engaging in any kind of conspiracy. “Insurers operate independently from one another,” he said. “They do not act in concert with each other under any circumstances.” The Louisiana insurance commissioner, Jim Donelon, who was briefed on the lawsuit by an aide, said Mr. Foti was obligated to sue if he found evidence of collusion between the companies.

But this summer, Katrina reached them, too, in the form of a cancellation letter from their home-insurance company. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Northeast Hurricanes City Room Blog The latest news and reader discussions from around the five boroughs and the region. Go to City Room » The letter said that hurricane events over the past two years had forced the company to limit its exposure to further losses; and that because the Grays home on Long Island was near the Atlantic Ocean  it is 12 miles from the coast and has been touched by rampaging waters only once, when the upstairs bathtub overflowed  their 30-year-old policy was nonrenewed, or canceled. The Grays signed with a new company, but their case attracted the attention of consumer advocates and, in turn, the New York insurance commissioner, Eric R. Dinallo. Mr. Dinallos sharp rebuke last month of the Grays company, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, reflected a shift in how public officials view a new reality in the homeowners insurance business, advocates say. In the last three years, more than three million homeowners have received letters like the Grays as insurance companies, determined to avoid another $40 billion Katrina bill, have essentially begun to redraw the outline of the eastern United States somewhere west of the Appalachian Trail. Public officials in Southern states from Florida to Texas have been fighting insurance carriers for years over rising rates and withdrawal of services, but officials in the Northeast have only recently joined the fray. Companies including Allstate, State Farm and Liberty Mutual have nonrenewed policies not only in hurricane-battered places like Florida and Louisiana, but in New York and other Northern states that have not seen hurricanes in years. Since last year, Allstate has turned down all new homeowners insurance business in New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts and the eight downstate counties of New York. An independent insurance agents group puts the Grays among about 50,000 residents of the New York metropolitan area  and about one million homeowners in the Mid-Atlantic and New England states  whose policies have been canceled since 2004. While most homeowners have been able to find coverage with other major insurers, or with smaller companies, in most cases it is at higher rates and with larger deductibles. The companies say they are obliged to avoid undue risks where they see them, and to remain solvent. Considering what happened between 2003 and 2005, said Robert P. Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry lobbying group, and considering that the best meteorological minds are telling us that for the next 15 to 20 years hurricane activity will be heavier than normal, if we didnt do something to reduce our exposure, wed be out of business. In response to a growing torrent of complaints, state officials and lawmakers have lately begun to push back, if gingerly, against the industry, which they see as overreacting to the hurricane threat in the Northeast. My concern is that this situation is being manipulated by the insurance companies in order for them to get higher rates, said State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, who calls the cancellation of policies in his eastern Long Island district more than a problem  it is a crisis. Mr. Dinallo, the commissioner, has focused his attention on the law: It was a single line in the Liberty Mutual letter sent to the Grays that prompted him to issue his rebuke. The line noted that one consideration in dropping their policy was that they did not have car insurance with the company. That, Mr. Dinallo said, is illegal. Predicating one policy on another, or so-called tie-in business, is a violation of state insurance law, he said. Liberty Mutual said the tie-in was a secondary issue, but in response to Mr. Dinallos warning, Liberty Mutual and the largest insurer in the state, Allstate, agreed to stop the practice. Earlier this year, Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, also challenged insurers tactics, subpoenaing records from nine insurance companies that were requiring homeowners to install storm shutters if they wanted to keep their policies. The insurers are making record profits, Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview, and the dire predictions of disastrous hurricanes, fortunately, have been very wrong  fortunately for everyone, including the insurers. Meanwhile, heated public hearings were held this year in the Rhode Island General Assembly about the lack of homeowners insurance in coastal areas, which include most of the state. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: October 18, 2007 A front-page article on Tuesday about the cancellation of several million homeowners insurance policies in the Northeast over the last three years because of insurers hurricane fears referred incorrectly to the actions of two insurers, State Farm and Liberty Mutual.

The two biggest companies, Allstate and State Farm, which provide nearly 35 percent of the insurance on American homes, are seeking legislation that would offer the same kind of program for hurricanes and other natural disasters as the government now promises to provide to commercial insurers in a future terrorism attack. The details are still being worked out, but the insurers and their supporters in Congress are talking about state and federal support kicking in after the industry has paid the first $4.5 billion in damage, compared with the first $25 billion in a terror attack. Three Florida lawmakers  two Republicans and a Democrat  have introduced federal legislation that would greatly reduce the risk for home insurers and, they say, make insurance on homes in vulnerable areas more affordable and more available. But opponents, including a number of other insurance companies, say that the government should not be in the business of bailing out insurance companies for their losses and that any such program would mostly benefit homeowners along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts at the expense of residents elsewhere in the country. They argue that lowering premiums may send the wrong signal to people on the coasts and encourage further construction in vulnerable areas, resulting in higher payouts for insurance and disaster relief. People should understand the risk they face, said Julie A. Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association, a large industry group. The industry managed to handle $61.8 billion in losses from Hurricane Katrina and other storms in 2005 and to come back strong this year with record earnings in the first nine months. But the insurers say that was only because they have been pushing up prices along the coasts and reducing their potential losses by refusing to renew policies or to sell new coverage to hundreds of thousands of homeowners along the coasts. The insurers say they also have been doing exceptionally well on auto insurance and investment gains. And they have had a stroke of luck. After a streak of heavy storm activity, this year was strikingly mild for hurricanes. Not one hurricane has hit the United States and none are expected before the season ends on Nov. 30. But insurers say that they cannot count on such good fortune in future years. It is not clear how much momentum the legislation has. The two Republican sponsors in the House  Ginny Brown-Waite, from a small town near the gulf coast of Florida, and E. Clay Shaw Jr. from south Florida  have the endorsement of 30 colleagues, including 12 Democrats. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat who is a former Florida insurance commissioner, has introduced matching legislation in the Senate. The elections in November could shift control of at least one house of Congress to the Democrats. But Allstate and its allies say support for the program is growing in both parties. The lawmakers supporting the legislation say it would provide relief to hundreds of thousands of homeowners in Florida. With no other alternative, the homeowners have had to buy coverage from a state insurance agency that charges above-average prices and provides bare-bones coverage. Allstate and State Farm, which write a big share of the policies for coverage on the coasts, say that without government help their prices will have to go higher and that, to protect themselves, they will be forced to cut back coverage even more on the coasts. But several other insurance companies, which have lighter concentrations of coverage on the coasts and are in less danger of overwhelming losses from hurricanes, say they would rather the government stay out of their business. Those insurers say they prefer to continue trying to persuade state regulators to drop their restraints on pricing and to permit them to keep raising premiums to reflect the accurate potential for losses. The insurers also want to be able to continue to be free to decide whether to provide coverage or not. Some industry experts say the insurers also fear that a drive for federal backing for hurricane insurance could backfire and threaten the terrorism insurance program. It is scheduled to expire at the end of 2007 and needs Congressional endorsement to continue. Many companies sell both commercial and home insurance. Under a federal hurricane insurance program, insurers would probably be forced to offer coverage to everyone, no matter how high the risk of major claims, as is required under the program on terrorism insurance. Speaking against federal hurricane coverage, Joseph Annotti, a spokesman for a trade group with more than 1,000 insurance companies as members, said, We generally favor a free-market approach. Allstate is the largest member of Mr. Annottis organization, the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. But Mr. Annotti said the association differed with Allstate on this issue. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Even as profits on home insurance are soaring, some of the nations big insurers are turning to Washington in a bid to gain protection against future catastrophic losses.

Under a federal hurricane insurance program, insurers would probably be forced to offer coverage to everyone, no matter how high the risk of major claims, as is required under the program on terrorism insurance. Speaking against federal hurricane coverage, Joseph Annotti, a spokesman for a trade group with more than 1,000 insurance companies as members, said, We generally favor a free-market approach. Allstate is the largest member of Mr. Annottis organization, the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. But Mr. Annotti said the association differed with Allstate on this issue. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Allstate had been arguing for years that the case was groundless and should be dismissed. In the decision, Federal District Judge E. Richard Webber said that lawyers for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had presented strong enough evidence of discrimination that “a reasonable jury could find” that Allstate violated anti-discrimination laws. He said that in arguing for a dismissal, Allstate had “not presented sufficient evidence to rebut this claim.” The judge said that the government would have to prove in court that Allstate had acted improperly. The judge did not set a date for a trial, but government lawyers said the timing of a trial could be part of a conference with both sides that he has scheduled for today. Michael J. Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate, said that the company’s treatment of its agents was appropriate and legal. “We continue to believe our agent reorganization program was lawful and did not discriminate against any individual because of age or any other factor,” he said. “We’re disappointed with the judge’s ruling.” Felix Miller, a senior trial lawyer for the E.E.O.C., said that government lawyers “fully expect to be able to prove” that Allstate’s policy was improper. Allstate agents began complaining to the federal agency of age discrimination shortly after the company decided in 1999 to dismiss nearly 6,500 career agents and offer them jobs as independent contractors. The agents said that 94 percent of those dismissed were 40 years old or older. The E.E.O.C. determined in September 2000 that the insurer had violated anti-discrimination laws by requiring those agents who chose to become independent contractors to sign a wavier promising that they would not sue the company. Employment lawyers said companies may require such waivers, but not as a condition of future employment. The agency said the waiver was a form of illegal retaliation. Negotiations between the E.E.O.C. and Allstate over the compensation of the agents broke down and the agency filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the company in late 2001. The agents had already filed their own civil lawsuit in August of that year contending that Allstate had illegally stripped them of employee benefits and pushed them out because of their age. Allstate denied the assertions. A federal judge in Philadelphia combined the two lawsuits, and that case is still pending. Two years ago the government agency filed the age discrimination lawsuit that Judge Webber ruled on yesterday. Robert Johnson, the lawyer in charge of the E.E.O.C.’s St. Louis office, said the judge’s decision “was a landmark ruling in the development of age discrimination law.” In an interview, Mr. Johnson said it was would be one of the first cases to go to trial after a United States Supreme Court decision last year that broadened the basis for age discrimination claims.

Analysts said the results were a harbinger for a record performance by the property casualty insurance industry in 2006. The company, the second-largest home and auto insurer after State Farm, said it earned $1.16 billion, in contrast to a loss of $1.5 billion for the same quarter last year after Hurricane Katrina and other storms destroyed or damaged more than 300,000 homes and businesses insured by Allstate. “It’s a big rebound,” said Adam Klauber, an analyst at Cochran Caronia Waller, an investment bank in Chicago. Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of Allstate, said in an interview that strong results were producing excess cash and that Allstate was buying back $3 billion of its shares. Such a step often increases share value. Allstate’s stock closed down 19 cents at $63.30 yesterday. But that was a 14 percent increase from $55.75 on Aug. 1, when the industry’s share prices began rising as fears of a bad hurricane season began to ease. On average, property insurance stocks were up 10 percent yesterday from Aug. 1, Mr. Klauber said. Insurance experts said last week that they expected record profits of $60 billion for the industry in 2006, up from $43 billion in 2005 even after paying for damage in Hurricane Katrina and other storms. The insurers ended 2005 with a big gain because of strong investment earnings and exceptional profits on auto insurance, workers’ compensation, general liability and coverage on homes away from the coasts. Allstate was the first property insurer to report third-quarter results. Over the next month, 40 property insurers are scheduled to report profits, said Brian Meredith, an analyst at UBS Securities. “You’re going to have very, very big earnings from the companies,” he said. Allstate reported an annual profit in 2005 of $1.8 billion, mostly because of strong earnings on auto insurance, said Kevin Callahan, a portfolio manager at Century Funds in Boston, which owns 40,000 shares of Allstate. Mr. Liddy said he expected record annual earnings for Allstate in 2006 of $4.8 billion to $5 billion  about the same as Allstate’s losses from hurricanes in 2005. Altogether, property insurers paid out $61 billion for hurricane damage in 2005. Allstate and other insurers raised prices along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico after heavy hurricane losses in 2004 and 2005 and forecasts for this year of about a dozen hurricanes. The worst storm has been Tropical Storm Ernesto, which reached hurricane strength briefly over water but hit land in Florida in late August with winds well below hurricane force. No major storms are expected in the remaining six weeks of the hurricane season. Prices for coverage for many coastal properties have tripled and quadrupled. Some have risen to more than 10 times higher than last year. But analysts said they expected little or no declines and perhaps some increases because forecasters were still predicting another decade of powerful hurricanes. Allstate has led home insurers in combining price increases with cuts in coverage along the coasts. In Florida alone, Allstate has refused to renew 215,000 policies. It is not renewing nearly 40,000 policies in New York. Consumer advocates say prices on the coasts are excessive. “Insurers like Allstate are using last year’s catastrophes as an excuse to jack up rates and, at the same time, cut back coverage,” said Birny Birnbaum, the executive director of the Center for Economic Justice in Austin, Tex.

First, experts began predicting last year that the East Coast was at a higher than normal risk of being hit by a major hurricane in 2006. Then, in January, the largest homeowners' insurance company in downstate New York, Allstate, announced it would not write new policies for single-family homes and would not renew some policies. Two months later, the Rand Corporation sounded its own alarm, saying that half the homes in some of the nation's most flood-prone areas, including the Northeast, were not covered by flood insurance. Then, starting in late June, towns along the Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers were inundated when record rains led the rivers to overflow their banks. And it's not over yet. Three months remain in the hurricane season, which peaks from August through October. Residents left scrambling to find homeowners' coverage in Allstate's wake are learning that other insurers are also retreating from coastal areas and that those still writing policies are charging higher premiums. Homeowners' insurance, which is required to obtain a mortgage, does not cover damage from floods, only from wind and other effects of hurricanes, such as fallen trees. Federal flood insurance -- where it is available -- covers a house's structure for nominal premiums but charges extra to cover the contents. And private flood insurance costs more. Experts say too many residents remain misinformed about the availability of flood insurance or have insufficient coverage. Ask Robert and Cathy Berg, of Lambertville, N.J. Their house on the Delaware River has been flooded three times in 22 months. Last year, they had no flood insurance and sustained $30,000 in damage, Mrs. Berg said. This year, they obtained flood insurance -- but not enough. Retirees on a fixed income, the Bergs opted for a $5,000 deductible, which reduced the premium, but when their house was flooded again this month, they received a check from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, through which they had bought the insurance, for just $175, Mrs. Berg said. ''Now you tell me: What was the point of getting insurance?'' she asked. Gerard Brown, the owner of an insurance agency in Lindenhurst, on Long Island, said that FEMA caps coverage in both high- and low-risk flood zones at $250,000 for a house and $100,000 for its contents. In the highest-risk zones, like Long Beach, N.Y., the maximum coverage with a $1,000 deductible would cost $2,350 a year, but that could be reduced to $600 or less for properties above a minimum specified elevation, Mr. Brown said. Additional insurance is available through private companies, Mr. Brown said, but not for waterfront properties. Where it is available, he said, ''it's not cheap.'' Howard Mills, the New York state superintendent of insurance, said the results of the Rand study illustrated, alarmingly, the federal program's greatest problem -- too few homeowners who are required by their mortgage holders to have flood insurance or who should have it are buying it. ''I've spent a significant amount of time talking about the need, but it's a very difficult sell,'' Mr. Mills said. At least a month before the Susquehanna overflowed its banks earlier this summer, New York began requiring insurance agents to talk to prospective and current customers about the need for flood insurance and to have them sign a waiver if they declined coverage. ''Availability is not the problem,'' Mr. Mills said. ''Getting people to buy coverage is.'' Those who buy homeowners' policies, as distinct from flood insurance, may find themselves paying more as the insurance industry tries to regroup after hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma and Dennis. Those storms contributed to a record-breaking $53 billion in losses for the insurance industry last year, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. Allstate alone reported $4.7 billion in losses during the third quarter of 2005. As a result, seeking to curtail the financial risks posed by a future catastrophe and deciding its greatest risk was in downstate New York, Allstate stopped writing new policies there in January. The company held a 26 percent share of the market in those eight counties -- Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and the five New York City boroughs.</text></article>

The one that turns up in sentences like "I'll get a new car if  and that's a big if  I get a raise"? Now, a leading marketer of life insurance is using a colossal-size version of the conditional. The campaign, now getting under way, is for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, known as MetLife, one of the largest American life insurers. Besides television and newspapers, the campaign will extend to the Internet (metlife.com), cartoons and sweepstakes  not to mention onto the sides of the two MetLife blimps, Snoopy I and Snoopy II, that criss-cross the country. The effort is the latest in a barrage from marketers of all types of insurance, which includes new ads from Genworth Financial, Liberty Mutual and Travelers as well as continuing promotions from Aflac, Allstate, Geico and State Farm. MetLife has a budget estimated at more than $30 million, an increase from the estimated $22 million spent on other recent campaigns. Foote Cone &amp; Belding in New York, one of the two principal MetLife agencies, is creating the campaign. The ads are the first change in themes for Met Life in six years. The previous theme, "Have You Met Life Today," still appears, but only tucked into corners of ads, not unlike some vestigial organ. The new theme is "Guarantees for the If in Life," which is being abbreviated on the sides of the blimps as "For the If in Life"  presumably because the word "Guarantees" is long enough to require a blimp or two of its own. Beth Hirschhorn, chief marketing officer at MetLife in New York, said the theme was intended to address an important change in the market for life and health insurance that was uncovered by consumer research. "Pretty much at the heart of this campaign is that Americans are feeling a greater financial burden on themselves," Ms. Hirschhorn said. "Even when the 'macro' indicators don't look too bad, consumers are feeling worse than they have been." The reason is that "they are very aware of the erosion of traditional safety nets," she said. "They know they can't rely in retirement on government, employers or the stock market the way they used to.""MetLife is playing the part of a partner to help people create their own personal safety nets." That argument is made pointedly in the initial elements of the campaign. "Let's bring today's financial uncertainties down to size," says the headline of one ad. The headline of another ad says reassuringly, "Replace today's uncertainties with guarantees." The narrator in the first television commercial, which runs 60 seconds, declares: "If. For such a small word, it packs a wallop. We all have our personal ifs." Among them, she says, is wondering "if Social Security isn't enough" for a retirement nest egg. " 'If' can hold you back," the narrator asserts, then pivots in a positive direction, adding: "Or 'if' can propel you forward. We believe 'if' should never hold you back." Thomas Ordahl, a partner at Group 1066 in New York, a corporate identity consulting company, said the focus on uncertainty made sense. "The insurance industry was built on the promise of mitigating the risks in life, although in the past it was mostly the everyday, ordinary risks of death, house burning down, being laid up in the hospital for months," Mr. Ordahl said. "This campaign targets more abstract modern fears: being laid off, taking care of older parents, living to 100," he added. "What was the promise of protecting you from life's catastrophes has now becoming protecting you from life's anxieties." In other words, Mr. Ordahl said, "postmodernism hits the insurance industry." Foote Cone, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, shares the MetLife agency roster with Y&amp;R Advertising in New York, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam Brands unit of the WPP Group. Y&amp;R Advertising typically creates campaigns aimed at consumers and Foote Cone typically creates business-to-business campaigns, centered on employee benefits. The Foote Cone interactive unit, FCBi, works on Web sites for MetLife and the MetLife Bank. (metlifebank.com). "We're close to this issue because on employee benefits, consumers ask, 'What can I expect from my employer?' " after retiring, said Kim Corrigan, executive vice president and director for client services at Foote Cone. The campaign is not only aimed at baby boomers who are nearing retirement, Ms. Corrigan said, but also is "casting a much wider net" to reach "the younger generation that knows they don't have the safety net and can't count on others for the future." Bringing up the ifs in life, as in the daunting risks, could be counterproductive for MetLife because it may stimulate fear in consumers that leads to inertia rather than action, like learning more about MetLife policies and products. To address that, Ms. Corrigan said, the campaign takes the approach that "there will always be an 'if' in 'life,' some wonderful, some challenging, and in today's world, managing the 'ifs' in life is more important than ever." "It's not to say Met Life is going to solve every if," she added, but by working with customers to design their safety nets, "the value proposition is that Met Life is helping you manage through the uncertainties with guarantees." Snoopy and Woodstock, the Peanuts characters that have appeared in MetLife ads for decades, are part of the new campaign. For instance, Snoopy, dressed as his alter ego, the World War I flying ace who chases the Red Baron over the skies of Europe, appears on the blimps. Another Peanuts connection is made in the television commercials, which use a new orchestral arrangement of "Linus and Lucy," music written by Vince Guaraldi for the 1965 animated TV show "A Charlie Brown Christmas." In addition to consumers getting a look at the campaign on television, in newspapers and online, "there is an internal component" for MetLife employees, Ms. Hirschhorn said, meant to inform them about and build their enthusiasm for the new approach. Among the elements still to come, she added, are the cartoons, which will appear as ads in The New Yorker magazine; ads aimed at Congress and so-called thought leaders, which will run in publications like The Hill, Roll Call and The Washington Post; and promotions like contests and sweepstakes. More Articles in Business »YOU know that "big if" everyone is always talking about? The one that turns up in sentences like "I'll get a new car if  and that's a big if  I get a raise"? Now, a leading marketer of life insurance is using a colossal-size version of the conditional. The campaign, now getting under way, is for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, known as MetLife, one of the largest American life insurers. Besides television and newspapers, the campaign will extend to the Internet (metlife.com), cartoons and sweepstakes  not to mention onto the sides of the two MetLife blimps, Snoopy I and Snoopy II, that criss-cross the country. The effort is the latest in a barrage from marketers of all types of insurance, which includes new ads from Genworth Financial, Liberty Mutual and Travelers as well as continuing promotions from Aflac, Allstate, Geico and State Farm. MetLife has a budget estimated at more than $30 million, an increase from the estimated $22 million spent on other recent campaigns. Foote Cone &amp; Belding in New York, one of the two principal MetLife agencies, is creating the campaign. The ads are the first change in themes for Met Life in six years. The previous theme, "Have You Met Life Today," still appears, but only tucked into corners of ads, not unlike some vestigial organ. The new theme is "Guarantees for the If in Life," which is being abbreviated on the sides of the blimps as "For the If in Life"  presumably because the word "Guarantees" is long enough to require a blimp or two of its own.

Skip to next paragraph From top, Irwin Thompson/The Dallas Morning News, via Associated Press; Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters; Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press Multimedia Graphic: Changing the Geography of Insurance Rates Enlarge this Image Rick Friedman for The New York Times Insurance premiums on Cape Cod are going up, if the homeowners are lucky enough to keep their policies. Not so for the owners of homes on the coast from Texas as far north as Cape Cod  their premiums are going up, if they are lucky enough to keep their policies. Call it the Katrina effect. As the nation's home insurers prepare for an expected onslaught of powerful hurricanes over the next decade or so, they are trying to woo new customers in the heartland of America, where hurricanes rarely if ever tread, to make up for lost revenue from the tens of thousands of customers they are abandoning on the coasts. Rates have begun to drop in the Midwest and West, and insurance experts say they expect the trend to spread across most of the interior of the country. Allstate, for example, has cut rates in Michigan by an average of 16.5 percent in the last six months and lowered rates in Montana by 14.8 percent. But in places like Long Island and Cape Cod as well as the coasts in the Southeast, insurers are doubling prices for some customers and refusing to sell new policies or renew old ones. Recently, State Farm, the largest home insurer, sought an increase averaging 71 percent for home insurance in Florida. The insurers have been raising prices and cutting back coverage for homes in Florida and the Gulf Coast for years. But now, they have begun to apply the same measures in coastal areas that have not experienced a devastating storm in decades. "The insurers simply can't bet the entire farm on insuring the coastal areas," said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. They "are looking to the rest of the country as an opportunity for profitability." The changes are the most sweeping in the home insurance business in decades. For the first time, the insurers are effectively creating a two-zone system, with homeowners along the coast struggling to get coverage at any price while those inland choose the least expensive among competing offers. The insurers' measures are infuriating consumer advocates, who say the cutbacks and price increases are unnecessary. "They're overreacting," said J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. The risk suddenly seems greater to the insurers, Mr. Hunter said, partly because they have begun to base their calculations on short-term projections rather than long-range weather patterns. "They're supposed to bring stability, but that's not happening," Mr. Hunter said. "They're putting short-term profits ahead of people. It's because of hurricanes. But some people haven't had a hurricane for years and they're being dumped. That's not right." Until recently, it would not have occurred to the insurers to look inland for profits because they were losing money on home insurance everywhere. In fact, home insurance used to be sold as a loss-leader to attract customers for more lucrative auto insurance. But after a surge in fraudulent claims pushed auto insurance into the red, the insurers decided to overhaul the two lines of coverage. So, in the last few years, the home insurers raised rates and reduced benefits all across the country. Claims fell in many places, according to Jeff Rieder, the president of the Ward Group, a national insurance consulting company in Cincinnati, as some customers chose policies with higher deductibles to offset the increased prices. Also, he said, some homeowners decided not to file claims for routine damage, worried that their policies might not be renewed. Now, home insurers are making money everywhere but in hurricane territory. Auto insurance is also doing well. So strong has the home insurance business become that the insurers ended 2004 with a profit, even after $15 billion in hurricane losses. The losses from Hurricane Katrina and other storms in 2005 were almost double, $28 billion, and still, insurance experts say, the business is expected to show a profit. Mr. Hartwig of the Insurance Information Institute said about half the hurricane losses were covered by reinsurance that insurers bought to protect themselves. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Business »Homeowners in Michigan have been getting some surprising news lately from their insurance companies  their premiums are going down as insurers fight for their business.

The company, Allstate Insurance Group of Northbrook, Ill., said it planned to reduce its business in coastal areas vulnerable to what the company described as the increased danger of a devastating hurricane. Allstate said it would not write new policies and would decline to renew some old policies about to expire in New York. As a result, tens of thousands of Allstate policyholders will eventually have to find a new insurance company, some of them beginning as early as May. ''We have made a very, very difficult decision to manage our exposure by reducing our market share,'' Brian Pozzi, an Allstate regional counsel, said in an interview. Joseph Enright, who owns a five-bedroom house in Flatbush, Brooklyn, said is scrambling to find a new carrier before his Allstate policy expires in May. ''We're inland,'' he said. ''It would take quite a tidal wave to reach us.'' But his house is near the Prospect Park lake and, according to the city's Office of Emergency Management, is only a block away from a ''surge zone'' during a major hurricane. The last truly devastating hurricane to ravage the region was a 1938 storm, known as the Long Island Express, that crossed over Long Island and into New England, killing about 600 people in the United States. Like Hurricane Katrina, it was a Category 3 storm at landfall. Scientists say such powerful hurricanes are more likely to occur in the Northeast as Atlantic waters continue to warm. New York's top insurance regulator responded angrily to Allstate's decision. ''We are condemning this action in no uncertain terms,'' said Howard Mills, the state superintendent of insurance. ''We feel they took this action prematurely. This is a sudden action.'' Because of a technicality, however, regulators can do little about it. According to Allstate, fewer than 40,000 of the company's million policyholders in New York will be affected by the company's decision. That falls below the 4 percent threshold that gives regulators the legal authority to demand from Allstate a written plan and possibly to order changes. Last year, Allstate issued $5 billion in hurricane-related payouts, the company said. The spate of hurricanes has led many insurance companies to stop renewing policies in areas of Florida and the Gulf region. In New York, Allstate is the largest provider of consumer insurance, including auto and other policies. It has a 26 percent market share in the city's five boroughs and Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, lobbied Allstate officials last month to retain policyholders. ''Allstate, you're serenading us, you're waltzing us, you romance us, but Brooklyn is not a cheap date,'' he said in an interview yesterday. ''You want to break up with us, it's not going to be so easy.'' Allstate competitors say that, for now, they are open for business and do not plan to seek higher premiums. But that, too, could change, said Meryl Golden, general manager for Liberty Mutual Insurance's northeast region. ''Certainly the return on investment for a customer on the coast is different from that of a customer in Albany,'' she said. ''Ultimately, we may need to raise rates.'' Allstate said it hopes to help customers obtain coverage from other insurance companies. Nonrenewal will ''depend on where your home is located, what your home is made of, how old it is, your claim history,'' Mr. Pozzi said. In testimony at before the Department of Insurance last month, Mr. Pozzi said hurricanes like the Long Island Express tend to return on a regular schedule of about 68 years. The Long Island Express hit in 1938, exactly 68 years ago this year.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Lori Waselchuk for The New York Times James Lee Witt's disaster consulting firm has landed contracts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. HOW TO HELP A partial list of relief organizations and other information on the Web. YOUR STORY Share your experiences via e-mail or in this forum. Soon after the storm hit, the State of Louisiana signed up with Witt Associates, a disaster consulting firm. Within days, Mr. Witt had become a fixture at the state's emergency operations center in Baton Rouge, advising the governor and sleeping in a trailer. He even figured out a way for FEMA to reimburse the state for his firm's fees, which the company estimates at $4 million to $6 million over the next year. In Mississippi, Witt Associates swung into action to assist employees of Pinnacle Entertainment, whose Casino Magic Biloxi had been blown off its moorings and into a parking lot. Days later in New York, Mr. Witt appeared at a news conference with another client, the Allstate Corporation, to promote creation of a catastrophe fund to ease the financial burden on insurers. In rushing into trouble when others were running away, Mr. Witt displayed the energy that won him wide praise for his service as the nation's top emergency official - and the nickname Master of Disaster. The much-criticized performance of FEMA after Hurricane Katrina hit has only enhanced his reputation. But as he applies his skills as a consultant, Mr. Witt is having to step deftly to avoid being perceived as a disaster profiteer. "I just don't want anyone to say that we used this as a way to profit or to try to get new business," he said. "I just don't want that." In Louisiana, he cut his usual hourly fee to $275 from $500 for the no-bid state contract and declined to take on any other business there, despite what his partners say are numerous requests. Just one day after his news conference with Allstate, he backed away from his lobbying work for the insurer to avoid conflicts with his advisory role to the state. Mr. Witt is hardly the first insider to trade on his government experience. Administration officials generally are barred from lobbying their former agency for one year after leaving. Still, some critics find Mr. Witt's business troubling. "James Lee Witt is giving his seal of approval to some companies, and I question whether that is appropriate as you leave government," said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, which studies government contracts. "He is lending his credibility as a public official to help companies advance in Washington." Thanks to his résumé and his Rolodex, Mr. Witt - his friends call him James Lee - has taken a once-obscure area of expertise and turned it into a multimillion-dollar business. He has turned his old job on its head, now advising others on how to deal with the agency he once led. "It's all been built on relationships." Mr. Witt, 61, said in an interview. "People know who you are and they trust you." Former President Bill Clinton helped enlist as partners former Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Gen. Wesley Clark, the former NATO supreme commander and Democratic presidential candidate. Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin reviewed the business plan. Former Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said he put in a good word for Mr. Witt with Louisiana officials. And former FEMA officials, with their own networks of contacts, are on his payroll. Started in 2001 with a $300,000 loan and a borrowed office, Mr. Witt's business has grown to include 25 employees and had revenues of about $7 million last year. Nextel, the telecommunications giant, hired him to market its products to safety officials, while the Whelen Engineering Company, which makes sirens, paid him to push for FEMA regulations that would benefit the company. His client list includes universities and cities seeking help on disaster plans. The World Bank and the State Department have hired him as a consultant at $1,000 a day. He is also paid $300,000 as the chief executive of the International Code Council, a nonprofit organization that promotes stronger building codes. "James Lee Witt brings to the table a track record of success," said Donald Kettl, a natural disaster expert at the University of Pennsylvania. "He's got the franchise. He's got star power." 1 2Next Page &gt; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting for this article.

Days later in New York, Mr. Witt appeared at a news conference with another client, the Allstate Corporation, to promote creation of a catastrophe fund to ease the financial burden on insurers. In rushing into trouble when others were running away, Mr. Witt displayed the energy that won him wide praise for his service as the nation's top emergency official - and the nickname Master of Disaster. The much-criticized performance of FEMA after Hurricane Katrina hit has only enhanced his reputation. But as he applies his skills as a consultant, Mr. Witt is having to step deftly to avoid being perceived as a disaster profiteer. "I just don't want anyone to say that we used this as a way to profit or to try to get new business," he said. "I just don't want that." In Louisiana, he cut his usual hourly fee to $275 from $500 for the no-bid state contract and declined to take on any other business there, despite what his partners say are numerous requests. Just one day after his news conference with Allstate, he backed away from his lobbying work for the insurer to avoid conflicts with his advisory role to the state. Mr. Witt is hardly the first insider to trade on his government experience. Administration officials generally are barred from lobbying their former agency for one year after leaving. Still, some critics find Mr. Witt's business troubling. "James Lee Witt is giving his seal of approval to some companies, and I question whether that is appropriate as you leave government," said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, which studies government contracts. "He is lending his credibility as a public official to help companies advance in Washington." Thanks to his résumé and his Rolodex, Mr. Witt - his friends call him James Lee - has taken a once-obscure area of expertise and turned it into a multimillion-dollar business. He has turned his old job on its head, now advising others on how to deal with the agency he once led. "It's all been built on relationships." Mr. Witt, 61, said in an interview. "People know who you are and they trust you." Former President Bill Clinton helped enlist as partners former Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Gen. Wesley Clark, the former NATO supreme commander and Democratic presidential candidate. Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin reviewed the business plan. Former Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said he put in a good word for Mr. Witt with Louisiana officials. And former FEMA officials, with their own networks of contacts, are on his payroll. Started in 2001 with a $300,000 loan and a borrowed office, Mr. Witt's business has grown to include 25 employees and had revenues of about $7 million last year. Nextel, the telecommunications giant, hired him to market its products to safety officials, while the Whelen Engineering Company, which makes sirens, paid him to push for FEMA regulations that would benefit the company. His client list includes universities and cities seeking help on disaster plans. The World Bank and the State Department have hired him as a consultant at $1,000 a day. He is also paid $300,000 as the chief executive of the International Code Council, a nonprofit organization that promotes stronger building codes. "James Lee Witt brings to the table a track record of success," said Donald Kettl, a natural disaster expert at the University of Pennsylvania. "He's got the franchise. He's got star power." 1 2Next Page &gt; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting for this article.

But it is an even bigger concern for Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of Allstate Insurance, which insures more than 750,000 homes in Florida and hundreds of thousands more in neighboring states. Terrorism has also become a concern for Mr. Liddy. While an attack on an individual home may seem improbable, experts say hundreds of homes could be destroyed in a strike on one of the scores of strategic targets in the United States that are surrounded by residential areas.

Forum: Markets and Industries Hurricanes, though, are particularly on Mr. Liddy's mind this year because of the havoc caused last year when a record four major storms hammered Florida, leaving almost no part of the state untouched and costing Allstate and other insurers $22.9 billion. Mr. Liddy talked recently about hurricanes and terrorism and their impact on Allstate and its customers. Q. What goes through your head as a killer hurricane is approaching? A. Fear. And concern for our policyholders. These are devastating storms. They can wipe out communities. They don't just destroy homes. They can destroy a family's heritage. All their belongings, their scrapbooks. Everything. They can also be devastating for our company and our shareholders. Our whole claims organization has to go into an incredible work overload and our capital can be strained. Q. You've announced that you are not going to renew coverage for 95,000 homeowners in Florida. That's pretty drastic. Why are you taking this step? A. We think we have too much exposure in Florida. We have to strike a balance. We estimated the worst case scenario and we simply were insuring too many homes in the state of Florida. We're limited by regulators in what we can charge. And the rates the state allows us to charge simply wasn't enough to cover our potential losses. For the financial safety of the company we had to cut back. Q. What are these people going to do for coverage? A. Several new companies have come into Florida. One of them is offering coverage to our customers. In many cases they're able to charge a higher rate, a more appropriate rate than we are. That's the way the regulatory system works. Q. You say you are limited in what you can charge. But you've just requested an average increase of 27 percent. That seems like a big jump. A. That rate increase is being sought and approved in stages. It doesn't mean that every homeowner gets a 27 percent increase. Homes in the most highly exposed areas will get the largest increases. Most importantly, we need to replenish the capital that was wiped out by last year's events - all the profits we had made in Florida in home insurance since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Q. You've spoken of a need for a partnership between insurers and the government to deal with catastrophes. A. Allstate and other insurance companies simply cannot cover the losses from catastrophe after catastrophe and stay in business. The essence of insurance is covering occasional events of moderate damage that can be foreseen by actuaries, not these infrequent but very expensive events. For those kinds of events, federal or state government simply must play a role. Q. On terrorism, it looks like support is growing in Congress to extend the program under which the government pays most of the insurance costs in a major attack. A. Yes, I think support for that program is growing daily. But it doesn't provide for terrorism damage against homes and personal autos. And it should. Q. Perhaps that's because most experts think that the most likely targets are big commercial buildings, railways, bridges, tunnels, airplanes and airports. A. Well, the risks are very real.

Tripodi was the chief marketing officer for Seagram's spirits and wines, he spent lengthy lunches talking shop with ad agency executives. Now he is more likely to eat tuna sandwiches at his desk. "It was a simpler media landscape," Mr. Tripodi said of those days not so long ago. "You would spend a lot more time with your general brand advertising agency. Now you spend less and less time with your general agency and a whole lot more time with other folks, like your interactive agency, your direct marketing agency, your public relations agency, your sponsorship agency. "From the agency point of view, you do not have time for 'Let's get together for lunch,' " he added. "It's more, 'Let's grab a cup of coffee.' " Mr. Tripodi, now a senior vice president and the chief marketing officer at Allstate, has watched the ad industry evolve since he got into marketing at International Business Machines in 1977. But the pace of change is accelerating significantly. "All marketers are facing so many new challenges," Mr. Tripodi said, citing fragmenting audiences for mass media, the population's growing diversity, the government's "do not call" legislation and technologies like digital video recorders that give consumers new control over what they watch. "The notion that the 30-second commercial blasting out is going to drive your business is a fairly naïve notion," Mr. Tripodi said. "Consumers are bombarded. The smart marketers, I think, are redeploying." Advertisers as a group are indeed rethinking how they use their money, according to data from TNS Media Intelligence, which tracks ad spending in major United States media. Broadcast television commercials, for example, accounted for 17.2 percent of all ad spending in 2001. Last year, that figure fell to 16.5 percent. Newspapers' share has slipped to 19.7 percent from 20.4 percent. At the same time, advertisers have increased their allocations for media such as cable television, local radio, outdoor advertising and the resurgent Internet. Certain big advertisers have redeployed with particular force. Johnson &amp; Johnson cut its share of spending on broadcast commercials to 37.8 percent last year, from 46.1 percent in 2001, increasing its allocations for syndicated TV and the Internet. Microsoft nearly halved its broadcast TV allocation, to 16 percent last year, from 30.7 percent in 2001, while increasing the Web's share to 31.5 percent, from 14.1 percent. At Allstate, broadcast and cable TV commercials consumed 70 percent of the advertising and marketing budget in 2000. This year, the company plans to spend just 40 percent on television. From 2000 through this year, Allstate also doubled its allocation for multicultural marketing, to 8 percent from 4 percent, and entered Internet advertising in a big way, lifting its share to 5 percent from nearly nothing. TNS estimates that Allstate spent about $300 million last year on advertising. Mr. Tripodi, 49, has been refining Allstate's tactics since October 2003, when he was hired to infuse more of a marketing perspective into a company built by insurance executives. In previous jobs he promoted Captain Morgan rum by running the captain for president and helped introduce the "Priceless" campaign for MasterCard. By the time he got to Allstate, the company faced not only marketing challenges but also price competition from companies like Geico and Progressive. He began examining "consumer touch points," like billing statements and the way claims are handled, looking for ways to engage people emotionally. "I spend a lot more time listening directly to the voice of the consumer," said Mr. Tripodi, who some days listens in on customer phone calls or checks the Web site for price quotes as if he were a random Web surfer. Allstate has also developed new products, like the tiered policies being introduced this month as Your Choice Auto Insurance, and found new ways to spread the word, like hiring an agency in New York called Not Traditional Media to supplement a more traditional ad campaign created by Leo Burnett in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe. Not Traditional Media farms out assignments to smaller nontraditional agencies around the country that might otherwise escape the notice of big advertisers. Most strikingly for a company so invested in safe driving, Allstate last month became the sponsor of a Nascar race, the Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The race was renamed the Allstate 400. "That was definitely out of the company's comfort zone historically," Mr. Tripodi said. The company's sponsorship allocation has grown to 7 percent this year from just 1 percent five years earlier. None of this has wiped television from Allstate's map, but Mr. Tripodi tries to squeeze more from his TV advertising than in the past. Allstate is running commercials during the season finales of programs like "Desperate Housewives" on ABC and "24" on Fox, following the emerging consensus that big television events do more for advertisers because people often watch them in groups and with intense attention. The company has advertised during "24" partly because its "Our Stand" campaign features Dennis Haysbert, an actor on the program. Fox's promotional sites for "24" include links to a site for the "Allstate Special Investigation Unit," aimed at evoking the program's cloak-and-dagger feel. The deal flirts with hot field of branded entertainment, in which commercial products are injected into programs. "You know marketers," Mr. Tripodi said. "They're constantly chasing down the holy grail." There is another persistent challenge for chief marketing officers: justifying their expenditures. Last month, Allstate reported that its first-quarter profits grew 18 percent compared with the first quarter of last year. But it is hard to tell how much of the company's results are a result of marketing efforts. "Marketing in every company faces the challenge of proving its value," Mr. Tripodi said. "That's the multibillion-dollar question."</text></article>

A predictable set of sober tables emerged, with responses by gender, income and so on. But Allstate also asked respondents to pick the reality television show title that best reflected their readiness level. A fair number, especially older people, saw themselves as "Joe Millionaire" - big bucks, no worries. But there were also a sprinkling who thought that "Fear Factor" summed it up pretty well: they were terrified by the very mention of retirement. Most, though, said they saw themselves firmly in "Survivor" territory: it would be a challenge, but (grunt, sweat, scratch) they could do it. Still, isn't Allstate missing some apt show titles, like "One Life to Live" (don't bother me now), "Wheel of Fortune" (I'll win my nest egg gambling), or "Friends" (they'll definitely chip in)?

The insurance company was already struggling with a broader discrimination lawsuit protesting its decision to dismiss more than 6,000 agents in the summer of 2000. Advertisement Yesterday's lawsuit, which was filed in Federal District Court in St. Louis by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, focused on Allstate's refusal to consider any of the dismissed employees - 94 percent of whom were 40 years old or older - for other jobs for at least a year. C. Felix Miller, the commission lawyer in charge of the case, said the company also erred in making an exception to its one-year ban; it rehired an agent who was younger than 40. A spokesman for Allstate, Michael J. Trevino, said the company denied the latest accusations. "The intent was to have the program apply to everyone regardless of age,'' Mr. Trevino said. In Washington, a spokesman for the commission, David Grinberg, said the agency received more than 80,000 complaints a year from workers but only 350 to 400 resulted in lawsuits. "When we do bring a lawsuit, it has to be a very strong case,'' he said. Mr. Grinberg said the Allstate lawsuit was distinctive in part because only about 5 percent of the agency's lawsuits are related to age discrimination. "This is a major employer in a big industry,'' he said. The dispute grew out of a plan by Allstate, announced in fall 1999, in which the company said it was eliminating its employee-agent jobs. But, it said, the agents could become independent contractors, without employee benefits. Roughly 4,000 became contractors and received a $5,000 bonus. The other 2,000, who left the company, received an average of $100,000 in severance pay and were permitted to sell their agencies and keep the proceeds. To receive the bonuses, severance pay and sell their agencies, the agents were required to sign a release promising that they would not sue Allstate for discrimination under federal employment laws. The E.E.O.C. later determined that the requirement to give up the right to sue violated several laws that prohibit employment discrimination because of race, religion, color, age or other factors. While the agency was trying to negotiate a resolution with Allstate, the agents independently sued the company in summer 2001. They asserted that Allstate had illegally stripped them of their employee benefits and pushed them out because of their age. The commission filed its own lawsuit against Allstate on behalf of the agents in late 2001. Eventually, the lawsuits were combined in a federal court in Philadelphia. In April, Judge John P. Fullam of Federal District Court in Philadelphia cleared the way for a trial on some aspects of the lawsuit. But he was equivocal on the issue of age discrimination. At one point in his ruling, he declared that there had been no age discrimination. But he also said his reason for permitting the case to proceed was that some of Allstate's actions had violated the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act. Mr. Miller of the commission said the lawsuit filed yesterday involved "a completely different issue and completely different facts'' that arose from the same dispute.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/business/16insure.html?ref=allstatecorporation">Florida Examines Higher Insurance Deductibles<date>Published: September 16, 2004</date><text>IAMI, Sept. 15 - Twelve years ago when Hurricane Andrew pummeled South Florida, 11 small insurance companies went out of business and the giants in home insurance, State Farm and Allstate, were staggered. But industry analysts say that is not going to happen this year, even though not one, but two, hurricanes have torn up thousands of houses and businesses across the state and a third, Hurricane Ivan, was expected to affect the Florida Panhandle late Wednesday or early Thursday. The insurance companies are expected to do fine, industry experts said, because the insurers, with the approval of Florida officials, have cut back on hurricane coverage, shifting much of the initial cost of repairs and reconstruction to the people who suffered the damage. Advertisement The insurers argued that they could not stay in business without such measures. But now Gov. Jeb Bush and Tom Gallagher, the head of the state's Department of Financial Services, are suggesting that the companies have gone too far. The governor and Mr. Gallagher are focusing on sharply increased deductibles that force homeowners to pay thousands of dollars for repairs before their insurance kicks in. Mr. Bush, with the support of Mr. Gallagher, is considering calling a special session of the Legislature to review the higher deductibles and other issues arising from the barrage of hurricanes. Economists say the deductibles will probably deepen an anticipated slump resulting from the hurricanes. But the slowdown is expected to be brief as federal assistance and billions in insurance payments flow into Florida. To offset the impact of the deductibles, J. Antonio Villamil, the chairman of Governor Bush's council of economic advisers, said Wednesday that he has recommended that the Legislature consider dipping into surplus state funds. One approach, he said, would be to give everyone with unpaid insurance losses a payment of $500 or so. Mr. Villamil said he was also recommending that state construction projects be accelerated. "With Ivan now making landfall, there is going to be a tremendous short-term impact on Florida,'' Mr. Villamil said. "This makes a special session of the Legislature very likely. And it would cover all these issues.'' When hurricane warnings go up, instead of the standard $500 deductible in use across the country, a much higher mandatory deductible becomes effective for most homes in Florida and most other parts of the Atlantic Seaboard and the coast along the Gulf of Mexico. Changes in deductibles in Florida will probably lead to similar shifts for insurers and tens of millions of customers throughout the region, insurance experts said. In Florida, the mandatory deductible for homes valued at more than $100,000 is 2 percent; it is 5 percent for homes insured for more than $250,000. The standard $500 deductible remains unchanged for homes valued at less than $100,000. With a 2 percent deductible on a $200,000 home, the owner pays for the first $4,000 in damages. That is expensive enough when just one hurricane has hit. But now, with the arrival of Hurricane Ivan, some homeowners may face three sets of deductibles. As state law stands now, the higher deductibles can be applied to a single home for each of the storms so that the owner of a $200,000 home could wind up having to pay as much as $12,000 for repairs for three hurricanes before collecting a dime from an insurance company. "We want to get rid of that multiple deductible,'' Mr. Gallagher said in an interview on Wednesday. "Many consumers don't have the money to handle that. There should be one deductible per season.'' Mr. Gallagher also wants to replace the high mandatory deductible with a more flexible system. As a minimum, he would impose a $1,000 deductible for most homes. But he would also permit people to choose a range of higher deductibles intended to lower premiums. One way or another, though, the insurance industry says that customers are going to have to pay up for coverage. "You can't reduce the deductible without increasing the rate,'' said Roger Morris, a spokesman for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. "That's how we've kept rates down, by raising the deductible.'' Rates have more than doubled in Florida since Hurricane Andrew, but the industry says that without the deductibles they would have had to rise much higher.

A Texas Department of Insurance spokesman said the refunds are part of a rate rollback ordered by Commissioner Jose Montemayor last year. The one-time refund to about 686,000 customers represents 8.75 percent of the premiums paid on home insurance policies with effective dates from Sept. 7, 2003, through Sept. 6, 2004, the company said. Last year, Allstate cut its rates for Texas homeowners by 10.1 percent under the settlement. The average refund will be about $91.</text></article>

Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade organization in New York. Rather than announcing across-the-board rate decreases, insurers including giants like Allstate, Progressive and Geico are more aggressively offering lower prices to customers with good driving records and significantly raising prices for those who have been involved in crashes or have received tickets for speeding and other violations. Since most drivers fall into favorably rated categories, the net result is expected to be lower costs for millions of drivers.''Many of the national players are strategically reducing rates,'' said Anthony Diodato, a supervisor of analysts at A.M. Best, a source of data on insurance.Over all, the average cost of insurance is still increasing, albeit at a much lower rate: instead of last year's average rise of 7.8 percent, prices for auto coverage across the country are expected to increase by 3.5 percent, according to the Insurance Information Institute.The rate reductions are expected to apply to all categories of passenger vehicles, from tiny compacts to monster S.U.V.'s, and should be felt across the country over the next 12 months.''You're at a tipping point,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''It takes a year or so for rate changes to ripple through the industry.''As painful and irritating as the high cost of gasoline may be for drivers, it will probably help propel the downward trend in auto insurance prices.''When consumers use their cars less, that tends to result in fewer accidents,'' said Steven A. George, a senior vice president for underwriting at USAA.After nearly 25 years of rising auto insurance rates, prices leveled off in 1997 and 1998, then dipped to an average cost of $680 per car across the country in 1999 and 2000. But the insurers said costs began to get ahead of them again and they began raising prices to an average of $842 per car last year.</text></article>

Net income climbed to $900 million to $930 million, or $1.27 to $1.31 a share, the company said. Allstate, based in Northbrook, Ill., is scheduled to release results for the period on April 20. Profit excluding the cost of an accounting rule change and realized investment gains and losses was $1.38 to $1.42 a share, compared with the $1.15 average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.</text></article>

His action cleared the way for a trial on the company's attempt to convert the agents to independent contractors and remove their benefits, the company and lawyers for the agents said yesterday.In a ruling on Tuesday, Judge John P. Fullam of Federal District Court declared that Allstate's insurance unit had not discriminated on the basis of age, as the agents accused. But he said that the company had improperly required the agents to sign a release giving up their right to sue the company in exchange for staying on as independent contractors or leaving and receiving severance pay and other benefits.Judge Fullam said that the 6,200 agents who had signed the release could now rescind the action and proceed with their lawsuit, provided that they returned to Allstate any benefits they received in connection with the release.The roughly 4,000 agents who stayed with Allstate as independent contractors received a $5,000 bonus. The more than 2,000 who left received an average of $100,000 in severance pay and were permitted to sell their agencies for, in many cases, several hundred thousand dollars.Allstate says it regards the proceeds of the sale of the agencies as benefits, but the agents say they are entitled to keep that money because it came from independent buyers and not the insurance company.Approximately 20 agents refused to sign and left the company without receiving any special benefits, and Allstate had contended that only they could properly bring a lawsuit.The court's decision is the most definitive ruling yet in a case that began nearly three years ago when the agents filed their lawsuit.A few months after they sued, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also sued Allstate. Both lawsuits claimed that Allstate's requirement that the agents surrender their rights to sue violated federal laws, and the agents also accused the company of age discrimination because 90 percent of those involved were older than 40.The agents and the employment commission may proceed on the issue of the release, although Allstate may introduce new objections. The judge also dismissed a claim by the agents that Allstate had violated pension laws. Michael J. Wilson, a lawyer for the agents, said his clients were delighted with the judge's decision.</text></article>

But analysts said much of the gain reflected heavy investment losses a year ago and a small gain this year. Allstate said the premiums it collected for auto and home insurance rose 5 percent over the period a year ago, to $6.63 billion. Ira Zuckerman, an analyst for Nutmeg Securities, said that figure compared with estimated growth of about 8 percent to 10 percent for the personal lines industry.Joseph B.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/business/judge-hears-age-bias-suit-by-agents-at-allstate.html?ref=allstatecorporation">Judge Hears Age-Bias Suit By Agents At Allstate<date>Published: September 16, 2003</date><text>A lawyer for agents in a long-running age discrimination dispute against Allstate said today that company executives told the board in the summer of 1999 that summarily dismissing ''low-performing agents'' in a drive for greater efficiency was ''not legally possible.'' It was the first face-to-face courtroom confrontation in the case.At the hearing here in Federal District Court and in a later interview, a lawyer for Allstate, Edward F. Mannino, acknowledged that ''low-performing agents'' referred to older agents who had become less productive. He said the company decided against focusing on that category of agents.Both sides went on to say that six months later, the company said it was dismissing its 6,200 employee agents -- 90 percent of whom were over 40 -- but would rehire them as independent agents, without benefits, if they signed a pledge not to sue for any violations of employment law.Allstate said in the hearing, before Judge John P. Fullam, that the termination plan it announced in November 1999 was appropriate and legal. The plan did not specify any category of workers, company lawyers said, but applied to all remaining employee agents. Over the previous 10 years, Allstate had signed up about 9,000 independent contractors among more than 15,000 agents.''Instead of getting rid of the lower performers, we got rid of everybody,'' Mr. Mannino said.But Michael J. Wilson, a lawyer for the agents, asserted that Allstate had devised a termination plan that it expected would mostly push out older agents. Mr. Wilson said that in the board presentation, Allstate executives acknowledged legal and fairness issues if agents were forced to leave without an option, and settled on the plan to dismiss and rehire agents. He said that because the older agents were already eligible for pensions and other retirement benefits, Allstate assumed they would not work for less pay.''Allstate was trying to get rid of the older agents,'' he told the court.The agents say they are entitled to compensation because Allstate improperly deprived them of hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits. They also say employment law was violated because they were required to give up their right to sue if they remained as agents.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission warned Allstate before the agents were dismissed in June 2000 that it was probably illegal to require them to give up their rights, and it later sued the company. The two suits have been consolidated before Judge Fullam.</text></article>

So last week, Governor McGreevey raised a few eyebrows when he called a news conference to announce that Allstate was sending five new agents to New Jersey.''They have a press conference and say they are bringing five, count 'em five, agents into the state,'' said Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll, a Morristown Republican. ''They must be desperate for good news.''In his defense, the governor's supporters say this is the first good news the state has had about automobile insurance in years. The five from Allstate (plus an independent agent who will sell Allstate insurance) are the first new agents the company has sent to New Jersey in decades. At one time, the insurance giant had 600 agents in the state; it now has 160.''It means that new policies can be written for literally thousands of drivers,'' said Micah Rasmussen, the governor's spokesman. ''It is another vote of confidence in the governor's car insurance reforms.''Mr. Rasmussen added: ''If the worst criticism of our plan is where we hold our press conferences, I'll take that as a pretty good vote of confidence.''

More than 90 percent of the agents were older than 40.Some of the agents complained to the commission. In a letter to Allstate and the agents dated last Thursday, Lynn Bruner, a district director for the commission who has been overseeing the dispute, said that Allstate's policy of refusing to rehire the agents in lesser jobs while signing up younger workers ''discriminated against persons age 40 and over.''Evidence in the case, Ms. Bruner wrote, showed that the company's action ''was not justified by a legitimate business purpose.'' She did not elaborate.In her letter, Ms. Bruner said the agency would now try to negotiate a settlement covering this part of the dispute. Efforts toward settling other aspects of the case have so far failed.A spokesman for Allstate, Michael J. Trevino, said the company disagreed with the commission's finding. ''We know that age had absolutely nothing to do with Allstate's rehire policy,'' he said. Now that the one-year waiting period has passed, he said, ''those terminated agents, regardless of age, are today eligible for rehire, even though they are older now.''Speaking for the agents, Michael J. Wilson, a lawyer with the firm of Zevnik Horton in Washington, said the latest decision showed that the federal agency was ''looking at every aspect of this program and saying, 'Allstate, what you did is illegal in multiple respects.'

Resolution of the battle will determine how much consumers will pay and whether insurers will continue to do business in the state, said Marc Serafin, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service.''Policyholders may enjoy a rate decrease now, but if that ultimately leads to insurance companies' getting into financial trouble, companies will write less business,'' Mr. Serafin said. ''Consumers will have less choice for insurance. If you have less choice, rates go through the roof.''Of 32 companies reviewed by the Texas Insurance Department, 25 were told to reduce rates 1.5 percent to 31 percent, and 14 companies filed for an appeal, according to Lee Jones, a spokesman for the department.</text></article>

Sixteen Allstate agents had accused the company of developing marketing strategies that focused on suburban areas and excluded urban ones. Under the Fair Automobile Insurance Act, carriers must cover drivers with a certain point ranking on their driving record, typically fewer than nine. Holly C. Bakke, the state banking and insurance commissioner, found that the company's practices were meant to ensure ''financial stability.'' In a statement yesterday, she said, ''The requirement to sell auto insurance to all eligible drivers does not prevent a company from developing a statewide business plan.''

The 19 people, including local lawyers, insurance brokers and operators of medical clinics, were charged with conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. The charge carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison.Among those charged were several people the authorities say acted as middlemen, including retired police officers, who were paid by lawyers to find accident victims.The authorities say the middlemen paid insurance brokers to obtain the names of clients who had recently reported automobile accidents. According to the charges, the middlemen, posing as hospital officials, called the victims and directed them to seek medical care at clinics run by their co-conspirators, and also steered the victims to specific personal injury lawyers, who in turn paid the middlemen for the ''referral.''Accident victims who felt that their injuries no longer required medical treatment were urged to continue, to keep their claims alive, the authorities said.''The only way you can make money is if you prove you are injured,'' John Fernandez, a manager of a medical clinic, said to one reluctant accident victim in an April 3 cellphone conversation that was recorded by detectives, according to a complaint filed in Nassau County Criminal Court.The complaint details another recorded phone conversation in which Robert Fernandez, John Fernandez's brother and partner at the clinic, told a woman who had been in a minor accident that insurers would pay her ''a big amount of money'' for her pain and suffering.The Fernandezes' lawyer, Ronald J. Aiello, said yesterday that the brothers were innocent and that they denied saying these things.''They are young businessmen and absolutely deny any involvement with this indictment,'' Mr. Aiello said. ''They have no criminal record and are surprised and shocked by the charges.''Three of the 19 people charged are lawyers. Benjamin Brafman, who is representing one of the lawyers, Michael Weinreb, said Mr. Weinreb was innocent.''When the investigation is complete,'' Mr. Brafman said, ''it will be apparent that he did not personally violate any law, nor did he conspire to violate any law.''</text></article>

Barring some extraordinary development, she said, it seems likely that the case will be certified as a class action. A final decision could come within a few weeks.Allstate, the second-largest insurer of homes and autos after State Farm, said it planned to wait and see how the case played out. ''While the judge has offered an indication of his intention,'' said Michael J. Trevino, a company spokesman, ''there is much work to be done.''He said it was ''too early in the process to decide whether settlement is appropriate.''With older workers among the fastest-growing part of the work force, the Allstate case is being followed by discrimination experts and executives across the country. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a related lawsuit against Allstate, and AARP has assigned two lawyers to help the agents.In March, two Democrats in the House of Representatives, Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Robert Andrews of New Jersey, introduced legislation aimed at preventing companies from forcing older employees into retirement and denying them pensions and other benefits, as the agents assert that Allstate did.If the case is certified as a class-action lawsuit, it could represent more than 6,000 Allstate agents and be one of largest accusing a company of age discrimination.In an order last Thursday, Judge John P. Fullam of the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia expressed one reservation with the agents' certification request: He wanted the number of plaintiffs reduced to 3 or fewer from 29.''The problem the judge identified is a minor one,'' Ms. Gerken said. ''So I think the parties would be fair to read his order as signaling a plan to certify.''</text></article>

The cover, which featured tidy-looking offices sporting the company's iconic blue-and-white logo, promised that signing on was ''better than being in business for yourself.'' Inside, it offered prospective agents nothing less than a piece of the American dream. ''Have you ever wanted a proprietary interest in a business?'' the brochure beckoned. How about ''unlimited income potential''? And ''job security''?Ron Harper, the son of a tractor salesman from Gainesville, Ga., wanted all of those things. A 38-year-old father of two, he had worked his way up in the supermarket business, starting as a bagger at 16 and rising to district sales manager in charge of 17 stores. But the supermarket industry was hurting, and after trying out a couple of other managerial jobs, he was looking for something more stable.That was when he heard that Allstate was hiring. Its Neighborhood Office Agent program offered just the mix of opportunity and security he wanted. Allstate would give him policies to sell, money to run his own agency and a brand whose slogan -- ''You're in Good Hands'' -- was a marketing legend. He understood that the money would not be great at first. He would have to hustle to build a ''book of business,'' and Allstate's commissions were less than he could earn as an independent broker. As an Allstate employee, though, he would receive generous benefits, including a pension. If he honed his skills and worked hard, he figured, there was no limit to what he could earn. And once he got past the preliminaries, he was told, he could be terminated only for dishonesty.In August 1989, Harper was assigned to the small town of Thomson, Ga., and he uprooted his family and began hunting for customers in difficult terrain. Most of Thomson's older residents already had car and home insurance, and the younger ones were clearing out for better jobs in Augusta and Atlanta. But Harper ''bled blue,'' as the company's saying goes. He lived off savings at first, pouring his commissions back into the agency, and used his own money for rent, an assistant's salary and ads in the Yellow Pages. After a few years, he had his book of business and was making a modest living. Then, in 1998, Allstate reduced the commissions it paid its neighborhood agents. To make up the lost revenue, Harper's wife quit her job and worked for him at below-market wages.</text></article>

Profit, excluding realized investment losses was 87 cents a share; analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had expected 77 cents.Allstate has increased earnings by raising premiums and selling more life insurance and annuities. It has also moved to cut losses on the mold claims by excluding them from coverage, and it converted salaried sales agents into independent contractors.Allstate said it expected to earn $3.20 to $3.40 a share in 2003, excluding revamping charges and investment gains and losses.The company sold $5.85 billion of auto and home policies in the quarter, 4.4 percent more than a year earlier. Claims payments were 97.8 percent of premium income, less than the 104.5 percent figure of last year.The financial services division, which sells life insurance, annuities and other products, reported that sales rose 19 percent, to $2.76 billion.Some investors say price increases will slow or stop as consumer groups fight higher rates.An Allstate competitor, the State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Company, the largest car and home insurer, expects to lose several billion dollars this year after deciding to raise rates more slowly than Allstate, the chief executive, Edward B. Rust Jr., said last month.State Farm lost $4.9 billion during the first nine months of 2002, after losing $5 billion the previous year.Allstate reported earnings after trading closed.

But the use of a grand jury signals that prosecutors have decided to devote significant time and effort to the inquiry, according to lawyers who specialize in white-collar criminal cases.Prosecutors are examining whether top executives at Computer Associates, which is based in Islandia, N.Y., inflated the company's sales and profits during the late 1990's to reach a $1.1 billion payday that was tied to the performance of the company's stock. They are also looking into an accounting change that Computer Associates made in 2000 that effectively allowed the company to count some of its sales and profits twice. Some former and current employees have said the company made that change to hide the fact that it had previously inflated its profits.Computer Associates has said its accounting is proper.The Allstate Corporation, a client of Computer Associates, and Mary Welch, a former Computer Associates employee, said yesterday that they had received subpoenas to testify or provide documents to the grand jury.''We are cooperating fully,'' said Michael J. Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate. He said that Allstate was not a subject of the investigation but that the company could not disclose what types of information it had been required to provide. ''We certainly do not want to impede the U.S. attorney's investigation,'' he said.Ms. Welch, a former saleswoman for Computer Associates, said she received a subpoena in August or September to testify before the grand jury in Brooklyn. ''They were going to fly me out to New York,'' said Ms. Welch, who lives in Illinois.But Ms. Welch said prosecutors had let her out of the subpoena after she told them that she did not have detailed information about the way the company accounted for its software sales.

The company said the settlement reduced third-quarter net income to $248 million, or 35 cents a share, from the $280 million, or 39 cents, previously reported. Michael Trevino, an Allstate spokesman, would not elaborate on terms of the settlement. He said Allstate reviews its asbestos reserves once a year and thinks they are now adequate. The company, which is based in Northbrook, Ill., announced the revision after the close of trading yesterday.</text></article>

Ms. Bruner said Allstate had acknowledged telling the agents they would not be permitted to work for the company unless they agreed in writing not to sue for any kind of employment discrimination. Such an action is a form of illegal pre-emptive retaliation, she said in the letter, which urged the company and the agents to begin settlement talks.For nearly two years, Allstate has been fighting similar claims that it forced thousands of auto and home insurance agents to become independent contractors. Those agents sued Allstate in Federal District Court in Philadelphia in August. In December, the E.E.O.C. also sued Allstate.Allstate has in turn sued the agents for fraud, saying they got severance or other benefits after agreeing not to sue the company, but never intended to honor their agreements. Susan Rosborough, an Allstate lawyer, said the company, the country's second-largest seller of auto and home insurance after State Farm, treated its agents properly and legally. The company says it wants to make its sales force more efficient and is increasing commissions to compensate for the elimination of benefits. But Michael Wilson, the lead lawyer in the agents' private suit, said their earnings as independent contractors were not making up for the losses in benefits.The initial complaints from the home and auto insurance agents were based on age discrimination. More than 90 percent of them were more than 40 years old. More than 80 percent of the life insurance agents are that old. Both of the commission's cases cover a wide range of employment discrimination offenses.</text></article>

The company, which sells automobile and home insurance, says net income was $426 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $500 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 2.3 percent, to $7.3 billion. First-quarter results were hurt by increased costs in its property-liability unit, higher restructuring expenses and decreased investment income in its property-liability business, the company said. The results were better than Wall Street analysts had expected, and Allstate shares rose $2.01, or 5 percent, to $41.06.</text></article>

Over all, insurers worldwide are expected to pay $30 billion to $70 billion for Sept. 11 losses.As usual, insurers made a loss on underwriting, paying $1.16 in claims and expenses on every $1 of premium received. That was worse than $1.10 the year before.Insurers' bottom lines, however, were sunk as investment returns, which usually cover the loss on underwriting, did not do so last year.Insurers had low returns on reliable investments as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, while they lost billions of dollars liquidating bad bets like venture capital and technology investments.</text></article>

Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group.Ronald D. McNeil, a senior vice president for Allstate, told investors at a Banc of America securities conference in New York yesterday that Allstate had increased its prices for auto insurance an average of 8.3 percent in 17 states so far this year. He said Allstate had raised its prices for home insurance by an average of more than 20 percent in 20 states.State Farm said it was taking similar action. It was not immediately able to provide figures for the increases so far this year. But Richard Luedke, a spokesman, said the increases were significantly larger than those in the previous year, when they averaged 4.6 percent for home insurance and 2.7 percent for auto insurance. The increases were necessary, he said, because ''we were paying out more in claims than we were collecting in premiums.''J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said that profit and loss trends for the insurers indicated a need for an average increase of 4 percent to 8 percent in auto premiums. But he said increases of 20 percent for home insurance were ''way out of line.''''I don't see anything in the data that would justify an increase of that magnitude,'' he said.In some states, the increases are even higher, analysts said. ''We're starting to see increases of 25 percent to 30 percent in a lot of states,'' said Ira L. Zuckerman at Nutmeg Securities in Fairfield, Conn.For years, he said, home insurance was sold as a loss-leader to attract customers to the more lucrative business of auto insurance. But in recent years, both lines of coverage have been losing money.</text></article>

Allstate, the nation's second-largest insurer, said it did not expect rate increases to translate into significant profit improvements until the second half of the year, warning that 2002 results would fall slightly short of previous estimates. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $264 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $547 million, or 74 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results included $107 million in one-time charges for restructuring and a legal settlement with Georgia policyholders.</text></article>

Linczer started teaching defensive driving classes in 1989, he said people ''used to look at me cross-eyed and ask what the class was all about.''''Now what they want to know is where I give it,'' he said.Years ago, he continued, most of those who took the class were there to remove four penalty points from their driving records. Now, he said, about 90 percent take it to shave 10 percent from their auto insurance premium.Defensive driving instructors got a boost when the Allstate Insurance Company, the Island's largest auto insurer, announced an average 11.8 percent increase for new automobile customers in the New York metro area effective Jan. 8; it is effective Feb. 17 for renewals. Industry officials said other automobile insurers are expected to follow suit.A spokeswoman for Allstate, Maureen Sullivan, said the rate increase follows a 6 percent rise last April. She attributed the increases principally to fraudulent personal injury claims against the company, which insures 1.2 million cars in the state.Gregory V. Serio, superintendent of the state Insurance Department, confirmed a ''sudden explosion in the number of insurance fraud reports'' in the last 12 to 18 months. From 1999 to 2001, he said, the Insurance Department recorded a 66 percent increase in reports of no-fault insurance fraud.Mr. Linczer, founder of the Driving Safety Training Center in Manhattan, said his school, which has classes in 150 to 200 places in the metropolitan area, expects a record number of students this year. He noted that the insurance rate reduction is good for only three years and that nearly half of his students take the course again when the rate reduction expires.The cost of the classes ranges from $25 to $50.Mr. Linczer conducted a class last month at the Dix Hills Jewish Center. Of 24 people in the class, 2 said they were there to clean up their driving records; the rest said they wanted the 10 percent insurance premium cut.In the six-hour class spread out over two days, Mr. Linczer reviewed a 25-page booklet prepared by the Empire Safety Council that covered such things as traffic and safety laws, proper use of the seat belt, road rage, defensive driving techniques (for instance, handling skids, knowing the blind spots on a car and how to merge onto a highway) and how little time speeding really saves. And he showed three videos recently recorded on Long Island dealing with driving techniques and driving while intoxicated.</text></article>

Allstate, one of the largest auto insurers in the nation, will record an expense of $70 million, or 10 cents a share, for closing claim offices and redesigning its customer information centers. The company, based in Northbrook, Ill., estimates the changes will save it $140 million a year before taxes. Allstate also said it was reserving $38 million, or 5 cents a share, in the fourth quarter for the settlement with Georgia auto policyholders. Allstate will report its financial results for the fourth quarter on Feb. 6.</text></article>

Elsewhere in New York State, Allstate customers will pay 7.3 percent more for auto insurance.The increases, which have been approved by state regulators, are immediate for new customers, and take effect Feb. 17 for older customers.Though the increase in New York City and the nearby counties was more than four times the average price increase for insurers across the state in 2000, the latest year for which full statistics are available, state regulators said they were not surprised.''This is exactly what we knew was coming,'' said Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Insurance. ''We need some real reform on fraud and abuse.''New York already has the second most expensive auto insurance in the country, with an average cost of $943 per car. But state officials worry that New York may soon surpass New Jersey as the most expensive state for auto insurance at an average of $1,043 per car. Auto insurance has become a rancorous political problem in New Jersey and Gov. George E. Pataki does not want it to become a big issue in New York.Last year, he and Gregory Serio, the superintendent of insurance, presented a series of changes to the Legislature that were intended to reduce fraud. Many legislators said they recognized fraud as a serious problem, but they were unable to act on a bill before adjourning. Some legislators suggested a special session to deal with auto insurance fraud. But ultimately there was no special session.State Farm Insurance, the third largest insurer in the state, increased its rates an average of 7.4 percent across the state in November. And the regulators said yesterday that they expected other insurers to raise their rates as well.Across the country, auto insurance rates rose an average of 6 percent last year, according to Robert Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, as costs for medical treatment and auto repairs rose. The average increase in the previous year was 3 percent.</text></article>

The suit, filed in United States District Court in Philadelphia without a formal announcement, centers on a decision by Allstate to convert its 15,200-member sales force from regular employees with pensions and health care benefits to independent contractors. To continue as contractors, the agents were required to sign a waiver, or release, that they would not sue Allstate. By last June, all but 6,400 of the agents had become contractors. The remaining agents, 90 percent of whom were older than 40, were then dismissed and given the choice of rejoining as contractors or leaving the company. Infuriated by the waiver, which they viewed as the linchpin in the company's strategy to shed its older workers, several agents filed complaints with the E.E.O.C., accusing Allstate of age discrimination. For the E.E.O.C. to bring a suit, there must be a complaint of discrimination based on race, sex, age, religion or disability. The agency determined in September 2000 that the waiver was a form of pre-emptive retaliation and that Allstate had violated several laws against discrimination. The agency pressed Allstate to compensate the 6,400 agents and to change its policies, but the E.E.O.C. said in February that negotiations had failed. Even so, Allstate and government officials said, the agency continued over the last few days to reach a settlement. ''This is not a lawsuit-happy agency,'' said Reginald Welch, the spokesman for the agency. ''A lawsuit is a measure of last resort.'' The lawsuit has the same goals: compensation for the agents and a change in corporate policy. Although the case was brought before the current chairwoman, Cari M. Dominguez, was appointed by President Bush last summer, it is likely to further fuel discontent among business executives who think the Bush administration has yet to bring the often-partisan commission under control. The administration has not filled two other vacancies on the five-member commission. As a result, the two sitting Democrats outnumber Ms. Dominguez. In addition, the administration has not appointed a general counsel, who is especially influential in deciding which discrimination cases to bring and how the litigation should be handled. ''From the business community's perspective, there's a sense that it's out of control, that there's no centralized direction to it,'' said Lawrence Z. Lorber, a lawyer who defends companies in labor and discrimination disputes. The commission, created in 1964, has often been a partisan battleground populated by strongly ideological personalities. Ida L. Castro, who was the last chairwoman during the Clinton administration, is now an official at the Democratic National Committee. Perhaps the best-known Republican chairman in recent years was Clarence Thomas, now a Supreme Court justice and an icon in the party's right wing. The E.E.O.C. receives tens of thousands of complaints each year but is able to investigate only a few and files lawsuits only in those cases that it considers significant and most critical in policing anti-discrimination laws. ''We have to be very strategic in terms of choosing litigation vehicles,'' Mr. Welch said. ''The case has to be in the public interest. It could be a situation that looks particularly egregious and that requires us to step in very forcefully and aggressively.'' Mary Alice Horstman, a spokeswoman for Allstate, the nation's second-largest insurer of cars and homes after State Farm, said last night: ''We are very disappointed to learn that the E.E.O.C. has filed a lawsuit. We had hoped to reach a resolution without litigation. Allstate stands by its commitment to fairness to all individuals and believes that the release will be found to be a fair and lawful component of the reorganization program. Releases are used routinely in the American workplace in connection with business reorganizations and have been consistently upheld in court.''</text></article>

Allstate said today that payouts from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks also contributed to the shortfall. The weaker earnings, which Allstate had previewed in detail last week, were in line with Wall Street's newly lowered expectations. Shares of Allstate fell 97 cents, to $32.64. Net earnings for the quarter were $226 million, or 32 cents a share, down from $644 million, or 87 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell 4 percent, to $7.17 billion from $7.44 billion. Excluding special items, the company said operating income was 56 cents a share, down from 71 cents a share. That was 2 cents better than an estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call, based on Allstate's guidance last week. Allstate has maintained since shortly after the attacks that the tragedy would not have a major financial impact on the company. But the insurer, which is based in Northbrook, Ill., said last week that additional claims would result in about $32 million in losses to both its property-liability and financial businesses. Primary causes of the earnings decline were higher homeowners' claims, particularly increased mold- and weather-related claims, the company said. Capital losses resulting from market conditions affecting portfolio trading and investment write-downs also hurt the bottom line. ''We remain concerned about the adverse loss trends in our homeowners line and are taking strong action to deal with this situation,'' said the company's chairman and chief executive, Edward Liddy.</text></article>

Shares of Allstate fell $3.43, or 9.5 percent, to $32.85. Allstate said that third-quarter operating income was now expected to be 53 cents to 57 cents a share, down from 71 cents a year earlier. It said higher homeowners claims, particularly those related to mold and weather, were the main reason loss reserves increased by $80 million in the quarter.</text></article>

Prices are rising at more than twice the 3 percent average of recent years, and by more than 10 percent in many states.Allstate, the second-largest home insurer, has been leading the way, with increases of 10 percent to 25 percent in several states. State Farm, the largest home insurer, has been more reluctant to raise prices, lifting premiums 6 percent to 10 percent in a handful of states. Safeco, the eighth largest, says it expects increases to average more than 25 percent for its 1.5 million customers this year.Though other companies are more circumspect than Safeco about overall insurance rates, analysts say higher prices are almost certain to spread. ''These are shock increases,'' said J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America.Insurance companies, which set their own rates, state by state, and zone by zone within each state, are responding to profit pressures. The companies are earning less on their investments and on certain types of personal policies while reeling from a surge in weather-related claims in the last few years. In addition to raising rates, some companies are also forcing homeowners to pay more out of pocket after they file claims.Rising home values compound the situation for some people, since higher rates come as the values of their policies increase. And the average increases often mask outright price surges for those living in areas singled out by insurers.In Texas, for example, Tricia Beaugh wound up with sticker shock on the renewal of her policy. In May, Allstate raised the cost of the $94,000 policy on her three-bedroom brick veneer house in Humble, near Houston, to $670, up 56 percent, from $430 the previous year.''It was like 'Oh, my God,' '' said Mrs. Beaugh, who sells advertising in the Yellow Pages. ''We had pretty much figured out to the penny what we could afford for the mortgage, maintenance, insurance and taxes. We ended up having to finance the insurance, pay by the month.''Insurers have long tried to keep prices low on homeowners' policies as a way to lure customers into their profitable auto insurance business. But the profits on auto policies have shrunk, leading companies to raise auto rates last year and now to insist that home insurance be profitable.</text></article>

Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate, said, ''We completely disagree with the allegations.''Also yesterday, some agents opposing Allstate said that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission voted last week to authorize a government suit against the insurer in connection with the dismissals.The agency has characterized Allstate's dismissals as ''unlawful interference, coercion and intimidation.''Felix Miller, the agency lawyer in charge of the Allstate case, would not comment on whether a government suit was being prepared. Mr. Trevino, the Allstate spokesman, said the authorization for the lawsuit was based on the E.E.O.C.'s conclusion that the dismissals were a form of retaliation; he said the agency was still investigating complaints of age discrimination.Mr. Trevino said Allstate executives had been engaged in ''active and ongoing dialogue with the E.E.O.C.'' to resolve the case. Allstate's next meeting with a mediator will be tomorrow, he said.The class-action suit filed yesterday with 27 plaintiffs also contended that although Allstate took away the health and pension benefits of the agents, it continued to treat them like staff employees, barring them from selling insurance for other companies, dictating office hours, requiring Allstate approval for hiring office assistants and imposing other controls.The suit said that many agents would have taken customer service jobs at Allstate but that the company refused to hire them for those jobs for at least a year so as to keep them from retaining their old benefits.Referring to changes in the relationship of the agents and Allstate as a restructuring, Mr. Trevino said the company believed that its actions were ''lawful and permissible.''</text></article>

The companies -- Allstate, Progressive and Encompass -- accused the 26 defendants of staging accidents and running diagnostic and acupuncture centers that were ''medical bill mills,'' churning out claims for procedures that were unneeded or never performed. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, was the third insurance industry suit in the last 16 months in the state charging similar practices. It comes as many insurers in the state are seeking large rate increases, citing the costs of sharply rising auto-insurance fraud. The lawsuit seeks $36 million in triple damages. Joseph P.

Allstate, which provides insurance services to over 14 million households, said the purchase of Sterling, which operates 39 car repair shops in seven states and has about $100 million in annual revenue, will help reduce repair times, improve customer service and increase efficiencies. Allstate, which is based in Northbrook, Ill., bought Sterling from the private investment groups Conning Capital Partners and Berkshire Partners.</text></article>

Now, No. 2, Allstate, is having a go at selling policies through one of the first online markets for insurance, a California site called InsWeb. And this time, analysts say that they think the chances for success are good. ''State Farm couldn't make money with InsWeb,'' said Todd Eyler, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, ''but Allstate's agents are much more Internet friendly and enabled.'' InsWeb distinguishes itself by providing customers with comparative prices for insurance from several companies. But customers who wanted to buy from State Farm had to contact the insurer and then wait, often to no avail, for an agent to reply by telephone or an e-mail message. Allstate says that it will send a quote via an e-mail message within 30 seconds, along with a toll-free phone number to call to complete the purchase of a policy. Joseph B. Treaster</text></article>

''It was just Allstate and the E.E.O.C.,'' he said.Both Allstate and the agents said they were disappointed that the talks had ended. The agency said it was referring the case to its litigation unit and both Allstate and the agents appeared to be preparing to go to court.Asked whether Allstate was considering any settlement offer that might head off a suit, Michael J. Trevino, a spokesman, said that with the end of the conciliation talks ''the settlement option seems to be foreclosed.''The agents' complaint centers on the decision by Allstate to convert its 15,000-member sales force to independent contractors. By last June, all but 6,500 of the agents had become contractors. They were then dismissed and given the choice of rejoining as contractors or leaving the company.Those who wanted to become independent agents or wished to receive enhanced severance benefits were required to agree not to sue Allstate. Agents who did not agree would receive a lesser package.In her letter, Ms. Bruner said the action by Allstate violated several federal statutes and ''constitutes unlawful retaliation.'' In an earlier letter, she said it also amounted to ''unlawful interference, coercion and intimidation.''In another move that experts on employment law said underscored concern about Allstate's dealings with its agents, the E.E.O.C. has filed a brief on behalf of a Connecticut agent who is challenging the company on some of the same issues. Moreover, the agency plans to send a lawyer to argue in support of the agent's case before a federal appeals court in early March.</text></article>

Aaron Kaufmann, a lawyer for the agents, said the lawsuit was seeking court approval to permit hundreds of other agents to join in a collective action similar to a class action.Michael Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate, said the insurer regarded the agents as exempt from the federal law requiring time-and-a-half pay for anyone working more than 40 hours a week and that ''they are not due any overtime pay.''The agents, who work on commission, say they should receive overtime pay because Allstate, starting in January 1999, required them to keep their offices open more than 40 hours a week. The agents say they often worked longer hours by choice, but they contend they should have been paid for it once the company required it.The federal suit is the latest development in a long-running battle between Allstate and some of its current and former agents growing out a decision by the company to transform its sales force from employees with pensions, health benefits and subsidies for office expenses to independent contractors. Allstate, the second-largest insurer of autos and homes in the United States behind State Farm, has also recently begun selling insurance over the Internet and through through call centers, which some agents say undermines their sales opportunities.By last June, all but 6,500 of the company's 15,000 agents were independent contractors. By the end of that month, the remaining 6,500 agent employees were dismissed. They were given the choice of staying on as independent contractors or leaving the company. Allstate said 2,400 agents left.All the agents who stayed were required to sign a waiver that they would not sue Allstate in the future. Those who left were given enhanced severance packages if they signed the waiver.Seventy of the agents, including some who stayed with the company, complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And in September, the agency said it thought that Allstate had coerced and intimidated agents into surrendering their rights in violation of federal law. The agents and the insurance company, Allstate executives said, are negotiating a possible settlement.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/08/opinion/insurance-and-suv-s.html?ref=allstatecorporation">Insurance and S.U.V.'s<date>Published: December 08, 2000</date><text>State Farm, the nation's largest car insurer, has announced that it will cut premiums by a small amount on some models of sport utility vehicles and other large cars and raise premiums on several models of small cars. It will do so because, it says, the bigger cars provide better protection for drivers, cutting the medical costs of accidents.But the rate changes raise serious questions. They will hurt people who buy smaller cars, including poorer people who cannot buy larger cars. They will encourage well-to-do families to buy heavy cars that burn excessive amounts of gasoline, spoiling the environment, and can inflict severe damage on occupants of smaller cars in accidents.Insurance premiums are not designed to protect the poor or the environment. But the fact that premiums do not take equity or the environment into account makes it all the more important for them to cover the cost of all the damage that drivers of large cars inflict on themselves and other cars and drivers. Otherwise, auto insurers will be subsidizing expensive gas guzzlers.State Farm says its new rates are fair. It is altering only that part of the premium covering medical costs incurred by the owners, a rate adjustment that will amount to just a 2 percent change in premiums for some popular models. Meanwhile, State Farm is leaving liability coverage -- coverage for property damage and injuries to other people -- where it is because, the company says, S.U.V.'s do not inflict above-average damage on others. S.U.V.'s, it concedes, demolish smaller cars in crash tests. But that is offset by the fact that their owners are involved in fewer and less severe accidents.But not everyone agrees. Allstate and Progressive, the second- and fourth-largest insurers, have actually started raising the cost of liability coverage for many S.U.V.'s and other large cars and reducing the cost for cars that most Americans own. Their data suggest that owners of these models cause above-average property and medical damage. In Allstate's case, the premiums have been raised on some models by about 10 percent. Farmers, the nation's third-largest insurer, intends to follow Allstate's and Progressive's lead.</text></article>

Yet insurance premiums have ignored that pattern.Instead, two drivers with similar records have paid the same for liability coverage (for damage and injuries to others) and personal injury coverage (for injuries in the policyholder's vehicle), whether they are driving a Chevrolet Suburban or a Ford Escort.Now, though, accident data are persuading the industry to make changes that, officials say, better assign costs to the responsible parties. For consumers, premiums are likely to rise or fall by $150 or less a year, insurance executives say. For the industry as a whole, premium income should be little changed, although individual companies' fortunes could be affected as customers respond to shifts in pricing.</text></article>

The move stripped the agents of their employee benefits, but the company promised them higher commissions to help cover the cost of doing business on their own.The agents could have rejected the offer and opted instead to leave Allstate with an enhanced severance package. But either way, they were required to sign a waiver in which they pledged not to sue the company.Infuriated by the waiver, which they viewed as the linchpin in the company's strategy to shed its older workers, roughly 70 agents filed complaints this spring with the E.E.O.C., saying they were victims of age discrimination. After a six-month investigation, the commission ruled in favor of the agents, concluding that Allstate had coerced and intimidated them into surrendering their rights.Allstate officials characterized the waiver as ''a common and prudent business practice'' and said the company had no immediate plans to change it. But while E.E.O.C. officials acknowledge that waivers are a common way of warding off litigation in the workplace, they say waivers rarely require employees to give up their rights to sue a company merely to hold onto their jobs, a violation of federal law. The commission investigators also said they viewed the Allstate case as particularly troubling because so many agents were affected, considerably more than in many of the cases it takes on.The commission's finding is a potential stumbling block for Allstate's efforts to recreate itself. In the past year or so, the company has begun a major overhaul, hoping to sell its policies from call centers around the country and over the Internet, where traditional agents are considered virtually obsolete.The company is also eager to sell more insurance through what are referred to as independent agents, who work for themselves and sell the policies of 10 or more insurance companies at the same time.</text></article>

When the company required him to work weekends, he says, he did not complain. When it cut back on office help and had him do his own paperwork, he uttered no protest. At 51, Mr. Romero thought that his silence would pave the way to an easy retirement.The job had been a good one. Though most big insurance companies have long relied on independent contractors to sell their policies, Allstate was among the few to hire agents as employees with benefits, arousing a fierce loyalty from its sale force.But last November, Mr. Romero, in Kansas City, Mo., and about 6,000 other employee agents were told that their jobs would be terminated on June 30, their benefits canceled and their pensions frozen. They could stay with Allstate and earn higher commissions, but only as independent contractors who paid their own expenses, got no benefits and could be dismissed at any time. Or they could leave, taking a severance package or selling their business to fellow agents. In all cases, the agents had to waive their rights to sue the company.Mr. Romero signed the waiver and sold his business. But all he could think about, he says, was how difficult it would be to find a new job with the same security and perquisites. ''I felt betrayed,'' he said. ''Ever since I have been with Allstate, they've always said the agent is the backbone of the company, but now they've changed their story.''In March, Mr. Romero filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over the waiver, starting a feud that has spread around the country. Since then, at least 50 agents have filed similar complaints, contending that Allstate, the nation's second-largest insurance company after State Farm, violated federal law by forcing them to surrender their civil rights to keep their jobs.The commission has yet to rule, but it calls the number of complaints fairly large and cause for concern, considering how rarely discontented employees overcome fear of repercussion and take action.The dispute is the latest skirmish in a long-simmering conflict over the use of independent contractors in the American workplace. The practice has long been scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service because it enables businesses to escape payroll taxes, and labor unions attack it as a means for employers to evade benefits like pensions, sick pay and paid vacations.Correction: July 14, 2000, Friday A credit on the Workplace page on Wednesday for a picture of an Allstate agent who figures in a dispute with the company misspelled the photographer's name.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/27/business/cost-of-insurance-for-cars-is-rising-across-the-nation.html?ref=allstatecorporation">COST OF INSURANCE FOR CARS IS RISING ACROSS THE NATION<date>Published: May 27, 2000</date><text>After falling for two years, car insurance premiums around the country are climbing once again, resuming a steady quarter-century rise.Several big insurers -- including Progressive, Geico, State Farm and Allstate -- have begun imposing higher prices, and analysts say that by the end of the year most other leading companies are likely to follow suit. The insurers said they were forced to act because of rising expenses for repairs and treatment of injuries.''The trend is clearly upward,'' said Thomas V. Cholnoky, who follows auto insurance for Goldman, Sachs.While the size of the increases has varied widely -- and some companies are still cutting prices -- rises of at least 4 to 5 percent have not been uncommon. And a few companies have raised prices in some states by more than 10 percent. Analysts and industry executives say they expect more of the same next year.In New York and Connecticut, the first signs of the shift are appearing. But the situation is less clear in New Jersey, where spending on car insurance -- averaging $1,150 a year a car, compared with $700 nationally -- has been the highest in the country. Last year the legislature took the unusual step of ordering a 15 percent cut in prices.While expenses for insurers may well be rising in New Jersey, as elsewhere, industry executives said it was difficult to predict whether those costs would be offset by legislative changes aimed at reducing fraud and litigation and, if not, to what extent political leaders would permit price increases.Consumer advocates say the increases may not be justified. J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America, said that while some costs were rising, expenses for insurers, over all, were still declining.Americans spent an estimated $126 billion last year on car insurance, which is mandatory in all states. That was nearly four times what they paid to insure their homes. There are many more claims involving cars and passengers than for homes, though, and liability claims in the hundreds of thousands of dollars are much more common in car crashes than in incidents related to homes.Besides raising prices, insurers are reducing or eliminating discounts and screening applicants more carefully so that they apply the highest rates to the riskiest drivers and simply refuse to sell to some. Several companies have also been hacking away at administrative expenses, with layoffs in some cases.</text></article>
