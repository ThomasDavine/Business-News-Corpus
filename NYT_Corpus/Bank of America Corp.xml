The bank’s shares have been battered recently amid fears about the effect of the debt crisis in Europe and other worries that have been hanging over financial companies. The exchange, which could involve up to 400 million common shares, could allow the bank to raise $2.76 billion, based on Thursday’s closing price of $6.91. Brian T. Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, has long maintained that additional share sales are not necessary to raise capital. Bank officials said the move was not driven solely by the need to increase its capital cushion, but was also an opportunity to reduce debt and interest expenses. The plan was outlined Thursday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A decision is not final, but the bank is likely to go ahead with the exchange shortly, according to one official. By saving money on interest payments on the preferred shares, the move to issue new common shares would not reduce earnings and could actually add to earnings in the short term, the bank said in its filing. In addition, swapping shares of common stock for the preferred shares will add to the bank’s Tier 1 capital base, because under international regulatory standards preferred stock does not count as common equity while common stock does. Because the preferred stock is trading below par value, Bank of America can buy it back from investors at a price above where it is trading, yielding a gain for those shareholders. But because it is still below par, it allows Bank of America to book a gain on the difference. “We want to exchange one form of capital, which is very expensive, for another, which counts toward our Tier 1 common equity on terms that are economically favorable to us,” said Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for the bank. “Our goal is to have the strongest balance sheet we can have, and this is an important step.” Shares of Bank of America have fallen nearly 50 percent in 2011, as the bank faces tens of billions of dollars in liabilities for its role in the subprime mortgage mess as well as a slowdown in other parts of its business. Further increasing the number of shares outstanding from the current level of 10.1 billion is unlikely to win favor with investors. As a result, Bank of America’s stock fell nearly 2 percent in after-hours trading. This is the second time this week that the company has reversed course. On Tuesday, Bank of America announced it was calling off plans to impose a $5 fee on debit cardholders after an uproar by consumers as well as politicians in Washington. Under Mr. Moynihan’s leadership, Bank of America has been busy shedding noncore assets and raising capital. In August, it sold half its stake in the China Construction Bank, adding $3.5 billion to Tier 1 capital. It is now the nation’s second-biggest bank, having recently lost the top spot to JPMorgan Chase. The billionaire Warren E. Buffett invested $5 billion in the company in August by buying preferred shares. That deal did not count toward Tier 1 capital but was widely seen as a crucial endorsement of Bank of America’s management team amid growing doubts among investors. His shares would not be affected by the bank’s latest plan. Shareholders are sensitive about issuing new common stock because it dilutes the bank’s earnings per share. In this case, the dilution equals about 4 percent. Bank of America’s share count exploded after the financial crisis of 2008, because the company used stock to buy Merrill Lynch and also issued shares to pay the government back for two bailouts totaling $45 billion. The deal with Mr. Buffett could cause a 5 percent dilution and that, along with the 4 percent dilution from the plan announced Thursday, means “shareholders are being nickel and dimed here,” said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer.</text></article>

Only a month earlier, the bank had announced the new charge, immediately setting off a huge uproar from consumers. Despite an outpouring of complaints online and at branch offices, the bank had remained steadfast in its plans until last Friday, according to a person briefed on the situation, planning to ease just some of the conditions for avoiding the fee. But over the weekend, after two major competitors — Wells Fargo and the nation’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase — said they were backing away from their plans to levy similar charges, two high-ranking Bank of America officers recommended to Brian Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, that the bank simply drop the fee. Then, on Monday morning, when SunTrust, a regional bank in Atlanta, said that it, too, would abandon its $5 charge, Bank of America was left standing alone, the last major bank planning the fee. The announcement came on Tuesday. “We have listened to our customers very closely over the last few weeks and recognize their concern with our proposed debit usage fee,” David Darnell, co-chief operating officer at Bank of America, said in a statement. “As a result, we are not currently charging the fee and will not be moving forward with any additional plans to do so.” The revenue the bank expected to raise from the debit fee was not worth the damage to its reputation, the person briefed on the matter said. The bank never disclosed how many of its customers would have been affected by the fee. It also declined on Tuesday to comment on how many had closed their accounts after the original announcement, but sources close to the bank said that account closures were higher than usual. And smaller institutions like PerkStreet said that their account acquisition rate had spiked in the days afterward. Besides Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and SunTrust, Regions Financial has also said it would roll back its debit fee as of Tuesday and reimburse customers for any charges incurred. All along, though, Bank of America took the brunt of the criticism, and apparently, it was not just the debit fee that caused consumers to lash out. For Grace Anderson, of Madison, Wis., the bank’s recent decision to cut 30,000 job positions had prompted her to close a checking account. “I cannot in good conscience invite them into my house and my life,” she said, adding that she had moved her account to USAA, a federal savings bank. The new fees were part of an effort by the banks to raise revenue lost elsewhere. On Oct. 1, a new federal rule went into effect that limits the fees banks can levy on merchants every time a consumer swipes a debit card to make a purchase. The new limit is expected to cost the banks about $6.6 billion in revenue a year, beginning in 2012, according to Javelin Strategy and Research. That comes on top of another loss, of $5.6 billion, from new rules restricting overdraft fees, which were widely seen as onerous and went into effect in July 2010. Now that all the large banks have decided not to impose the debit fee, experts said, they will find other ways to fill the hole. “Those revenues paid for a lot of things,” said Joe Gillen, chief executive of Pinnacle Financial Strategies, a bank consultant in Houston. Now, he said, consumers can expect more fees over time. “It will be slow and gradual, but they will bring those revenues back,” Mr. Gillen said. What he said was most frustrating, however, was that the banks were penalized for their openness. The fees the banks were trying to replace — the so-called swipe fees — were not readily apparent, even though all consumers were ultimately paying them in higher costs at the cash register. Now, Mr. Gillen said, the banks “are going to have to hide the fees and the customers will still have to pay them.” But those customers may have found their voice, which has been amplified by social media. “People can now use tools like Change.org, Facebook and Twitter to rapidly organize and collectively act to influence the policies of even the largest companies,” said Ben Rattray, founder of Change.org, which allows consumers to start grass-roots campaigns using its online platform. He pointed to Molly Katchpole, a 22-year-old woman from Washington who collected more than 300,000 signatures opposing the fee by using his company’s platform. And then there is the grass-roots effort that is calling for this coming Saturday to be “Bank Transfer Day,” where customers of big banks move their accounts to community banks and credit unions. Mr. Rattray and other consumer advocates said the outcry was about much more than fees. “Bank of America’s new debit card fee was the last straw for many consumers who are tired of banks that got bailed out that are now turning around and hiking fees,” said Norma Garcia, manager of Consumer Union’s financial services program. “There was this phenomenon with banks and others confusing passivity with loyalty. And consumers are saying, ‘You can’t take us for granted anymore.’ ” Lawmakers also openly criticized Bank of America’s planned fee. Days after the bank announced that it would charge the fee, President Obama said customers should not be “mistreated” in pursuit of profit, while Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the move “incredibly tone deaf.” And Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, spoke out on the Senate floor, urging consumers to vote with their feet. He had sponsored the rule, known as the Durbin amendment, that limited the amount banks could charge for debit card transactions. On Tuesday, he took to the floor again. “What we have at work here is a very fundamental principle of our economy, the free market economy, transparency,” he said. “So people know what they are being charged. So they have a choice.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 1, 2011 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Bank of America as the nationâs largest bank. JPMorgan Chase has overtaken Bank of America in assets, according to third-quarter results released in October.</text></article>

Customers who hold Bank of America credit cards, directly deposit wages into the bank or hold a minimum balance will not be charged under a new plan. Previously, the bank said the minimum balance required to avoid the fee was $20,000, but lowering that minimum is also possible. The hesitation at Bank of America comes as other banks are also pulling back, at least for now. Wells Fargo said Friday that it was canceling a test that would have imposed a $3-a-month charge on debit card holders in Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, Washington and Oregon. JPMorgan Chase, which was testing a $3-a-month charge, has decided it will not impose a stand-alone debit card use fee, a person briefed on the situation said. Bank of America officials were caught off guard after the planned $5 fee was disclosed late last month. Days later, President Obama said customers should not be “mistreated” in pursuit of profit, while Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the move “incredibly tone deaf.” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, took the unusual step of denouncing the bank on the Senate floor, urging customers, “Vote with your feet. Get the heck out of that bank.” Despite the apparent change of heart, banks are likely to continue to find ways to make up for billions in lost revenue because of new federal regulations that sharply reduce the fees paid to the banks by merchants when consumers use debit cards. At the same time, other bank businesses, like lending and sales and trading, have been anemic. Besides losing an estimated $6 billion from the reduction in the so-called swipe fees, the industry faces the disappearance of billions of dollars from the end of overdraft penalty fees.</text></article>

A new report from Javelin Strategy &amp; Research finds that only a little more than half of consumers who try to do so are successful. The other half meet with frustration and a quarter abandon the process, Javelin’s report says. The finding doesn’t bode well for banks, especially larger ones, that are facing a great deal of consumer backlash of late, especially over the growth in user fees. Most people apply for accounts online because they expect it to be faster and more convenient (and possibly cheaper, for online-only accounts) than doing it over the phone or visiting a branch, says Mark Schwanhausser, a senior financial services analyst with Javelin. (There may also be, Bucks suspects, a risk for smaller banks and credit unions hoping to win new accounts on the coming “Bank Transfer Day” on Nov. 5. If their online account-opening process isn’t smooth, some prospective new customers could give up in frustration.) As part of the research for the report, a team of Javelin “secret shoppers” tried out the online application process for various types of accounts at 10 major banks, as well as five other institutions including credit unions and online banks, and found convenience sorely lacking in some cases. Some banks boasting of online applications actually direct customers to download paper application forms for submission. At ING Direct and Wells Fargo, the report found, some online applications are restricted to existing customers. In the case of Wells Fargo, for instance, existing customers were allowed to apply online for a credit card, but newcomers were directed to apply at a branch. At Citibank, an application for a home-equity line of credit led to a “cycle of frustrating links” that forced the user to call a bank representative on the phone for help. (Citibank corrected the navigation problem shortly after the interaction, the report notes.) In another case, Bank of America seemed overly aggressive in following up on an online application. A Javelin researcher began an online application for a mortgage at Bank of America, providing contact information as an initial step, but abandoned the process before completion. Within a minute, a bank sales representative called on the telephone. While that might make sense from the bank’s perspective, Mr. Schwanhausser said, it could unnerve some applicants. “If you’re trying to be anonymous in shopping habits, it could be jarring or even somewhat creepy,” he said. Have you opened an account online recently? What was your experience?</text></article>

With the bank shrinking its balance sheet and selling off assets, the company, based in Charlotte, N.C., surrendered its title as the country's biggest bank Tuesday, another sign of how a money-losing giant assembled over decades is being reshaped into a smaller and, investors hope, more profitable institution. Bank of America, with $2.22 trillion in assets reported Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings, is now second to JPMorgan Chase, which has $2.29 trillion assets. It also ranks second to JPMorgan Chase in terms of branches and total deposits. Analysts said it was more evidence of how Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, is reversing the legacy of his controversial predecessor, Ken Lewis, an empire builder who craved being the biggest in United States banking and whose creation ultimately needed two federal bailouts to survive the financial crisis. ''There's been a huge philosophical change in who they want to be,'' said Mike Mayo, a veteran bank analyst with Credit Agricole Securities. ''This is a milestone that marks the end of a two-decade-long period during which they aspired and eventually became the largest bank.'' In today's slow-growth economy, though, bigger is not necessarily better. And the challenges Bank of America still faces were evident in the numbers it released Tuesday. Buoyed by one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, Bank of America reported a $6.23 billion profit for the third quarter, but the headline number camouflaged weak results in many of its businesses. Still, investors cheered the news, pushing the bank's shares up 10 percent to $6.64 a share. Although its investment bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has been a crucial source of profit recently as other businesses like mortgage lending hemorrhaged money, the slow trading environment and financial uncertainty in Europe caused trading revenue to drop. The company's global banking and markets revenue fell to $5.2 billion from $7 billion, and the unit reported a $302 million loss in the third quarter, a sharp contrast to the $1.46 billion gain a year ago. Mr. Mayo estimated that the bank's underlying core revenues dropped 17 percent, as other businesses like global commercial banking, card services and consumer real estate services also posted declines from a year ago. One exception was the company's wealth management business, where revenue and net income both rose. Still, the story behind the $6.23 billion profit was mostly a tale of one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, including $4.5 billion from positive adjustments to the value of its outstanding debt, a $1.7 billion accounting gain on the perceived riskiness of its debt and a pretax gain of $3.6 billion from the sale of half its stake in China Construction Bank. ''It's not like 2007 or 2008 where there are losses that threaten the bank's capital's position,'' said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. ''But nothing was particularly great and trading was very weak.'' Without the special items, Bank of America would have earned about $2.7 billion, which included pulling back $1.7 billion it had set aside, largely for borrowers who fail to pay their consumer and credit card loans. Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital, counted 15 special items in the quarter, down from 16 in the second quarter but more than the 12 in the first quarter. ''It's a big company undergoing a transformation.'' The bank reported net income of 56 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.3 billion or 77 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts had been expecting the bank to earn 28 cents a share in the third quarter. Revenue rose to $28.7 billion from $26.9 billion, although that too was pumped by one-time gains. For investors, the red ink flowing from Bank of America's disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant, remains the biggest worry. Both the federal government and private investors are seeking compensation for tens of billions of dollars in losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages.</text></article>

For investors, the red ink flowing from Bank of America’s disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant, remains the biggest worry. Both the federal government and private investors are seeking compensation for tens of billions of dollars in losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages. Part of the reason investors breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday was that the red ink from subprime mortgages eased in the last quarter. Provisions for so-called put-backs, in which investors try to force the bank to buy back soured mortgages by arguing they were improperly originated and bundled into securities, fell to $278 million. In the second quarter, these provisions totaled a whopping $14 billion, including an $8 deal billion with investors that include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Litigation costs fell to $290 million from $1.5 billion in the second quarter. In 2006, Bank of America surpassed Citigroup to become the biggest bank by market capitalization, an event that can be seen as a high-water mark of Mr. Lewis’s era. Today, its $67 billion market value lags Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Bruce R. Thompson, the company’s chief financial officer, said he expected assets to keep shrinking in the coming months, as some loans come due and are not renewed and the company’s Canadian credit card business is sold in the fourth quarter. “We’re not focused on the size of the balance sheet, what we’re focused on is getting the balance sheet that’s best for our customers and best for us,” he said. In fact, while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup showed slight growth in terms of total loans in the third quarter, Bank of America’s overall loan portfolio declined by about 0.9 percent compared with the second quarter, Mr. Goldberg noted. The company’s headcount is also set to drop sharply from the 290,509 recorded during the third quarter. Roughly 2,000 employees were told last quarter their jobs were being eliminated, and 30,000 more are set to go over the next three years as part of Project New BAC, an efficiency initiative aimed at cutting $5 billion in expenses in its first phase. Mr. Moynihan defended Bank of America’s controversial new $5-a-month debit card fee Tuesday, arguing that customers who bring more of their banking business to the company will be able to avoid it.</text></article>

The bank put its exposure to Greece at $485 million, most of it in loans that don’t include the country’s government debt, and more than $10 billion total exposure to Italy and Spain.

It had net income of $6.2 billion, or 56 cents per share, but that is not the part I found most interesting in a quick review of the numbers. Instead it is the progress, or lack of same, in getting past all the bad mortgages it sold into securitizations. FLOYD NORRIS Notions on high and low finance. In the quarter, the bank set aside only $278 million for representations and warranties claims. It is that number, not the $1.79 billion in charge-offs in the quarter, that affects reported profit. I say “only $278 million” because that is the lowest quarterly figure for additions to that reserve at least since the fourth quarter of 2009, which is the first number I could find in a quick review of prior reports. Here’s the trend: Q4 2009: $516 million Q1 2010: $526 million Q2 2010: $1.248 billion Q3 2010: $872 million Q4 2010: $4.140 billion Q1 2011: $1.013 billion Q2 2011: $14.037 billion Q3 2011: $278 million. On its face, this is good news, a sign the problem is receding. After all, there was a limited number of representations and warranties that Bank of America — and more importantly Countrywide Financial — made, and someday the problem has to be over. The second-quarter provision was a huge one, a deliberate effort to take all the bad medicine there was. But the decline was not because new claims have dried up. They amounted to $3.8 billion in the quarter, $99 million more than in the previous quarter. In a commentary, the bank says the new claims come mainly from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises. (You can find that commentary on Page 31 of the bank’s release.) The demands from Fannie and Freddie, the bank says, “have become increasingly inconsistent with our interpretation of our contractual obligations.” The process, it would appear, is getting nastier. The low provision does not mean final settlements are near. One more note: Of the new claims in the quarter, $164 million came from mortgages sold in 2009 or later, a figure that is higher than in any of the previous quarters. That is well after Bank of America took over Countrywide, and after the mortgage market collapsed. It sounds like Fannie and Freddie are saying that bad practices continued.</text></article>

Tedd Speck, a 49-year-old market researcher in Kent, Conn., was furious about Bank of America’s planned $5 monthly fee for debit card use. But he is staying put after being overwhelmed by the inconvenience of moving dozens of online bill paying arrangements to another bank. “I’m really annoyed,” he said, “but someone at Bank of America made that calculation and they made it right.” Former bankers and market researchers say that it’s no accident. The steady expansion of online bill paying, they say, has emboldened Bank of America, as well as rivals like Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and SunTrust, to turn to new fees on customer accounts as other sources of revenue dry up. The fees have caused an uproar among consumers and drawn sharp criticism from politicians, including President Obama. “The technology locks you in and they’re keenly aware of it,” said Robert Smith, who was chief executive of Security Pacific when it was bought by Bank of America in 1992. “It’s very hard for consumers to just ditch that.” For years, banks have openly sought to attach as many loans and services as they can to a customer, like credit cards, mortgages and mobile phone banking. What they haven’t mentioned are marketing studies like the one commissioned by Fiserv, which develops online bill paying systems, showing that using the Internet to pay bills, do automatic deductions and send electronic checks reduced customer turnover for banks by up to 95 percent in some cases. With 44 million households having used the Internet to pay a bill in the past 30 days — up from 32 million five years ago and projected to reach 55 million by 2016 — it’s a shift that has major ramifications for competition. There’s even evidence that fewer consumers are switching banks, with 7 percent of them estimated to be moving their primary account to a different institution in 2011, down from 12 percent last year, according to surveys by Javelin Strategy and Research. Emmett Higdon, a consultant who managed Citibank’s online bill payment product from 2004 to 2007, said that “for the consumer, it’s a double-edged sword.” While customers value the convenience, inside the industry “it was known that it would be a powerful retention tool. That’s why online bill paying went free in the first place. Inertia is powerful in the banking industry.” Bank of America today has 29 million account holders banking online and 15 million using the service to pay bills, but company officials say there is no connection between the stickiness of Internet bill paying and the decision to impose the $5 monthly debit card fee. “People like online bill pay, it’s convenient and safe,” said Anne Pace, a spokeswoman for the company. “The lower attrition rate that came along with it was simply a result of offering a valuable service.” The fee, she said, “allows us to continue offering the benefits that customers have come to expect from our debit card,” like fraud protection, overdraft prevention and a wide-reaching A.T.M. network. Asked if the bank calculated how many online-bill-pay customers a new fee could drive away, Ms. Pace said, “We did extensive research on how they would react to a new fee and whether it was fair.” The new fee will not apply to customers with a Bank of America mortgage or those who have an account balance of $20,000 or more. Members of Congress have taken notice of the fee uproar — and the ties that bind customers to their banks. “The difficulty of moving accounts is deliberate and unnecessary,” said Representative Brad Miller, who introduced a bill this month that would make it easier for customers to switch. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

But a new change in corporate policy change is likely to receive a much warmer reception. Starting next year, the nation's largest bank will begin reimbursing its employees with same-sex partners for the extra taxes they pay for health insurance - something that their married heterosexual co-workers don't have to worry about because the federal government recognizes them as an economic unit. A growing number of companies have begun to adopt the policy. Google was one of the earlier adopters, and several other technology companies, law firms, consultancies and others followed suit. But there are still only a handful of big financial services firms that have begun reimbursing their employees with same-sex partners. Last we checked, that group included Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas. Why is there even a need for such a policy? Under federal law, employer-provided health benefits for domestic partners are counted as taxable income, if the partner is not considered a dependent. On top of that, the employees cannot use pretax dollars to pay for their premiums - unlike their opposite-sex married counterparts. So while many big companies offer health insurance coverage for domestic partners, it costs employees more money to use it. To level the playing field among gay and heterosexual employees, many companies are covering the extra costs. Like several other firms, Bank of America is only covering the costs for same-sex partners and their dependents. Many companies choose only to cover same-sex couples since heterosexual domestic partners have the option to marry and avoid the extra taxes. The banking giant will provide the reimbursement once a year, and it will be calculated for each employee on an individual basis. ''We regularly review our benefits plans to ensure they meet the diverse needs of our employees,'' said Ferris Morrison, a spokeswoman for the bank. Do you think Bank of America's move will pressure other big financial firms to follow suit?

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/opinion/the-big-banks-falter.html?ref=bankofamericacorporation">The Big Banks Falter<date>Published: October 13, 2011</date><text>As the first of the major banks to report its earnings each quarter, JPMorgan Chase is a barometer of conditions in the financial industry. The mercury is falling.JPMorgan reported on Thursday that its third-quarter revenue had dropped by 11 percent from the second quarter; its profit fell by 4 percent from a year earlier. And since JPMorgan is arguably one of the nation’s healthier banks, results for firms like Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are likely to be considerably worse. These declines are worrisome in the sense that they reflect the weakness of the broader economy. Joblessness, damaged credit and falling home values have left people unable to borrow or to repay debt and businesses reluctant to hire and invest. But the results also reflect how the banks built profits abusing their customers. Long overdue federal restrictions on hidden overdraft charges and excessive debit card fees have begun to take a bite out of bank profits, and that should be happening. But the banks and their investors tend to see any rules and regulations that slow revenue growth as undue and overly burdensome, and they are pushing back. The question is whether lawmakers and regulators will stand up for the new fee restrictions and other rules as banks resist. Banks, habituated to gouging their customers, are already trying to recoup lost revenue with dubious new charges, like Bank of America’s $5 monthly fee for using a debit card. The move has infuriated customers and led President Obama to rightly warn against mistreatment of customers in the pursuit of profit. But Bank of America has yet to relent — a stubbornness that may be from of a belief that aggrieved customers won’t do better elsewhere. On Thursday, five Democratic congressmen led by Peter Welch of Vermont asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the big banks were engaging in “price signaling,” a form of collusion in the setting of prices. The big banks are also resisting proposed regulations on capital levels, derivatives and investing practices. If successfully implemented, the new rules will help to curb the kind of reckless trading and irresponsible lending that caused the crash and recession. That will slow revenue growth, but it is the price of a more stable system. The banks also have gotten themselves into a legal mess for which they have no one to blame but themselves. JPMorgan had to set aside another $1 billion last quarter to prepare for legal claims from investors who want to recoup their loss from mortgage bonds backed by bad loans. The banks face legal challenges from federal and state governments over foreclosure abuses and other mortgage-related issues. In all, analysts say mortgage problems could cost JPMorgan up to $9 billion. Bank of America, the most exposed of the big banks to mortgage-related litigation, is potentially on the hook for far more. Investors, meanwhile, are pricing banks’ stocks below the banks’ book value — a sign that they don’t believe the banks are worth what the banks say they are. The questions generally involve whether banks are properly valuing their loans and investments and the extent of their exposure to shaky European debt. Banks could fix this with increased and detailed disclosure. Government officials and regulators could compel that disclosure. The general failure on this front feeds the air of skepticism. One of the lessons from the financial crash is that there is no substitute for transparency. In the new earnings season, investors are still in the dark.</text></article>

Both its consumer and Wall Street businesses were hit hard by the still-anemic recovery in the United States. The bank made $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $4.4 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analysts’ consensus estimate of 96 cents a share. Shares of JPMorgan fell almost 5 percent on Thursday to $31.60. Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and chief executive, said that his bank had seen surprisingly few signs that consumers and businesses were retrenching. In fact, he pointed to a modest increase in credit card loans and a much sharper uptick in loan growth to small and midsize corporations as evidence the broader economy was doing much better than many had feared. In addition, loan losses appear to be stabilizing. “It hasn’t really strengthened, but the recovery is still here,” Mr. Dimon said in a conference call with journalists on Thursday. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release In one sign of confidence, the bank bought back more than $4.4 billion of shares and warrants during the third quarter. The paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter. That helped offset $1 billion the bank set aside in pretax funds to cover potential legal claims largely stemming from problems in its mortgage division. The bank also took a $542 million pretax loss in its private equity unit. Revenue remained under pressure, falling to $24.4 billion, or 11 percent, from the second quarter, amid a slowdown in stock and debt offerings that had propped up the bank’s results in the past. Difficult trading conditions, slimmer profit margins on lending, and the elimination of overdraft and other penalty fees all weighed on top-line growth. One thing that has not changed, however, is banker compensation. This year, workers at JPMorgan’s investment bank are on track to be paid, on average, about $389,000 per employee, up 4 percent from $369,000 per employee in 2010. Over all, the bank’s employees are poised to make about the same amount as they did in 2010 — an average of about $118,000 in salary, bonus, and other compensation. Star bankers and traders stand to reap millions. As a diversified bank and the first to report earnings, JPMorgan is seen as an indicator for the financial industry. It was among the first banks to prompt analysts to start cutting earnings estimates when it warned in early September of a sharp fall-off in its Wall Street businesses. The other big banks will report earnings next week; Citigroup and Wells Fargo are to release their results on Monday morning, and Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs follow later in the week. All are expected to report a similar slowdown in their investment banking businesses, with some analysts forecasting that Goldman Sachs will report its second quarterly loss as a public company. Investors are so concerned about the banks’ prospect for growth that they fled the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks are down more than 30 percent since January. Stagnant loan growth, higher capital requirements, and the reduction of once-lucrative debit card swipe fees are expected to take a big bite out of profits. What’s more, investors are increasingly nervous about the exposure of American banks to their counterparts in Europe, which have vast holdings of bonds backed by Greece and other nations with weak economies. The choppy markets weighed heavily on its JPMorgan’s investment bank’s results. Profits dropped 20 percent from the prior quarter, to $1.6 billion. Over all, trading revenue was down sharply from a year ago, when market conditions were much better. The bank’s large fixed-income and commodities operations fell 14 percent from the second quarter, while equities fell 15 percent, excluding the accounting gains taken on its debt. Investment banking fees fell 31 percent, as corporations shelved plans for acquisitions as well as stock and bonds deals, given all the uncertainty swirling in the markets. Those figures were roughly in line with guidance provided Wall Street in mid-September. Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan expected to eliminate around 1,000 jobs, largely through attrition. “We are building an investment bank for the long run but we always trim our sails,” he said. Chase Home Lending, the bank’s mortgage division, continues to bleed money. Losses have improved slightly, to around $900 million this quarter, but show few signs of letting up anytime soon. “We don’t expect a lot of improvement going forward in housing numbers,” Mr. Dimon said during the conference call. “It’s hard not to be cautious.” On top of that, Chase faces billions of dollars in potential legal claims stemming from the federal government and private investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage bonds backed by loans that quickly went sour. It might also have to pony up several billion dollars more as part of a settlement with federal and state regulators for its role in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure mess. Banking analysts say the mortgage problems could cost the bank up to $9 billion. The bank’s other major businesses fared a bit better, despite the looming concerns about the job and housing markets. Chase Card Services, its credit card lending arm, posted an $849 million profit, down 8 percent from last year. Chase’s large commercial banking unit booked a $571 million profit, amid an 18 percent uptick in lending to middle-market corporations. JPMorgan’s asset management unit posted a $385 million profit despite facing the same drop in trading-related activity as the investment bank.</text></article>

Change.org, the Web site where Molly Katchpole, 22, started a petition this week opposing the fee, said in a statement that Ms. Katchpole got a call from Andrew Plepler, Bank of America’s social responsibility and consumer policy executive. According to the statement, Ms. Katchpole asked him if the bank would drop the fee and Mr. Plepler said it was “premature” to answer that question. Later, a spokeswoman for the bank, Anne Pace, said in an e-mail: “We plan to implement the fee in early 2012.” “Please, do the right thing,” the petition says. “Reverse your decision to charge customers $5 each month for using their debit cards to make purchases.” Bank of America, along with other large banks, will soon add monthly fees to many accounts when customers shop with their debit cards. They have done this, they say, in response to federal caps on the amount banks can charge merchants for processing debit-card purchases. Bank of America said it would start charging the fees on some accounts starting in January, prompting an outcry from customers. Recently, Netflix reversed course on a change in its service after a wave of consumer outrage.</text></article>

Galvin, says money managers should disclose the value of the services they receive from big banks. Wall Street banks often boast that they hire the best and the brightest. Now, scrambling to bolster profits, they have become full-time headhunters for some of their biggest hedge fund clients, a role that is rife with potential conflicts. Big banks have long provided extra benefits to hedge funds, including finding office space for firms and raising money for new portfolios. They have even acted like informal recruiters for their premier clients by passing along résumés or making introductions to industry professionals. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink But those once-ancillary placement services have become established practices as Wall Street struggles to make up for profit centers that have been lost to new regulations and a weak economy. Since the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and others have become powerful recruiting forces for hedge funds. In an effort to secure lucrative brokerage and trading business, the banks scout finance executives, accountants and receptionists free. Goldman calls the practice “talent introduction.” Without the necessary disclosures and appropriate restrictions, the staffing services could prove controversial. For one, Wall Street firms risk provoking the ire of a client if they poach hedge fund talent or compete for the same potential employees. It also raises a question of loyalty; hedge fund executives may be swayed to direct business to the Wall Street firm that hired them rather than the bank that makes the best sense for investors. “We get put in this situation every day,” said Stuart Hendel, global head of prime brokerage at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which offers recruiting as part of its hedge fund services. The banks, he said, have “to walk a tight rope.” Banks say they have strict rules to prevent conflicts. Bank of America says it will not poach active employees of a current client. “All we’re doing is providing a clearinghouse for managers to meet prospective employees,” Mr. Hendel said. “We don’t go looking for people, people seem to find us. And we make it very clear we’re not providing recommendations.” Goldman said it disclosed its consulting services to clients and had “robust policies and procedures” to prevent conflicts of interest. “We are not in the headhunting business,” a spokeswoman for the firm, Andrea Raphael, said. “We do not solicit employees of one client to work at another client.” Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The practice renews concerns about how hedge funds indirectly pay for such secondary services. Government regulators have cracked down on these “soft dollar” arrangements — where a money manager steers business to a bank in exchange for perks. The deals can come at the expense of investors, who may be unaware of the relationship. Several years ago, Massachusetts’s chief financial regulator, William Galvin, took aim at so-called hedge fund hotels. At the time, Wall Street firms provided office space to up-and-coming money managers at below market rates in return for their trading business. As part of a settlement with UBS, investment advisers that leased real estate from the bank in the state had to provide written disclosure to current and prospective clients about the arrangement. It is unclear if hedge funds report their use of Wall Street staffing services. Mr. Galvin said that the money managers should disclose the value of the services they receive from big banks and the employees placed by banks. “It’s the type of relationship investors should know about, or simply shouldn’t exist,” Mr. Galvin said. As the industry has grown in size and stature, hedge funds have become an increasingly important source of revenue for Wall Street banks. Hedge funds, for example, account for an estimated 35 percent of trading commissions, according to Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. To distinguish themselves in the highly competitive business, banks — which provide credit and execute transactions for the big investors through their prime brokerage and trading divisions — have built out their suite of services. Recruiting was a natural extension. Wall Street firms, through their prime brokerage units, are involved in the daily operations of thousands of hedge funds, giving them a good sense of the industry turnover. After acting as informal recruiters for years, many banks formalized the process in recent years. The Wall Street firms have created rich databases that track hedge fund openings and potential candidates, with a small staff dedicated to the service. It is appealing for hedge funds. Traditional recruiters take as much as 25 percent of the hire’s first-year compensation. But Wall Street doesn’t charge anything. Richard Scardina, co-founder of the Atlantic Group, a professional search firm, said the banks were his biggest rivals. “It’s competition, but they are not going to put me out of business,” he said. “We specialize in recruitment day in and day out, and that is an edge that is hard to compete with.” Mostly, the banks’ staffing efforts focus on back-office and accounting functions, although the banks occasionally place investment professionals and research analysts. Glazer Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund with roughly $500 million, recently tapped Goldman to hire a staff member in its accounting division, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The potential landmines for banks are significant. The majority of people in Goldman’s database are out of work, according to executives at three hedge funds who have used the service. But the list, the people said, does include a small number of hedge fund employees looking to leave their jobs, because they’re unhappy or are looking to move to another part of the world. In such instances, banks could run the risk of poaching staff from their hedge fund clients, said Dick Del Bello, a senior partner at Conifer Group, a independent firm that provides administrative support to hedge funds. “The one thing they have to be careful of is, you don’t want to raid the henhouse,” he said. “You don’t want to go to client A and take someone actively there and send them to client B.” The practice could also have unwanted consequences for hedge funds. If the Wall Street bank knows a top executive wants to leave a firm, the departure could raise red flags about the health of the hedge fund, Mr. Del Bello said. The bank, in response, might decide to withdraw the fund’s credit, potentially forcing it to sell assets. Ms. Raphael of Goldman said that if the firm discovered something material, it “would discuss the matter and its implications with the client.” To Mr. Galvin, it comes down to disclosure. “If you are an investor, you want to know the manager is acting in your interest without an ulterior motive.”</text></article>

If a bank wants to send me yet another credit card application, or if the local discount store wants to make me an offer I can’t refuse, or if a charitable organization is requesting a contribution, let it pay full rather than “standard” rates. Second, with the subsequent reduction in “junk“ mail, delivery patterns could be adjusted to consolidate physical post offices. One of the postal service’s great contributions has been ZIP codes. These codes would allow a dynamic analysis of those delivery patterns: If a specific post office delivered a certain volume of mail to its existing set of ZIP codes before “standard” deliveries ended, how many ZIP codes could it now add to maintain the same volume? Frank Greene Tellico Village, Tenn., Oct. 2 Why Taxes ‘Must’ Climb To the Editor: In “The Problem With ‘No New Taxes’ ” (Economic View, Oct. 2) Tyler Cowen said that “taxes will eventually go up, because they must.” But one explanation for that “must” is not often heard: Our nation went to war in Afghanistan and Iran without raising taxes to pay for that war. On the contrary, President George W. Bush cut taxes, thereby further postponing the payment. As conservatives like to say, "There are no free lunches." So taxes must go up, not because of liberal profligacy or Keynesian theory, but simply because the time has come to pay the war bill. Manfred Weidhorn Fair Lawn, N.J.

That’s one good angle.Then there’s the “are we really supposed to start using cash again?” angle. Or the Durbin angle — Senator Dick Durbin being the Illinois senator whose amendment to the new financial reform law, imposing a steep reduction in bank interchange fees, “forced” banks to search for ways to make up for the lost revenue. There’s even a presidential angle, with President Obama saying on Monday that banks didn’t have “some inherent right” to a certain level of profits — and then more or less withdrawing the remark the next day. Me, I’m going with the gouging angle. The revenue that Bank of America, and many other banks, is seeking to replace with its new fees is lucre that a more honorable profession would never have touched in the first place. Indeed, 30 years ago, banks themselves would have turned their backs on it. Of course, back then, banks viewed customers as people to be helped, not marks to be taken advantage of. It was, to be sure, a different world then, with regulated interest rates, the Glass-Steagall Act preventing banks from getting into lucrative trading and a sleepy business model that valued a steady dividend over a highflying stock price. As interest rates were deregulated, Glass-Steagall abolished and investors demanding that bank stocks perform like Internet stocks, that ethos changed. Banks began looking in some dark corners for new revenue; this is when hidden fees began to creep into credit-card agreements, for instance. In retail banking, two new fees became crucial. One was overdraft fees, which gouged the least-sophisticated, least-wealthy customers by charging them $35 or so whenever their accounts were overdrawn. The second source was interchange fees, which gouged merchants who accepted debit cards. Though merchants at first resisted debit cards, they eventually caved because banks made them so ubiquitous. Banks pushed debit cards in part because they are much less expensive to process than checks (which banks lose money on). But banks also got hooked on the absurdly high interchange fees they charged merchants — an average of 44 cents per transaction, even though it costs literally pennies to process a debit-card transaction. In the summer of 2010, the Federal Reserve told the banking industry it could no longer charge overdraft fees unless customers “opted in.” To its ever-lasting credit, Bank of America, unlike its competitors, did not run a big scare campaign to persuade customers to agree to the opt-in. It chose to forgo the revenue, which amounted to some $3.3 billion, according to Credit Suisse. The Durbin amendment tackled interchange fees. It called on the Federal Reserve to cap the fees at a level that “reasonably” accounted for the cost of processing transactions. Although the Fed’s final number was still ridiculously high — well over 20 cents — it will, nonetheless, cost Bank of America another $2 billion. The news that Bank of America will impose the new debit card fee has infuriated many of its 50 million customers. But the bank insists that it’s not trying to alienate its customer base. Rather, a spokesman told me, the fee is part of “a much larger reconfiguration of our consumer business.” Next year, it plans to roll out a series of new offerings, most of which will be fee-based. Customers will be able to evade the fees only by maintaining large balances at all times. One suspects that these new fees will only generate more anger, for they will make plain what has long been hidden: that, fundamentally, retail banking makes its money by gouging the have-nots. Post-financial crisis, the essence of big banking has not changed. It’s just become more obvious. President Obama got it right the first time: Banks don’t have an inherent right to oversized profits. No industry does. Banks play a special role in society, and they get special protections from the government. In return, government has the right to impose special responsibilities. Every person needs a bank, no matter how rich or poor. The government will never force Bank of America — or any other bank — to reduce or eliminate its fees; it doesn’t have the nerve. But, at the least, it could insist that banks display their fees in a uniform way so that customers can compare how they’re being gouged and make banking decisions on that basis. That kind of reform could stir competition and bring down fees. This, of course, is precisely what the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is supposed to do — and would do if the Senate Republicans would ever allow a director to be approved. But, sigh, that’s a column for another day.</text></article>

His response? He ranted and raved and suggested that consumers “get the heck out of that bank.” But even as Bank of America and other institutions are adding fees and other restrictions, a company called PerkStreet, which you may have read about in this column before, is hoping that those Bank of America customers will run to its Web site. PerkStreet gives checking account customers as much as 2 percent back on their purchases when they use its debit cards. Meanwhile, a company called BancVue works with community banks and credit unions to offer checking accounts that can yield more than 3 percent in interest on deposits for people who use their debit cards a lot. Soon, the company asserts, the total number of branches among all of the institutions that offer its rewards checking accounts will equal that of the 10th-largest bank in America. So the big banks make you pay, and the most aggressive of the little institutions want to pay you. What on earth is going on here, and can this possibly continue? First, let’s be clear about what we talk about when we talk about free checking. As Ron Shevlin, an analyst at Aite Group, explains it, you can just as easily make a case that free checking will always exist as you can that it never existed in the first place. “If I bring enough money and accounts, they are not going to charge me,” he said. “They would be crazy to.” Indeed, that is still the case with Bank of America. If you have a mortgage with the bank or $20,000 on deposit, the $5 fee will not apply. Even when nearly everyone had free checking several years ago, however, there were all sorts of questionable activities going on behind the scenes to pay for it. Overdraft fees were a big one. A.T.M. fees for using the wrong machine were also lucrative. And then there are the merchants who have generally paid far more to the banks for the privilege of accepting their debit cards than the service actually costs. Those fees helped pay for free checking, but they probably contributed to slightly higher prices in the store. The outrage over those merchant fees is what led Senator Durbin and his colleagues to limit what financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets can collect from merchants when customers use debit cards. Any checking account provider smaller than that, including PerkStreet and BancVue’s partners, can continue collecting higher fees. Because they get more fees, it helps them offer better checking account terms. Indeed, both companies are built in no small part on the backs of those merchants and the fees that they pay. PerkStreet offers a free checking account and 2 percent back on all debit card purchases (with no monthly or annual limits) to people who keep an average of $5,000 in a checking account. On days when you fall below that figure, you get 1 percent back, which is still a good deal for a debit card program. Dan O’Malley, PerkStreet’s co-founder, would not say what percentage of customers regularly earned 2 percent, though he said that the number was “meaningful.” I’d guess it’s less than half. He achieves further savings by handing out the refunds only via gift cards, most of which he obtains at a discount to face value. The catch for PerkStreet customers is that they have to sign for their purchases to get the rewards. (Recurring charges on the debit card from monthly billers earn rewards, too.) If customers punch in a PIN instead, PerkStreet usually gets less in fees from the merchants, so it generally doesn’t give customers rewards when they do that. Mr. O’Malley also would not say how many accounts the company had at the moment. As big banks have made changes in recent months, however, PerkStreet has tripled its account acquisition rate, he said. Last Friday, the day after Bank of America announced the $5 fee, the acquisition rate doubled again. On Saturday, it doubled yet again. BancVue’s checking accounts, which it encourages bank and credit union customers to call “Kasasa,” can offer high interest or rewards, depending on which platforms the partner institution wants to adopt. The banks and credit unions decide how much interest to pay, and it can top 3 percent these days. The catch is that they generally limit how much money you can deposit to earn that rate, and you have to use your debit card at least 10 or 15 times a month. Most don’t require customers to sign for purchases, though. The theory here is that once you make people use the debit card 10 or 15 times a month, they’ll put it at the top of their wallet and use it 20 or 30 times a month. So whether they sign or use a PIN, enough money rolls in from the merchants to pay for the high interest. (Some people may overdraw their accounts more often with heavy use, which also helps on the profitability front.) In reality, according to Carolyn Jordan, a senior vice president at Neighborhood Credit Union, which has branches in and around Dallas, only half of people who sign up for its Kasasa accounts will make the required number of debit transactions in any given month. If they don’t, they earn less, so that helps sustain the program. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/opinion/debit-card-fees-are-robbery.html?ref=bankofamericacorporation">Debit Card Fees Are Robbery<date>Published: October 6, 2011</date><text>WHEN Bank of America told its customers recently that it would start charging them $5 a month to use debit cards, it argued that it was forced to make that change because of regulations that altered the economics of the cards. Other banks agreed. The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, put the effects of the regulations this way: “If you’re a restaurant and you can’t charge for the soda, you’re going to charge more for the burger.” Both banks were responding to the Federal Reserve’s actions to limit the interchange fees banks charge stores each time a debit card is used for a purchase.But the banks’ simplistic statements are merely an attempt to rationalize and obfuscate one of the largest illegal transfers of wealth from consumers to banks in American history. Debit cards were developed by banks as a replacement for paper checks. When a consumer pays with a debit card instead of a check, the bank saves money. In the 1980s, Visa calculated the savings at 55 cents to $1.60 per check. The savings is much higher today. For decades, Bank of America, the founding owner and member of Visa (originally called BankAmericard) and all of the Visa and MasterCard banks, including Chase, hid the identity of their debit cards from stores by designing them to look and function like their signature authorized credit cards and by charging stores the same price for debit and credit transactions. Banks did this despite the fact that purchases made with a debit card didn’t involve a loan from the bank, posed very little fraud risk and were extravagantly profitable to banks because they eliminated the costs of processing and clearing checks. The practice of deceiving stores and forcing them to accept overpriced debit transactions was challenged in a 1996 antitrust lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard, in which I was the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. In 2003, that resulted in a $3.4 billion settlement to stores, a court order to redesign the debit cards and a reduction in the price banks charge stores for common debit transactions — to an average of 42 cents per transaction from an average of 63 cents. However, that lower price was still much too high, as the Federal Reserve well knew. The Fed had been established in 1913 in large measure to end the then widespread practice of banks’ charging a similar “interchange” fee for the use of paper checks. Those check interchange fees were slowing the growth of interstate commerce, and the Fed quickly prohibited them. The interchange fees that banks now charge stores for debit transactions are economically and functionally identical to the check interchange fees prohibited by the Fed almost a century ago. When A.T.M. cards were first used at stores as point-of-sale debit cards, no interchange fees were charged. In many instances debit card networks like Shazam and Tyme actually paid stores to accept debit transactions. They did this so banks, which owned the networks, could reap the huge profits of eliminating checks. But Bank of America, Chase and their Visa/MasterCard partners wanted to have their burgers and eat them, too. They instituted the illegal practices challenged and eliminated in the Visa Check antitrust litigation. Later, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the Fed to continue the process of addressing high and anticompetitive debit interchange fees by examining whether the banks could justify those fees on the basis of the costs banks incurred in processing debit card transactions. After initially deciding that debit interchange fees should be lowered from 44 cents to 7 to 12 cents, the Fed, in yet another huge handout to big banks, revised the fee range to 21 to 24 cents. That is the change in economics which Bank of America cites as it attempts to begin charging a large new fee to its debit cardholders. It’s a free country, but also one where competition is supposed to prevail and prevent companies, including banks, from simply raising the price of their burgers without suffering the competitive consequences. Recently, Netflix learned that a company can’t adopt a big price increase without suffering the consequences. When it tried to, it lost hundreds of thousands of its customers. Retail customers of Bank of America and of any other bank that follows its lead should swiftly move their business. I am certain that other banks will welcome the competitive opportunity that Bank of America has given them with its arrogant and disingenuous action and justification.

The problems first cropped up on Friday, a day after the bank, the nation’s largest, announced it would impose a new $5 a month charge for some debit cardholders. But Mr. Owen insisted the problems were not caused by hackers unhappy with the new fee or by efforts to flood the site with traffic as a protest, a strategy called a denial-of-service attack. “Everything we know does not point to third-party intervention,” he said. Along with hundreds of internal analysts and technical staff, Mr. Owen said the bank had also been consulting with federal law enforcement officials and outside industry experts to get to the root of the Web troubles. The problems were at their worst on Friday — the day after the $5 fee was announced — but Mr. Owen pointed to other causes like weekly paydays and federal government disbursements at the beginning of the month for the increase in visitors to the site. “It’s a series of events that have converged,” Mr. Owen said. Besides the increased traffic, Mr. Owen said the company was in the middle of an effort to replace an old computer system while also offering customers new options when they used the site. The combination of factors made the problem more time-consuming to fix. As the company identified and fixed individual bottlenecks, he said, other problems would spring up elsewhere, delaying the effort to get the Web site working normally again. “Sometimes, it’s as simple as fixing a box or changing a setting. But that’s not the case in this instance.” The Bank of America Web site had 24.3 million unique visitors in August, according to data compiled by comScore, several million more than rivals like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Capital One.</text></article>

Brooks/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA Countrywide branch in Sun City, Arizona in 2007. Over the past weeks, it has become quite common to speculate that Bank of America might solve its “Countrywide problem” by putting the mortgage unit into bankruptcy to escape some liabilities and litigation losses. Bloomberg News has reported on the idea, and so has Dealbook’s Deal Professor. One thing that has not been discussed is how such a bankruptcy would come out very differently for two groups that otherwise have the same basic legal rights against Countrywide Financial. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink I am speaking here of the Countrywide bondholders on the one hand, and those who have various tort claims (like claims for fraud), on the other. During the height of the financial crisis, the Bank of America Corporation, the financial holding company that is at the top of the BofA pyramid, guaranteed more than $16 billion of Countrywide debt. The 8-K filing announcing the move is set forth below. This means that a Countrywide bankruptcy would only address its total debt picture if it also involved a bankruptcy of the bank’s holding company. That appears quite unlikely and it would be quite messy, since the holding company is no doubt a “credit support provider” on countless derivatives on the Merrill Lynch side of the company — maybe on the bank side as well. A bankruptcy filing by a credit support provider would set off a right to terminate in all these swaps. That means the bank would essentially be stuck in a place not unlike that of Lehman Brothers’ parent company, where lots of counterparties terminate the swaps if it is in their interest, and others simply refuse to perform. In short, a filing by the parent company would be highly unattractive. That would leave a bankruptcy filing for just Countrywide only. But that also would mean that Bank of America would have to make good on the guarantee to the bondholders. Bondholders have the benefit of the guarantee, but other creditors — like those who argue that Countrywide committed fraud in connection with their mortgages or foreclosures — do not. In short, bondholders would be repaid what they are owed in any Countrywide bankruptcy. Others are not likely to be so lucky. Bank of America 8-K Filing on Countrywide Financial Stephen J.

Bank of America’s Web site continued to be troubled by sporadic problems on Wednesday, as has been the case in five of the last six days. Visitors to the site were greeted with a different message on Wednesday: “We value your business and appreciate your continued patience. Most of our site is working normally, but you may experience occasional delays.” After running slowly for much of Tuesday, the Web site seemed to return to normal on Tuesday night. But the slowdown developed again Wednesday morning. The difficulties have tended to recur during periods of higher traffic, only to resolve during off-peak times. The problems first cropped up on Friday, a day after the bank, the nation’s largest, announced it would impose a new $5 a month charge on some debit cardholders. But a bank official insisted the problems were not caused by hackers angered by the new fee or efforts to flood the site with traffic as a protest, a strategy called a denial of service attack. In a statement on Wednesday, the bank said: “Our online banking systems are available to customers. Given the last few days, we are rigorously monitoring our online banking system and chose to continue deploying an alternate home page to ensure that customers get to the right destination quickly.” The problems have been intermittent since Friday, continuing on Saturday but clearing up Sunday, only to return Monday. The site’s problems were magnified for many bank customers because they typically pay their bills in the first part of the month. “Financial institutions live and die by their ability to do online banking,” said Mark Rasch, a former federal computer crime prosecutor now with CSC, an information technology services firm. The breakdown has already caused some longtime customers to take their business elsewhere. “How hard is it to maintain a Web site?” asked Mark Hugh Miller, a writer in Los Angeles who has been a Bank of America customer for 40 years but said he planned to switch his checking account to a local credit union. Mr. Miller said he first encountered problems on Sunday night when he tried to log on and see if a check he had written had cleared. He finally managed to get through on Tuesday morning. “It wasn’t just slowness,” he said. “Sometimes, the site never opened. Other times, it was unresponsive.” While nearly all highly trafficked consumer sites encounter slowdowns from time to time, the length of the difficulties at Bank of America’s Web site is unusual, technology experts said. “Today is the fourth day,” said Ken Godskind, vice president for monitoring products at SmartBear Software. “This is an awfully long time for something to be going on.” If the problems were not caused by hackers or an attack, other causes might be a surge in traffic connected to the new $5 fee or a change or upgrade to the bank’s internal system that unexpectedly slowed the site, Mr. Godskind said. He said the times when the site was working, like Sunday, tend to be low-traffic periods.</text></article>

The Web site started having problems on Friday, a day after Bank of America said it would start charging a $5 monthly fee for customers who use debit cards. The site was slower than usual, and some customers trying to log on received error messages. The bank said on Friday that the site had been fixed. But problems continued into Saturday.

The caller was telling a banker in Chicago that none other than Mr. Buffett wanted to reach the chief executive of Bank of America, ASAP. The hurried deal that emerged from that early-morning call in late August underscored Bank of America’s predicament: It was the too-big-to-fail bank that, to some, also seemed too big to succeed. Its C.E.O., Brian T. Moynihan, has been struggling to fix things for almost two years. After the financial markets turned on the company this summer, Mr. Buffett invested $5 billion, arresting a precipitous decline in Bank of America’s share price. But not even the imprimatur of the Oracle of Omaha has been enough to dispel the clouds. Despite the billions from Mr. Buffett, and tens of billions in asset sales, Bank of America can’t seem to find its way. The situation has set teeth on edge at its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. But perhaps nowhere is the grumbling louder than in Midtown Manhattan, at One Bryant Park, now the base of the Wall Street bank formerly known as just Merrill Lynch. When Merrill collapsed into the arms of Bank of America in late 2008, the deal remade the face of Wall Street. Merrill, with its “Thundering Herd” of rough-and-tumble stockbrokers, was now reporting to more formal Southern bankers in Charlotte. No sooner was the deal done than gaping losses at Merrill threatened to drag down Bank of America. Washington stepped in with the second of two federal bailouts. Nearly three years later, taxpayers have been repaid, with interest, and what is now Bank of America Merrill Lynch is doing surprisingly well. But the company as a whole is groaning under the weight of many billions of dollars in bad home mortgages, most of them inherited from Countrywide Financial, which it acquired in 2008. Bank of America’s stock, down 54 percent this year, is the biggest loser in the Dow Jones industrial average. The irony is not lost on bankers, brokers and traders at One Bryant Park. The billions of dollars that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is earning from its businesses on Wall Street are being wiped out by the red ink flowing out of Countrywide. Bonuses are on the line. So are jobs. “It’s debilitating and depressing,” says one Merrill veteran, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “People are very angry. How could we not be?” Many Americans who don’t work in the financial industry — people who are struggling to make ends meet, or to find jobs, or to keep them — are more than angry. But this is Wall Street, where money is the measure and where, even in this post-bailout era, top producers expect to be paid, and paid well. In hindsight, many agree that Mr. Moynihan’s predecessor, Kenneth D. Lewis, paid too much for Merrill Lynch: $50 billion in stock. The outcry over the deal and subsequent bailout led to investigations by state and federal regulators. A lawsuit brought by Bank of America shareholders contends that Bank of America tried to keep the losses at Merrill quiet, and seeks $50 billion in damages. So it might come as a surprise that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is actually thriving. Measured by fees collected for Wall Street work, it is second only to JPMorgan Chase and well ahead of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The global banking and markets unit of Bank of America, which includes many of the operations it acquired in the Merrill merger, earned $3.7 billion in the first half of 2011. With help from the Thundering Herd, the bank’s assets under management have increased to $2.2 trillion from $2 trillion in the last year, despite the turbulence in the financial markets. AT One Bryant Park, all of this comes as cold comfort. Many bankers and traders typically receive at least half of their pay in the form of restricted stock. In recent years, Bank of America has made such awards when its share price was trading upwards of $14. With the price now at $6.12, anyone who got shares has essentially suffered a big pay cut since they were handed out, mostly because of the problems associated with Countrywide, the subprime lender whose excesses came to symbolize the housing bubble. Executives at Bank of America Merrill Lynch concede that they have a big mountain to climb. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Bank of America probably has bigger problems than any of its competitors. So it stands to reason that it would make a bolder move. After all, it is dealing with a pile of troubled mortgages, legal fallout from the sales of bonds made from those loans and questions about how it serviced its home mortgages. Still, the scale of its changes mean that most debit card shoppers who do not have Bank of America mortgages or more than $20,000 in account balances will need to pay that $5 monthly fee. It is a tax on pretty much every customer without a healthy salary or investment income, plus those who want to keep their savings elsewhere for whatever reason. Bank of America and Wells Fargo are hardly alone here, since other big banks have toughened the rules for people who want to keep free checking, or have killed off rewards programs to save money. And we probably haven’t heard the last of the new rules either. All of these moves together, however, raise a simple and rather obvious question: Why is anyone still doing business with banks like these? Just after noon on Friday, Elvita Dominique, who lives in Harlem, was trying to answer that question for herself. She had just left a Bank of America branch on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan having made an appointment with a bank employee who could help her review her options. “I want to know if they are going to make exceptions,” she said. (Later in the day, the branch employee said no.) She had already heard that Citibank did not plan to add monthly debit card fees, so she will investigate that possibility. She is also considering joining a credit union. Bank of America’s move is part of a broader effort to overhaul its checking account lineup. As of sometime early next year, it will have four basic accounts, only one of which will waive the $5 monthly fee for debit card users who want to use the card for purchases. A.T.M. use will not incur the monthly fee, but charging recurring bills like gym memberships or mobile phone plans to your debit card will. Only Bank of America customers with more than $20,000 in combined checking, savings and certificate of deposit accounts or a bank mortgage (of any size) will be able to avoid both the debit card fee and any other monthly fee for falling below a required minimum balance level. Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust customers will also get a waiver, as will unemployed people who use certain government-issued Bank of America cards that have benefit money loaded onto them. While the bank will not say what percentage of its checking account customers it expects (or hopes) will be paying new fees, $20,000 is a much higher bar to clear than the direct deposit requirement or the $1,500 to $10,000 minimum balances that the bank currently places on many checking account customers who wish to avoid fees. As a result, plenty of customers will be looking at their options. What would cause people who count on debit cards to help them live within their means to stick around despite the $5 a month fee? The first factor is the perceived pain involved with switching. And it is a pain, though not as much as you may think. It shouldn’t take much more than 90 minutes to reboot direct deposit of your paycheck and move all the automated payments from one account to another. There may be a few hiccups over the next couple of months, but they shouldn’t take more than a few minutes each to fix. Try to leave some money behind in the old account for a few months just in case it takes billers a few cycles to make the switch. Much depends, then, on how much you value that 90 minutes, versus the $60 in savings you might achieve in Year 1 with your new financial institution. Then you need to weigh the value of your time against the good feeling that would come from rewarding a checking account provider that wasn’t so fee-happy. A.T.M. convenience is another factor that limits switching. Consumers who haven’t looked at an online-only institution in awhile will be pleasantly surprised by the developments here. Some of them have tapped into nationwide networks of fee-free machines that are bigger than any one bank’s collection of locations. Others let you use any A.T.M. you want and reimburse you for most or all of the fees you pay to withdraw money. Banks like ING Direct, Ally, Charles Schwab and USAA are all worth a look here. They may well pay better interest too, though it won’t amount to very much these days. There could be plenty of people who have no problem with an extra $5 a month. Claudia Smith, who lives in Fayetteville, Ark., said she wasn’t worried about the new fee, even though she used her debit card extensively. “It’s well worth $5 a month to not have to carry a checkbook,” she said. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

It was just one of several new charges expected to hit consumers as new regulations crimp banks’ profits.Wells Fargo and Chase are testing $3 monthly debit card fees. Regions Financial, based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to start charging a $4 fee next month, while SunTrust, another regional powerhouse, is charging a $5 fee. The round of new charges stems from a rule, which takes effect on Saturday, that limits the fees that banks can levy on merchants every time a consumer uses a debit card to make a purchase. The rule, known as the Durbin amendment, after its sponsor Senator Richard J. Durbin, is a crucial part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Until now, the fees have been 44 cents a transaction, on average. The Federal Reserve in June agreed to cut the fees to a maximum of about 24 cents. While the fee amounts to pennies per swipe, it rapidly adds up across millions of transactions. The new limit is expected to cost the banks about $6.6 billion in revenue a year, beginning in 2012, according to Javelin Strategy and Research. That comes on top of another loss, of $5.6 billion, from new rules restricting overdraft fees, which went into effect in July 2010. And even though retailer groups had argued that lower fees were important to keep prices in check, consumers were not likely to see substantial savings. In fact, they are simply going to end up paying from a different pot of money. Or as Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, put it after passage last year of the Dodd-Frank Act, “If you’re a restaurant and you can’t charge for the soda, you’re going to charge more for the burger.” Chase is now charging customers for a paper statement. It also, like many other banks, scrapped its debit card rewards program. And customers that Chase inherited from Washington Mutual no longer enjoy free checking accounts. The bank is also exploring a number of other fee increases, including for online banking, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Bank of America’s debit fee is steeper than most of its competitors’, reflecting the broader challenges the bank is facing after the financial crisis. The bank has introduced an online-only account that charges customers for doing business at a local branch. It also plans to apply its new debit card fees to anyone who uses the card to make recurring payments like gym fees or cable bills. Citibank is one of the few that said it would not introduce a charge for debit card use. “We have talked to customers and they have made it abundantly clear that ‘if you charge me to use my debit card, I would find that very irritating,’ ” said Stephen Troutner, head of Citi’s banking products. Still, the bank has made it more difficult to qualify for free checking, among other moves. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo estimated that the Durbin rules would cost the bank $250 million in revenue every quarter. It hopes to make up half that gap with a variety of new products and customer fees, including the monthly debit card fee of $3. The change is part of a “pilot program” the bank will begin on Oct. 14 in five states across the country, including Washington and Georgia. As of Saturday, the bank will discontinue its debit card rewards program. Meanwhile, HSBC said that it recently increased an A.T.M. fee — to $2.50 from $2 — for certain customers when they used a competitor’s A.T.M. It also recently introduced a debit transaction fee of 35 cents, though the first eight transactions are free. And at TDBank, customers will now have to pay $2 for using A.T.M.’s outside their network. “Durbin essentially moves the cost of debit away from merchants, and now it’s more focused on consumers,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin. “There are all sort of things happening where banks are saying, where can we put fees in place for our service to generate revenue or how can we reduce our costs?” Over the last few years, consumers have increasingly shifted their spending to debit cards from credit cards, in large part to curb their spending. But some analysts predicted that the new fees could prompt consumers to return to credit cards — a more lucrative alternative for the banks. Consumers have already begun to react to the changes. Patrick Shields, 48, said he had decided to leave Citibank, where he has held a small-business account for his residential window cleaning business since 1986. He was contemplating opening a personal checking account, but realized he could do better at a credit union. “At the credit union, they opened it free of charges, which Citi could not and would not do,” said Mr. Shields, who noted that a personal checking account would have cost more than the one he uses for his New York business. “Now I have both accounts covered, and I am fee-free.” The so-called Durbin rule quickly emerged as one of the thorniest provisions of Dodd-Frank, touching off a long and furious fight in Washington. Wall Street dispatched an army of lobbyists to tame the rule, ultimately yielding mixed results. In June, the Senate defeated a measure that would have delayed the new rule. But just three weeks later, the Federal Reserve decided to cap the fees at 21 to 24 cents for each debit card transaction, a much lighter blow than once expected. In a statement on Thursday, Senator Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said that small businesses would benefit from the new limits. “Swipe fee regulation will still allow banks to cover the actual costs of debit transactions but will rein in the banks’ excessive profit-taking.” Ann Carrns contributed reporting.</text></article>

One of the big ones, however, is why people keep their checking accounts at big, national banks. This is not a knock on the Bank of Americas and Wells Fargos of the world, per se. They are presumably good at some things. But I’ve been happily banking with online banks (USAA, then BankDirect and now Charles Schwab) for more than a decade and have never missed having a branch, let alone the lines at what was then called Chemical Bank back in the 1990s. My loose checks have headed off to Texas or Orlando for deposit in (postage-paid) envelopes; now I take a picture of them with my phone and send Schwab the snapshots. I can talk to people on the phone if I need help, and they are nicer than the tellers I used to encounter in Manhattan. And the bank reimburses me for many of my A.T.M. fees. It’s possible that you are among the high-balance crew who still get free checking from big banks and always will. Or perhaps you think their services are worth whatever monthly fee you pay. As for the rest of you, what’s keeping you from switching? You can read this weekend’s Your Money column for my attempt at knocking down some of the most common excuses.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/banks-adding-debit-card-fees/?ref=bankofamericacorporation">Banks Adding Debit Card Fees<date>September 29, 2011, 3:35 pm</date><text>Michael Stravato for The New York TimesA customer pays by swiping a debit card. Starting Saturday, big banks must comply with a new regulation that caps the fees they can charge merchants for processing debit card purchases. But some consumers are already seeing the impact of the change, in the form of higher fees charged on their checking accounts, as banks seek to recoup lost revenue. Bank of America is the latest bank to say it will begin charging a monthly fee for checking accounts that use debit cards. Starting early next year, the bank will charge $5 a month, in any month that the customer uses a debit card to make a purchase. (If customers have a debit card, but don’t use it, they won’t incur the fee.) The fee won’t apply to A.T.M. transactions, and it won’t be charged to customers with certain premium accounts, a bank spokeswoman, Betty Riess, said. “The economics of offering a debit card have changed with recent regulations,” she said. Bank of America joins banks including SunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells Fargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up to record levels, a recent survey found. The added fees have come even though the limit on the merchant fees wasn’t as low as banks initially had feared. (The Federal Reserve originally considered a cap of 12 cents, or half of what it finally set.) While consumers are seeing the impact of the change in their bank accounts, any potential savings benefit at stores is likely to be muted. “I don’t expect there to be any visible effects at the cash register,” said Aaron McPherson, practice director for payments at IDC Financial Insights. When similar caps were put in place in Australia, he said, merchants there didn’t pass along savings, so it’s unlikely that will happen here either. That’s because, retail groups say, stores aren’t going to benefit as much as they had originally hoped under the new cap, and some merchants may actually pay higher fees. The Fed earlier this year lowered the average maximum “swipe,” or interchange, fee to roughly half of what it had been previously. (Shoppers don’t pay the fees directly; banks collect them from merchants on behalf of payment networks like MasterCard and Visa, which set the rates. The rates vary depending on the type of merchant.) Retail groups say the new cap is a “critical step” in reining in fees that contribute to higher prices for shoppers. But Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said the Fed, under pressure from banks, set a “deeply flawed” formula for the cap that will actually result in some retailers paying higher fees for small-dollar transactions — say, drinks sold at coffee shops. The formula sets the cap at 21 cents, plus .05 percent of the transaction amount, plus another penny in certain cases, for fraud-control measures. That means the maximum fee on the average debit transaction of $38 will be about 24 cents, compared with 44 cents previously. But the payment networks have indicated they will treat the cap as more of a floor in some cases, Mr. Dodge said. In short, he said, to help make up for lost revenue on big-ticket items, the networks will increase fees on smaller transactions, to bring them up to the new limit. Retailers do retain some flexibility, he said, to steer customers away from more expensive forms of payment, like rewards credit cards, and toward less expensive methods. So consumers may eventually see some merchants, like gas stations, offer discounts for using a debit card, as some do now for payments in cash. One impact is clear, said Paul Bragan of Wakefield Research, which has studied consumer opinion about the swipe fee debate: Consumers are much more aware of the process by which banks charge stores for the use of plastic cards, and are in favor of more disclosure of such fees. “They’re looking for greater transparency in the process, so they can understand how it will affect them,” he said. If you see any signs of changed retail prices or bank fees, after Oct. 1, please let us know in the comments section.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/business/freddie-macs-loan-deal-with-bank-of-america-is-called-flawed.html?ref=bankofamericacorporation">Freddie Mac’s Loan Deal With Bank of America Is Called Flawed<date>Published: September 27, 2011</date><text>Freddie Mac used a flawed analysis when it accepted $1.35 billion from Bank of America to settle claims that the bank misled it about loans purchased during the mortgage boom, according to an oversight report scheduled for release on Tuesday.The faulty methodology significantly increased the probable losses in Freddie Mac’s portfolio of loans, according to the report, prepared by the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the company. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were taken over by the government in 2008 so additional losses would be shouldered by taxpayers. The report also noted that the settlement with Bank of America in December was completed over the objections of a senior examiner at the agency. Freddie Mac officials did not want to jeopardize the company’s relationship with Bank of America, from which it continues to buy loans, the report concluded. The agency official who questioned the loan review methodology contended that Freddie Mac’s analysis greatly underestimated the number of dubious loans bought from the Countrywide unit of Bank of America from 2005 to 2007. The deal between Freddie Mac and the bank resolved claims associated with 787,000 loans, some of which were repurchased by the bank, and cannot be rescinded. “An effective mortgage repurchase process is critical in limiting the enterprises’, and ultimately, the taxpayers’ exposure to credit losses resulting from the financial crisis,” said Steve A. Linick, the inspector general who oversaw the report. “F.H.F.A. and Freddie Mac must do more to ensure that high-dollar settlements of repurchase claims are accurately estimated and in the best interests of taxpayers.” When selling loans to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Countrywide and other originators vouched that the mortgages met certain quality standards or characteristics, like accurately representing a borrower’s income or the appraised value of a property. These promises require mortgage originators to buy back at full value those loans that do not meet the standards. Companies often review loans for possible buybacks after experiencing large numbers of defaults. Not all defaults, of course, occur after misrepresentations. The inspector general’s report does not specify how much additional money Freddie Mac could have received from Bank of America had it used a more effective analysis. But the senior examiner who questioned the deal told the inspector general’s staff that Freddie Mac’s faulty process could cost the company “billions of dollars of losses.” A Freddie Mac spokesman, Douglas Duvall, declined to comment, but said that it continued to believe its deal with Bank of America was “commercially reasonable based upon our internal evaluation and judgments.” Because of the faulty methodology, Freddie Mac failed to review 100,000 loans from 2006 for possible irregularities, the report said. As of June 2010, some 93 percent of foreclosed mortgages from 2005 and 2006 had not been analyzed, eliminating “any chance to put ineligible loans back to the lenders for those years.” The report also noted that 300,000 foreclosed loans originated from 2004 to 2007 and owned by Freddie Mac were not reviewed for possible claims. These loans have a combined unpaid principal balance exceeding $50 billion, the report said. Freddie Mac’s review process was faulty, according to the report, because it did not change its analysis to account for new types of mortgages issued during the housing boom. These included mortgages that had rock-bottom interest rates initially — known as teaser rates — lasting three years to five years before adjusting upward. The loan review analysis used by Freddie Mac focused on mortgages that went bad within two years, because historically that had been the period during which defaults related to possible loan improprieties were most likely to occur. Reasoning that the new types of mortgages with artificially low initial rates would probably lengthen the period before large numbers of defaults occurred, the senior agency examiner urged Freddie Mac’s management in June 2010 to review loans that experienced problems well after two years, the report said. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

But Bank of America is haunted by other demons from the financial crisis, the most significant one being a lawsuit arising from its troubled Merrill Lynch acquisition. This lawsuit, brought by Bank of America shareholders, claims that Bank of America and its executives, including its former chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, failed to disclose what would be a $15.31 billion loss at Merrill in the days before and after the acquisition. The plaintiffs contend that this staggering loss was hidden to ensure that Bank of America shareholders did not vote against the transaction. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Bank of America disclosed this loss after Merrill was acquired. At the same time, Bank of America also disclosed a $20 billion bailout by the government. The bank’s stock fell by more than 60 percent in a two-week period, a market value loss of more than $50 billion. This episode also spawned a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bank of America, Mr. Lewis and Joseph Price, the former chief financial officer, settled for $150 million. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan approved the deal but complained that it didn’t sufficiently penalize the individuals involved. The amount was paid by Bank of America with no liability for Mr. Lewis or Mr. Price. Judge Rakoff called the settlement “half-baked justice at best.” Judge Rakoff may see his wish for greater penalties granted. The New York attorney general’s office has a lawsuit on the matter. More significantly, a lawsuit seeking about $50 billion was brought by some of the largest class-action law firms and is quietly advancing in the Federal District Court in Manhattan. The plaintiffs contend that Bank of America engaged in a deliberate effort to deceive the bank’s shareholders. According to the plaintiffs, who include the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and a Netherlands pension plan that is the second-largest in Europe, Bank of America’s senior management, including Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price, began to learn of large losses at Merrill Lynch in early November 2008, months before the deal closed. Mr. Price met with the bank’s general counsel, Timothy J. Mayopoulos, to discuss whether to disclose the loss — at the time about $5 billion — to Bank of America shareholders. Mr. Mayopoulos testified to the New York attorney general’s office that while his initial reaction was that disclosure was warranted, he decided against it. Merrill had been losing $2.1 billion to $9.8 billion a quarter during the financial crisis, and so this loss would be expected by Merrill and Bank of America shareholders. Plaintiffs in the private action and the New York attorney general’s complaint claim that after this meeting, Mr. Price and other senior executives at Bank of America sought to keep this loss quiet and that Mr. Price in particular misled Mr. Mayopoulos. Mr. Mayopoulos has testified that on Dec. 3, 2008, Mr. Price told him that the estimated loss would be $7 billion. Mr. Mayopoulos concluded again that no disclosure was necessary. Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Price misled Mr. Mayopoulos as the forecasted loss at this time had now grown to more than $10 billion. The Bank of America vote occurred on Dec. 5 without its shareholders knowing about this gigantic looming Merrill loss, which was now about $11 billion. Mr. Mayopoulos has testified he was surprised at this higher number when he learned of it at a Dec. 9 board meeting. Mr. Mayopoulos sought to meet with Mr. Price about the new loss. The next day, Mr. Mayopoulos was fired and escorted out of the building. The Merrill acquisition was completed on Jan. 1, 2009. Two weeks later, Bank of America disclosed for the first time that Merrill had suffered an after-tax net loss of $15.31 billion. Bank of America has argued in its defense that the exact amount of the loss was uncertain during this time. Moreover, this disclosure was not necessary because Merrill’s losses were within the range of previous losses and included a good will write-off of about $2 billion that was previously disclosed. The total loss was not material. But if it is true that Mr. Price, with Mr. Lewis’s assent, kept this information from Mr. Mayopoulos in order to avoid disclosure, this is a prima facie case of securities fraud. Would Bank of America shareholders have voted to approve this transaction? If the answer is no, then it is hard to see this as anything other than material information. Plaintiffs in this private case have the additional benefit that this claim is related to a shareholder vote. It is easier to prove securities fraud related to a shareholder vote than more typical securities fraud claims like accounting fraud. Shareholder vote claims do not require that the plaintiffs prove that the person committing securities fraud did so with awareness that the statement was wrong or otherwise recklessly made. You only need to show that the person should have acted with care. This case is not only easier to establish, but the potential damages could also be enormous. Damages in a claim like this are calculated by looking at the amount lost as a result of the securities fraud. A court will most likely calculate this by referencing the amount that Bank of America stock dropped after the loss was announced; this is as much as $50 billion. It is a plaintiff’s lawyer’s dream. Bank of America is facing a huge liability from this claim. It is also facing even more liability for those who bought and sold stock during this period up until Jan. 15. In a ruling on July 29, the judge in this case allowed these claims to proceed against Bank of America, Mr. Price and Mr. Lewis. The judge had already ruled that the disclosure claim related to the proxy vote could proceed. This case is on a relatively fast track, with an October 2012 trial date. Given the $50 billion claim looming over it, Bank of America will most likely try to settle this litigation. The settlement value appears to be in the billions. Firing your main witness — Mr. Mayopoulos — and escorting him out the door no doubt only increases the cost. The case shows how regulators’ actions can be supplemented by private actions. And if the plaintiffs win, this case may be the exceedingly rare event of directors and officers, particularly Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price, actually having to pay money personally to settle a securities fraud claim. If so, the two men would join the relatively few executives from the financial crisis who have been personally penalized. Whatever the outcome of this case, it appears that Bank of America shareholders were sacrificed in December 2008 so that the Merrill deal could be completed. The bill may now be coming due for Bank of America. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the world of mergers and acquisitions.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/business/moodys-downgrades-credit-ratings-of-three-large-banks.html?ref=bankofamericacorporation">Moody’s Downgrades Credit Ratings of Three Large Banks<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>Moody’s cut its credit ratings Wednesday on three large banks — Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — underscoring the challenges the sector still faces three years after the onset of the financial crisis.The downgrades were driven by Moody’s conclusion that the federal government was less likely to step in and provide support for a faltering big bank the way it did after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, when Washington executed a series of actions including capital infusions and credit guarantees to halt the spreading panic. Moody’s had put the banks on notice for a possible downgrade on June 2. While Moody’s said it “believes that the government is likely to continue to provide some level of support to systemically important financial institutions,” the agency added that the government “is also more likely now than during the financial crisis to allow a large bank to fail should it become financially troubled.” Under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform passed by Congress in 2010, financial institutions must file a so-called living will that lays out steps for an orderly liquidation in the event of a financial collapse. The goal is to avoid future government bailouts, as well as the kind of turmoil unleashed by Lehman’s unexpected bankruptcy. “Now, having moved beyond the depths of the crisis, Moody’s believes there is an increased possibility that the government might allow a large financial institution to fail, taking the view that the contagion could be limited,” the firm said in a statement. Even so, Moody’s said it doubted whether a global financial institution could be liquidated “without a disruption of the marketplace and the broader economy.” The ratings agency cut Bank of America’s long-term senior debt to Baa1, three levels above junk. For Citigroup, Moody’s cut its ratings on short-term debt to Prime 2 from Prime 1, while affirming its A3 long-term rating. Moody’s lowered its rating on Wells Fargo’s senior debt to A2 from A1. Its Prime-1 short-term rating was affirmed. Of the three institutions, Bank of America has the lowest credit rating. Shares of all three big banks fell sharply after the downgrade, but Bank of America dropped the most, falling 7.5 percent to $6.38 a share. Although big banks enjoyed higher credit ratings before the financial crisis, Wednesday’s move was not unexpected, and analysts played down its significance. Although it could slightly raise borrowing costs over the long term, banks are not expected to have to pay significantly more to finance their operations in the near term. “It’s not a good headline, but it shouldn’t have much impact,” said Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital, adding that even the federal government’s loss of its AAA rating this summer had not raised its borrowing costs. In addition to seeing the government as less likely to support Bank of America, if needed, Moody’s said that the company “remains exposed to potentially significant risks related to both the residential mortgage and home equity loans on its balance sheet, as well as to mortgages previously sold to investors.” Investors are seeking to force Bank of America to pay billions of dollars for its alleged misdeeds during the height of the housing boom, especially the bubble-related excesses at Countrywide Financial, the subprime giant Bank of America acquired in 2008. Bank of America has reached settlements with some investors, but other holders of mortgage-backed securities assembled by Bank of America, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, another subsidiary, are suing to recover multibillion-dollar losses. Moody’s was careful to note that its action did not reflect a weakening of Bank of America’s “intrinsic credit quality.”</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/business/spinoff-lesson-learned-tyco-treads-carefully.html?ref=bankofamericacorporation">Spinoff Lesson Learned, Tyco Treads Carefully<date>Published: September 19, 2011</date><text>Shareholders appreciate a good breakup story, and Tyco is giving them more to love. The company, an industrial manufacturing group, divided itself into three parts in 2007. Now one of them, Tyco International, is being carved into three more pieces. The company’s shares gained on Monday amid a broad market sell-off. But while equity investors often see value in a less sprawling conglomerate, the same isn’t always true for bondholders.Corporate debt is often an afterthought in breakups or, worse, a tool to help one unit look better at the expense of another. Tyco knows this. Last time around, an ugly fight with creditors ensued after it tried to buy them out on the cheap, nearly derailing the breakup. This time, the company is paying them more heed. Lenders to other companies haven’t fared as well. Sunoco, for example, retained some $3 billion of investment-grade borrowings when it spun off its coal mining subsidiary. Now, the debt is rated junk and the company is scrambling to get out of the refining business. Meanwhile at Dynegy, creditors are in a pitched battle with the activist investor Carl Icahn over a split of sorts. The company transferred assets away from the holding company and, more important, out of the reach of bondholders should Dynegy ever stumble into bankruptcy — something management warned was a real danger before Mr. Icahn acquired a significant minority stake. Tyco seems to have learned a lesson. The company alienated debt investors four years ago. This time, by promising to redistribute $4 billion of borrowings relatively fairly among the residential alarms, pipeline widgets and fire and security units to retain their investment-grade status, Tyco seems to be going out of its way to keep bondholders on its side. Investors in other conglomerates may not be so lucky. Over 60 companies have announced spinoffs this year and more seem destined to come. Weak debt covenants held over from the boom and from more recent issues mean bondholders should be mindful of their vulnerability amid breakup fever. Tyco’s creditors got a second chance. Others may not. Voodoo Merger Math The numbers just aren’t adding up on Wall Street. To support the merger ambitions of their clients, investment bankers routinely claim the sum of a deal will be greater than its parts. Yet in the three years or so since JPMorgan Chase bought Bear Stearns, Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch and Barclays bought the American arm of Lehman Brothers, each firm has shed, not gained, market share. These results undermine Wall Street’s deal math. Though the 2008 deal was originally intended as a rescue of Merrill, Bank of America can comfort itself with the knowledge that Merrill has propped up the bank’s results through its mortgage crisis. Barclays, meanwhile, has solidified a role in the United States by plucking Lehman out of bankruptcy. And Bear Stearns fortified JPMorgan’s prime brokerage business, which provides services to hedge funds. But in dispensing advice to corporate clients, the deals have disappointed. At the end of 2007, Lehman sat in third place in United States merger league tables, with a little over 9 percent market share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Barclays, which had virtually no M.&amp; A. presence in the United States at the time, has less than 6 percent share so far in 2011. On a global basis, Bank of America and Merrill commanded 8 percent between them before they merged. Together, the entity clocks just 6 percent today. JPMorgan and Bear boasted more than 9 percent when separate, but JPMorgan’s share is now just 8 percent. Market forces and strategic decisions explain some of this. Boutiques, and some large rivals, capitalized on the disarray. Bank of America struggled to keep senior Merrill bankers, especially in Europe. Much of Lehman’s merger success was structured around leveraged buyouts, a business yet to recover. And JPMorgan’s investment banking head count dwindled by more than the number added with Bear within two years of the deal. The mergers fell short of their potential in other ways. In stock and debt underwriting, none of the combined firms has gained business, and in some cases they’ve lost significant market share. That doesn’t mean Bank of America, Barclays and JPMorgan will regret doing these deals. Their clients, however, should keep the outcomes in mind the next time they are presented with a pitch book professing that one and one make three. AGNES T.

In a bellwether for other large financial firms, JPMorgan Chase warned that third-quarter trading revenue was likely to fall about 8 percent from a year ago. Investment banking income is also expected to drop by one-third from a year earlier, as corporations get cold feet about acquisitions as well as stock and debt offerings. “I think you can safely expect a decline in our markets revenue,” Jes Staley, the head of JPMorgan’s investment bank, said in remarks at the Barclays financial services conference on Tuesday. There are still 13 trading days left in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, and Wall Street firms will not release their final numbers until the middle of next month. But a sharp fall-off in summer trading seems poised to weigh heavily on the banks’ earnings — and perhaps accelerate another round of layoffs expected in the coming months. After helping lift Wall Street’s results during the financial crisis, trading revenue is projected to fall for a second straight quarter. On average, it is expected to be down by about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also expected to have weak third-quarter results. Investors shrugged off the latest bad news as shares of the biggest banks rose slightly on Tuesday in relatively calm trading. But bank stocks have been pummeled recently. The KBW index, a widely cited gauge of the banking sector, has fallen more than 28 percent since January. Although Wall Street firms can land windfalls making speculative bets with the banks’ own capital, the bulk of their trading revenue comes from transactions made on behalf of clients. But with the heightened volatility over the summer, many companies and investors remained on the sidelines — causing a significant slowdown in trading activity. The lackluster trading results come at a bad time for the industry, when profits and revenues have slipped to the levels attained before the housing boom. Many are bracing for a slowdown in lending, as consumers grow nervous about their job prospects and businesses put off expansion plans. Banks still face an endless stream of legal headaches and litigation fees from the foreclosure mess. In addition, new regulation has ratcheted up compliance costs and caused once-lucrative income streams, like debit card swipe fees and overdraft charges, to vanish. And all that is not counting the impact of the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates low for the next two years — a move that will erode lending profit margins in the months ahead. In anticipation of leaner times ahead, banks are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations. On Monday, Bank of America announced plans to cut about 30,000 jobs across the company, or nearly 10 percent of its work force. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Credit Suisse and UBS are among the major Wall Street firms that have started laying off employees in the last few months. JPMorgan’s investment bank is more than halfway through a five-year plan to save about $1.3 billion a year by consolidating its trading operations — a move that will involve shedding as many as 3,000 workers, some of whom will be employed elsewhere in the bank. But so far, Mr. Staley said the bank does not anticipate a major round of layoffs beyond those previously announced. “We have had a very good first half of the year,” he said at a banking conference in Frankfurt last week. “We will see how this plays out.” Still, the numbers at JPMorgan may foreshadow more pain ahead. JPMorgan was among the first major banks to sound the alarm bells over souring subprime mortgage loans in early 2007. In 2008, the bank flagged concerns about ballooning losses on its large portfolio of home equity loans ahead of many competitors and has moved quickly to shore up its reserves against legal claims stemming from the mortgage mess. In his remarks, Mr. Staley said investors could expect equity and fixed income trading revenues to decline about 30 percent from the second quarter, putting them at about $3.85 billion. Investment banking fees are expected to fall to about $1 billion, down from $1.9 billion in the second quarter. He also said that the bank’s private equity business would face a “moderate loss” of about $100 million and that its asset management business would see trading-related declines. Other banks may see a similar fall-off in trading. Citigroup, which has a giant fixed-income business, could see core trading revenue drop 47 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse research. Overall trading revenue at Morgan Stanley is expected to fall about 1 percent from a year earlier, while revenue at Bank of America is expected to rise about 11 percent. Both banks had relatively weak third-quarter results in 2010. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs’s trading income is expected to fall about 7 percent from a year ago, according to Credit Suisse. But that may not represent the full extent of the declines it can expect. Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote in a recent report that the bank could face more than $3.2 billion in losses tied to its investment and lending businesses, which include private equity and other investments made with the bank’s own capital. That is because it must adjust its accounting to reflect the market’s recent round of wild swings.</text></article>

Moynihan, vowed on Monday to eliminate $5 billion in costs annually by 2014, including by cutting at least 30,000 jobs at the company.In a widely anticipated speech at an investor conference in New York organized by Barclays, Mr. Moynihan outlined his plan to make Bank of America, the largest bank in the United States, more efficient and profitable — even if that meant sacrificing scale. “We don’t have to be the biggest company out there,” he said. “We have to be the best.” While he did not specify how many jobs might be involved, the company announced shortly after his speech that 30,000 jobs were to be eliminated. The bank employs 288,000 people. The job cuts are part of recommendations reviewed last Thursday and Friday by the company’s top management in Charlotte, N.C. “The company expects that attrition and the elimination of appropriate unfilled roles will be a significant part of the anticipated decrease in jobs,” Bank of America said in a statement. The first part of the revamping plan involves the consumer banking operations, as well as the bank’s home loan, technology and support operations. Other parts of the business, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, will be reviewed in the second phase, which begins in October and continues through March 2012. Mr. Moynihan aims to cut at least $5 billion out of the bank’s $73 billion in annual expenses by shutting some of its 63 data centers, eliminating overlapping deposit systems and trimming layers of back-office staff that were accumulated during the acquisition binge undertaken by his predecessor Kenneth D. Lewis. “It’s taking out work we don’t need to do any more, and getting it out of the company,” he said. “We’re a much simpler company than we were 24 months ago.” While the speech fell short of the bold blueprint many analysts and investors had hoped for, Bank of America shares rose in early trading, and closed the day up 1 percent. at $7.05. During the question-and-answer part of the session, Mr. Moynihan was asked whether federal regulators had wanted the bank to raise more capital. Mr. Moynihan said they had not. A shareholder also asked about mounting losses at Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender. The losses are still plaguing Bank of America three years after it bought the company for $2.8 billion. Before the sale, Countrywide had nearly collapsed into bankruptcy when its financing dried up. Mr. Moynihan answered that in dealing with Countrywide, the bank “looks at all our options on everything.” When the shareholder followed up by asking Mr. Moynihan if he was saying that bankrupting Countrywide was a viable option, Mr. Moynihan again demurred. “There are options around all this stuff that we continue to work on,” he said. Angry investors who hold mortgage-backed securities are trying to force Bank of America and other large banks to buy back billions of dollars worth of mortgages that have defaulted. The investors argue that the home loans did not conform to the original underwriting standards or were originated with little evidence of adequate assets on the part of borrowers. In other cases, investors including the federal government and the insurance giant A.I.G. want to recover tens of billions of dollars from the big banks for losses on securities they assembled from now-troubled subprime mortgages. Then there is the investigation by state attorneys general into mortgage servicing abuses, which could cost the big banks more than $20 billion in a proposed settlement that so far they have been unable to complete. “The attorneys generals settlement is part of what can move us forward, but the settlement has to be reasonable for the company and reasonable for shareholders,” Mr. Moynihan said.

Will Pay Back $3 Billion to Buffett<date>September 13, 2011, 5:11 pm</date><text>Mario Anzuoni/ReutersWarren E. Buffett will get back $3 billion that he invested in General Electric during the financial crisis, plus a $300 million bonus. 8:31 p.m. | Updated Warren E. Buffett continues to collect benefits from the financial crisis. General Electric said on Tuesday that it would pay back the $3 billion investment that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, made in the depths of the crisis, netting Mr. Buffett a tidy profit. He will get back his principal, a $300 million bonus, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, according to a regulatory filing by G.E. on Tuesday. General Electric said it would repay the investment on Oct. 17. Mr. Buffett has been quick to capitalize on the problems of financial companies, forging deals at beneficial terms to Berkshire. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The S.E.C. filing In 2008, just before striking an agreement with G.E., Mr. Buffett picked up a $5 billion stake in Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. This year, Goldman returned the $5 billion to Berkshire with an extra $500 million for paying back the investment early. The investment netted Mr. Buffett $1.7 billion, or roughly $190,000 a day. At the time the deal was negotiated, Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, joked that he would pay Mr. Buffett back in $1 bills. Mr. Buffett said that was fine, provided Goldman kept up a 10 percent dividend until he had finished counting the bills. As the market turbulence has picked up in recent months, Mr. Buffett has continued to hunt for opportunities. In August, Berkshire Hathaway took a $5 billion stake in Bank of America. Mr. Buffett is scheduled to receive a 6 percent annual dividend. Berkshire provided General Electric — and its finance unit GE Capital — with much-needed support in the crisis. Amid the market turmoil in fall 2008, General Electric reduced expectations for earnings, citing “unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets.” It also cut its dividend, stopped its stock buyback program and issued additional shares to raise capital. But those moves were not enough. As its stock continued to plummet, General Electric reached out Berkshire for a lifeline. With his investment, Mr. Buffett gave G.E. his implicit stamp of approval. But he extracted a hefty price. General Electric agreed to pay a 10 percent annual dividend on the $3 billion investment. The steep payout reflected the timing of the deal, which was negotiated during Wall Street’s darkest days. “It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,” said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar who covers Berkshire Hathaway. “There was a lot deeper concern about financial institutions.” Since then, G.E. has steadily improved its operations, notably retooling its finance arm to focus on less risky lending strategies. In the second quarter, GE Capital reported a profit of $1 billion, up 57 percent from the second quarter of 2010. “General Electric proved to be vulnerable to the financial crisis in 2008, as the group had sizable troubled assets and was too dependent on funding through the commercial paper market,” Henk van Tulden, an analyst with Financiele Diensten Amsterdam, wrote in a recent report. “The company reacted by restructuring, downsizing and stabilizing its financial division.” But despite the improvements, the stock has continued to languish, a situation that could crimp Mr. Buffett’s total profits on his G.E. investment. Berkshire has the option to buy $3 billion worth of G.E. common shares for $22.25 each until late 2013. General Electric shares closed at $15.41 on Tuesday, down nearly 40 percent from when Mr. Buffett made his investment nearly three years ago.</text></article>

Bank of America said in a statement released on Monday that it planned to eliminate 30,000 jobs “over the next few years.” Such a reduction, representing roughly 10 percent of the bank’s work force, had been expected. In an appearance at a Barclays conference on Monday, the bank’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, discussed plans for an overhaul that would produce $5 billion in cost savings. But Mr. Moynihan did not make any reference to job cuts. He said the savings would come primarily from merging legacy data centers, deposit systems and other assets the bank had acquired through acquisitions.

It did not provide specifics on where jobs might be eliminated. In announcing its plans, Bank of America is following in the footsteps of many other big banks. Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have begun to reduce their work forces. HSBC, the global banking giant based in London, has announced job cuts on the same scale as those envisioned by Bank of America, saying it intends to eliminate 30,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, over the next two years.</text></article>

On Monday, the bank announced plans to cut jobs and reduce annual costs over the next three years. As Bank of America executives prepared last week to announce the first phase of their turnaround plan, a group of consultants hurried to complete their recommendations for the overhaul, called Project New BAC. The 44 senior bank managers and roughly two dozen consultants assigned to the initiative worked through lunch, barely pausing to enjoy the pepperoni, sausage and vegetarian pies that had been ordered from a pizzeria. On Monday, the bank’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, announced the broad strokes of their five-month effort, announcing plans to eliminate 30,000 jobs and cut annual costs by $5 billion over the next three years. “We don’t have to be the biggest company out there. We have to be the best,” Mr. Moynihan said. The consulting firms enlisted to help with Project New BAC — EHS Partners and the Promontory Financial Group — are what are known in the industry as bank doctors. Financial firms often turn to these specialists in periods of crisis, seeking out their recommendations on deep and wide-ranging cuts to bolster revenue and eliminate unnecessary expenses. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Bank of America Confirms Plans to Cut 30,000 Jobs The idea is that outsiders can find thousands of small savings and inefficient processes that insiders may miss. Promontory and EHS both have long ties to Bank of America, and to each other. Eric Holder, who is leading EHS’s work on Project New BAC, and Neil Smith, Promontory’s head consultant on the project, were both members of a team from Tandon Capital Associates that helped the Fleet Financial Group with a similar effort in 1994. On that project, called Fleet Focus ’94, Mr. Holder and Mr. Smith worked with a team of 50 internal managers known inside the bank as the “Nifty 50.” One of those 50 managers was a budding young lawyer named Brian T. Moynihan. At Fleet, the consultants recommended cutting Styrofoam coffee cups that cost the company $48,000 a year. Name-brand toner for Fleet’s laser printers was replaced with a generic toner to save $200,000 a year. In all, Fleet cut annual costs by $300 million and laid off 3,000 workers. The changes helped Fleet’s bottom line and set the stage for an eventual takeover. In 2004, it was acquired by Bank of America for about $48 billion in stock, at the time one of the largest bank mergers in history. In 1999, Mr. Holder, Mr. Smith and another consultant, Jeremy D. Eden, started their own firm, EHS Partners. They worked on cost-cutting for institutions including Mellon Financial, the PNC Financial Services Group and the Union Bank of California. But in 2009, Mr. Smith left EHS to start a rival team at Promontory Financial, a large consulting firm that specializes in regulatory and legal work and that helped Morgan Stanley revamp itself as a bank holding company after the financial crisis. A person with knowledge of the companies who spoke anonymously to avoid angering the firms described Mr. Smith’s split from Mr. Holder as an acrimonious divorce that capped years of tension between the men, making their joint assignment on Bank of America all the more unlikely. “I can’t even imagine how that works,” the person said. “When you think about the importance of figuring out Bank of America’s issues, that’s hard enough. To add another level of complexity with the consultants working out their own issues is another thing.” Promontory and EHS declined to comment on their relationship. Bank of America declined to comment on the two firms, and a spokesman said many of the changes made in Project New BAC had come from bank employees rather than from outside consultants. Since Project New BAC was announced last spring, Mr. Holder’s team from EHS; Mr. Smith’s team, Promontory Growth and Innovation; and another team from Promontory that is focusing on regulatory issues have been working four days a week from the bank’s headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., camping out in cubicles on the seventh floor. The Bank of America managers assigned to work on the project full time have led small teams of bank managers in a division-by-division review of operations. In phase one, roughly 150,000 ideas were submitted by Bank of America employees, and the best were presented to Mr. Moynihan and his management team. Consultant-led reform programs are common in banking, especially in the case of a company that, like Bank of America, has grown rapidly through mergers and acquisitions. When done correctly, the recommendations can trim fat and make a bank more competitive. “For a larger bank with so many acquisitions in the past, it makes sense to have someone come look at the process and the overlaps,” said Jefferson Harralson, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods. The process can be painful. One project led by EHS, a 1999 revamp of the Union Bank of California that was called “Mission Excel,” saved the bank hundreds of millions of dollars and increased profits. But those savings included cutting 1,400 jobs, and the project was reportedly renamed “Mission Expel” by some employees. “Barnacles grow on a bank, and it’s good to have an outsider come scrape them off,” said Charles Wendel, president of Financial Institutions Consulting. “But one of the great clichés is that you can’t shrink your way to greatness.” After submitting their final recommendations, the team of consultants and company employees shared drinks on Thursday on a terrace at Bank of America’s headquarters. Mr. Moynihan thanked them for their hard work, which in some cases included relocating temporarily to Charlotte. But their job is far from over. The first phase focused on Bank of America’s retail side, where many of the most obvious cuts were made. In the next phase, which is expected to begin in late October, EHS and Promontory will look at the commercial banking and wealth management divisions. “They’re pulling the lower hanging fruit first,” said Mr. Harralson. “There’s more to come.”</text></article>

Bucks has written previously about the demise of the card, which was one of the best deals out there in the world of rewards plastic. Schwab stopped sponsoring the cards last year, so they actually are not Schwab cards anymore, a Schwab spokeswoman said. But Schwab’s card partner — FIA Card Services, a unit of Bank of America — had continued to provide the 2 percent cash-back rewards, and had told holders they would be notified of any further changes. Now, holders are being notified that the cards will be replaced with Bank of America-branded cards with different rewards, according to a report this week by the Web site NerdWallet. The perks aren’t bad, but they aren’t as good as the rewards offered by the Invest First card. Bank of America is starting to notify customers who currently have the 2 percent cash rewards card that they will be offered either the BankAmericard Privileges card, or the BankAmericard Cash Rewards card, a bank spokeswoman, Betty Riess, confirmed. Customers have until mid- to late October to choose, she said. The  BankAmericard Cash Rewards card offers 3 percent back on gas, 2 percent on groceries and 1 percent on everything else, plus an extra 10 percent bonus if the rewards are redeemed and put into a Bank of America account. The card has no annual fee and zero percent interest for the first 12 months. You also get a $50 credit if you charge at least $100 in the first 60 days. On the downside, it carries a 3 percent fee for transactions in foreign currencies, making it a poor choice for foreign travel. The Privileges card provides 1 point for every dollar in purchases, plus three times the points in categories that rotate quarterly.  Also, if customers opt for cash rewards under the Privileges program and deposit the cash  into a Bank of America or Merrill Lynch account, they get a 50 percent bonus. The card has a $75 annual fee, but it is waived for the first year. If neither of those cards is appealing, NerdWallet suggests some alternatives with decent rewards. First is the Capital One Venture rewards card. It has an annual fee of $59, but that’s waived for the first year. Next, NerdWallet cites Chase Freedom Visa, which offers a $200 sign-up bonus, as well as 5 percent cash back on bonus categories — like groceries and department store purchases — that rotate each quarter. Also, my colleague Ron Lieber recently wrote about the new Capital One Cash card that offers 1.5 percent cash back — although it makes you wait a bit to collect some of the cash. If you’re an Invest First Visa cardholder, have you been notified of your new card choices? What will you choose?</text></article>

Moynihan, chief of Bank of America. It’s time for Brian T. Moynihan’s close-up. Mr. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, has been criticized on many fronts in recent weeks. His bank has faced questions about its capital needs and mortgage-related legal woes, as well as a management shake-up last week that saw the departure of two senior executives, Sallie L. Krawcheck and Joe Price. Even a $5 billion cash infusion from Warren E. Buffett, meant to buoy confidence in Mr. Moynihan’s leadership, did little to boost the bank’s stock price. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink In a hotly anticipated appearance at the Barclays 2011 Global Financial Services Conference on Monday morning, Mr. Moynihan is expected to address those problems and announce elements of “Project New BAC,” the bank’s year-long mission, named after its stock ticker, to increase revenue and restore itself to full health. The live blog of his speech is below. 9:45 A.M. |Updated: Grilling Mr. Moynihan In the first audience question, an activist from the Rainforest Action Network harangued Mr. Moynihan for contributing to global warming by underwriting coal-fired power plants. Other investors in the audience, likely more concerned about pay caps than ice caps, shouted the activist down before he could finish his question. In response to another question about Warren E. Buffett’s recent $5 billion cash infusion, Mr. Moynihan said he was “very pleased” with the investment. One questioner who didn’t identify himself asked Mr. Moynihan if Bank of America had been asked by the Federal Reserve or other regulators to raise capital in the wake of Mr. Buffett’s investment. Mr. Moynihan said they had not. That same person then asked Mr. Moynihan the toughest question he’s faced all day: “Can you or would you bankrupt Countrywide?” Mr. Moynihan answered that in dealing with the troubled mortgage giant, the bank “looks at all our options on everything.” When the questioner followed up by asking Mr. Moynihan if, in essence, he was saying that bankrupting Countrywide was a viable option, Mr. Moynihan again demurred. “There are options around all this stuff that we continue to work on,” he said. Mr. Moynihan then exited the stage. 9:27 A.M. |Updated: Bigger Isn’t Necessarily Better Mr. Moynihan defended Bank of America’s capital position, saying that adjusted for certain one-time transactions, the bank’s tier 1 common ratio is back to where it was in the first quarter of this year. “We don’t have to be the biggest company out there, we have to be the best,” Mr. Moynihan said, defending the bank’s streamlining process. He is now taking questions from the audience. 9:16 A.M. |Updated: Cutting Costs Mr. Moynihan said that first phase of Project New BAC had been approved by the firm’s executives. 50 bank managers worked on the turnaround project, which began in April and is expected to last until April of next year. Phase 1 of the project will result in $5 billion in cost savings, or 18 percent of the total expected savings. Those savings will come primarily from merging legacy data centers, deposit systems, and other assets acquired through acquisitions and mergers with other banks. “We’re a much simpler company than we were 24 months ago,” Mr. Moynihan said. 9:06 A.M. |Updated: Three challenges to Bank of America Mr. Moynihan noted that five of Bank of America’s six core businesses are performing well. “We have one business we need to work on: our mortgage business,” Mr. Moynihan said. He outlined three major issues facing the bank: stagnant economic growth in the U.S., legacy mortgage issues, and a new regulatory capital regime. “We told you last March that we were reducing operating costs,” Mr. Moynihan said, teasing a possible update on Project New BAC. 9:01 A.M. |Moynihan remembers 9/11 As he began his speech, Mr. Moynihan took a moment to remember the 10th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center. “You’re reminded of the song that Bruce Springsteen wrote called ‘Empty Sky,’” he said, noting that the bank “acknowledges the loss in our community.” 8:53 A.M. |Updated: What to Expect Mr. Moynihan takes the stage (or what is assumed is a stage, since Barclays’ no-media policy means DealBook will be live-blogging an audio-only webcast) in about 10 minutes. Until then, the pre-game suspense is building. Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura, says that he expects Mr. Moynihan to announce some details of “Project New BAC,” an all-hands-on-deck overhaul plan unveiled in April that will attempt to boost revenues and cut costs across the company. “My gut is it’s going to be a lot about costs and restructuring the company,” Mr. Schorr said, politely fielding DealBook’s call while he was busy listening to a Wells Fargo presentation at the same conference. Mr. Schorr said he didn’t expect to hear Mr. Moynihan announce specific numbers of layoffs, but said it would be “probably a range.” Earlier reports have estimated that the bank may be planning to eliminate as many as 40,000 jobs.</text></article>

Buffett, and the sale of more than $15 billion in assets. None of those major news events have propped up the bank’s battered stock, which finished last week at just less than $7 a share — down nearly 30 percent since the beginning of August. On Monday, Brian T. Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, is scheduled to deliver a much-anticipated address to investors at a conference hosted by Barclays in New York, but anything less than a bold new blueprint is likely to leave already frustrated investors grumbling. “He’s got to say something new, otherwise it’ll be a real dud,” said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. “There’s a lot of cynicism. People are going to be skeptical of any numbers they put out.” Mr. Moynihan will unveil the initial results of the bank’s Project New BAC restructuring initiative, named after its stock ticker symbol. That plan will increase targets for quarterly cost savings to well above the $1 billion to $1.5 billion goal he laid out last month. Mr. Moynihan is also expected to note that the streamlining, which could cost 30,000 to 40,000 jobs in the next three years, would affect the executive suite, too. Last week, the company said the reshuffling did not leave room for the positions held by two well-known top executives, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price. Bank of America officials declined to comment on the contents of the speech on Monday. Two other top executives who are at the heart of Mr. Moynihan’s team, Bruce R. Thompson, the chief financial officer, and Mike Lyons, head of corporate strategy and planning, played critical roles in putting together the presentation. Mr. Moynihan is likely to emphasize that Bank of America is sticking with the diet he imposed on it after taking over in late 2010, while cleaning up after the acquisition binge begun by his predecessor as chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis. Mr. Moynihan is expected to detail the bank’s current capital structure, reiterating his desire to strengthen the company’s balance sheet further without having to resort to selling more stock, a major worry among Bank of America shareholders. He is also likely to emphasize that the asset sales in the third quarter have replenished capital that was consumed by the cost of settling mortgage-related litigation in the second quarter. An Aug. 10 conference call with Mr. Moynihan and investors, hosted by a Florida hedge fund manager, Bruce Berkowitz, drew a collective thumbs-down from Wall Street. Analysts say that Mr. Moynihan needs to deliver something stronger and more detailed this time to halt the slide in Bank of America’s stock price. “I’m still scratching my head over that conference call with investors in August that didn’t add a lot of value,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole. “The C.E.O. has his back up against the wall more than it’s been in the past. Investors do want something radical to confront many radical circumstances.” Mr. Mayo says the challenge for Mr. Moynihan is that more radical solutions that might lift the stock in the short-term could prove risky in terms of the future of the company and its long-term performance. For example, spinning off its highly profitable Merrill Lynch unit might give the stock a short-term bounce but deprive the bank, the country’s largest, of a major source of profits even as margins in more traditional areas of banking like commercial lending are squeezed. And when it comes to the biggest problem facing the bank, how much it will cost to atone for the excesses associated with the housing bubble, the options are even less appetizing. Angry investors are trying to force Bank of America, and other large banks, to buy back billions of dollars worth of mortgages that have defaulted, arguing that the home loans did not conform to the original underwriting standards or were originated with little evidence of adequate assets on the part of borrowers. In other cases, investors including the federal government and the insurance giant A.I.G. want to recover tens of billions of dollars from the big banks for losses on securities they assembled from now-troubled subprime mortgages. For Bank of America, the bulk of those losses stem from the 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime giant. While Mr. Moynihan has not ruled out putting the Countrywide unit into bankruptcy, such a step would make it harder for healthy divisions of the company to borrow, Mr. Kotowski of Oppenheimer warned. To make matters worse, Mr. Kotowski said, the cost of the mortgage mess has mushroomed, undermining confidence more broadly in how the bank has handled the issue. At an investor conference last November, Mr. Moynihan vowed “hand-to-hand combat” to fight these claims, but the settlements by Bank of America in January and June were a shift away from that strategy in an effort to put the litigation behind the company and resolve the resulting uncertainty. The legal onslaught has only intensified, however, with more lawsuits filed on Sept. 2 by the federal agency that oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the fears about how much the mortgage implosion will eventually cost Bank of America loom as large as ever. “The mortgage risk is everything for Bank of America,” said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura. “They can take several billion dollars out in costs, but if they lose the big numbers people are talking about in terms of mortgages, the cost cuts won’t make enough of an impact.” But Mr. Schorr said that cost cuts also signal that Bank of America could address what is within its reach to influence. “They can’t control Europe imploding or this enormous mortgage risk,” he said. “But they can try to control their operating performance.”</text></article>

Moynihan takes the stage at a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Monday to tell investors what is in store for Bank of America, but already the chief executive’s plans are generating the kind of buzz reserved for the opening of a Broadway show down the street.Will he break up the company and spin off Merrill Lynch? Cut tens of thousands of jobs? Put its subprime mortgage albatross, Countrywide, into bankruptcy? If not such a bold move, how does Mr. Moynihan plan to reverse the company’s painful slide? The earliest clues could come Thursday, when the top executives of the country’s largest bank gather at its Charlotte, N.C., headquarters to review recommendations of a 44-member internal team that has been preparing restructuring plans since March. Company officials say a split-up is out of the question for now, as is imminent bankruptcy for Countrywide. But 30,000 jobs, roughly 10 percent of the company’s work force, could be eliminated over the next three years as a result of the restructuring initiative known as Project New BAC.  There has been plenty of drama already this week, with the abrupt exit Tuesday of two top executives, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price, and the splitting of the bank into two basic units, one dealing with individual customers, the other focusing on businesses and institutions. While company officials say the reorganization would actually make it harder to break up the company, it has not stilled the speculation. “At some point, it gets too big to manage,” said Brian Wenzinger, a principal at Aronson Johnson Ortiz, a Philadelphia money management firm. “Smaller works better, and the less complicated it is, the better it can work.” Bank of America shares rallied sharply Wednesday on a broader market jump, rising 7 percent to close at $7.48. They are still off 50 percent since January, weighed down largely by fears that the company could have to pay out tens of billions of dollars more to settle claims stemming from the subprime mortgage meltdown. Those losses set off worries the company might need to raise fresh capital, but the $8.3 billion sale of its stake in China Construction Bank and a $5 billion investment by Warren Buffett last month have eased those fears for now. Despite the cold water from executives, some big investors would like to see the Merrill brokerage and investment banking unit spun off. “As a stockholder in Bank of America, I feel like Merrill Lynch would be worth $7 a share on its own, at least,” said Buzzy Geduld, who sold his brokerage firm — Herzog, Heine, Geduld — to Merrill in 2000, and now owns more than 2.5 million shares in Bank of America. “I think the upside is terrific.” No one disputes the idea that Bank of America has become too complex. In some ways, the company resembles a crazy quilt assembled through acquisitions pursued by Mr. Moynihan’s predecessor, Kenneth D. Lewis, whose deal-making culminated in 2008 with the purchase of both Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant at the root of many of Bank of America’s problems today. Mr. Moynihan has spent much of his 18 months at the helm undoing Mr. Lewis’s legacy. In fact, company officials say the need to turn what was a sprawling empire into a leaner, more focused enterprise is what is driving both Project New BAC, which takes its name from the company’s ticker symbol, and Tuesday’s reshuffling. “We’ve simplified the company in the aftermath of the financial crisis and regulatory reform,” said Anne M. Finucane, Bank of America’s top global strategy and marketing officer. “And we’re reducing risk to both the company and the financial system by evaluating businesses that are not core to the strategy or were bolted on.” She added that the new structure follows the blueprint Mr. Moynihan presented to the board shortly before he was tapped to become chief executive in December 2009. Looking ahead, executives say the reorganization actually makes it harder to split off Merrill Lynch, because it will be more integrated into the overall company and will not remain under one main leader. Its famous “thundering herd” of 16,000 financial advisers will be under David Darnell, who will also head up Bank of America’s more traditional consumer businesses. The institutional business will still be under Tom Montag, a Goldman Sachs veteran who joined Merrill shortly before Bank of America acquired it in 2008. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Following a pattern that is expected to be repeated across Wall Street in the coming months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch began handing out pink slips to several hundred employees on Thursday. The job cuts are expected to fall across the entire organization, including sales and trading operations as well as investment banking. While the Merrill Lynch unit has been solidly profitable in 2010 and 2011, its parent, Bank of America, is in the midst of cutting 7,000 jobs this year, of which 3,500 are to be eliminated in the second half of the year, and only a relatively small number are coming from Merrill. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Like other investment banking firms, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been hurt by the slowdown recently in deal-making amid the stock market’s wild swings over the summer. The cuts are similar to a round of job reductions that took place last September. Given the headlines, and Bank of America’s own executive reshuffling this week, “people were braced for it,” one banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Bank of America shares have been pummeled recently, and the firings occur as top executives are meeting at Bank of America’s headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday and Friday to review plans for what is called Project New BAC, an efficiency initiative that could eliminate 30,000 of the bank’s 288,000 jobs. Project New BAC does not yet include Merrill Lynch; it will be looked at next, following the careful review now being completed of Bank of America’s consumer and home loans businesses, as well its support and technology functions.</text></article>

Krawcheck, the president of the wealth management division of Bank of America, is leaving the company. Sallie L. Krawcheck’s departure from Bank of America not only shook up the struggling financial firm’s executive management team, it also left Wall Street’s self-policing organization in the lurch. Ms. Krawcheck, one of the top women on Wall Street, who led the wealth management group at Bank of America until she left the company on Tuesday, was recently elected a governor of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Without facing a challenger, she won a spot in August representing large brokerage firms on Finra’s board. In her candidate profile, circulated in June, Ms. Krawcheck highlighted her credentials for the influential board spot. “Among other honors, Ms. Krawcheck has been listed eight times as one of Fortune’s ‘Most Powerful Women’ in business, and U.S. Banker ranked her first on its list of ’25 Women to Watch’ in 2009 and fourth on its ’25 Most Powerful Women in Banking’ list in 2010,” the notice said. But now that Ms. Krawcheck has become a free agent, her board spot could be up for grabs. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The Last Women on Wall Street It is unclear exactly what happens next; the Finra bylaws do not account for such management shake-ups. For now, Finra will not eject her from the position. But to keep the seat she will have to join another large brokerage firm in a “short period of time,” a Finra spokesman told DealBook. Unless she soon finds a new home on Wall Street, Finra will move to hold a special election to fill her vacant seat. Such elections are not unprecedented, occurring occasionally when regulatory sanctions shut down smaller brokerage firms and oust their executives who serve on Finra’s board. The reorganization at Bank of America forced Ms. Krawcheck’s second major board departure this year. In April, she exited BlackRock’s board to make way for Tom Montag, president of global banking and markets at Bank of America and a Goldman Sachs alumnus. At Finra, Ms. Krawcheck was slated to fill a three-year term, replacing Richard F. Brueckner, chairman of Pershing, a Bank of New York Mellon brokerage unit.</text></article>

Women — always a rare breed in the upper echelons of Wall Street — are looking like an endangered species in the executive suite of big banks. On Tuesday, Bank of America reshuffled its management team, culling Sallie Krawcheck from its ranks. With her departure, a handful of women will still report directly to the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, but they largely fill top roles in groups that don’t produce revenue. Among them: Anne Finucane, the global strategy and marketing officer; Christine Katziff, the corporate general auditor; Andrea Smith, the head of human resources; and Cathy Bessant, the head of global technology and operations. It is a long-running theme across Wall Street, with the plum spots in investment banking and brokerages most typically held by men. At Goldman Sachs, women make up little more than 12 percent of the partnership, an elite group that includes the firm’s most senior executives and biggest stars. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Bank of America Shakes Up Management Team In many ways, the gender imbalance has only grown more uneven since the financial crisis, with a number of notable women leaving their top spots in recent years. Erin Callan, the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers, got the boot just months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Zoe Cruz, the co-president of Morgan Stanley, was ousted in a management shake-up in late 2007. Terri Dial lasted just a year as chief executive of Citigroup’s consumer business in North America. And Heidi Miller, the head of JPMorgan Chase’s international efforts who was once viewed as a potential successor to the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is set to depart the company early next year. That is not to say women do not hold some pretty powerful positions in finance. Earlier this year, the private equity firm Carlyle Group, which just filed to go public, tapped Adena T. Friedman as its chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Ina Drew, the bank’s chief investment officer, sits on the operating committee. In January, Cece Stewart joined Citigroup to head up its consumer and commercial division in the United States. Edith Cooper runs human resources for Goldman Sachs. Ruth Porat is the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley. But their status is more the exception than the rule. In the United States, women account for 2.7 percent of the chief executives in the financial industry, and 16.8 percent of the executive officers, according to a study by Catalyst.</text></article>

David Darnell and Tom Montag were named co-chief operating officers. Bank of America shook up its top management team on Tuesday, as the beleaguered financial firm contended with a flagging share price and mounting legal liabilities. As part of the reshuffling, the bank announced the departure of two senior executives, Sallie L. Krawcheck, one of the top women on Wall Street, and Joe Price, a Bank of America veteran. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release David Darnell and Tom Montag were named co-chief operating officers, in newly created positions that will report directly to the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan. Mr. Montag will oversee the banking and markets activities, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which he headed previously. Mr. Darnell, currently head of global commercial banking, will run all of the consumer businesses, including wealth management and home loans. The reorganization — which essentially splits the sprawling empire into two main units, one focused on consumers, the other on businesses and institutions — comes as Bank of America faces an erosion of investor confidence. Amid growing losses linked to the mortgage crisis and fears that its capital cushion was insufficient, the financial firm has been pummeled, the laggard stock in an already troubled industry. Bank of America got a brief respite from its market problems last month when the billionaire Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made a $5 billion investment. In the days that followed, the stock rose steadily. But the company’s legal problems continued to pile up, once again putting pressure on the stock. On Friday, federal regulators filed suit against Bank of America and 16 other firms, accusing them of misrepresenting the quality of mortgages that they sold to the housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Shares of Bank of America closed at $6.99 Tuesday, off about 50 percent since the start of the year. With Bank of America staggering under the weight of soured mortgages, most of which were acquired when it bought Countrywide in 2008, there has been speculation that a broader reorganization of the company could be in the offing. Options might include spinning off its highly profitable Merrill Lynch unit and putting Countrywide into bankruptcy, but bank officials say both possibilities are highly unlikely. The company, in an effort to reduce costs and increase profits, is set to review proposals for Project New BAC, an internal initiative aimed at making the company more nimble. It is expected to cut 10 percent of the overall work force over the next few years, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The cost savings associated with the departures of Ms. Krawcheck, the president of global wealth and investment management, and Mr. Price, the president of consumer and small business banking, are potentially substantial. Ms. Krawcheck made $6.2 million in 2010, and $1.9 million in 2009, the year she was hired. Their teams also include large support staffs. The shake-up is the second time this year that Mr. Moynihan has changed his management team. He named a new chief financial officer, Bruce Thompson, to succeed Charles Noski, who left the role to tend to “a serious illness of a close family member.” (He remains on as vice chairman.) Gary Lynch of Morgan Stanley was selected to become the global chief of legal, compliance and regulatory relations, a new position. Ms. Krawcheck has been a well-known figure on Wall Street for decades and among the small cadre of top women executives in finance. After college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she moved to New York, landing a job as an investment banker at Salomon Brothers and switching after a few years to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Later at Sanford C. Bernstein, Ms. Krawcheck distinguished herself as a stock analyst, covering securities companies. Early on, she made headlines with some of her bold calls, notably upsetting Wall Street executive Sanford I. Weill when she criticized the acquisition of Salomon by his firm the Travelers Group. Shortly after Alliance Capital Management purchased Bernstein in 2000, she was named chairman and chief executive. Amid scandals over Wall Street research, she became head of research and brokerage at Citigroup in 2002, a move to restore credibility in the division. She eventually rose through the ranks, becoming chief financial officer at Citigroup and then head of its wealth management division. But she left the bank in September 2008 after clashing with top executives over whether to reimburse clients who lost money on Citigroup hedge funds. Ms. Krawcheck was hired in August 2009 by Kenneth D. Lewis, then the company’s controversial chairman and chief. Since her arrival, the wealth management group has posted steady results, even as the broader market has been battered by billions of dollars in losses. In the second quarter, the division earned $506 million, down slightly from the previous period, but up from $329 million in the second quarter of 2010. In particular, the Merrill Lynch brokerage force has been a surprising bright spot for the troubled bank, increasing its client base since the 2009 takeover by Bank of America. In a report earlier this year Michael Mayo, an analyst at Crédit Agricole Securities, said he expected the growth to continue. Despite the group’s steady performance, Ms. Krawcheck was not considered a member of Mr. Moynihan’s inner circle, according a senior executive at the bank. But her departure, said another bank executive close to Ms. Krawcheck, was not acrimonious like it was with Citigroup. “She has been through this before and gets it,” the person said, who was not authorized to speak on the record. Ms. Krawcheck did not respond to requests for comment. Under the terms of her employment agreement, Ms. Krawcheck could collect $2.4 million to $4.7 million in previously awarded stock grants, as of the end of December, according to an analysis of a regulatory filing by The New York Times and Footnoted.com, a division of Morningstar. She may also negotiate a separate severance package. Mr. Price’s departure closes the book on a long career at Bank of America, which he joined in 1992 from PriceWaterhouse. He is no stranger to shake-ups at the bank, serving as auditor general, risk manager and chief financial officer. His most recent move came in early 2010, when Mr. Moynihan assigned him to oversee the consumer bank. Under Mr. Price’s leadership, the division has had mixed results. The credit card portfolio has bounced back from the depths of the crisis, more than doubling its net income in the first half of 2011. But the bank’s deposit business has gradually reported lower returns over the last year. Mr. Moynihan in a statement praised the efforts of Ms. Krawcheck and Mr. Price at Bank of America, saying “delayering and simplifying at the scale in which we operate requires difficult decisions. We wish them well and look forward to their continued leadership and business successes in the future.” Ben Protess contributed reporting. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: September 9, 2011 An article on Wednesday about management changes at Bank of America referred incompletely in some editions to a job change involving Charles Noski, a former chief financial officer. Mr. Noski gave up that position in April because of the serious illness of a close family member; he did not leave the bank, and remains a vice chairman.</text></article>

Wall Street no longer runs on Dunkin.’ Shares of the Dunkin’ Brands Group slid 5 percent Tuesday morning, as equity analysts issued a mixed bag of reports. The doughnut and coffee purveyor, which went public less than two months ago in a highly anticipated public offering, did not get a resounding vote of confidence from its underwriters — many of which initiated coverage on the stock with a “neutral” or negative rating. Goldman Sachs, one of its top underwriters, slapped a “sell” rating on Dunkin’ and a $23 price target, citing a “full” valuation. In its note, issued early Tuesday, Goldman praised the company’s margins and international opportunities but warned that its earnings per share growth will probably not rise fast enough to support the stock’s momentum. “We see the potential for underlying Dunkin U.S. comps to decelerate and disappoint in the back half of 2011 and 2012,”  the firm noted. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink A number of banks — which had to wait several weeks after Dunkin’s offering before issuing reports — took a similarly cautious stance. Three of its underwriters, Barclays Capital, Wells Fargo Securities, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, issued “neutral” or “equal weight” ratings on Dunkin’. Barclays, which set Dunkin’s price target at $27, said the “strengths of its global portfolio make a compelling long-term investment.” But it added that the valuation is a “primary concern” since it is trading at a premium to its restaurant peers. Other potential hurdles include the company’s plans to expand on the West Coast and its ability to turn around its Baskin-Robbins chain, according to Barclays. The skepticism evident in Tuesday’s research notes stands in stark contrast to the enthusiasm for Dunkin’s shares in late July. During the company’s public offering, international and domestic investors flocked to the banks for a piece of Dunkin’. Orders amounted to more than 20 times the size of the eventual offering, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. Shares of Dunkin’, which have traded as high as $31.94, are still about 35 percent above the company’s offering price. Historically, underwriters have not been shy to heap praise on the companies they have shepherded to the public markets. In the wake of LinkedIn’s debut, the company’s underwriters, JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, all stamped bullish ratings on the stock with rosy outlooks, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch calling LinkedIn a “$10 billion long-term revenue opportunity.” Still, there was some love for Dunkin’ on Tuesday. At least four of its underwriters, J.P.Morgan, Stifel Nicolaus Weisel, Williams Capital Group, and William Blair &amp; Company, issued positive ratings on the stock. Its lead underwriter, J.P. Morgan, delivered an “overweight” rating, assuring investors that “longevity and low-risk growth should sustain premium multiple.” It set its price target at $30.</text></article>

The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is suing 17 leading banks that sold them nearly $200 billion worth of subprime mortgage-backed securities that fell sharply in value when the housing market collapsed. The federal government has already put over $150 billion into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to bail them out, so this is a chance to recoup at least some of the losses. While the claims sound like a typical securities fraud suit, the F.H.F.A. is relying on lesser-known provisions of the federal securities laws that give it a significantly stronger basis for obtaining substantial recoveries from the banks that packaged the mortgages and sold securities backed by them. The Securities Act of 1933 authorizes claims by purchasers of securities who bought them pursuant to a registration statement (Section 11) and a prospectus (Section 12(a)(2)), two documents that must be filed before a security can be sold for the first time. Liability under these provisions is set off if they “contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.” White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links NYT: Federal Regulators Sue Big Banks Over Mortgages The two provisions were intended to ensure that issuers of securities, and those responsible for drafting the documents filed as part of the process, would be careful that all the information disclosed to investors was correct. Those who can be held liable for a violation of Section 11 are the issuer of the security and its directors, anyone who signed its registration statement and every underwriter involved in the offering. Section 12(a)(2) applies to the issuer and the actual underwriter selling the securities by a prospectus. Neither provision requires proof that the defendant actually relied on the misleading or omitted information, nor that those involved in the sale sought to defraud purchasers. While intent to defraud, or at least recklessness, is usually an element of a securities fraud claim, these provisions dispense with that requirement in order to create a strong incentive for issuers and underwriters to make sure the information provided to purchasers is both complete and correct. Along the same lines, unlike a typical securities fraud claim, lawsuits brought under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) do not require a plaintiff to prove that the misstatement or omission caused any damage. The remedy for a violation is the difference between the amount paid for the security and its value at the time the lawsuit was filed, or the price for which it was sold. In effect, this is a money-back guarantee if the registration statement or prospectus included a material misstatement or omission. There are relatively few lawsuits brought under these provisions because they are limited to those who purchased in the initial offering of the securities, and they do not apply to transactions in the secondary market, like sales on a stock exchange. There is also a much stricter statute of limitations applied to these claims that requires filing a lawsuit within one year of discovery of the misstatement or omission, and no later than three years from the filing of the documents. Unlike other purchasers, the F.H.F.A. can pursue its claims even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought the mortgage securities from 2005 to 2007 because a provision of federal law extends for up to three years the limitations period for filing claims. The lawsuits generally allege that the issuers and underwriters, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, misstated the owner occupancy percentage and loan-to-value ratio for the pool of loans included in the mortgage-backed securities and falsely certified that the lenders complied with proper loan underwriting procedures. The National Credit Union Administration filed similar claims against Goldman Sachs and other securities sellers, seeking nearly $2 billion. In response, some defendants argued that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not misled about the risks in the mortgage-backed securities they purchased. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said the mortgage giants were the “epitome of a sophisticated investor,” while a Bank of America statement asserted that they “claimed to understand the risks inherent in investing in subprime securities and continued to invest heavily in those securities even after their regulator told them they did not have the risk management capabilities to do so.” Although the banks can plausibly claim that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were knowledgeable about the mortgage market, the standard for a violation of Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) is whether any misstatements or omissions were “material,” which means a reasonable investor would consider them important. The materiality standard is quite broad, and arguing that these investors should have known better does not undermine a claim that the registration statement and prospectus included material misstatements. There are defenses to the F.H.F.A. claims, but they will not be easy for the banks to establish. Any defendant, other than the issuer, can assert a “due diligence” defense to a Section 11 claim, and for Section 12(a)(2)) the issuer or selling underwriters can try to show they acted with “reasonable care.” The burden of proof is on the defendant to make out these defense, and courts have not looked favorably on claims that sophisticated issuers somehow overlooked important information. Defendants can also offer a “negative causation” defense to limit the potential damages by showing that any drop in the value of the securities was not related to the misstatement or omission in the documents. This is the opposite of the “loss causation” requirement for the typical securities fraud claim, which requires the plaintiff to show a connection between the misstatement or omission and any decline in value. The misstatements and omissions described in the F.H.F.A.’s complaints relate to how the mortgages were likely to perform during the impending collapse in the housing market. Showing negative causation may not be possible if the value of the securities was overstated from the outset. Moreover, putting the burden to show “negative causation” on the defendants means the F.H.F.A. gets the benefit of the doubt on loss. The value of the mortgage-backed securities at issue in the lawsuits is almost $200 billion, although the government is unlikely to recover all of what was invested because the securities retain at least some value. The total potential recovery is difficult to establish at this point, but the potential exposure of the banks could be significant because Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) impose near strict liability on issuers and underwriters.

Investors fled financial shares Friday amid growing concern that the litigation could last for years and undermine earnings and balance sheets in the process. The complaints were filed just as the stock market closed Friday afternoon, but with word leaking out of the impending legal action during the trading session, shares of Bank of America fell more than 8.3 percent, while JPMorgan Chase dropped 4.6 percent and Goldman fell 4.5 percent. “The suits only add to the uncertainty that dogs the industry,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole. “Banks should pay for what they did wrong, but at the same time they shouldn’t be treated as a big piñata that has the effect of delaying the housing recovery. If banks have to pay for loans they made five years ago, are they going to make new ones?” After the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, years of litigation followed. The mortgage bust and the subsequent financial crisis have spawned a similar legal fight, said Jaret Seiberg, a financial policy analyst with MF Global in Washington. “It’s going to be exceedingly difficult and take years to play out,” he said. “There’s not much incentive for either side to settle.” The litigation represents a more intense effort by the federal government to go after the financial services industry for its supposed mortgage failures. Indeed, the cases were brought on the basis of 64 subpoenas issued a year ago, giving the government an edge in its investigation that private investors suing the banks lack. The Obama administration as well as regulators like the Federal Reserve have been criticized for going too easy on the banks, which benefited from a $700 billion bailout package shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the autumn 2008. Much of that money has been repaid by the banks — but the rescue of the mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie has already cost taxpayers $153 billion, and the federal government estimates the effort could cost $363 billion through 2013. Even though the banks already face high legal bills from actions brought by other plaintiffs, including private investors, the suits filed Friday could cost the banks far more. In the case against Bank of America, for example, the suit claims that Fannie and Freddie bought more than $57 billion worth of risky mortgage securities from the bank and two companies it also acquired, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial. In addition to suing the companies, the complaints also identified individuals at many institutions responsible for the machinery of turning subprime mortgages into securities that somehow earned a AAA grade from the rating agencies. The filing did not cite a figure for the total losses the government wanted to recover, but in a similar case brought in July against UBS, the F.H.F.A. is trying to recover $900 million in losses on $4.5 billion in securities. A similar 20 percent claim against Bank of America could equal a $10 billion hit. In a suit that identifies 23 securities that Bank of America sold for $6 billion, the company “caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an amount to be determined at trial.” Within minutes of the filing of the suits, several banks responded with a preview of the legal arguments they will make in the coming months, namely that Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated investors who should have known the securities were not without risk, and that the losses were caused not by fraud or misrepresentation but by underlying difficulties in the housing market. In a statement, Bank of America said Fannie and Freddie “claimed to understand the risks inherent in investing in subprime securities and continued to invest heavily in those securities even after their regulator told them they did not have the risk management capabilities to do so.” In spite of that warning, Bank of America said, the government-controlled mortgage giants “are now seeking to hold other market participants responsible for their losses.” Other large banks also assembled huge amounts of so-called private label mortgage-backed securities for Fannie and Freddie that declined sharply in value after the housing bubble burst in 2007. JPMorgan Chase sold $33 billion, while Morgan Stanley sold over $10 billion and Goldman Sachs sold more than $11 billion. A who’s who of foreign banks were also big bundlers and sellers of these securities, like Deutsche Bank with $14.2 billion, Royal Bank of Scotland at $30.4 billion, and Credit Suisse selling $14.1 billion. All were sued Friday. “We believe the claims brought by the F.H.F.A. are unfounded,” said Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank. “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated investor, having issued trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and purchased hundreds of billions of dollars more, often after hand-picking the loans they now claim should not have been included in the offerings.“ Buried in the filings themselves, however, is a damning portrait of the excesses of the housing bubble, when borrowers were able to obtain home loans without basic proof of income or creditworthiness, and banks appeared only too happy to mine profits taking the risky loans and assembling them into securities that could be sold to investors. In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, for example, the suit says that “Goldman was not content to simply let poor loans pass into its securitizations.” In addition, the giant investment bank “took the fraud further, affirmatively seeking to profit from this knowledge.” When an outside analytics firm, Clayton, identified potential problems in the underlying mortgages Goldman was turning into securities, the suit said, “Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red flags revealed by Clayton’s review.” Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Citigroup. Similar behavior in terms of warnings provided by Clayton transpired at Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, RBS and UBS, according to the complaints.

The suits stem from subpoenas the finance agency issued to banks a year ago. If the case is not filed Friday, they said, it will come Tuesday, shortly before a deadline expires for the housing agency to file claims. The suits will argue the banks, which assembled the mortgages and marketed them as securities to investors, failed to perform the due diligence required under securities law and missed evidence that borrowers’ incomes were inflated or falsified. When many borrowers were unable to pay their mortgages, the securities backed by the mortgages quickly lost value. Fannie and Freddie lost more than $30 billion, in part as a result of the deals, losses that were borne mostly by taxpayers. In July, the agency filed suit against UBS, another major mortgage securitizer, seeking to recover at least $900 million, and the individuals with knowledge of the case said the new litigation would be similar in scope. Private holders of mortgage securities are already trying to force the big banks to buy back tens of billions in soured mortgage-backed bonds, but this federal effort is a new chapter in a huge legal fight that has alarmed investors in bank shares. In this case, rather than demanding that the banks buy back the original loans, the finance agency is seeking reimbursement for losses on the securities held by Fannie and Freddie. The impending litigation underscores how almost exactly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of a financial crisis caused in large part by subprime lending, the legal fallout is mounting. Besides the angry investors, 50 state attorneys general are in the final stages of negotiating a settlement to address abuses by the largest mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup. The attorneys general, as well as federal officials, are pressing the banks to pay at least $20 billion in that case, with much of the money earmarked to reduce mortgages of homeowners facing foreclosure. And last month, the insurance giant American International Group filed a $10 billion suit against Bank of America, accusing the bank and its Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch units of misrepresenting the quality of mortgages that backed the securities A.I.G. bought. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan all declined to comment. Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said, “We can’t comment on a suit that we haven’t seen and hasn’t been filed yet.” But privately, financial service industry executives argue that the losses on the mortgage-backed securities were caused by a broader downturn in the economy and the housing market, not by how the mortgages were originated or packaged into securities. In addition, they contend that investors like A.I.G. as well as Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated and knew the securities were not without risk. Investors fear that if banks are forced to pay out billions of dollars for mortgages that later defaulted, it could sap earnings for years and contribute to further losses across the financial services industry, which has only recently regained its footing. Bank officials also counter that further legal attacks on them will only delay the recovery in the housing market, which remains moribund, hurting the broader economy. Other experts warned that a series of adverse settlements costing the banks billions raises other risks, even if suits have legal merit. The housing finance agency was created in 2008 and assigned to oversee the hemorrhaging government-backed mortgage companies, a process known as conservatorship. “While I believe that F.H.F.A. is acting responsibly in its role as conservator, I am afraid that we risk pushing these guys off of a cliff and we’re going to have to bail out the banks again,” said Tim Rood, who worked at Fannie Mae until 2006 and is now a partner at the Collingwood Group, which advises banks and servicers on housing-related issues. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Bank of America shares have shed the Warren E. Buffett bounce, opening sharply lower on Friday morning after a flutter of bad news for the financial firm. Late Thursday night, The New York Times reported that federal regulators were set to sue several large banks, including Bank of America, for masking the risk of mortgage securities they packaged and sold at the height of the bubble. The Wall Street Journal said shortly thereafter that the Federal Reserve had taken the rare step of asking Bank of America to produce a contingency plan, in case its health worsens. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink It was rough going for most bank stocks on Friday morning, as Goldman Sachs‘s shares slid about 4 percent and Citigroup stock fell roughly 3 percent. But Bank of America’s shares fell even further, roughly 6 percent on Friday morning, dropping well below the $8 mark where it has hovered over the last week since Mr. Buffett agreed to invest $5 billion in the firm. After jumping 27 percent on Mr. Buffett’s announcement last Thursday and ending that day up 9.4 percent, the shares slid about 5 percent this week. The bank’s stock has been shellacked this summer amid rising fears that it will have to raise capital. Bank of America shares are down more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year. Brian T. Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, has rejected that notion of a liquidity problem. But, at the same time, he has also been moving to shed several noncore business lines. Earlier this week, the bank agreed to sell about half of its China Construction Bank holdings to a group of unidentified investors. The deal is expected to raise $8.3 billion for Bank of America.</text></article>

Known as the FSoc (pronounced EFF-sock), the council comprises all leading regulators and other responsible officials, headed by the Treasury secretary. So far, it has done little — reflecting the predominant official view that in the post-crisis recovery phase, financial risks in the United States are generally receding. Today’s Economist Perspectives from expert contributors. But three important and related issues emerged this summer that the FSoc needs to consider quickly: impending bank mergers that could create two more too-big-to-fail banks; whether to force the breakup of Bank of America; and how to rethink capital requirements for large systemically important banks, particularly as continuing European sovereign debt problems undermine the credibility of the international Basel Committee approach to bank capital. On the merger front, Capital One plans to buy the online business of ING, and PNC is acquiring the American business of Royal Bank of Canada. Both acquisitions would create banks with assets around $300 billion. (Steven Pearlstein had a very good column in The Washington Post on Sunday on the background to these deals.) In some official minds, Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for too-big-to-fail banks to exist — if any such bank got into trouble, it would be shut down without any significant costs being incurred by taxpayers. Most independent analysts and many people active in financial markets regard this proposition as unproven at best and, most likely, incorrect. For example, in a new working paper, “Too-Systemic-to-Fail: What Option Markets Imply About Sector-Wide Government Guarantees,” Bryan T. Kelly, Hanno Lustig and Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh compare the price of put options (i.e., the option to sell and therefore lock in a price) for the financial sector stock index relative to put options on individual banks’ stocks (Disclosure: I’m a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, which published this paper, and co-director of its Africa Project but had nothing to do with this paper). Put options are cheaper if they are less valuable to investors as protection against price collapses, and the index puts are a lot cheaper than the appropriately weighted sum of put options on individual bank stocks, particularly during the recent financial crisis. The authors infer that “investors price in substantial government bailout guarantees for the financial sector as a whole” — thus the index puts are cheap, because you don’t need to insure privately against overall collapse — with around half of the market value of the financial sector during 2003-9 accounted for by collective bailout guarantees. No other sector in the United States economy gets anything like this kind of insurance. At the same time, the researchers point out that the government does not eliminate all idiosyncratic company-specific risk; this is why put options on individual companies stocks are relatively more valuable. In a sense this message is encouraging, because it suggests some specific companies can fail or otherwise go out of business. But presumably, at critical moments specific megabanks have a particular and complete kind of downside protection. It’s hard to envisage the potential failure of a $2 trillion bank like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America without systemwide adverse consequences. The first question for the FSoc is therefore: Wouldn’t allowing mergers by Capital One and ING and by PNC and Royal Bank of Canada create financial companies whose potential risk is more likely to be systemic? The largest financial institution allowed to fail without a bailout since the collapse of Lehman Brothers was CIT Group, which had a balance sheet of around $80 billion. Perhaps Capital One and PNC are already too big to fail; PNC is No. 12 and Capital One is No. 13 on the official list of bank holding companies, ranked by assets as of June 30. We don’t know where the critical cutoff is — and perhaps more studies along the lines of the work by Professors Kelly, Lustig and Nieuwerburgh would be helpful, or the FSoc could find another way to make a reasonable and fact-based determination. But what really matters is what could happen in future systemic crises, and this is very hard to predict. So why not err on the side of caution and keep large banks from becoming bigger through merging? Or the FSoc could require these merging banks to demonstrate that they will generate social value commensurate with or in excess of the extra social risks that they are creating. The second question is closely related: Why not break up Bank of America? The Dodd-Frank legislative process ended up rejecting the idea that existing banks, as of 2010, should be broken up — as long as they continue to operate in a reasonable and sustainable fashion. But the legislative intent was also clear with regard to big banks that are in trouble: There should be preemptive action, either through pressing bank management or, if that doesn’t work, through regulator-imposed requirements. These requirements can include making the bank smaller, simpler and less systemic – in other words making sure that any kind of future “resolution” or “intervention” for that bank (both euphemisms for a form of bankruptcy) would not be a systemic event. If Bank of America were to fail today, it would create a systemic problem and presumably set off some sort of desperate policy reaction. The bank is the largest bank-holding company in the United States, with assets at the end of June of more than $2.26 trillion. If Bank of America is forced to divest various activities, like those it bought from Merrill Lynch, that would not eliminate systemic risk. But it would make this one troubled institution less central to the economy, and, if handled properly, less of a brake on economic recovery. This raises the third and arguably most important question: Why not increase capital requirements further for systemically important financial institutions? Warren Buffett’s agreement last week to invest in Bank of America has highlighted the lack of capital, at least at that one bank: It has too little equity relative to its debts, hence the need for Mr. Buffett. But Mr. Buffett, it now appears, is getting cumulative preferred stock — so he gets a guaranteed dividend before any common-stock holders get a return. This makes sense for him, without question. And his holding is loss-absorbing, in the sense that his equity would be wiped out before there was any question of defaulting on money owed to any creditors. This is presumably the best that Bank of America could do in terms of raising capital through the market. But it should not be enough from the perspective of FSoc, which is charged with overall responsibility for systemic risks. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed a methodology for systemically important institutions, but it rests on a very weak analytical basis, as Americans for Financial Reform pointed out in a recent letter. The FSoc would be making a very bad mistake if it continued to follow the European lead that set the lowest common denominator at Basel. The evident capital problems of European banks, and the way this will slow growth, were flagged at the Jackson Hole, Wyo., meeting of policy makers last week by Christine Lagarde, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund and, until recently, finance minister of France (see this assessment by Felix Salmon). The FSoc should listen to her warnings and think about what this means for American banks. If the Dodd-Frank legislation is to have lasting impact, the FSoc needs to establish itself as a meaningful overseer of systemic financial risks. It needs to meet and deliberate in an open and transparent manner. It should confront pressing questions of systemic risk head on, being clear about the analytical basis for its decisions. Business as usual is a recipe for disaster — in the United States, as in Europe.</text></article>

Buffett announced a $5 billion investment in Bank of America last week. Last week, our financial Superman, the mild-mannered Midwesterner Warren E. Buffett, swooped in again to save another bank, the financial markets, the American economy and just maybe our precious way of life. Mr. Buffett’s purchase of $5 billion worth of Bank of America preferred stock (on his usual generous terms, including long-lasting warrants to buy common stock at an attractive price) immediately stiffened the upper lips of chattering investors and pundits. Bank of America’s chairman hailed it as a “vote of confidence” in the bank. It was also celebrated as a signal that the worst was over in the rout recently experienced by the American financial sector. For the moment, that all seems right: Bank of America’s stock is up 17 percent from the Aug. 25 announcement, and stocks of the other three major American banks — JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — are also up. But as the news is digested, it could set off the opposite effect. The Buffett investment just might turn out to erode, not increase, confidence. And not only for Bank of America, but for the banking sector as a whole. Mr. Buffett’s investment reveals something both infuriating and scary. Bank of America has not been talking straight about its need for capital. “You cannot have the largest bank in the country saying, ‘We don’t need the money,’ and then paying this kind of price to Warren Buffett for capital they say they don’t need, “ said Daniel Alpert, who runs the investment firm Westwood Capital. “Industrywide, it’s a potential boomerang because we think, ‘Why should we believe any of these guys when they say they don’t need the money?’” “We’ve been through a massive crisis in 2007 and ’08 where executives of major financial institutions tried to hide their insolvency,” he added. “They said, ‘No, no, a thousand times no, we’re fine.’ And then they were gone.” Sure, Mr. Buffett reportedly approached Brian T. Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive, who initially rebuffed the investment offer — suggesting that Bank of America didn’t really need capital. Even so, Mr. Moynihan’s reticence didn’t last long. And if the bank truly didn’t need capital, why make such an expensive deal that could dilute other shareholders? The more investors think about it, the more Mr. Buffett’s announcement will intensify, not allay, their fears about Bank of America’s capital position. Indeed, Mr. Buffett is making something more resembling a loan than an equity investment. Of his $5 billion investment, only $2 billion counts in the important measure of capital that regulators look at, called Tier 1. The Trade View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink That is perhaps why Bank of America’s money-raising has not stopped with Mr. Buffett. On Monday, the bank sold about half of its stake in China Construction Bank for more than $8 billion. And over the last year, Bank of America has been jettisoning multiple businesses to raise cash and shore up its capital. Prudent, yes, and we can hope the bank’s management has learned a lesson about credibility. Last year, Mr. Moynihan suggested that the bank would be able to raise its dividend after it passed the Federal Reserve’s second round of stress tests. No such luck. That plan was blocked, rightly, by the Fed, whose exams revealed, among other perils, Bank of America’s overexposure to the sickly real estate sector. Yet Mr. Moynihan and Bank of America persisted, with analysts expecting the bank to come back in the middle of the year to push the Fed to revisit the dividend issue. So much for that now. Still, even with these moves, some investors and analysts do not think the bank’s actions will be sufficient, and that it will have to sell common shares to raise capital. Bank of America disagrees. Yes, the stock has “an overhang” thanks to economic and legal uncertainty, but “we understand that and are working very aggressively to address that,” said Jerome F. Dubrowski, a spokesman. “We have more than enough capital to run our business” based on current rules, he said. The bank has clearly explained to investors and regulators how it will reach compliance with the new rules ahead of schedule, he added. The Buffett opportunity was too good to pass up, Mr. Dubrowski said: “There’s only one Warren Buffett. We are very happy to have him, but it wasn’t driven by capital.” Yet Bank of America investors had whipped themselves into a panic in August because of the giant legal liability faced by the bank. The Buffett investment does not remove that, let alone any of the bank’s other millstones. Not only does the bank still face billions in legal settlement costs from Countrywide Financial deals, but it also has to buy back billions in faulty mortgages. Bank of America’s questionable foreclosure practices continue to drag it down, and, in addition, it faces Securities and Exchange Commission investigations into the actions of its subsidiary, Merrill Lynch, in the lead-up to the financial crisis. Bank of America acquired Merrill in 2008, under heavy pressure from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. The big problem, however, is not the unknown legal costs, but the exceedingly well-known exposure to real estate, both home mortgages and home-equity lines of credit. The bears will return, armed with a soft economy and the declining housing market. As they do, what is to stop them from jumping from bank to bank? Compared with Bank of America, Wells Fargo has more exposure to real estate and less capital. The bank classifies about 19 percent of its residential mortgage loans as either delinquent or nonperforming, a number similar to that of Bank of America. Wells Fargo says it’s fine, but where have we heard that before? Of all the big American banks, JPMorgan Chase, perhaps surprisingly, has the highest proportion of bad mortgages, at about 24 percent, according to Bankregdata.com. Citigroup is lowest at less than 14 percent. But JPMorgan’s balance sheet is more solid than that of any of the country’s other megabanks. Even if the major banks do not experience additional capital crises, the Fed plans to keep interest rates low for years. That will almost certainly depress bank lending rates, squeezing profits. That is, if the banks lend at all. In one of the most important business lines for Bank of America and the other big banks,Big Three, residential mortgages, the banks are pricing themselves out of the market, offering uncompetitive rates. The mortgage market remains shattered. Why aren’t the banks lending? They fear potential future litigation, for one. And they claim there is not enough demand from high-quality borrowers. But if they had conviction that the economy and housing markets were recovering, those concerns would ebb. So if bank leaders are not exhibiting confidence, why should the rest of us?

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/business/bank-of-america-accused-of-breaching-mortgage-accord.html?ref=bankofamericacorporation">Nevada Accuses Bank of America of Breaching Mortgage Accord<date>Published: August 30, 2011</date><text>The attorney general of Nevada is accusing Bank of America of repeatedly violating a broad loan modification agreement it struck with state officials in October 2008 and is seeking to rip up the deal so that the state can proceed with a suit against the bank over allegations of deceptive lending, marketing and loan servicing practices.In a complaint filed Tuesday in United States District Court in Reno, Catherine Cortez Masto, the Nevada attorney general, asked a judge for permission to end Nevada’s participation in the settlement agreement. This would allow her to sue the bank over what the complaint says were dubious practices uncovered by her office in an investigation that began in 2009. In her filing, Ms. Masto contends that Bank of America raised interest rates on troubled borrowers when modifying their loans even though the bank had promised in the settlement to lower them. The bank also failed to provide loan modifications to qualified homeowners as required under the deal, improperly proceeded with foreclosures even as borrowers’ modification requests were pending and failed to meet the settlement’s 60-day requirement on granting new loan terms, instead allowing months and in some cases more than a year to go by with no resolution, the filing says. The complaint says such practices violated an agreement Bank of America reached in the fall of 2008 with several states and later, in 2009, with Nevada, to settle lawsuits that accused its Countrywide unit of predatory lending. As the credit crisis grew, the settlement was heralded as a victory by state offices eager to help keep troubled borrowers in their homes and reduce their costs. Bank of America set aside $8.4 billion in the deal and agreed to help 400,000 troubled borrowers with loan modifications and other financial relief, such as lowering interest rates on mortgages. But foreclosure problems mounted in Nevada, where Countrywide originated 262,622 loans, and complaints about the bank’s loan servicing practices began flooding into Ms. Masto’s office shortly after the settlement was struck. She found that Bank of America had “materially and almost immediately violated” the terms of the settlement, according to the complaint. Ms. Masto declined to comment beyond the court filing. Jumana Bauwens, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, said the bank was reviewing Ms. Masto’s complaint. “We disagree that there has been any material breach of the consent decree and will continue to vigorously defend this action,” she said. Ms. Masto’s request to terminate the 2008 deal could raise further questions about the extent of its liabilities arising from Countrywide’s lending practices and from the bank’s own loan servicing activities in the foreclosure crisis. The move by the Nevada attorney general could also imperil the already shaky negotiations over improper foreclosure practices being conducted by state attorneys general and the four largest banks, including Bank of America. Those talks, which also involve federal officials, have stalled over the summer with disagreements over whether the deal would allow state regulators to bring future lawsuits against the institutions for questionable practices. Attorneys general who do not want to give up the right to file additional suits against the banks — including Ms. Masto, Eric Schneiderman of New York and Beau Biden of Delaware — have declined to endorse a proposed settlement. The breadth of the new Nevada complaint indicates that Bank of America’s problems extend throughout its mortgage operations, including origination, loan servicing and securitization. Nevada officials also found broad problems in the bank’s interactions with imperiled borrowers. For example, the complaint says the bank advised credit reporting agencies that consumers were in default when they were not, and contends that Bank of America employees deceived borrowers about why their requests to modify loans were denied. In addition, it says, the bank falsely claimed that the actual owners of loans had refused to allow changes to their mortgages, and it incorrectly claimed that borrowers had failed to make payments on trial loan modifications when in fact they had. Bank of America also misled borrowers, the Nevada attorney general’s filing noted, by offering loan modifications with one set of terms only to come back with a substantially different deal. Among the more troubling findings in the Nevada complaint is the contention by several Bank of America employees that the company imposed strict limits on the amount of time they could spend on the phone assisting troubled borrowers seeking help with their loans. One worker said in a deposition cited in the complaint that employees were punished if they spent more than seven minutes or 10 minutes with a customer. Even though these limits allowed almost no time for assistance, Bank of America employees who did not curtail their conversations were reprimanded, this employee said. The Nevada filing also maintains that Countrywide, which Bank of America acquired in 2008, did not deliver necessary loan documentation when it put together mortgage securities and sold them to investors during the boom. Under the typical pooling and servicing agreements struck between Countrywide and investors who bought the securities, the bank was required to endorse the mortgage note and deliver it to the trustee overseeing the pool. Countrywide failed to do so, the complaint notes. These paperwork failures should have barred the bank from foreclosing on borrowers, the Nevada complaint says, but it went ahead nonetheless. This aspect of Ms. Masto’s complaint echoes a lawsuit filed in early August by Mr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, to block a settlement between Bank of New York and Bank of America covering 530 Countrywide mortgage pools. In that case, Mr. Schneiderman contends that Countrywide did not deposit loans into the mortgage pools as required and that the bank had no right to bring foreclosure actions against these borrowers. Ms. Masto’s complaint asks that the court impose civil penalties on Bank of America and order it to cover the costs of caring for foreclosed properties borne by municipalities.</text></article>

This would allow her to sue the bank over what the complaint says were dubious practices uncovered by her office in an investigation that began in 2009. In her filing, Ms. Masto contends that Bank of America raised interest rates on troubled borrowers when modifying their loans even though the bank had promised in the settlement to lower them. The bank also failed to provide loan modifications to qualified homeowners as required under the deal, improperly proceeded with foreclosures even as borrowers’ modification requests were pending and failed to meet the settlement’s 60-day requirement on granting new loan terms, instead allowing months and in some cases more than a year to go by with no resolution, the filing says. The complaint says such practices violated an agreement Bank of America reached in the fall of 2008 with several states and later, in 2009, with Nevada, to settle lawsuits that accused its Countrywide unit of predatory lending. As the credit crisis grew, the settlement was heralded as a victory by state offices eager to help keep troubled borrowers in their homes and reduce their costs. Bank of America set aside $8.4 billion in the deal and agreed to help 400,000 troubled borrowers with loan modifications and other financial relief, such as lowering interest rates on mortgages. But foreclosure problems mounted in Nevada, where Countrywide originated 262,622 loans, and complaints about the bank’s loan servicing practices began flooding into Ms. Masto’s office shortly after the settlement was struck. She found that Bank of America had “materially and almost immediately violated” the terms of the settlement, according to the complaint. Ms. Masto declined to comment beyond the court filing. Jumana Bauwens, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, said the bank was reviewing Ms. Masto’s complaint. “We disagree that there has been any material breach of the consent decree and will continue to vigorously defend this action,” she said. Ms. Masto’s request to terminate the 2008 deal could raise further questions about the extent of its liabilities arising from Countrywide’s lending practices and from the bank’s own loan servicing activities in the foreclosure crisis. The move by the Nevada attorney general could also imperil the already shaky negotiations over improper foreclosure practices being conducted by state attorneys general and the four largest banks, including Bank of America. Those talks, which also involve federal officials, have stalled over the summer with disagreements over whether the deal would allow state regulators to bring future lawsuits against the institutions for questionable practices. Attorneys general who do not want to give up the right to file additional suits against the banks — including Ms. Masto, Eric Schneiderman of New York and Beau Biden of Delaware — have declined to endorse a proposed settlement. The breadth of the new Nevada complaint indicates that Bank of America’s problems extend throughout its mortgage operations, including origination, loan servicing and securitization. Nevada officials also found broad problems in the bank’s interactions with imperiled borrowers. For example, the complaint says the bank advised credit reporting agencies that consumers were in default when they were not, and contends that Bank of America employees deceived borrowers about why their requests to modify loans were denied. In addition, it says, the bank falsely claimed that the actual owners of loans had refused to allow changes to their mortgages, and it incorrectly claimed that borrowers had failed to make payments on trial loan modifications when in fact they had. Bank of America also misled borrowers, the Nevada attorney general’s filing noted, by offering loan modifications with one set of terms only to come back with a substantially different deal. Among the more troubling findings in the Nevada complaint is the contention by several Bank of America employees that the company imposed strict limits on the amount of time they could spend on the phone assisting troubled borrowers seeking help with their loans. One worker said in a deposition cited in the complaint that employees were punished if they spent more than seven minutes or 10 minutes with a customer. Even though these limits allowed almost no time for assistance, Bank of America employees who did not curtail their conversations were reprimanded, this employee said. The Nevada filing also maintains that Countrywide, which Bank of America acquired in 2008, did not deliver necessary loan documentation when it put together mortgage securities and sold them to investors during the boom. Under the typical pooling and servicing agreements struck between Countrywide and investors who bought the securities, the bank was required to endorse the mortgage note and deliver it to the trustee overseeing the pool. Countrywide failed to do so, the complaint notes. These paperwork failures should have barred the bank from foreclosing on borrowers, the Nevada complaint says, but it went ahead nonetheless. This aspect of Ms. Masto’s complaint echoes a lawsuit filed in early August by Mr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, to block a settlement between Bank of New York and Bank of America covering 530 Countrywide mortgage pools. In that case, Mr. Schneiderman contends that Countrywide did not deposit loans into the mortgage pools as required and that the bank had no right to bring foreclosure actions against these borrowers.

As people and businesses assess the damage left in Hurricane Irene‘s wake, some banks are trying to help. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase told its customers that it would waive A.T.M. fees through Sept. 4 for those in hurricane-affected areas. In an e-mail to customers, the bank said it would not charge fees related to overdraft, the use of non-Chase A.T.M.’s, late payments on credit cards and loans and early withdrawal on certificates of deposit. In addition, the bank will extend branch hours and increase the number of employees at branches “in severely affected areas.” A JPMorgan spokeswoman, Kristin Lemkau, said that branch employees were instructed to reach out to local businesses and use their “good judgment” in helping consumers secure loans at flexible terms. “We’ve given them the green light to act on the spot,” Ms. Lemkau said. “They can accelerate the loan approval process and give favorable financing terms when they can.” Employees who can travel safely are expected to report to work on Monday, but JPMorgan has made “backup childcare” services available.

Capital One, which has more than 1,000 branches in the region, said it was willing to work with customers to grant interest rate reductions and fee waivers, depending on their situations. In a statement to DealBook, Bank of America said it was actively working with customers “to help them with their specific needs.” The company expects “minimal” disruptions to its operations and plans to deploy mobile A.T.M. units to affected areas as necessary. On Monday, Wells Fargo announced it will suspend fees associated with using non-Wells Fargo A.T.M.s and for early withdrawals on C.D.s, through Sept. 2. A representative for PNC Financial Services said the firm was still reviewing the impact of the storm and its options. Their actions come as the banks themselves grapple with the fallout of Hurricane Irene. Although the storm slowed down as it pushed through the Northeast corridor on Sunday, it still damaged power lines and caused severe flooding in certain regions. As of Monday morning, JPMorgan reported 103 branches without power, about 10 percent of its presence in the greater New York area. About 30 locations reported flooding or physical damage to the building. PNC said 55 branches were still without power. At the height of the storm, about 200 were affected. While 25 are expected to get power on Monday, at least one branch, its location in New Hope, Penn., is still inaccessible because of flooding.</text></article>

The deal, which came just days after Warren E. Buffett agreed to invest $5 billion in the bank, is the latest asset sale for the beleaguered financial company. Over the last month, Bank of America has sold its Canadian credit card division and has put its European card operation on the block, as it continues to clear noncore assets from its books. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Buffett's Stake Viewed as Seal of Approval The press release The moves come amid recent fears that Bank of America lacks sufficient capital, concerns that its chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, has tried to allay. On Monday, Bank of America highlighted the deal’s effect on capital levels. Bruce R. Thompson, the bank’s chief financial officer, said in the statement that the deal would increase its Tier 1 capital by $3.5 billion. A collection of international financial regulators, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, sets minimum capital requirements for big banks across the world including required levels for Tier 1 capital, a crucial measure that regulators use to assess the health of an institution. Under the Basel requirements, Bank of America must retain a Tier 1 capital ratio of 3.5 percent, which will gradually increase to more than 9 percent over the next decade. Under the terms of the deal, Bank of America will sell 13.1 billion common shares of the China Construction Bank Corporation to a group of unidentified investors. A consortium of sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East as well as several private equity firms were in the negotiations for the stake, two officials briefed on the talks said Friday. The deal is expected to close later in the quarter. Even after the sale, Bank of America will still hold about 5 percent of China Construction Bank. According to its statement, Bank of America is in talks to expand a separate existing “strategic assistance agreement” between the two banks. “Our partnership with China Construction Bank has been mutually beneficial,” Mr. Moynihan said in the statement. Stock in Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., has rallied in the days after Mr. Buffett’s investment. Shares rose 63 cents, or 8 percent, to $8.39 on Monday, though they are still down 37 percent since the beginning of the year.</text></article>

Buffett invested $5 billion in the beleaguered American financial giant. A consortium of sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East as well as several private equity firms are in negotiations with bankers and could close a deal by early next week, two officials briefed on the talks said Friday. While Bank of America plans to sell at least half of its 10 percent stake in the Chinese bank, it is willing to unload much more than that for the right price, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because the sale was still being negotiated. The sale would improve Bank of America’s capital position under international Basel III regulations. Bank of America’s stock fell by nearly 30 percent earlier this month on investor fears that it would have to sell more shares to raise more capital amid huge losses on soured mortgage securities and a weakening economy. Mr. Buffett’s investment — and the likely sale of the Chinese stake — have helped allay those worries while reinforcing investor confidence in management, and Bank of America shares rose 1.4 percent to $7.76 a share on Friday. The stock jumped more than 9 percent Thursday on news of Mr. Buffett’s move. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment. But if a deal is completed soon, it would also defy speculation that deep-pocketed buyers would be hard to find at a time of intense volatility in the markets and uncertainty about the global economy. The sale by Bank of America has also been complicated by the fact that other institutions have been selling shares in China Construction and other Chinese banks. In July, Singapore’s state investment fund, Temasek Holdings, sold more than $1 billion worth of shares in the China Construction Bank. Unloading the Chinese shares represents one more step in reversing the legacy of Bank of America’s former chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, who made Bank of America the nation’s largest bank through a long series of acquisitions, some more profitable than others. One in particular, the 2008 purchase of Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender, has been disastrous, costing the bank more than $30 billion. The investment in the China Construction Bank, which began in 2005, has been much more successful. In its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bank of America estimated the entire stake was worth almost $19.6 billion, about $10 billion more than it paid. Bank of America owns 25.6 billion shares of China Construction, of which 23.6 billion are covered by a lock-up preventing sales that expires on Monday. A lock-up on the remaining 2 billion shares expires next August. For Bank of America, unloading the China Construction stake is also part of a broader effort by its chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, to sell off noncore businesses, strengthen the bank’s capital position and focus on the company’s retail and investment banking operations. Since the start of 2010, Mr. Moynihan has sold more than $30 billion worth of assets, most recently unloading the bank’s Canadian credit card business and a portfolio of commercial real estate. The potential deal was first reported by CNBC. While Mr. Buffett’s move and the potential sale of China Construction have been greeted positively by investors, the overhang from Countrywide still looms large. In June, Bank of America reached an $8.5 billion settlement with 22 major holders of soured mortgage securities to help cap future repurchase claims. That deal was set to be reviewed by a state court judge in November, but a group of other investors who oppose the settlement filed a notice Friday to move the case to federal court in Manhattan. If that effort were to ultimately succeed, it could delay resolution of the settlement, but legal experts said permanently moving the venue would not be easy. The trustee for the 22 investors, Bank of New York Mellon, is expected to ask next week that the case be kept in state court. The state court had imposed a deadline of Tuesday for any objections to the agreement.</text></article>

Buffett. The billionaire investor snatched up shares of Goldman Sachs and General Electric during some of the darkest days of 2008, injecting life and funds into the companies and turning a handsome profit later. On Goldman alone, Mr. Buffett netted $1.7 billion. On Thursday, he sought to turn the same trick again, investing $5 billion in an institution that is still struggling to recover from the financial crisis, Bank of America. Like the Goldman deal, the Bank of America infusion comes with a rich plum: a guaranteed dividend payout of about $300 million a year, whether the stock goes up or down. The stock shot up on Thursday as the investment allayed concerns about the bank. Its shares rose as much as 27 percent, before ending the day up 9.4 percent, at $7.65. ''He has the golden touch,'' said Mitchel Penn, an analyst with Legg Mason Capital Management, one of Bank of America's largest shareholders. ''It's a wonderful vote of confidence in Bank of America.'' The deal came together quickly. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Buffett's assistant called the office of Brian T. Moynihan, the Bank of America chief executive, and a call was set up, said two people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Mr. Moynihan told the investor that the bank did not need capital. Mr. Buffett responded by saying that he was planning to invest for the long term and outlined a proposal. Interested, Mr. Moynihan suggested that the two of them meet to discuss it. No, thanks, Mr. Buffett said, his mind was made up and he didn't need a sit-down. The call was soon over. In the hours that followed, Mr. Moynihan, Bruce Thompson, the bank's chief financial officer, and Charles Holliday, the chairman, met and briefed directors on Mr. Buffett's proposal. Lawyers for both sides - Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson for Mr. Buffett's company and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which represented Bank of America - hashed out the details, working straight through the night. Robert E. Denham, a partner at Munger Tolles, said there were no major hurdles to an agreement. ''It's a very boring story,'' he said laughing. ''Just a very, very intense turning of the documents.'' At 7 a.m. on Thursday, the board held a conference call to approve the deal. The investment comes at a pivotal time for Bank of America. It has set aside more than $20 billion to cover its legal exposure for mortgages made during the housing bubble, and the bank faces a nationwide investigation into its foreclosure practices. Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors. Mr. Buffett is aware of the bank's mortgage issues, but a person briefed on his thinking said that the investor felt that Bank of America was well positioned to make money over the long term and that the legal woes would diminish. At the age of 80, Mr. Buffett can claim a global reputation as a savvy investor for his bets on railroads, insurers and famous brands like Coca-Cola. But in recent years, he has also become one of the world's mightiest champions of the banking industry. With the $5 billion investment by his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett stands to eventually become the largest shareholder in Bank of America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Berkshire is already the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo and American Express. It stands to be a large stakeholder in Goldman when shares he obtained during the financial crisis convert. ''He always likes to buy into industries he understands and he feels comfortable with banking,'' said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar. That was not always the case. In his 1990 letter to shareholders Mr. Buffett wrote, ''The banking business is no favorite of ours.'' He had good reason to be skeptical. Just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of preferred shares in Salomon Inc. To protect his holdings, Mr. Buffett did something unusual, stepping in to become chairman in August 1991 after he forced out Salomon's chairman, John Gutfreund, during a Treasury auction scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving Salomon from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. Mr. Buffett stepped down as chairman of Salomon about 10 months later. It was many years before he would return to Wall Street. During the financial crisis in September 2008, Mr. Buffett came to the rescue of Goldman, investing $5 billion in the firm. A week later, he bought $3 billion in preferred shares from General Electric, as the conglomerate's shares were plummeting. Each investment proved to be highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett's holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. By some measures, his Bank of America investment closely resembles the earlier deals. Each contained investments of $5 billion or lower and the deals all included warrants with strike prices near the pre-deal share price. During the crisis, however, Mr. Buffett commanded a steeper price. ''It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,'' said Mr. Woodbury of Morningstar. Under the terms of the Bank of America deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that will pay a 6 percent annual dividend. Mr. Buffett also will receive warrants for 700 million shares that he can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium. The deal is expected to close on Sept. 1, according to a regulatory filing. It was the sort of move that many industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James P. Gorman, told reporters at his firm's annual meeting that a big-name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting ''the malaise to lift.'' Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays, on Thursday commended Bank of America for being the one to nab the highly coveted ''Buffett seal of approval.''

Buffett, the legendary investor, is sinking $5 billion into Bank of America in a bold show of faith in the country’s biggest, and most beleaguered, financial institution. It comes amid deepening worries about the long-term health of the company, which has already had to set aside roughly $20 billion to atone for its mortgage misdeeds at the height of the housing bubble.Bank of America’s problems are emblematic of the economic woes facing the country in general and the housing market in particular. Its fortunes have been waning as the outlook for growth has darkened and the financial markets have gyrated. More than some other large banks, Bank of America’s fate is also heavily intertwined with that of consumers. It services one in five home loans, and with 5,700 branches assembled through decades of mergers, it counts 58 million customers. The losses suffered by the bank — $9 billion over the last 18 months — have spurred worries about just how solid its foundations are and raised fears that it will need tens of billions of dollars in fresh capital. Bank executives insist that that is not the case, and they were quick to trumpet Mr. Buffett’s move as a crucial show of support for a management team, especially the chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan. “In the shaky couple of weeks that we’ve gone through in the financial markets, it’s a good time for this vote of confidence by a savvy investor,” said Charles O. Holliday Jr., the bank’s chairman. “We didn’t need the capital, but it doesn’t hurt to have more in a volatile time.” Even as investors cheered Mr. Buffett’s investment, lifting the bank’s shares more than 9 percent, analysts cautioned that it did not address more fundamental problems that will take years to correct. Moreover, it does little to lift the uncertainty over how much the company will ultimately have to pay to angry investors holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of soured mortgage securities. Also hanging over the company is the prospect of a multibillion-dollar mortgage settlement with the government. “This is a good endorsement but it’s no silver bullet,” said Michael Mayo, a bank analyst with Crédit Agricole in New York. “Bank of America got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval and Buffett got a sweetheart deal, but the company hasn’t been able to get its arms around the magnitude of the losses.” The bulk of those losses stem from the company’s disastrous acquisition of Countrywide Financial in 2008, the subprime lender whose reckless lending policies have made it a symbol of the housing bubble. Mr. Moynihan’s predecessor, Kenneth D. Lewis, paid $4 billion for Countrywide. It has already cost the company more than $30 billion. To offset that red ink and strengthen the bank’s capital position, Mr. Moynihan has sold more than $30 billion worth of assets since the start of 2010, most recently unloading its Canadian credit card business and a portfolio of commercial real estate. Bank of America shares have been pounded in recent weeks amid deepening worries about just how much the mortgage mess will eventually cost the bank, how the downshift in the economy will crimp earnings and whether it can absorb losses without having to raise more capital. Earlier this week, the stock dropped to its lowest point since the aftermath of the financial crisis, and nearly 30 percent below where it began the month. Other banks’ stocks have dropped, too, but the speed of the descent and the surge in the cost of insuring the company’s debt awakened memories of the financial crisis, when companies like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers found themselves short of capital. Bank of America’s capital position is much stronger than it was going into the financial crisis — it held $218 billion at the end of the second quarter by one key measure, but was still behind peers like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

FLOYD NORRIS Notions on high and low finance. B of A will pay less to be saved, but that can be explained by the fact there is less panic to contend with this time. This time the rumors were that the bank needed to raise capital; back then, the rumors were that Goldman was the next Lehman Brothers. The terms of the two deals are similar. Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett’s company, invests $5 billion in straight preferred stock, and gets a warrant allowing him to invest another $5 billion in common stock at a set price. The preferred stock is perpetual, but the company can buy it back at a premium whenever it wishes to do so. At Goldman he got a 10 percent coupon on the preferred, and it would cost Goldman a 10 percent penalty to buy it back. At B of A, he gets 6 percent coupon and a 5 percent premium for a buyback. The warrants are different, and reflect that B of A was in a better position. B of A stock closed on Wednesday at $6.99. The warrants are at $7.142857. So at least B of A gets a little premium to market price at the time of the deal if the warrants are exercised. Goldman shares were at $125.05 when the deal with Mr. Buffett was announced. His warrant was at $115 per share. He got a discount exercise price. How has Mr. Buffett done at Goldman? Fine on the preferred. Not so fine on the warrant. Goldman bought the preferred back in April. Add in the interest and the repurchase premium, and Berkshire made $1.75 billion over two and a half years. Anything it collects on the warrants will be gravy, but at the moment there is none available. Goldman shares trade around $110. The warrants had five-year terms, so Berkshire has until October 2013 to exercise them. Mr. Buffett did do a little better on one term of the warrants at B of A. They are 10-year warrants, twice as long as at Goldman. So he has a lot longer time for the share price to work out. When Mr. Buffett made his first Wall Street rescue, of Salomon Brothers amid a scandal two decades ago, he was reported to have called his investment a Treasury bill with a lottery ticket attached. He would get a solid return if the company merely survived, and a great one if it prospered. Seen that way, this is not nearly as risky as a bet as a purchase of B of A stock would be. That may be the essential point that led the early euphoria to fade. B of A stock leaped to $8.80 soon after the opening this morning, but was under $8 by 11 a.m. It is a sign of both the prestige of Mr. Buffett and of the fragility of markets that either of these deals were available to him. Of course, there are risks in being a rescuer. A rescuer needs to use cash it can afford to lose, and it needs to have the judgment and courage to refuse to throw good money after bad if things do not go according to plan. In August 2007, Countrywide Financial, a major home lender, was bailed out by B of A, which invested $2 billion in convertible preferred stock. It was convertible at a discount to current market value. B of A stock rose on the news. A few months later, with Countrywide in deeper trouble, B of A agreed to take over the whole company for stock then worth $4 billion. The deal closed July 1, 2008. By then B of A was trading for about half what it was worth when it first invested in Countrywide. It had a lot further to fall. It was one of the worst mergers ever.

Buffett’s investment has a guaranteed payout. The financial crisis has been good to Warren E. Buffett. The billionaire investor snatched up shares of Goldman Sachs and General Electric during some of the darkest days of 2008, injecting life and funds into the companies and turning a handsome profit later. On Goldman alone, Mr. Buffett netted $1.7 billion. On Thursday, he sought to turn the same trick again, investing $5 billion in an institution that is still struggling to recover from the financial crisis, Bank of America. Like the Goldman deal, the Bank of America infusion comes with a rich plum: a guaranteed dividend payout of about $300 million a year, whether the stock goes up or down. The stock shot up on Thursday as the investment allayed concerns about the bank. Its shares rose as much as 27 percent, before ending the day up 9.4 percent, at $7.65. “He has the golden touch,” said Mitchel Penn, an analyst with Legg Mason Capital Management, one of Bank of America’s largest shareholders. “It’s a wonderful vote of confidence in Bank of America.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Video: Buffett's $5 Billion Bet The Problems at a Shaky Bank of America The deal came together quickly. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Buffett’s assistant called the office of Brian T. Moynihan, the Bank of America chief executive, and a call was set up, said two people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Mr. Moynihan told the investor that the bank did not need capital. Mr. Buffett responded by saying that he was planning to invest for the long term and outlined a proposal. Interested, Mr. Moynihan suggested that the two of them meet to discuss it. No, thanks, Mr. Buffett said, his mind was made up and he didn’t need a sit-down. The call was soon over. In the hours that followed, Mr. Moynihan, Bruce Thompson, the bank’s chief financial officer, and Charles Holliday, the chairman, met and briefed directors on Mr. Buffett’s proposal. Lawyers for both sides — Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson for Mr. Buffett’s company and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which represented Bank of America — hashed out the details, working straight through the night. Robert E. Denham, a partner at Munger Tolles, said there were no major hurdles to an agreement. “It’s a very boring story,” he said laughing. “Just a very, very intense turning of the documents.” At 7 a.m. on Thursday, the board held a conference call to approve the deal. The investment comes at a pivotal time for Bank of America. It has set aside more than $20 billion to cover its legal exposure for mortgages made during the housing bubble, and the bank faces a nationwide investigation into its foreclosure practices. Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors. Mr. Buffett is aware of the bank’s mortgage issues, but a person briefed on his thinking said that the investor felt that Bank of America was well positioned to make money over the long term and that the legal woes would diminish. At the age of 80, Mr. Buffett can claim a global reputation as a savvy investor for his bets on railroads, insurers and famous brands like Coca-Cola. But in recent years, he has also become one of the world’s mightiest champions of the banking industry. With the $5 billion investment by his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett stands to eventually become the largest shareholder in Bank of America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Berkshire is already the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo and American Express. It stands to be a large stakeholder in Goldman when shares he obtained during the financial crisis convert. “He always likes to buy into industries he understands and he feels comfortable with banking,” said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar. That was not always the case. In his 1990 letter to shareholders Mr. Buffett wrote, “The banking business is no favorite of ours.” He had good reason to be skeptical. Just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of preferred shares in Salomon Inc. To protect his holdings, Mr. Buffett did something unusual, stepping in to become chairman in August 1991 after he forced out Salomon’s chairman, John Gutfreund, during a Treasury auction scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving Salomon from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. Mr. Buffett stepped down as chairman of Salomon about 10 months later. It was many years before he would return to Wall Street. During the financial crisis in September 2008, Mr. Buffett came to the rescue of Goldman, investing $5 billion in the firm. A week later, he bought $3 billion in preferred shares from General Electric, as the conglomerate’s shares were plummeting. Each investment proved to be highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. By some measures, his Bank of America investment closely resembles the earlier deals. Each contained investments of $5 billion or lower and the deals all included warrants with strike prices near the pre-deal share price. During the crisis, however, Mr. Buffett commanded a steeper price. “It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,” said Mr. Woodbury of Morningstar. Under the terms of the Bank of America deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that will pay a 6 percent annual dividend. Mr. Buffett also will receive warrants for 700 million shares that he can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium. The deal is expected to close on Sept. 1, according to a regulatory filing. It was the sort of move that many industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, told reporters at his firm’s annual meeting that a big-name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting “the malaise to lift.” Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays, on Thursday commended Bank of America for being the one to nab the highly coveted “Buffett seal of approval.” In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E. Buffett’s decision to invest $5 billion in Bank of America.</text></article>

Moynihan, left, Bank of America’s chief, and Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway 1:04 p.m. | Updated Warren E. Buffett comes to the rescue, again. On Thursday, Berkshire Hathaway, run by Mr. Buffett, announced plans to invest $5 billion in Bank of America, a vote of confidence for the beleaguered financial firm. While investors initially cheered the news bidding up bank stocks in trading this morning, the sector settled down in the afternoon as the market digested the deal. Shares of Bank of America, which spiked more than 25 percent on Thursday, are currently at $7.55, up roughly 8 percent. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, both up which jumped nearly 10 percent in the morning, gave back much of their early gains, too. JPMorgan Chase was off slightly in the afternoon. The pullback reflects the continued trepidation about the industry, which is clouded by economic concerns, regulatory uncertainty, and legal liabilities.

Bank of America's Capital Quandary Still, the Berkshire investment has helped allay concerns about Bank of America. Shares of the financial firm have been battered of late over fears the company lacks sufficient capital. The stock has fallen by nearly 30 percent since the beginning of August. “I remain confident that we have the capital and liquidity we need to run our business,” Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan said in a statement. “At the same time, I also recognize that a large investment by Warren Buffett is a strong endorsement in our vision and our strategy.” The Berkshire investment comes at a pivotal time for Bank of America. Its troubled mortgage division has racked up billions of dollars in legal bills, and the financial firm faces a nationwide investigation into its foreclosure practices. Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors. Mr. Moynihan has taken steps to cut costs and improve its capital cushion. He put the European credit card operation up for sale and sold off the Canadian card division, making it clear non-core assets would be on the block. Last week, the bank announced plans to cut 3,500 jobs. In a memo to employees, Mr. Moynihan said that “we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully.” But the embattled chief stopped short of raising capital, reiterating that the financial firm was on solid footing. The assertions did little to soothe investors. Then on early Wednesday, Mr. Buffett called Mr. Moynihan to discuss a potential deal. At first, Bank of America’s chief was skeptical, saying the bank didn’t need a capital injection. But Mr. Buffett emphasized it would be a long-term investment, not a short-term fix. Over the course of the day and multiple calls, they hammered out the investment, finalizing the details late on Wednesday. Under the terms of the deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that pay a 6 percent annual dividend, and receive warrants for 700 million shares that it can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium. It is the sort of move industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman told reporters at his firm’s annual meeting that a big name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting the “the malaise to lift.” “We think this news is clearly a positive for the entire group as Buffett’s investment injects confidence into the system and Bank of America in particular following its consistent erosion in recent trading,” Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr said in a research note, adding that it should help dampen volatility in the stock. Mr. Buffett has played the role of savior before. In the depths of the financial crisis, Berkshire Hathaway gave Goldman Sachs a $5 billion lifeline, which came with a hefty 10 percent dividend. The investment bank paid back the money earlier this year after getting the greenlight from regulators. When shares of General Electric got hit, Mr. Buffett stepped in with a $3 billion investment. The deal also came with a 10 percent annual payout. With Bank of America, Mr. Buffett is once again jumping in at a point of weakness. Since the beginning of the year, the bank’s shares have dropped to less than $7, from $15. Last year, it was trading at more than $19. “Bank of America is a strong, well-led company, and I called Brian to tell him I wanted to invest in it,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement. “I am impressed with the profit-generating abilities of this franchise, and that they are acting aggressively to put their challenges behind them. Bank of America is focused on their customers and on serving them well. That’s what customers want, and that’s the company’s strategy.” Mr. Buffett is a fan of financial companies that he thinks have a strong franchise and brand. He owns Wells Fargo, gradually upping his stake over the past year. In the latest quarter, he bought nearly 10 million shares of the lender. He has also counted Bank of America among his past holdings. In the midst of the subprime crisis in 2007, Berkshire bought 8.7 million shares, quickly increasing the stake to 9.1 million shares. But Mr. Buffett was critical of management at the time. He told Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that Bank of America paid a “crazy price” to acquire Merrill Lynch in the midst of the disaster. Mr. Buffett sold off his remaining shares in Bank of America at the end of 2010. In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E. Buffett’s decision to invest $5 billion in Bank of America.</text></article>

Buffett is among the nation’s best deal-makers, and in the $5 billion investment he struck with Bank of America, he’s getting a guaranteed profit. Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway will receive 50,000 perpetual preferred shares. That stock carry a 6 percent annual dividend payable quarterly, meaning that Bank of America will be sending about $300 million a year to Berkshire’s headquarters in Omaha. Put another way, Berkshire will be earning $821,917.81 a day, or $9.51 a second. All in all, not a bad way to spend $5 billion, especially when Berkshire had $47.9 billion in cash and equivalents as of the end of the second quarter. Berkshire will also receive 10-year warrants that can be converted into 700 million common shares in Bank of America, at a strike price of about $7.14. (To be exact, $7.142857.) As of Thursday afternoon, that meant an immediate paper profit of $392 million on the warrants, based on Bank of America’s stock price of $7.70. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Want more granular detail? Analysts told Reuters that the actual value of Berkshire’s warrants are worth $3.17 billion to $3.84 billion, though the actual value will change over time. And Dealbreaker has put together a nicely considered analysis of the value of Bank of America implied by Berkshire’s investment, replete with a Google Docs spreadsheet. The short answer: $5.28 a share or so. (The stock was trading around $7.70 on Thursday afternoon.) The deal will provide Berkshire with a tidy profit as long as Mr. Buffett can hold on to the stake. Bank of America can buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium, or an additional $250 million. Bank of America is undeniably getting a better deal than Goldman Sachs or General Electric did when they secured similar deals with Berkshire. Mr. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants in Goldman and $3 billion for the same in G.E. The preferred shares in both carried a 10 percent annual dividend and a 10 percent premium to be repaid early. In Goldman’s case, when it finally bought out Berkshire’s stake in the spring, it paid out $5.64 billion. But as Mr. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday morning, those were struck during the financial crisis, and therefore demanded much harsher terms.</text></article>

Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. With his $5 billion investment in Bank of America, Warren E. Buffett is adding yet another American financial giant to his stock portfolio. His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, has long been an investor in the nation’s banks, and counts five firms in which it has a major stake. Here were Berkshire’s top holdings in financial companies as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing: FIRM MARKET VALUE OF STAKE AMOUNT OF SHARES CHANGE FROM 1ST QUARTER American Express $7.84 billion 151,610,700 No change Wells Fargo $9.89 billion 352,327,608 + 9,703,683 shares US Bancorp $1.76 billion 69,039,426 No change Source: Bloomberg News/S.E.C. filing Berkshire also owns smaller stakes in the Bank of New York Mellon and the M&amp;T Bank Corporation. Of course, Mr. Buffett’s most notable bets on the finance sector of late came from his big capital injections into Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis. Those two deals closely resemble his new investment in Bank of America; he bought $5 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares in Goldman and $3 billion in G.E. Those purchases were highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a 10 percent annual dividend, as well as requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. Still, not all of Mr. Buffett’s Wall Street moves have turned out well. While Berkshire earned a profit from its Goldman and G.E. investments, warrants that it received along with the preferred shares remain underwater. (The 700 million warrants that Berkshire received from Bank of America, on the other hand, are currently in the money: They carry a strike price of $7.142857, while the firm’s stock price is at $7.89 as of late Thursday morning.) Going further back, just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of Salomon Brothers preferred shares.

Berkshire sold its shares in the firm in 1997, after Salomon was sold to what is now Citigroup. Outside of banks, Mr. Buffett declined to invest in the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1993.

RT @BeckyQuickcnbc: Buffett thought of Bank of America investment idea Wed morning while in the tub.Thu Aug 25 13:32:46 via webPeter Lattman peterlattman Lorey Sebastian/DreamworksMena Suvari during a rose-petal bath in “American Beauty.” What is it with Warren E. Buffett and bathtubs? The legendary investor, who announced on Thursday that he was investing $5 billion in Bank of America, said in an interview with CNBC shortly after the announcement that he had dreamed up the idea of helping the beleaguered bank just two days earlier, while taking a bath. Reaction to that bit of information was far from bubbly. “I could’ve done without that,” wrote Josh Brown on his Reformed Broker blog. “TMI,” our own Peter Lattman wrote in a Twitter message. But as it turns out, baths and bathtubs are a bit of a theme for Mr. Buffett. In “The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,” Alice Schroeder’s 2008 biography of the Berkshire Hathaway chairman, one chapter is titled “The Bathtub Steeplechase.” Ms. Schroeder describes how a young Mr. Buffett would play a game with his sisters in which they would roll marbles down the side of a bathtub filled with water. The marbles, each of which was given a name, were rolled simultaneously into the water, and the first to hit the stopper won the race. “His sisters watched him race the marbles over and over, trying to improve their times,” Ms. Schroeder wrote. “The marbles never tired, the stopwatch never erred, and — unlike his audience — Warren never seemed bored by the repetition.” In the book, Mr. Buffett is also said to compare his brain to a bathtub: The tub filled with ideas and experiences and matters that interested him. When he had no more use for information, whoosh — the plug popped up, and the memory drained away…The bathtub memory’s efficiency freed up enormous amounts of space for the new and the productive. Buffett thought of the bathtub memory as a helper that allowed him to “look forward,” rather than “looking backward” all the time like his mother. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Buffett Invests $5 Billion in Bank of America But Mr. Buffett’s fascination with bathtubs did not end with his childhood. In 2008, after making a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs at the height of the financial crisis — a deal that is being compared with the recent Bank of America deal — he offered another tub-related analogy. “Unfortunately, the economy is a little like a bathtub,” Mr. Buffett said in an interview at the time. “You can’t have cold water in the front and hot water in the back. And what was happening on Wall Street was going to immerse that bathtub very, very quickly in terms of business.” Investors are hoping his Bank of America investment, born in a bathtub, will shut off the market’s Jacuzzi-like volatility.</text></article>

Judging by the stock price, Bank of America doesn’t appear to have many fans. But some of the stock’s supporters are now leaping to its defense. Prominent analysts like Meredith Whitney and Anthony Polini at Raymond James sought on Wednesday to shoot down rumors and ease worries that the bank needs more capital. “Recent news items have been as absurd as any we’ve seen in many years of following the company,” Mr. Polini said in a report on Wednesday. “Our rational analysis indicates that the company has excess liquidity, a flexible (and sound) balance sheet, very high reserve levels and more than enough capital to put the mortgage mess behind it without issuing a single new common share.” And Wednesday the markets, which have been merciless with Bank of America, smiled on the stock. The bank’s shares shot up more than 10 percent by late Wednesday afternoon, as the stock once again flirted with $7 territory. What a difference a day can make. On Tuesday, Bank of America shares continued their recent free fall before settling at just above $6, a level not seen since the credit crisis. The stock has fallen roughly 50 percent this year. Investors, in part, are reacting to recent warnings from a handful of analysts and commentators who say that the bank may need to raise more capital. True or not, the market has latched on to that perception. Henry Blodget, the former stock analyst turned business blogger, escalated the debate on Tuesday. Theorizing that it would take Bank of America $100 billion to $200 billion to “clean up” its books, he raised questions about the value of the bank’s assets and the extent of its legal bills stemming from the troubled mortgage division. But Bank of America was quick to hit back at Mr. Blodget, saying he made “exaggerated and unwarranted claims.” Mr. Blodget was barred from the securities industry in 2003 for privately disparaging stocks he was encouraging investors to buy. Not everyone agrees with Mr. Blodget’s take on Bank of America. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Ms. Whitney took to the airwaves, telling Bloomberg radio on Wednesday that there was no immediate need for the bank to raise capital. Mr. Polini jotted off a report that predicted brighter days for the bank’s stock. “We believe,” Mr. Polini said, that Bank of America’s stock “can more than triple from recent price levels.” He noted that the stock bottomed out at roughly $4 in early 2009 before it climbed back to $20 a year later. Richard X. Bove of Rochdale Securities blamed Bank of America’s woes partly on state regulators who are aiming to extract a steep fine from the bank for its questionable foreclosure practices. Short-sellers and state attorneys general “have banded together to break this bank,” he said in a report this week. (Earlier this summer, Mr. Bove had told DealBook that he moved all his holdings to cash.) Other analysts were hesitant to lead the cheer for Bank of America, though they noted that investors should be mindful that the current market tumult is not 2008 all over again. “Investors need to step back and think through what actually occurs in a time of crisis and why the current environment (at least to date) is significantly different than the financial crisis of 2008-2009,” Stifel Nicolaus analysts said in a report.</text></article>

The number of institutions on the agency’s problem list fell for the first time in nearly five years. Bank failures are down. Loan books even grew slightly. So the crisis in America’s financial system is officially coming to an end.Yet although in aggregate the industry looks in better shape, the reality is more complicated. America’s biggest banks are indeed recovering nicely. But they are doing so at the expense of the country’s thousands of smaller institutions. Consider the F.D.I.C.’s latest statistical data release. The country’s 106 banks with assets of more than $10 billion increased their share of industry assets to a record 79.1 percent. That has made them more efficient and allowed them to increase their earnings some 20 percent faster than smaller banks in the second quarter. A higher concentration of banking assets is not necessarily a problem. America should not really need 7,513 banks to efficiently allocate credit to businesses and consumers. Canada does it with just a handful. But it does create some hazards. First, America’s smaller banks are still the primary providers of capital to small businesses, which are in turn the main engine of job creation. Fewer banks issuing less credit to small businesses is hardly an ideal recipe for bringing down the country’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate. Second, as big banks increase in size, so does the potential damage to the economy and the government’s finances should they fail. And that in turn increases the chances that policy makers and regulators become less inclined to actually let them fail and turn instead to hazard-ridden bailouts — the very thing that recent reforms were supposed to prevent. This too-big-to-fail menace is clear in the F.D.I.C.’s figures. The small fry are paying, on average, almost 50 percent more than the largest banks for deposits that finance their loan books. This gap makes it easier for the big to outrun and poach from the small. That may fatten up the industry’s headline numbers, but not without some risk. A Stock Is Mired Bank of America’s shareholders are resigning themselves to life on skid row. Fears of a dilutive capital increase have helped send the stock down to just 30 percent of book value. The worries may prove overblown. Even so, Bank of America’s long-running mortgage woes have moved a seemingly endless list of litigants ahead of equity investors in the pecking order. On Monday, a judge allowed mortgage bondholders to challenge an $8.5 billion settlement the bank struck with 22 institutional investors in June. The deal to cap repurchase claims from the government-owned mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac does not look as solid as when it was sealed in January. What’s more, state attorneys general are still battling over whether the foreclosure fiasco settlement should include future immunity for banks involved. Other cases keep emerging, like American International Group’s $10 billion lawsuit earlier this month. Throw in heightened concerns about more losses if the economy dips back into recession, and hopes of a turnaround for Bank of America shareholders look even more remote. Despite all this, the bank is in better shape than in 2008. It has twice as much capital, some 50 percent more reserves against loan losses and at least another $20 billion set aside for mortgage claims. With $400 billion in cash and easy-to-sell securities on its balance sheet, the bank should be able to weather a liquidity crisis. Bank of America, under the leadership of Brian Moynihan, also has significant profit potential, in theory. Analysts estimate it could earn $15 billion next year. There are assets to sell, including its $17 billion stake in China Construction Bank. Including tax benefits and balance sheet restructuring, there should be enough to raise its Tier 1 common equity ratio under new capital rules to 9 percent by the end of 2013, according to Credit Suisse. That would put Bank of America on a solid capital footing six years ahead of the Basel III deadline. But that is also the problem. If all those funds are needed to shore up the firm, benefits for shareholders are further postponed. Until the legal claims can be resolved and Bank of America’s exposure to more losses clarified, the stock looks set to stay in the gutter. </text></article>

Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America. 5:10 p.m. | Updated As Bank of America’s stock skids toward levels it has not seen since the credit crisis, one is reminded of a lesson from that time: sometimes banks need to raise capital, even when they think they don’t need it. The bank’s stock is getting shellacked this week. The shares fell as much as 6 percent on Tuesday morning and were down nearly 3 percent by midday. The stock is hovering around $6, a share price it has not really reached since March 2009. To be sure, there are a number of factors weighing on the stock. Most notable among them, its troubled mortgage division has racked up billions of dollars in legal bills and they are still growing. But some analysts say the problem comes down to the market perception that the bank needs more capital. Bank of America’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, is insisting the bank does not need to raise capital but the market clearly disagrees. Mr. Moynihan, meanwhile, has been trying everything short of raising capital to bolster the share price. There was his open conference call this month with a crucial shareholder. Mr. Moynihan has also put the European credit card operation up for sale and sold off the Canadian card division, as he makes it clear that any noncore asset is on the block. On Friday, Mr. Moynihan announced that the bank was cutting 3,500 jobs, saying that “we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink But it is looking more and more like the only thing that will appease shareholders is to raise capital. And the longer he waits, the more it will cost. If the bank had moved in April, after the Federal Reserve rejected its plan for a dividend increase, it could have issued shares at more than $13 a piece. Now, with the shares trading at less than half that amount, it is going to cost Mr. Moynihan twice as much if he relents. While many analysts agree that, on the fundamentals, raising capital is unnecessary, sometimes perception is more important than reality. Henry Blodget, the former stock analyst turned business blogger, asserted that the market is questioning the value of Bank of America’s assets and the size of its legal liabilities. Citing other bloggers, he estimated that it would take $100 billion to $200 billion for the bank to “clean up” its books, wiping out a huge chunk of capital. Mr. Blodget, a former analyst at Merrill Lynch, was barred from the securities industry in 2003 for publicly promoting stocks he was privately disparaging. A spokesman for Bank of America derided Mr. Blodget’s analysis as “exaggerated and unwarranted claims.” “In general, everyone seems to be playing the 2008 playbook,” said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Company. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 23, 2011 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this post misstated Henry Blodget's estimate of how much money it would take to "clean up" Bank of America's books. It is $100 billion to $200 billion, not million.</text></article>

The answer is, more than you might think. AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile do not require cellphone customers to use a password on their voice mail boxes, and plenty of people never bother to set one up. But if you don’t, people using a service colloquially known as caller ID spoofing could disguise their phone as yours and get access to your messages. This is possible because voice mail systems often grant access to callers who appear to be phoning from their own number. Meanwhile, as Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate who founded ConsumerWorld.org, discovered recently, someone armed with just a bit of personal information about a target can also gain access to the automated phone systems for Bank of America and Chase credit card holders. Once those systems recognize the phone number of the incoming call and those bits of personal information, they offer up the latest on the cardholder’s debts, late payments and credit limits. Bank of America’s computer will even read off a list of dozens of recent charges, including names of doctors and other businesses the cardholder might have patronized. There are additional steps that the mobile phone companies and the card issuers could take to stop this sort of thing from ever happening. The fact that many of them don’t, however, makes this your problem to solve. These sorts of breaches wouldn’t happen without spoofing, and surprisingly enough, it’s an activity that turns out to be perfectly legal, up to a point. Commercial spoofing operations, which began offering services to individuals about seven years ago, are easy to find and cost $10 or so for 60 minutes of calling time. A Google search on “caller ID spoofing” leads to many providers with names like SpoofCard, whose slogan is “Be Who You Want to Be.” Registered users call an access number (or use a form on a Web site) and enter the phone number they are calling and the phone number they want to show up on the caller ID display of the person they are calling. Then the service puts the call through. Late last year, President Obama signed the Truth in Caller ID Act, which prohibits knowingly using spoofing services to defraud, cause harm or wrongfully obtain anything of value. The fine is up to $10,000 for a single incident. The new law, however, is not much of a disincentive for people already engaged in illegal activity. After all, for years, even before commercial services were available, hacker thieves were manipulating caller ID information to convince consumers that a bank was phoning. Unwitting recipients of these calls would hand over their Social Security numbers and become identity theft victims. Another common tactic was the jury duty fraud, in which thieves would program their phones to make it appear that they were calling from a local courthouse. Then they’d tell recipients that they’d missed their jury duty assignment and needed to pay a fine by credit card over the phone to avoid arrest. Once the thieves had the card numbers, they’d go on a spending spree. Given all of this, it’s hard to imagine a legitimate use for caller ID spoofing, but there are at least a few. People who have been victims of domestic violence may not want anyone to know where they are calling from. Doctors use it when calling patients from cellphones to keep patients from getting the number and pestering them later. Parents sometimes use the service as well, if they have children who tend to ignore their calls. Using spoofing services to listen to someone’s voice mail is probably not a legitimate use. That said, mobile phone voice mail systems would be more spoof-proof if they required passwords every time a user called in, no matter what phone someone was calling from. Only Verizon Wireless does this, though. After a recent article in The Boston Globe showing how vulnerable voice mail was to spoofing, AT&amp;T Wireless improved its security a bit. While it still lets users choose whether to require a password each time they call their voice mail, the default is to have them use one — the opposite of the previous practice. Sprint is similar to AT&amp;T in this regard, while T-Mobile allows users to require a password every time they call in for voice mail, but doesn’t default to that option. Why didn’t AT&amp;T force all customers to use a password? “We take the position that customers should have the information and tools available to make the right decision for them,” said Mark Siegel, a spokesman. Mr. Dworsky of ConsumerWorld, a former consumer protection lawyer for the state of Massachusetts, read the Globe article and wondered whether some credit card companies’ phone systems recognized callers if they were phoning in from a particular number. 1 2 Next Page » Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/bank-of-america-layoffs-continue/?ref=bankofamericacorporation">Bank of America Layoffs Continue<date>August 19, 2011, 7:47 am</date><text>The pain continues at Bank of America. The beleaguered financial firm, which continues to struggle under the weight of bad mortgage assets, is planning to cut 3,500 jobs, on top of the 2,500 reductions year to date, according to an internal memo written by the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan. And more could follow, with the total number of layoffs potentially reaching 10,000. “I know it is tough to have to manage through reductions, but we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully,” Mr. Moynihan said in the memo. Across Wall Street, banks have been moving to reduce expenses and headcounts, in an effort to bolster flagging profits and stock prices. Since the beginning of the year, shares of Bank of America have fallen to around $7 from $15. Amid the market turmoil in recent weeks, the bank’s performance has trailed other major financial firms like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase as well at the Dow Jones industrial average. On that front, Mr. Moynihan remained positive in his note to employees, emphasizing that the “data coming out of the businesses show that our strategy is working.” In recent weeks, the bank has moved to sell assets like its Canadian credit card business, raising billions of dollars in the process. The firm has also settled some of the outstanding legal issues surrounding its bad mortgage assets, which were mainly picked up with the purchase of Countrywide. “Despite the turbulence in the markets, always remember that we have the best franchise in the financial services industry and that we will get through these challenges,” Mr. Moynihan wrote. “Over time, higher net income and a rising stock price will surely follow.” The Bank of America Memo: Thank you for your ongoing leadership To: Bank of America senior leaders As we discussed last week, this obviously is a challenging time for our company in the markets, and for our shareholders. I want to thank you for your leadership in communicating with our teammates and arming them with the material they need to be confident in our company, and to keep customers and clients well-informed and prepared. While the markets reflect many economic factors we cannot control, we must stay focused on what we can control. We have important work to do to continue putting Countrywide’s legacy mortgage issues behind us, and building the capital we will need to meet new regulatory requirements and the market’s expectations in coming years. We are making solid progress, and this week announced another step in our capital reallocation strategy with our agreement to divest our Canada credit card business and our intent to exit the UK and Ireland consumer card businesses. There are some other actions we have taken. By now you are aware of the announcement that Ron Sturzenegger will lead Legacy Asset Servicing, as Terry Laughlin shifts to the chief risk officer role. As one of the world’s leading commercial real estate investment bankers, Ron’s leadership ability and expertise in the business are a great fit for this role. Also, we all owe our appreciation to Paula Dominick, who performed most ably as interim chief risk officer. In addition, you are most likely hearing about ongoing position reductions taking place across the company. There will be about 3,500 reductions in the third quarter. Notifications to the affected individuals have begun, and I expect many of you are involved in helping communicate those notifications. I know it is tough to have to manage through reductions, but we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully. These reductions are in addition to about 2,500 reductions we have already made, year-to-date. While the reductions this quarter are not part of New BAC, that work also is well underway as we continue to align our resources fully behind our customer-driven strategy. The management team will meet for our third and final review of ideas for change in early September. We expect to begin communicating major outcomes and next steps soon thereafter. Despite the turbulence in the markets, always remember that we have the best franchise in the financial services industry and that we will get through these challenges. We continue to hear positive things from our customers and clients, who appreciate all we can do for them. They are choosing to do more business with us, and the data coming out of the businesses show that our strategy is working. Over time, higher net income and a rising stock price will surely follow. Our task as leaders, and key to our success, is enabling our 280,000 teammates with the tools and capabilities they need to serve customers and clients, grow relationships, build the business and put the legacy challenges behind us. New BAC will help us do that; until we get there I need you to continue to manage risk and efficiency aggressively and continue to push your teams hard on the New BAC initiatives. It is important to our strategy that we continue to organize smartly, de-layer and simplify wherever we can, and make it that much easier for our teammates to deliver the franchise to our customers and clients. I greatly appreciate all you do to lead your teams, and look forward to the results of their work increasingly shining through over the next several quarters.</text></article>

Whatever the methods used there, it’s becoming increasingly clear that people in United States are vulnerable to something called caller ID spoofing. In essence, someone uses a service to make it appear that a call is coming from your phone number. The column explains how the process might be (pretty easily) used to listen to your voice mail or find out what you’ve spent (and where) on your Bank of America or Chase credit cards. The moral of the week’s reporting efforts for me? I’m no longer throwing out credit card receipts and will be shredding them instead. And I’m going to be much more careful about what I leave in people’s voice-mail boxes. How about you?</text></article>

Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of the bank, has said that he hopes to trim quarterly expenses by $1.5 billion. Thousands more job cuts are likely in the months ahead. “I know it is tough to have to manage through reductions,” Mr. Moynihan wrote in a memo to the company’s senior leadership late Thursday that outlined the cuts. “But we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully.” In the memo, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Moynihan said the company’s broader revamping effort was nearing completion of its first phase, which examines the consumer business and support functions. A third and final review is set for early September. The company plans to announce the first results of that project next month, which could include further job cuts that would total more than 10,000. Mr. Moynihan said in the memo that the company had already begun to tell the 3,500 employees that their jobs were to be eliminated, and that the reductions would come throughout the company. Bank of America, which has roughly 280,000 employees, cut about 2,500 jobs in the first half of the year. Even more than its large rivals, Bank of America has been battered particularly hard by the bursting of the housing bubble and the surge in foreclosures. It has already suffered tens of billions in losses tied to its disastrous acquisition in 2008 of Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender that has come to epitomize the excesses of the housing boom of the last decade. Investors are also pressing the bank to buy back billions of dollars in securities it assembled from mortgages that later soured. In June, it agreed to pay a group of investors including Pimco, BlackRock and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York $8.5 billion to settle a portion of these claims. While the settlement represented the culmination of months of negotiations and was seen as an attempt by Mr. Moynihan to finally put Countrywide’s disastrous legacy behind the company, investors  remain skeptical. Earlier this month, American International Group, the giant insurer, filed suit against the company over mortgage backed securities it assembled, and investors fear the June settlement may actually spur more litigation, rather than resolve it. The latest job cuts, which were first reported on the Wall Street Journal’s Web site late Thursday, will also hit the company’s Merrill Lynch unit. Bank of America agreed to acquire the firm at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. While Merrill has proved profitable more recently, trading volumes and the flow of deals have slowed substantially in recent months, making it vulnerable to further job reductions. Despite the huge settlements and other write-downs, Mr. Moynihan has said that he does not plan to issue more stock to raise new capital. Instead, the company has been engaged in the corporate version of a yard sale in recent weeks, raising billions of dollars as it offloads everything from its Canadian credit card business to several commercial real estate properties. In the recent market downturn, Bank of America shares have been especially hard hit.  Since the beginning of the year, Bank of America shares have fallen from $15 to a closing price of $7.01 on Thursday. “While the markets reflect many economic factors we cannot control, we must stay focused on what we can control,” Mr. Moynihan said in the memo.</text></article>

But Bank of America has found a new executive to run its Legacy Asset Servicing division, home to tens of billions of dollars in soured mortgage assets and home loans that are delinquent or in default. Ron Sturzenegger, who heads Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s real estate, gaming and lodging team, will join the bank’s management team and run the Legacy division, which was formed in February to help the Bank of America put its long-running problems with bad mortgages behind it by separating out the troubled home loans. “Ron is a proven leader who brings deep credibility and expertise in real estate to the Legacy Asset Servicing team, and I welcome him to the management team,” said Brian T. Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive. “Ron benefits from the great momentum the Legacy Asset Servicing team has created in the past year, and I am confident he and the team will build on that as we put these issues behind us.” Bank of America picked up much of the portfolio in 2008 when it acquired Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender whose excesses have come to epitomize the housing boom that collapsed and helped trigger the financial crisis of 2008. The previous head of the unit, Terry Laughlin, will assume the position of chief risk officer for Bank of America, a move that was announced last month. The huge overhang of bad mortgage debt has been weighing down shares of Bank of America for months, despite deals like an $8.5 billion agreement in June with private investors to resolve claims related to bad loans underwritten by Countrywide. Investors fear the bank could still have to pay tens of billions of dollars more. Bank of America shares were trading at just over $7 at midday Thursday, down more than 50 percent from where they started 2011.</text></article>

With the announcements, Bank of America continued the push to overhaul its credit card business as the bank reels from hefty losses in its troubled mortgage division. While dumping the international card business, Bank of America has largely retained its card loans in the United States, among other core assets. The bank said it hopes the deals will shore up its capital ratios. “Our strategy is clear: We have been transforming the company to deliver the franchise to our core customer groups, and building a fortress balance sheet behind that,” Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive, said in a statement. “While the credit card remains a fundamental core product for our U.S. customers, an international consumer card business under another brand is not consistent with that strategy.” Since Mr. Moynihan took over in early 2010, the bank has sold some 20 different businesses for roughly $30 billion. One big deal was announced in May, as the bank shed its remaining stake in BlackRock for $2.5 billion. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The moves come as Bank of America, the nation’s biggest bank by assets, struggles to regain its footing in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The beleaguered bank announced an $8.8 billion second-quarter loss after it agreed to settle huge legal claims surrounding its ill-fated acquisition of the subprime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial. The bank’s stock price has been beaten down, too, hovering around $7 for much of the month. Bank of America shares rose nearly 8 percent on Monday, following news of the deal. The announcements on Monday are Bank of America’s latest attempts to shed portions of its sprawling credit card business. Earlier this month, the bank agreed to sell its Spanish credit card portfolio to Apollo Capital Management, the giant private equity firm. In April, Bank of America sold its $200 million small business credit card loans to Barclays. The TD Bank Group, in addition to buying Bank of America’s $8.6 billion Canadian credit card business, agreed to purchase various other assets and liabilities for an undisclosed amount, according to a bank statement. The bank said it expected the deal to close in the fourth quarter. The remaining European card portfolios are even bigger assets for Bank of America. The bank manages a combined $19 billion in credit card loans in Britain and Ireland, which it now plans to sell. That business employs about 4,000 people.</text></article>

Hingle, via Bloomberg NewsWorldwide volume in mergers and acquisitions is $1.8 trillion year to date, a 31 percent rise over last year at this time. Companies in deals announced on Monday include, clockwise from top left, Cargill, Bank of America, Time Warner Cable and Transocean. Turmoil in the stock market. A downgrade of the United States credit rating. The economic crisis in Europe. Such a vicious cocktail of bad news would normally cause Wall Street’s deal machine to grind to a halt. But Monday had a spate of multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions, surprising investors, who had expected deal activity to slow in the grim environment. Leading the M.&amp;A. charge was Google, which said it was buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. The search company, which has made a business out of bucking conventional wisdom, does not seem deterred by the market tumult or the threat of a antitrust inquiry by the United States government. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Google’s acquisition of Motorola, by far its largest deal, would use some of the nearly $40 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Corporations, especially the leading technology companies, are sitting on record amounts of cash, a fact that deal makers have been hoping would spawn mergers and acquisitions even in difficult markets. Apple has about $76 billion in cash; Microsoft has $53 billion. “Even intense market volatility won’t get in the way of strategic deals,” said Scott A. Barshay, a corporate partner at the law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. “Well-capitalized companies are focused on the years ahead, not the last week of trading.” Private equity has remained another reliable driver of deal activity. After struggling through the financial crisis, the world’s largest buyout firms are now on firmer footing and have been looking to sell their holdings to return cash to their investors. The private equity world had two large exits on Monday: Time Warner Cable bought Insight Communications, which is owned by the Carlyle Group and others, for $3 billion, and the agriculture giant Cargill said it would pay about $2 billion for Provimi, an animal feed producer owned by the European buyout shop Permira. With Monday’s flurry of transactions — which also included a big oil-drilling deal and a large credit card disposition by Bank of America — worldwide M.&amp; A. volume totals $1.8 trillion year to date, a 31 percent increase over last year at this time, according to Thomson Reuters. And Monday was the biggest “Merger Monday” in the United States since April 4, Thomson Reuters says. Cargill to Buy Feed Company Cargill, the American agricultural giant, said Monday that it planned to buy a Dutch animal nutrition company, Provimi, for $2.1 billion from the private equity firm Permira. One of the largest privately held companies in the world, Cargill said it made a binding offer for Provimi, which specializes in nutrition and supplements for farm animals, for 1.5 billion euros. The deal will help Cargill add vitamin mixtures and additives to its animal nutrition business and expand in Latin America, Russia and Asia, where Provimi operates. The deal comes as food prices increase and demand for meat from developing economies rises. Provimi, based in Rotterdam, employs about 7,000 people and operates in 26 countries. It had sales of 1.6 billion euros in 2010 and earnings of 86 million euros in the first half of this year. Cargill’s vice chairman, Paul Conway, said the acquisition was “a significant move for Cargill into the higher value added segments in the animal nutrition market. Provimi has world-class expertise, knowledge and strong technical know-how, an area that we believe is key to the future of the industry.” JULIA WERDIGIER Bank of America Sheds a Unit Bank of America took steps on Monday to exit the international credit card business, agreeing to sell its $8.6 billion Canadian card venture to the TD Bank Group for an undisclosed amount and putting its remaining European card portfolio on the block.

BEN PROTESS Offshore Driller Builds Its Fleet Transocean, one of the world’s largest offshore drilling contractors, said on Monday that it had bid $1.43 billion for Aker Drilling of Norway to expand its fleet by adding rigs and ships. Transocean, which owned the rig lost in the oil spill disaster last year in the Gulf of Mexico, said it agreed to pay 26.5 Norwegian kroner ($4.80) in cash for each Aker share. The offer price is 62 percent higher than Aker’s average share price over 30 days before the offer, Transocean said in a statement. Transocean will also assume $800 million of Aker’s debt. With the acquisition, Transocean will gain two ultra-deepwater rigs that are on long-term contracts in Norway to Statoil and Det Norske. It will also get two drill ships being built at a shipyard in South Korea. Transocean will have to pay $900 million for the ships upon delivery. “Aker Drilling is an excellent strategic fit for Transocean,” the company president and chief executive, Steven L. Newman, said in a statement. “It allows us to enhance our position in Norway where we have enjoyed a long-term presence and excellent customer relationships.” The board of Aker Drilling unanimously recommended the bid to its shareholders, Transocean said. Aker Drilling’s shareholders are expected to vote on the offer later this month. JULIA WERDIGIER Cable Operator Expands Reach Time Warner Cable announced on Monday that it had agreed to buy Insight Communications, a large Midwestern cable television operator, for about $3 billion in cash. “We believe in our business and its long-term prospects and have long thought that Insight’s well-run, technologically advanced systems would fit well with our Midwest operations,” Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, said in a statement. Insight is owned by the Carlyle Group and other private equity firms, including MidOcean Partners and Crestview Partners. BRIAN STELTER</text></article>

That appears to be the mind-set of many nervous investors when it comes this week to financial stocks, which are down more than the broader market. Goldman Sachs is down almost 12 percent since Monday’s open. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are both down roughly 17 percent. Citigroup dropped 15 percent and JPMorgan Chase shares sank almost 9 percent. Some market insiders feel the sell-off is overdone. Bank executives are grumbling about it. There is nothing systemic seemingly going on here, they say. In some cases, banks have record-high capital levels thanks to recent regulatory rules requiring them to put up more capital against riskier businesses. Leverage, or how much money a firm borrows to fund its business, is down significantly since the financial crisis. An optimist may even argue these stocks are a screaming buy right now. All of the country’s biggest financial stocks are trading below book value, or crucial financial measure that refers to the liquidation value of a company’s assets if it were forced to sell everything. So what gives? No one cares about all that right now. “What you are seeing is the manic ‘I remember 2008’ selling,” said Glenn Schorr, a banking analyst with Nomura. “And the only thing that worked then was to get out of the way and not come back too early. The more cash they have, the safer people feel right now.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links A Rough Patch for Hedge Funds Europe Weighs Short Selling Ban Holders of financial stocks, burned by what happened in 2008, don’t want to stick around and see how this latest bump in the road ends, especially given the questions surrounding bank exposure to Europe, continued litigation stemming from the credit crisis and the potential impact of a possible recession, which threatens to crimp big money makers for the banks, including M.&amp;A., underwriting and beyond. Mr. Schorr said while most banks have stated they have bought protection to hedge against their exposure in Europe, bank investors are worried it may not matter. “There may be a voluntary restructuring instead of an actual bankruptcy so the protection they have bought might not pay off,” he said. Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities, is downright pessimistic, saying concerns over Europe and litigation are just a symptoms of larger problem, one that is systemic. “This is a continuation of 2008,” he said. “We are finally coming to grips with the fact we have a massive debt problem that needs to be dealt with. This is not a problem for our grandchildren. It is our problem. We have a financial system structured on a bankrupt currency and that system is now breaking down and a new system will arise to replace it, but we don’t yet anything to replace it. “ Mr. Bove said recently moved all his holdings into cash. While everyone’s hair seems to be on fire this week, major players including Fidelity, Wellington Management and AllianceBernstein have been big sellers of financial stocks for months now, regulatory filings show. This selling points perhaps to another concern about these stocks. Financial firms, with lower leverage levels and more rigorous capital requirements, simply won’t be able to generate anywhere near the returns they did before the financial crisis. Goldman’s return on equity was just 8 percent in the second half of this year, down from more than 30 percent in 2006. Banks argue that big shareholders are always selling in and out of their stocks. This week’s hubbub aside, the selling by some of these long-term holders suggests that concerns run deep. And even though the country’s banks are well capitalized and have significantly lowered their leverage levels since the crisis, it may be some time before investors wade in again.</text></article>

More specifically, will Bank of America put Countrywide into bankruptcy? And will this stem the bleeding? The Countrywide acquisition will go down in history as a deal from hell. It has already cost Bank of America tens of billions of dollars in litigation settlements, let alone losses resulting in a $20.6 billion charge to earnings in the second quarter. Bank of America has already announced that it expects another $5 billion charge for earnings, and American International Group said this week that it would sue Bank of America for $10 billion, mostly for loans issued by Countrywide. It appears that $5 billion is the floor. These mounting losses have raised the question whether Bank of America might be overwhelmed by Countrywide’s liabilities. Bank of America could be the first candidate for the new insolvency regime put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act. But the issue is much more complicated than this. The reason is that the losses of Countrywide are not those of Bank of America. Only if Bank of America took steps after the Countrywide acquisition to assume these liabilities is there a problem. Let me explain. Bank of America acquired Countrywide, but it did not assume its liabilities. Instead, the assets and liabilities of Countrywide were held separately in the formerly public company Countrywide Financial Corporation. The only change was that instead of Countrywide Financial stock being held by the public, it was now held by Bank of America. Because of limited liability laws for corporations, public shareholders of Countrywide Financial are not liable for Countrywide’s debts, and neither is Bank of America. This is standard procedure in a merger. Limited liability means that a company’s owners are not ordinarily liable for the debts the company incurs. When a company is acquired, its new owner usually just obtains ownership of the company’s stock. But this does not make the new owner liable for the target company’s liabilities. Companies use limited liability laws to plan and structure their operations, often using hundreds of different subsidiaries. For instance, there was talk last year of bankruptcy for BP, the British energy giant. But this was overstated, because BP’s North American operations were run by a wholly separate subsidiary corporation, which held the company’s Mexican Gulf operations. The real risk of bankruptcy was to this subsidiary. When Bank of America acquired Countrywide, it did not become responsible for its past misdeeds and any litigation liability. This is true even though it is now clear that Countrywide was insolvent at that time. Even so, Bank of America could have had Countrywide Financial put into bankruptcy and cordoned off these liabilities. It could still have done this today had it continued to operate Countrywide as a separate company. Unfortunately for Bank of America, it didn’t keep things so neat when it acquired Countrywide. Instead, Bank of America engaged in a number of complex transactions to consolidate Countrywide into its operations. The complaint filed by A.I.G. against Bank of America describes these transactions: On June 2, 2008, Countrywide Home Loans, a subsidiary of Countrywide Financial, sold Countywide Home Loans Servicing, another subsidiary, to NB Holdings, another subsidiary that was wholly owned by Bank of America. Bank of America paid Countrywide Home Loans for this sale by issuing it a note for $19.7 billion. Countrywide Home Loans Servicing was the actual subsidiary of Countrywide that serviced almost all of Countrywide’s mortgage loans. Countrywide Home Loans also sold a pool of residential mortgages to NB Holdings for $9.4 billion. On Nov. 7, 2008, Countrywide Home Loans sold the rest of its assets to Bank of America for $1.76 billion. Separately, Bank of America also acquired notes worth $3.6 billion from Countrywide Financial’s bank and the equity in a number of other Countrywide subsidiaries. Bank of America also assumed $16.6 billion of Countrywide’s debt and guarantees. If the A.I.G. complaint accurately describes these transactions, it means that the net effect was to leave Countrywide Financial and Countrywide Home Loans without assets, except the $11.16 billion payment and the $19.7 billion and $3.6 billion notes ($34.46 billion total). Countrywide’s liabilities stayed with the Countrywide. Bank of America turned Countrywide into a shell with assets of $34.46 billion, part of it in the form of loans from Bank of America. Once the settlements exceed this amount, Countrywide is out of money. Again, the exact amount is uncertain and this is an approximation, but it appears that Countrywide’s remaining assets are rapidly being subsumed by litigation claims and other liabilities related to the financial crisis. The best strategy for Bank of America would appear to be to throw the old Countrywide into bankruptcy. Normally this would be the end of the matter and Bank of America would not be liable for any of Countrywide’s debts. However, in any bankruptcy proceeding, anyone with claims against Countrywide will argue that Bank of America fraudulently transferred out Countrywide’s assets. And there are other legal arguments, including that Bank of America should be liable for Countrywide’s debts because of these transfers. The A.I.G. complaint against Bank of America, for example, makes a similar claim, arguing that Bank of America is a successor in interest to Countrywide by virtue of these transfers. The validity of these claims is hard to assess and will depend on how careful Bank of America was in transferring the Countrywide assets. If a court finds that Bank of America underpaid for these assets, Bank of America may be liable for some of Countrywide’s debts. Bank of America thus still has residual exposure to Countrywide in a bankruptcy and a hefty litigation bill to fight off such claims. Bank of America’s lawyers are likely poring over these transfers and assessing any liability in anticipation of just such a bankruptcy filing. The bottom line is that, unless Bank of America’s lawyers really messed up the transfers, Bank of America is far from insolvency itself, having the option of cordoning off this liability to a large extent through a bankruptcy filing. If nothing else, a Countrywide bankruptcy would tie this up in litigation for years if not a decades. Boy, did Ken Lewis really blow this one. Steven M.

Bank of America dropped almost 11 percent. Citigroup sank 10.5 percent. Goldman Sachs fell 10 percent, while Morgan Stanley was down 9.7 percent. All told, bank stocks have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year — and have swung wildly up and down over the last week — as the weakening economy is expected to take a toll on business and reduce earnings. But concerns about European banks are driving the latest wave of selling. Société Générale’s share price dropped 14.7 percent on Wednesday, the most of any European bank, as its chief executive “denied all rumors” that he said caused the stock to fall. Other European giants were alsopounded. Shares of Intesa Sanpaolo of Italy fell nearly 14 percent. Crédit Agricole and AXA Financial of France dropped more than 10 percent apiece. Financial institutions across the Continent have huge holdings of government and corporate bonds from Italy and Spain. Doubts about the financial health of European lenders are encouraging investors to unload their shares and driving up their borrowing costs. Those banks, in turn, trade billions daily with their counterparts on Wall Street. They also rely on billions of dollars invested by American money market mutual funds to finance loans and other investments. That has created a vicious circle, where fears about the soundness of European banks are feeding new concerns about the stability of American financial institutions. “The European situation is back and isn’t going away,” said Alex Roever, the head of short-term fixed income at JPMorgan Chase. “It continues to keep pressure on the market.” Only a few months ago, American banks looked as if they had finally found their footing. Loan losses were easing. Profits and bonuses were back. Even some of the new regulations had turned out to be not as draconian as many bankers once believed. But there has been a steady drumbeat of dismal headlines in the last few weeks. First, weak data for the housing market and the broader economy suggested that banks would find it even harder to grow. Standard &amp; Poor’s downgrade of the United States government further rattled confidence, the lifeblood of the financial system. Then, in a sign of how grim things had become, the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of pledging to keep interest rates near zero for the next two years. That may prevent the economy from slipping into another recession, but it will squeeze lending profits that make up the bulk of banks’ income. And that comes as demand is already slowing for all kinds of loans and a wave of deal making has been shelved. “Everyone is going to be lowering their estimates,” said David Ellison, the chief investment officer of two FBR mutual funds that invest in financial companies. “You are going to have lower loan growth and lower margins; we are in a new era.” If that were not enough, there are lingering worries about the legal hangover from the housing bust. Bank of America, which faces potentially tens of billions of dollars in investor claims, held an unusual conference call on Wednesday to reassure shareholders it could cope with all settlements, among other concerns. Its shares fell to $6.77 on Wednesday, after reaching a postcrisis high of almost $20 in April 2010. Now, as Europe’s fiscal troubles spread to core trading partners like France, there are renewed fears of contagion. The links between French and American institutions, after all, are orders of magnitude larger than they are between American banks and say, Greek, or even Spanish ones. For example, according to the Bank for International Settlements, French banks owed American institutions more than $160 billion at the end of 2010.  Spanish banks owed less than $20 billion. And that’s not counting the billions of dollars that big American banks lend directly to overseas companies or any European government debt they hold as investments. Nowhere is that nervousness greater than in the short-term financing markets, where European banks turn to American money funds each day for tens of billions of dollars in funding. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Bank of America may not be your top pick – but it is a favorite of Fairholme Capital Management. Fairholme’s founder, Bruce Berkowitz, is hosting a call on Wednesday afternoon with the chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan. The event has generated a lot of buzz on Wall Street and among Bank of America shareholders, who have watched this week as the bank’s stock has been whipsawed in the market. It was one of the biggest losers in Monday’s stock market fall. While it recovered Tuesday it is down again sharply on Wednesday along with the rest of the market, trading below $7 a share. “The purpose of the call is to better understand how Bank of America is navigating the economic environment and positioning its balance sheet for the long-term benefit of customers, creditors, and shareholders,” Fairholme said in a release. “Skeptics are invited to participate on the call.” DealBook is listening to the call.

The nation’s largest financial institution by assets shed over $16 billion of market value on Monday as its shares fell 20 percent after the downgrade of the United States credit rating, and a home loan lawsuit filed by the American International Group, the insurer. Other mortgage-heavy lenders were hit, too, but none as bad as Bank of America.The bank, led by Brian T. Moynihan, now has fingers in nearly a fifth of the country’s home loan market. Another recession wouldn’t just crimp earnings power. It could also lead to fresh losses on $1 trillion of problematic loans the bank owns or services — or both. Citigroup, where troublesome mortgages account for the largest chunk of its $300 billion in unwanted assets, had its shares tumble 16 percent on Monday. Midsize lenders like SunTrust, Regions and Fifth Third weren’t far behind. Investors have more concerns about Bank of America. The $10 billion A.I.G. lawsuit accusing the bank — and two institutions it bought during the crisis, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch — of “massive fraud,” adds to worries that its recent progress in putting its mortgage mess behind it is coming apart. There are growing doubts about whether bondholders will accept $8.5 billion to settle other outstanding home loan claims. And Bank of America is getting more claims than expected from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, despite a seemingly comprehensive settlement in January. Granted, the bank is in better shape than when the last crisis hit. Its capital ratios are much higher. Bank of America also now holds more than a third of its interest-earning assets in cash or liquid securities. That could help it to last almost two years before needing to raise any new debt. But that is, at best, secondary to shareholders. They’re focused on the double whammy of a lack of earnings power and the return of the mortgage black hole. Investors now estimate that Bank of America is worth $140 billion less than its breakup value. That’s more than even the most pessimistic of estimates for home loan losses. But it shows just how deep the housing hole from which Mr. Moynihan needs to climb really is. Context Counts Equities have been clobbered by the latest leg of the global financial crisis. Most indexes have shed more than 10 percent of their value in the last few weeks. The S.&amp; P. 500 index declined 6.7 percent on Monday alone. But falling share prices are a symptom of fears: they are not, as yet, a cause. Unleveraged investors who take a long-term view still have good reason not to panic. It would be foolish to suggest that equity markets can be insulated from broader woes. Financial stocks have suffered from the euro zone’s halting efforts to limit sovereign debt contagion and by America’s mortgage troubles. Mining companies, which are a supercharged bet on global economic growth, are also unattractive. Indeed, if banks get meaner and economic growth slows, few companies will escape. Forecasts are only just starting to acknowledge this. Analysts at Credit Suisse have cut their estimates of corporate earnings growth in the euro zone this year to 7 percent from 12 percent and the outlook for American companies to 12 percent from 14 percent. Consensus forecasts from Starmine, which point to growth of 15 percent in earnings per share in America and Europe this year, also look ripe for downgrades. But the context is important. Unlike in 2008 — or 1929 — investors show few signs of being forced to sell to repay debt or meet margin calls. If that happens, equity markets would be adding to economic problems rather than, as now, being messengers of worry. Corporate earnings are still expected to grow, and blue-chip equities are hardly highly priced. Even if earnings growth comes in at half the current expectations, the forward price-to-earnings ratio on American stocks is still less than 15. For European companies, it’s a little over 12. There is value in stocks absent from Treasuries, German bunds and British gilts. These supposedly high-quality sovereigns just get more expensive as the stampede to presumed safe havens continues. Equity markets are not immune. But the fundamentals suggest they could prove to be a valuable source of resilience.

With less than a hour before the close, the financial sector was leading the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index higher. All eyes were on shares of Bank of America, which plummeted 20.3 percent on Monday to their lowest level in more than two years. The stock was up more than 5 percent on Tuesday afternoon. Analysts at Nomura lent some support, writing in a note that “we think the 20 percent sell-off in BAC yesterday seems overdone as the bank still has solid consumer and capital markets franchises and a much improved balance sheet versus 2008.” Investors will also be watching for how Brian Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, fares on Wednesday in a conference call that is being held by Fairholme Capital Management, which owns a little less than 1 percent of the bank. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Wells Fargo analysts said the call “carries risks of not meeting the market’s desire for answers on three key topics.” Those topics are, according to the analysts: In our view, Moynihan must convince investors of: 1) why BAC executives remain confident that the company will not be required to issue common equity, particularly in the event of a double dip in the broader U.S. economy? 2) what other options might be considered by BAC to improve the bank’s Tier 1 common and tangible common equity ratios in the absence of additional common equity?; and 3) can BAC provide a more firm estimate of future mortgage putback liabilities from the GSE and non GSE investors? Other financial stocks were higher on Tuesday. Citigroup was up about 5 percent; JPMorgan Chase, nearly 2 percent. Shares of Goldman Sachs, however, were down 2.8 percent, while Morgan Stanley shares were down more than 1 percent.</text></article>

Moynihan, chief of Bank of America. Bank of America‘s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, who has been under fire for his bank’s dismal performance, has agreed to field questions from investors on Wednesday. The recent slide in the bank’s stock price is sure to focus investors’ attention on the conference call. Even with Tuesday’s bounce — Bank of America shares are up nearly 8 percent in midday trading — the shares are down more than 47 percent for the year to date. And Mr. Moynihan has been reassuring bank employees rattled by the stock sell-off. Skeptics will be welcome on Wednesday’s conference call, says Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, which owns more than 92 million shares of Bank of America and is hosting the hour-and-a-half conference call. Mr. Berkowitz will ask Mr. Moynihan “the toughest questions” submitted to askbrian@fairhomefunds.com before opening the call up, the firm said in a statement. DealBook talked to a number of analysts and investors and asked them what questions should be posed to the Bank of America chief executive. Here are the top six: 1. Brian, what is the tab on this mortgage mess going to be? In the second quarter, Bank of America set aside $14 billion to settle some big claims. Call us crazy, but we were hopeful that that might be it. Now we see American International Group is suing Bank of America. That is big. What do you think the ultimate tab might be?

You are one of first big financial executives to speak publicly since the debt downgrade on Friday. Do you think it was justified and how will it and all the turmoil effect Bank of America’s business? 4. Your credit default swap spreads widened sharply in recent days, if narrowing on Tuesday, indicating that investors are worried about the bank’s health.

Shares in the banking giant tumbled 20.3 percent to $6.51 on Monday, their lowest point in more than two years. Credit-default swaps tied to Bank of America’s debt reached their highest levels since the middle of 2009, indicating additional pressure on the company. Its stock has now fallen about 50 percent this year. Other financial firms were also hit hard in the broad decline in the markets. Financials were the worst performing of 10 sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index, falling nearly 10 percent on the day. But Bank of America in particular had to contend with several problems, including a new lawsuit tied to troubled mortgage loans. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Financial Stocks Tumble The A.I.G. lawsuit On Monday, the American International Group sued Bank of America, seeking more than $10 billion in damages. A.I.G., which was bailed out by the government during the 2008 financial crisis, accuses the bank and several firms it acquired, including Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial, of misrepresenting the quality of the mortgages that went into the bundled securities. In a statement, Bank of America rejected A.I.G.’s assertions. “A.I.G. is the very definition of an informed, seasoned investor, with losses solely attributable to its own excesses and errors,” Bank of America said. (Bank of America is not likely to be A.I.G.’s only target. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank may well receive complaints as well.) Jeff Kowalsky/Bloomberg NewsBrian T. Moynihan, chief of Bank of America. Separately, a well-regarded banking analyst, Mike Mayo of CLSA, on Monday downgraded Bank of America’s stock to underperform from outperform. Among the reasons he cited in a research note was concern that the firm might need to embark on another round of capital-raising. “The resolution of mortgage issues will take much longer and may indeed be much higher than management’s estimates, raising questions on the company’s ability to meet regulatory capital requirements in a timely manner,” he wrote. A Bank of America spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, declined to comment on the firm’s stock price. But he said in a telephone interview on Monday that the firm believed it had adequate capital and did not need to raise more. “It’s inarguable that the company is in a stronger position today than it was a year ago or even two years ago,” he said, pointing to the bank’s improving capital ratios and the profits that five of its six main business lines posted in the second quarter this year. American banks this year are likely to have the worst revenue growth they have experienced since 1938. But Bank of America in particular has lagged its rivals in improving the quality of its loan portfolio, while facing potentially steeper payouts, including from lawsuits over mortgage securities. Meanwhile, one of Bank of America’s most outspoken supporters has apparently retreated. Appaloosa Management, the big hedge fund run by David Tepper, sold off more than 41 percent of his stake in the firm during the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. He now owns about 10 million shares. Mr. Tepper’s move appears born of an effort to reduce Appaloosa’s exposure to banks as a whole, having also sold off big chunks of his holdings in Wells Fargo and Citigroup during the quarter. Mr. Dubrowski stressed that Bank of America’s management team, led by its chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, remained focused on executing the firm’s strategy. Mr. Moynihan is scheduled to answer questions from shareholders on a conference call Wednesday, which is being hosted by a major investor, Fairholme Capital Management. Have a query?

Sues Bank of America Over Mortgage Bonds<date>Published: August 8, 2011</date><text>The American International Group sued Bank of America on Monday over hundreds of mortgage-backed securities, adding to the surge of investors seeking compensation for the troubled mortgages that led to the financial crisis.The suit seeks to recover more than $10 billion in losses on $28 billion of investments, in possibly the largest mortgage-security-related action filed by a single investor. It claims that Bank of America and its Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial units misrepresented the quality of the mortgages placed in securities and sold to investors, according to three people with knowledge of the complaint. A.I.G., still largely taxpayer-owned as a result of its 2008 government bailout, is among a growing group of investors pursuing private lawsuits because they believe banks misled them into buying risky securities during the housing boom. At least 90 suits related to mortgage bonds have been filed, demanding at least $197 billion, according to McCarthy Lawyer Links, a legal consulting firm. A.I.G. is preparing similar suits against other large financial institutions including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, said the people with knowledge of the complaint, as part of a litigation strategy aimed at recovering some of the billions in losses the insurer sustained during the financial crisis. The private actions stand in stark contrast to the few credit crisis cases brought by the Justice Department, which is wrapping up many of its inquiries into big banks without filing any charges. The lack of prosecutions — the Justice Department has brought three cases against employees at large financial companies and none against executives at large banks — has left private litigants, mainly investors and consumers, standing more or less alone in trying to hold financial parties accountable. “When federal authorities don’t fulfill their obligation to enforce the law, they essentially give an imprimatur to the financial entities to do whatever they want and disregard the law,” said Kathleen C. Engel, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. “To the extent there are places where shareholders and borrowers can pursue claims, they are really serving the function of the government. They are our private attorneys general.” Though many in the public have called for more accountability for parties involved in the financial crisis, criminal charges on complex financial matters can be difficult to prosecute. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said the government was vigorously pursuing cases where appropriate, and she pointed to a recent jail sentence for the chairman of the mortgage company Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker. The spokeswoman, Alisa Finelli, declined to say how many people the government had assigned to that task. “Prosecutors and agents determine on a case by case basis the importance of relevant evidence developed in private litigation and how such evidence should be pursued,” Ms. Finelli said. “Civil litigation involves a lower standard of proof than is required for a criminal prosecution, where prosecutors must have sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed.” On Friday, the department announced it had concluded its investigation into Washington Mutual, the Seattle-based bank that nearly collapsed because of its risky mortgages, without finding evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The Justice Department has also concluded its investigation into Countrywide’s conduct leading into the financial crisis, according to a person with knowledge of that case. Even more investigations may soon be shut down because the Justice Department is heavily involved in negotiations between big banks and state attorneys general that may give the banks broad immunity against future claims. The state attorneys general are weighing these requests in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure cases, even though the government has not pursued the most basic investigation of these practices. As it has in similar cases, Bank of America is likely to dispute A.I.G.’s claims in the suit, filed on Monday in New York State Supreme Court. When asked generally about the quality of mortgage bonds issued by companies that are now part of the bank, Lawrence Di Rita, a spokesman for Bank of America, said the disclosures were robust enough for sophisticated investors. He said many of the loans lost value because housing fell. “Now you have a lot of investors and lawyers who are seeking to recoup the losses from an economic downturn,” Mr. Di Rita said on Sunday, speaking before the bank had seen A.I.G.’s suit. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

A lawsuit filed late Thursday accuses Bank of New York of fraud in its role as trustee overseeing the pools for investors. In papers filed in New York State Supreme Court, lawyers for Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general, contended that Bank of New York misled investors about its conduct as overseer of the securities. The bank also breached its duties to investors by agreeing to the deal with Bank of America, according to the complaint, because the trustee is conflicted and “stands to receive direct financial benefits” as a result of the agreement. Questioning the fairness of the deal, the attorney general’s lawsuit said that it could “compromise investors’ claims in exchange for a payment representing a fraction of the losses” that have been suffered by investors. When the terms of the deal emerged, they appeared to be quite favorable to Bank of America. On June 29, when the deal was announced, Bank of America’s shares closed with a gain of almost 3 percent. A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment. Jeep Bryant, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, disputed the attorney general’s allegations, calling them “outrageous, baseless, unsupported by fact and law” and saying that the bank would fight them in court. “We are confident that we have fulfilled in all respects our responsibilities as trustee,” he said, adding that Mr. Schneiderman’s action fails to understand the “benefit the settlement would provide to investors.”  Bank of America purchased Countrywide in a distress sale in early 2008. A judge overseeing the settlement will ultimately decide whether it should be approved. A court hearing on the proposed settlement was scheduled to take place Friday. Mr. Schneiderman’s lawsuit is likely to change the nature of those discussions.   As announced by Bank of New York, which is overseeing 530 mortgage pools issued by Countrywide, the deal would require Bank of America to pay $8.5 billion to investors holding the securities. The unpaid principal amount of the mortgages remaining in the pools totaled $174 billion. Lawyers representing 22 institutional investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock and Pimco, contended the deal was favorable. But other investors in the Countrywide pools who were not part of the settlement negotiations between Bank of New York and Bank of America complained that the terms were inadequate. Among the criticisms made by a group of investors known as Walnut Place were that the negotiations were conducted in secret and that Bank of New York was conflicted as a negotiator because Bank of America agreed to cover all its costs and liabilities relating to the deal. Mr. Schneiderman’s contention that Bank of New York breached its duties to investors is significant because a trustee that agrees to oversee loan pools like those issued by Countrywide must abide by the rules governing the securities. Such rules require that lenders deliver to the trust complete and original mortgage documents for each loan in a pool, for example, and require that the trustee notify investors when such loan documents are missing. Bank of New York led investors in the Countrywide pools to believe that the lender had in fact delivered complete and adequate mortgage files for each loan as was required, the lawsuit said. The bank also misled investors by confirming that loan files relating to hundreds of thousands of mortgages were complete. But the bank failed in these duties, the attorney general’s complaint said. After conducting a review of court records in the Bronx and Westchester County, Mr. Schneiderman’s investigators have determined that Bank of New York did not ensure that notes underlying properties were delivered properly to some trusts, according to the lawsuit. If loan documents were not delivered as required to the trustee, investors could recover the money they invested in the mortgages. “Investors in the trusts were misled by Bank of New York Mellon into believing that Bank of New York Mellon would review the loan files for the mortgages securing their investment, and that any deficiencies would be cured,” the lawsuit said.</text></article>

Under the transaction, Paetec shareholders will get 0.460 of a share of Windstream for each Paetec share, or about $891 million in stock. Windstream will also take on about $1.4 billion of Paetec’s debt. “This transaction significantly advances our strategy to drive top-line revenue growth by expanding our focus on business and broadband services,” Jeffery R. Gardner, the chief executive of Windstream, said in a statement. “The combined company will have a nationwide network with a deep fiber footprint to offer enhanced capabilities in strategic growth areas, including I.P.-based services, data centers, cloud computing and managed services.” Founded in 1998, Paetec provides voice, data and business services to nearly all of the metropolitan areas in the United States. For enterprise clients, Paetec offers cloud computing and data center solutions and a broad range of software and equipment products to help customers manage their communications networks. The deal comes as several telecommunications companies have made acquisitions to build out their broadband and data storage capacity as the shift to cloud computing gathers strength. Earlier this year, Verizon agreed to buy the informational technology services provider Terremark for $1.4 billion. In April, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of the data storage company Savvis for $2.5 billion. The acquisition of Paetec will add seven data centers and a fiber network of 36,700 miles to Windstream’s portfolio and should increase cash flow in the first year, excluding merger costs, according to the press release. The deal, which is expected to close within the next six months, should generate about $100 million in annual cost savings, the company said. Stephens and J.P. Morgan Securities served as financial advisers to Windstream, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank advised Paetec.</text></article>
