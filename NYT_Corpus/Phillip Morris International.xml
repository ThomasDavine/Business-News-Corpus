The court upheld a state appellate court’s ruling in February that sends the case back to Madison County. A judge there had sided with plaintiffs after a 2003 trial in a class-action lawsuit over Philip Morris’s marketing of “light” cigarettes. The state’s Supreme Court threw out that verdict. With the latest ruling, the plaintiffs expect to argue that a favorable 2008 United States Supreme Court decision may be applied to reinstate the Madison County case. A lawyer for Philip Morris’s corporate parent played down the development as the court merely deciding a procedural question about whether the plaintiffs met a statute of limitations, and not the merits of the bid to reopen the case. In 2003, a Madison County circuit judge, Nicholas Byron, who is now retired, found that Philip Morris misled customers about “light” and “low tar” cigarettes and broke state law by marketing them as safer. The state’s Supreme Court overturned that verdict in 2005, saying the Federal Trade Commission allowed companies to characterize or label their cigarettes as “light” and “low tar,” so Philip Morris could not be held liable under state law if such terms could be found false or misleading.

But in 2008, it ruled in a lawsuit on behalf of three Maine residents that smokers may use state consumer protection laws to sue cigarette makers for the way they promote “light” and “low tar” brands.The Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday cleared the way for plaintiffs’ lawyers to push the revival of a $10.1 billion verdict against Philip Morris.

The legislation would require that tobacco products be sold in plain green packaging, limiting the brand recognition enjoyed by global tobacco names like Marlboro and Camel. The law is expected to pass with broad bipartisan support when it is formally introduced in July, and it would go into effect at the start of next year, with a six-month transition period. The government hopes that the bill, along with some of the world’s highest taxes on tobacco, will continue to drive down smoking rates in Australia. The government also hopes that the law will serve as a template for other countries. The possibility of a domino effect is what tobacco companies are afraid of, said Andrew Hughes, a marketing expert at Australian National University in Canberra. “What’s to stop this same law being applied in other parts of the world?” he asked. Philip Morris Asia, which is based in Hong Kong and makes Marlboro cigarettes, said Monday that it had initiated legal action against the Australian government, contending that the new rules would violate Australia’s bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The company’s legal action, called a notice of claim, starts a mandatory three-month period for negotiations. “We believe we have a very strong legal case and will be seeking significant financial compensation for the damage to our business,” Anne Edwards, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, said in a statement. The Australian plans are among the strictest in the world, but other countries are also pushing new initiatives to reduce smoking. Last week, United States health officials released graphic warning labels that will cover the top half of cigarette packages beginning next year. The images will be the first major change to warning labels in more than 25 years; they include photographs of damaged teeth and lungs and a person exhaling smoke through a tracheotomy opening in his neck. Other governments are closely watching Australian efforts to restrict tobacco packaging. The British government, for example, has begun a consultation on ways to reduce the promotional effect of cigarette packs. Tobacco is severely taxed in Australia, where smokers spend about 16 Australian dollars, or $16.70, a pack. The packs come with pictures of maladies like mouth ulcers, cancerous lungs and gangrenous limbs. The new packs would go one step further by trying something new: shrinking the logos down to the point at which it is difficult to distinguish one brand of cigarettes from another. Under the law, 75 percent of the front of the packaging and 90 percent of the back would have to be covered by health warnings. The experiment has generated a roar of protest from tobacco companies and business groups like the International Chamber of Commerce, which says cigarette makers are being singled out even though they sell legal products. “What company would stand for having its brands, which are worth billions, taken away from them?” Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco Australia, said in a statement. “A large brewing company or fast food chain certainly wouldn’t, and we’re no different.” British American Tobacco Australia, also known as BATA, is Australia’s market leader and one of the world’s largest tobacco groups by revenue, with brands including Lucky Strike.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the Lorillard Tobacco Company and other cigarette makers in 1998, claiming they manipulated the nicotine content in cigarettes and misrepresented the health effects of smoking. The hospitals were seeking more than $455 million in damages, ranging from about $300,000 for some hospitals to $86.4 million for the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo. The hospitals argued that the industry’s actions had raised spending for unreimbursed and uncompensated tobacco-related health care. The tobacco companies denied any responsibility for patient care costs at the hospitals or any financial losses by the hospitals. The jury, in Missouri Circuit Court in St. Louis, rejected the hospitals’ claims on a 9-3 vote Friday in the seventh day of deliberations. “The jury correctly rejected the entirety of the hospital’s claims,” Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said in a statement. The jury agreed with Philip Morris “that ordinary cigarettes are not negligently designed or defective,” he said. The hospitals haven’t decided whether to appeal, their lawyer, Kenneth Brostron, said. The case is the third such health care cost-recovery claim to reach trial, according to regulatory filings by Altria. The tobacco industry won the first, in Ohio, in 1999. The second initially resulted in a $17.8 million award for a health insurer by a New York jury in 2001. That was reversed on appeal in 2004. The Missouri suit, which did not include patients as plaintiffs, went to trial in January. The hospitals, which provide care to indigent patients and others who do not pay, represent the majority of licensed, adult acute care hospital beds in Missouri, according to the complaint. The hospitals said medical ethics required them to serve people in need regardless of their ability to pay. Tobacco companies should reimburse the hospitals for care provided to patients who were unable to pay and were suffering from tobacco-related illness, the plaintiffs said. Hospitals also should “recover the increased costs incurred to providing all health care services” as a result of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke, according to the complaint.Tobacco companies are not liable to Missouri hospitals for money spent on patients with smoking-related illnesses who could not pay their medical bills, a St. Louis jury said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/big-tobacco-wins-missouri-case/?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Big Tobacco Wins Missouri Case<date>April 29, 2011, 2:37 pm</date><text>A jury in Missouri has decided after several months that major tobacco companies are not liable for hundreds of millions of dollars spent by more than 40 of the state’s hospitals on smoking-related illnesses in patients who could not afford to pay for their care, according to news reports. In a trial that started three months ago, the hospitals had contended that tactics employed by the tobacco industry, including the major defendants Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, and Lorillard, had fueled higher costs and more illnesses. The industry asserted that hospitals made more money, not less, among other assertions. Jurors had deliberated for about a week before deciding 9-to-3 against the hospitals’ assertions, Bloomberg News reported. The Times’s Barry Meier previewed the case in an article published in late January, noting that the case was finally headed to trial after 12 years.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/nyregion/30smoking.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Antismoking Poster Law in New York City Is Struck Down<date>Published: December 29, 2010</date><text>A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a New York City law that would have forced all bodegas and convenience stores to post gruesome images of diseased lungs, brains and teeth in the shops to discourage people from buying cigarettes. In a 13-page ruling, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in Manhattan wrote that while the law was well intentioned, it violated federal law since only the federal government had the authority to regulate cigarette warnings and advertisements. “Even merchants of morbidity are entitled to the full protection of the law,” Judge Rakoff wrote, “for our sake as well as theirs.” The decision puts an end — at least for now— to the city’s plan to have the placards displayed beside cash registers in more than 11,000 establishments across the city. While awaiting Judge Rakoff’s ruling, the city had agreed that it would postpone enforcement of its rule until this weekend. Lawyers with the city’s Law Department said they planned to appeal the decision. The city’s health department created the rule in late 2009. In June, the nation’s three biggest tobacco companies — Philip Morris, Lorillard and R. J. Reynolds — joined forces with the New York State Association of Convenience Stores in filing a lawsuit challenging the rule. In their suit, the tobacco companies and convenience stores said the rule violated the First Amendment rights of retailers who disagreed with the message, and breached a law stating that only the federal government can regulate cigarette warnings and advertising. In his ruling, Judge Rakoff said that health officials had good reason to view smoking as a “public health threat,” citing smoking as the leading cause of preventable death in New York City and the rest of the country. “Within New York City, roughly 7,500 people die from smoking annually — more than from AIDS, homicide and suicide combined,” he wrote. But Judge Rakoff also cited a federal law enacted in 1965, the Labeling Act, which gave the federal government exclusive authority over cigarette warnings. That law, he wrote, seeks to balance public and commercial interests: the federal government protects the public, but also sets clear and uniform cigarette regulations that protect “commerce and the national economy.” In his ruling, Judge Rakoff pointed out that the Labeling Act also contained a provision forbidding any state laws from conflicting with the federal government’s policies on cigarette warnings and advertisements. That, he concluded, makes the city’s placard policy illegal. Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who represented the convenience store association, said that even though the city had agreed not to enforce the rule until this weekend, many retail shops had put up the graphic placards anyway. He said he was “very pleased” with Judge Rakoff’s decision. “It will allow the retail stores in New York to be freed of the obligation to put signs up urging customers not to buy their lawful products,” he said. In a statement, the health department said that the city “strongly disagrees” with the ruling and that tobacco companies “trying to prevent these messages from being seen should be ashamed of themselves.” “The city’s warning signs portray completely factual messages about the dangers of smoking,” the statement added. “They do so at the exact moment when smokers are making decisions about purchasing tobacco. We believe it is the city’s responsibility to help smokers quit and to protect children from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/bloomberg-backs-uruguays-anti-smoking-laws/?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Bloomberg Backs Uruguay's Anti-Smoking Laws<date>November 15, 2010, 4:26 pm</date><text>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York telephoned the Uruguay’s president, José Mujica, on Monday morning to pledge his financial assistance to that nation’s fight against the world’s leading cigarette company. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire with a long record of antismoking activism, made the announcement after a front-page article in The New York Times on Sunday detailed some of the lobbying, marketing and court activities by multinational tobacco companies. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg announced at a news conference that he would direct to Uruguay’s legal defense some of the $375 million he has set aside in a philanthropy to fight smoking. In a news release, he did not name a precise figure. Uruguay, viewed as a world leader in antismoking laws, is being sued by Philip Morris International in a Washington-based affiliate of the World Bank. The cigarette giant objects to two new Uruguayan laws. One covers 80 percent of the front and back of cigarette packages with a graphic health warning. The other bans more than one type of any brand of cigarette, such as Marlboro red, gold and silver. The suit has rallied antismoking forces globally. They interpreted it as an attempt to intimidate Uruguay and send a message to other developing nations on the eve of a conference of tobacco control officials from 171 nations. The conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay, is expected to produce guidelines to enforce a broad antismoking treaty sponsored by the World Health Organization. In the press release, Mr. Bloomberg said his money “will assist Uruguayan government officials by providing legal research and expertise, launching public education mass media campaigns, and galvanizing world support and public opinion.” Peter Nixon, a spokesman for Philip Morris International, said in recent interviews that the lawsuit was necessary to protect the company’s trademark and intellectual property rights. He said its filing in February was unrelated to the conference of tobacco control officials. The suit seeks unspecified damages. Of the size of the health warning, Mr. Nixon said, “The previous ones were 50 percent and we thought that was reasonable. Once you take it up to 80 percent, there’s no space for trademarks to be shown. So we thought that was going too far.” The limit on brands, he added, forced Philip Morris to remove a number of brands from the market. A group of health-related nonprofit organizations bought a full-page advertisement in Uruguay’s leading newspaper Monday to thank the country’s president for standing up to tobacco companies. Philip Morris International’s $66 billion in annual revenues is twice the size of Uruguay’s gross domestic product.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/global/14smoke.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Philip Morris Said to Benefit from Child Labor<date>Published: July 14, 2010</date><text>MOSCOW — One woman said children as young as 10 working in the fields developed red rashes on their stomachs and necks as they harvested tobacco for use in cigarettes made by Philip Morris.Another migrant laborer working in the tobacco fields in Kazakhstan said a farmer confiscated her identification papers and withheld pay to force her to continue working despite dismal conditions. Human Rights Watch, the group best known for documenting governmental abuse and war crimes, plans to release a report on Wednesday showing that child and forced labor is widespread on farms that supply a cigarette factory owned by Philip Morris International in Kazakhstan, in Central Asia. While child labor should be condemned in any setting, the report said, employing children on tobacco farms is particularly hazardous because tobacco field laborers are exposed to high levels of nicotine while doing their jobs. Only a tiny fraction of Philip Morris’s global tobacco purchases are made in the country, and no tobacco raised on the farms employing child labor went into cigarettes sold outside of former Soviet countries. Philip Morris, after being provided with an advance copy of the report, said it agreed to sweeping changes in its purchasing policies in Kazakhstan. “Philip Morris International is firmly opposed to child labor,” Peter Nixon, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview from the company’s office in Lausanne, Switzerland. Although child labor is widespread in agriculture in Central Asia, Human Rights Watch said, the particularly harmful environment on the Kazakh tobacco farms warranted special attention. The report cited conditions it said were dangerous to children and adults alike. Lacking easy access to potable water, for example, laborers had resorted to drinking from irrigation channels contaminated with pesticides, the report said. The group interviewed 68 tobacco farm employees in one district of Kazakhstan during the harvest last fall, identifying them only by their first names and initials. All, including the children, were migrant laborers from neighboring Central Asian countries, mostly from impoverished Kyrgyzstan. The report also documented violations of basic farm safety rules, like laborers wearing open-toed shoes while working with sharp hoes. Human Rights Watch researchers documented 72 instances of children working in the Kazakh tobacco fields, which employ about a thousand migrants each season. Many are paid on a piecework basis, by the ton of harvested tobacco. The group said this was an inducement for parents to bring their children into the fields at harvest time. Even then, the report said, families made only a few hundred dollars for a half-year of farm work, after covering debts to farmers for board and travel. “A company like Philip Morris certainly has the resources to put an end to these practices,” Jane Buchanan, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher and the author, said in an interview. Mr. Nixon, the Philip Morris spokesman, said the company already had policies in place prohibiting purchases from farms that used child labor. Over the years, he said, this policy had reduced abusive practices at Kazakh tobacco farms — an assertion that Human Rights Watch said was supported in its interviews. All the same, Mr. Nixon said, Philip Morris would step up its efforts to eliminate child labor. The company, he said, was “appreciative” of Human Rights Watch for drawing the continuing abuse to its attention. But Ms. Buchanan said Philip Morris bore moral responsibility for the fate of child laborers in Kazakhstan, even though it was not their direct employer, citing precedents established by apparel and athletic shoe companies that over the last decade had demanded Asian suppliers prohibit child labor. “Companies are supposed to have policies to recognize and rectify problems with human rights in their supply chain,” she said. That many of the children worked alongside their migrant-laborer parents during the harvest, she said, did not diminish Philip Morris’s responsibility for their safety. Tobacco can be an unhealthy crop even before it winds up in cigarettes. Nicotine is absorbed through the skin through continual handling of tobacco leaves. The resulting ailment in tobacco farm laborers is called green tobacco sickness, causing nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Rashes are also common. The report cited studies indicating that laborers can absorb, in one day, the amount of nicotine equivalent to smoking 36 cigarettes. “Children are especially vulnerable due to their small body size in relation to the dose of nicotine they absorb,” the report said. The farmers studied by Human Rights Watch supply Philip Morris Kazakhstan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Philip Morris International, which is based in New York. The company, spun off from its parent, the Altria Group, in 2008, sells cigarettes in 160 countries outside of the United States, including Kazakhstan. Philip Morris USA markets many of the same brands in America, most notably Marlboro, but is a distinct company. Mr. Nixon said the company would require farmers to sign written contracts with adult laborers during this year’s growing season, and would hire an outside monitor to police farms for compliance with child labor laws. This year, the company opened a summer camp for the children of migrant laborers in Kazakhstan’s tobacco-producing region. It will also require its suppliers to pay monthly salaries, rather than piecework pay, to discourage migrant parents from enlisting the help of their children. In 2009, Philip Morris International’s net revenue was $25 billion on sales of cigarettes including globally marketed brands like Marlboro, L&amp;M, Chesterfield and Bond Street. The company’s purchases in Kazakhstan are tiny compared to its global operations; it bought 1,500 tons in 2009, compared to its global total of 400,000 tons. The company said it contracts with 300 farms in Kazakhstan, employing about 1,200 seasonal workers. These workers are typically accompanied by about 200 children, Mr. Nixon said. The Kazakh tobacco is used only in local brands unknown outside their markets in former Soviet countries, including Polyot and Apollo-Soyuz.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/nyregion/23cigs.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">With Higher Tax, New York Smokers Feel Put Upon<date>Published: June 22, 2010</date><text>There was a time when people did not think twice about smoking. That was when a pack of cigarettes could be bought for pocket change, when it was still legal to smoke in bars and restaurants, when Philip Morris — the nation’s largest tobacco company —still had its headquarters in the Philip Morris building. Of course, things have changed. After all, the Philip Morris building is not even called that anymore. (When it was new, in the early 1980s, it was called the Philip Morris Research Center and Headquarters, at first. Philip Morris’s parent company, the Altria Group, moved its headquarters to Richmond, Va., two years ago.) On the sidewalk alongside that building, at 120 Park Avenue, across from Grand Central Terminal, is an oasis for smokers in an increasingly smoke-free city: two thigh-high ashtrays and room to stand for the few minutes between lighting up and stubbing out. Smokers know this place well: Some come from as far as a block and a half away, because they dare not light up outside their own office buildings. It is between a subway entrance and, of all things, a tobacco shop. And it is not a happy place. The latest sin tax, part of an emergency budget measure to keep the state government running, will add $1.60 in state taxes to a pack of cigarettes. In New York City, where cigarettes are also subject to municipal taxes, the price of a pack of some brands will jump to more than $11 — or more than 50 cents per cigarette. Smokers came and went in this open-air smoking lounge, but the anger against the new tax — and sense that smokers are being picked on in budget-conscious times — remained. “I’m definitely not happy about it,” John O’Gorman, a risk manager who was smoking a Marlboro Light, said of the new cigarette tax, which takes effect on July 1. “There have got to be easier ways to raise more money.” All right, Mr. O’Gorman: Pretend that you were a governor facing a big budget shortfall. What would you tax to raise additional revenue? “All the cars coming into Manhattan,” because they contribute to air pollution, Mr. O’Gorman said. “Maybe there’s a way to tax that.” Among a cross section of smokers the consensus was that the new tax was an economic penalty. How much of a penalty depended on each smoker’s own story, on how cost-conscious they had become in a recession, on whether they had jobs or had lost them. Some said that paying an extra $1.60 a pack would make cigarettes cost so much that they would get serious about quitting once and for all. Doreen Campo, on a smoke break on Madison Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, said her mother had died of lung cancer after smoking for years. Ms. Campo, 51, said she had continued to smoke, but the new tax could change that. “I won’t be able to afford to smoke,” she said, smoking a Marlboro Light. “It’s too expensive. It’s expensive now. You end up short. You end up not eating because you want those cigarettes.” Still, she said, picking on smokers for new and higher taxes amounted to economic discrimination. “I mean, everybody has a right to do what they want to do,” she said. “It ruined the business for the bars because no one wants to go out in the cold to have a cigarette, or if you’re having a conversation, instead of you and me having a conversation, we have to get up and excuse ourselves and go outside. Even the restaurants. First they have smoking sections. Then they have none. Then you have the annoying people that pass by and they go like this.” She waved her arms as if she were clearing smoke from a fire. Daniel Conard, a sales manager smoking outside the former Philip Morris building, said the price still had a way to go before he decided that smoking was unaffordable. How high would the price per pack have to go? “For myself,” he said, “it would be $15.” But New York is not getting much revenue from him, even now. “I’m from Kentucky,” he said. “I go home and buy a few cartons.” And not that often: “I’m a work smoker,” he said. “I don’t smoke at home.” He said he smoked two or three cigarettes a day. He mentioned a tax on soda, an idea that Gov. David A. Paterson floated earlier in the year. “Smoking’s not good,” he said. “Drinking soda’s not good for the well-being of society, I guess.

Seeks Explanation Of Marlboro Marketing<date>Published: June 18, 2010</date><text>When the F.D.A. says no ''light'' cigarettes, it evidently means it. Days before a new federal ban on making tobacco products using the words ''light'' or other terms that might imply a safer smoke, federal regulators on Thursday sent a stern letter to the Altria Group, maker of the cigarettes known as Marlboro Lights. The Food and Drug Administration asked Altria about notes that have been placed on the last packs of Marlboro Lights reading, ''Your Marlboro Lights package is changing, but your cigarette stays the same.'' The notes also say ''In the future, ask for Marlboro in the gold pack.'' The F.D.A. said it was opening an investigation into the marketing of the cigarettes, which are the nation's best-selling brand and are sold by the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria. Starting next Tuesday, tobacco companies are barred from making any products labeled ''light,'' ''mild,'' ''low'' or with ''similar descriptors,'' according to the tobacco law, which President Obama signed a year ago on that day. Anticipating the new rules, Altria and other tobacco companies have been phasing out the banned terms. But they have repackaged the same products using what critics call ''color coding'' -- lighter hues of blue, gold, silver or orange for the former ''light'' products, or in the case of menthol cigarettes, greens. Through this makeover, Marlboro Lights became simply Marlboro in a gold box. Although the cigarette companies have said they are using the colors legally to differentiate brands, the F.D.A. has already opened an investigation into the industry color coding. Now the agency wants to know more about Altria's effort to tell consumers that light is now gold, by attaching the notes -- called onserts -- onto packs of Marlboro Lights still in the distribution pipeline. The F.D.A. told Altria it had until July 30 to produce all documents related to the company's market research on consumer perceptions about the gold packages and the health risks of the cigarettes inside. The letter said the onserts ''may perpetuate the mistaken beliefs associated with your 'light' cigarettes when marketed as Marlboro in the gold pack.'' An Altria spokesman declined to discuss the specifics of the F.D.A.'s query. ''We just got this letter,'' Brendan J. McCormick, the spokesman, said Thursday afternoon. ''This is a request for information, and we certainly plan to respond to the letter and comply with the request.'' Separately, the New York City health department on Monday began an advertising campaign to tell consumers that cigarettes in lighter colored packages are still deadly. ''Don't be fooled,'' one television ad says. ''All cigarettes contain the same poisons that make you sick and kill you.''</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25brfs-SMOKERSAWARD_BRF.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Florida: Smoker’s Award Is Slashed<date>Published: February 24, 2010</date><text>Concluding that a jury was moved by emotion rather than evidence, a judge on Wednesday reduced to nearly $39 million the $300 million in damages that had been awarded to a Florida smoker against Philip Morris USA.

The law taking effect this summer does not bar companies from making light cigarettes, only from using words like “light” in marketing. The industry says that it is complying and that it should be free to use colors on its packages to market different product lines to adult consumers. “Colors are really used to identify and differentiate different brand packs,” David M.

Dillard III, a senior vice president of Altria, said banning certain colors would be unconstitutional under commercial speech and property protections. The tobacco regulation passed last year gave the F.D.A. sweeping new regulatory authority over tobacco. One new requirement is that companies must prove to the F.D.A. that a product is safer than conventional cigarettes before it can be marketed as such. While Congress specifically banned some terms, including “low” and “mild”  present on about half the packages of cigarettes sold in the United States  it also gave the F.D.A. authority to act against “similar descriptors” that could mislead consumers to think certain products were less risky. Last month, the agency published a notice that it could take action against colors like silver or pastels, as well as additional words like “silver,” “smooth” and “natural,” which some companies are still planning to use on cigarette packages. The notice sought public and industry comments, which are due Friday. Kathleen Quinn, a spokeswoman for the new F.D.A. Center for Tobacco Products, said Thursday that the agency would “thoroughly review” the use of color on cigarette packages by June 22, the effective date of the wording ban and the first anniversary of the law’s passage. As it happens, Friday is also the deadline for petitions to be filed with the Supreme Court asking it to hear appeals from the 2006 conviction of tobacco makers for racketeering in making fraudulent claims about light cigarettes. According to Professor Connolly of Harvard, the tobacco industry has known for at least a decade from World Health Organization actions that words like “light” would eventually have to come off the boxes, giving it time to prepare the other visual cues on packaging. He shared with The New York Times a set of marketing materials about the new color system that he said had been given to him by people working in the tobacco industry. The color coding, Professor Connolly said, is red and dark green for regular and menthol; blue, gold and light green for light cigarettes; and silver and orange for ultra lights. “The myth of safer cigarettes is perpetuated,” Professor Connolly said. “Light cigarettes unleashed a monster.” But rather than fight over shading and coloring on the packages, he urged the F.D.A., using its new authority, to regulate filters and ingredients in those cigarettes to make them taste harsher. Light cigarettes have a different taste because they are filtered differently and may contain additives, Professor Connolly said.

The company posted $25 billion in net revenue for the year, down from $25.7 billion in 2008. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $6.7 billion, up from $6.1 billion a year earlier. “Widespread market share growth and productivity initiatives, largely offset the significant market contractions and consumer down-trading that we witnessed in those countries that suffered the most from the global economic downturn,” Louis C. Camilleri, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The new share buy back program will begin in May and last three years.

After eventually acknowledging, like others in its industry, that cigarette smoking was, indeed, addictive and caused disease, Altria went a step further. It broke from the Big Tobacco pack and began supporting legislation that would ultimately put the company under the regulatory thumb of the Food and Drug Administration.Altria’s motives for submitting to strict oversight have long been a mystery. Did the company and its executives, who were internally pursuing a strategy of “societal alignment,” suddenly embrace a true partnership on public health? Or was this a case, as its longtime foes and competitors have argued, of Altria seeking to generate good P.R. or lock in its market dominance by cozying up to a regulator that could restrict rivals from marketing new products? Another possible answer was highlighted this month, as the federal government began fine-tuning aspects of a law that President Obama signed last summer that gives the government sweeping new powers to regulate the production and marketing of tobacco products. A series of letters that Altria submitted to the F.D.A. as part of that process argues that the government should, effectively, sign off on the notion that smokeless tobacco products are less harmful than cigarettes — and that Altria and other companies should be allowed to market them as such to consumers. It is a pivotal and divisive claim. While public health doctors agree that the smokeless products are far less hazardous to individuals than cigarettes, they still have concerns because all tobacco products contain nicotine and carcinogens. They also contend that promoting smokeless products — some in tiny packages in the shape of cigarette packs — would attract new, perhaps younger customers and maintain the addiction for smokers who might otherwise quit. They note that Altria is adding flavorings to its smokeless products that have long been used in candy. Furthermore, critics say, Altria’s suggestion to the F.D.A. that it be allowed to market its products as less risky is part of an effort to dodge indoor-smoking laws (which are credited with encouraging more smokers to quit) and to encourage smokers to use oral tobacco products as supplements. “If you look at how they’re marketing smokeless now, they’re marketing for dual use, and to protect the cigarette market, which is their big money maker,” says Stanton A. Glantz, a professor of cardiology and a specialist in tobacco research at the University of California, San Francisco. UNDER its gregarious chief executive, an occasional smoker named Michael E. Szymanczyk, Altria is treading carefully when it comes to talking about its business strategies or its relationship with the F.D.A. After its letters to the regulator made headlines this month, the company canceled interviews for this article with top executives at its headquarters in Richmond, Va. An Altria spokesman says the executives declined to comment because “we don’t want to be perceived as leading the discussion” on the regulatory front. Brendan J. McCormick, another Altria spokesman, says the company supported the legislation enacted last summer because it believed that the F.D.A. offered the best way to settle the debates about tobacco use and marketing, which have raged for decades. He says the company believes that F.D.A. standards will create more predictability in the industry and a level playing field for competitors. Moreover, he says, the F.D.A. provides a forum to evaluate products that are potentially less harmful — and if the agency agrees with its argument, the company could market them with a federal imprimatur. Mr. McCormick says Altria doesn’t agree with criticisms that the new tobacco law and the company’s willingness to work closely with its regulator cement its market dominance. “This is a dynamic industry,” he says. And Altria is a changing company. It spent $11.7 billion last year to acquire UST, formerly the United States Tobacco Company and home to popular snuff brands like Copenhagen and Skoal. The merger made Altria the biggest cigarette and chew company in the country, controlling 50 percent of the cigarette market and 55 percent of the smokeless market. The deal also solved several quandaries facing the company. The biggest was that, after its spinoff of Kraft Foods and the less-regulated, faster-growing Philip Morris International units in recent years, Altria had become a stand-alone domestic cigarette company in a declining industry. Bans on indoor smoking, along with rising federal and state excise taxes, have accelerated a long-term decline in the volume of domestic cigarette sales. Volumes may be declining, but cigarettes remain Altria’s biggest business by far, accounting for $14.4 billion in revenue in 2009. (Smokeless brought in $1.2 billion.) Cigarette profits are growing thanks to price increases and a customer base of people who haven’t kicked the habit. About 70 percent of the nation’s 46 million smokers say they want to quit, government surveys show, and about 40 percent try every year. But only 2.5 percent succeed, the surveys say. The government estimates that 400,000 Americans die of smoking-related diseases each year.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/opinion/27fri3.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">A Big Loss for Big Tobacco<date>Published: November 26, 2009</date><text>A Florida jury has ordered Philip Morris USA to pay $300 million to a former smoker who developed severe emphysema and may need a lung transplant.

Come June, under the new federal tobacco law, cigarette companies will no longer be allowed to use words like “light” or “mild” on packages to imply that some cigarettes are safer than others. But in a move that critics say simply skirts the new rules, tobacco companies plan to use packaging to make those same distinctions: light colors for light cigarettes. So Marlboro Lights, the nation’s best-selling brand, from Philip Morris, will be renamed Marlboro Gold, according to a flier the company recently sent to distributors. Likewise, Marlboro Ultra Lights will change into Marlboro Silver. And anticipating the new rules, R.J. Reynolds has already changed Salem Ultra Lights, which are sold in a silver box, to Silver Box. “They’re circumventing the law,” said Gregory N. Connolly, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. “They’re using color coding to perpetuate one of the biggest public health myths into the next century.” The National Cancer Institute says there are no health benefits from light cigarettes and that they may be more dangerous because some people inhale them more deeply than regular cigarettes. The Food and Drug Administration has begun a federal review of the color-coding approach, a step that could conceivably lead to further actions against products designated as light. The law taking effect this summer does not bar companies from making light cigarettes, only from using words like “light” in marketing. The industry says that it is complying and that it should be free to use colors on its packages to market different product lines to adult consumers. “Colors are really used to identify and differentiate different brand packs,” David M. Sylvia, a spokesman for Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, said Thursday. “We do not use colors to communicate whether one product is less harmful or more harmful than another.” In a letter to the F.D.A. on Thursday, James E. Dillard III, a senior vice president of Altria, said banning certain colors would be unconstitutional under commercial speech and property protections. The tobacco regulation passed last year gave the F.D.A. sweeping new regulatory authority over tobacco. One new requirement is that companies must prove to the F.D.A. that a product is safer than conventional cigarettes before it can be marketed as such. While Congress specifically banned some terms, including “low” and “mild”  present on about half the packages of cigarettes sold in the United States  it also gave the F.D.A. authority to act against “similar descriptors” that could mislead consumers to think certain products were less risky. Last month, the agency published a notice that it could take action against colors like silver or pastels, as well as additional words like “silver,” “smooth” and “natural,” which some companies are still planning to use on cigarette packages. The notice sought public and industry comments, which are due Friday. Kathleen Quinn, a spokeswoman for the new F.D.A. Center for Tobacco Products, said Thursday that the agency would “thoroughly review” the use of color on cigarette packages by June 22, the effective date of the wording ban and the first anniversary of the law’s passage. As it happens, Friday is also the deadline for petitions to be filed with the Supreme Court asking it to hear appeals from the 2006 conviction of tobacco makers for racketeering in making fraudulent claims about light cigarettes. According to Professor Connolly of Harvard, the tobacco industry has known for at least a decade from World Health Organization actions that words like “light” would eventually have to come off the boxes, giving it time to prepare the other visual cues on packaging. He shared with The New York Times a set of marketing materials about the new color system that he said had been given to him by people working in the tobacco industry. The color coding, Professor Connolly said, is red and dark green for regular and menthol; blue, gold and light green for light cigarettes; and silver and orange for ultra lights. “The myth of safer cigarettes is perpetuated,” Professor Connolly said. “Light cigarettes unleashed a monster.” But rather than fight over shading and coloring on the packages, he urged the F.D.A., using its new authority, to regulate filters and ingredients in those cigarettes to make them taste harsher. Light cigarettes have a different taste because they are filtered differently and may contain additives, Professor Connolly said. Studies have shown that people who smoke light cigarettes satisfy their nicotine cravings by inhaling the smoke more deeply, smoking more cigarettes and taking more puffs on each cigarette. Altria said it had used terms like “light” as well as packaging colors to connote different tastes, not safety. But study after study  including ones by the industry disclosed in tobacco lawsuits  has shown consumers believe the terms and colors connote a safer product. Moreover, adults believe cigarette packs with the terms “smooth,” “silver” or “gold” are also easier to quit than other ones, and teenagers said they were more likely to try them, according to a survey and study published in September in the European Journal of Public Health. The survey authors, led by David Hammond, a health studies professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, called for plain, uncolored packaging. Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington advocacy group, said cigarette companies had responded to bans of terms like “light” and “low tar” in at least 78 countries by color-coding their packaging to convey the same ideas. “If the F.D.A. concludes that either new wording or color coding is misleading consumers,” he said, “then the F.D.A. has authority to take corrective action.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/philip-morris-to-buy-back-12-billion-in-shares/?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Philip Morris to Buy Back $12 Billion in Shares<date>February 11, 2010, 10:35 am</date><text>Philip Morris International said on Thursday that it would buy back $12 billion of its own shares, as it reported strong fourth quarter and full-year earnings. The company posted $25 billion in net revenue for the year, down from $25.7 billion in 2008. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $6.7 billion, up from $6.1 billion a year earlier. “Widespread market share growth and productivity initiatives, largely offset the significant market contractions and consumer down-trading that we witnessed in those countries that suffered the most from the global economic downturn,” Louis C. Camilleri, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The new share buy back program will begin in May and last three years.

After eventually acknowledging, like others in its industry, that cigarette smoking was, indeed, addictive and caused disease, Altria went a step further. It broke from the Big Tobacco pack and began supporting legislation that would ultimately put the company under the regulatory thumb of the Food and Drug Administration.Altria’s motives for submitting to strict oversight have long been a mystery. Did the company and its executives, who were internally pursuing a strategy of “societal alignment,” suddenly embrace a true partnership on public health? Or was this a case, as its longtime foes and competitors have argued, of Altria seeking to generate good P.R. or lock in its market dominance by cozying up to a regulator that could restrict rivals from marketing new products? Another possible answer was highlighted this month, as the federal government began fine-tuning aspects of a law that President Obama signed last summer that gives the government sweeping new powers to regulate the production and marketing of tobacco products. A series of letters that Altria submitted to the F.D.A. as part of that process argues that the government should, effectively, sign off on the notion that smokeless tobacco products are less harmful than cigarettes — and that Altria and other companies should be allowed to market them as such to consumers. It is a pivotal and divisive claim. While public health doctors agree that the smokeless products are far less hazardous to individuals than cigarettes, they still have concerns because all tobacco products contain nicotine and carcinogens. They also contend that promoting smokeless products — some in tiny packages in the shape of cigarette packs — would attract new, perhaps younger customers and maintain the addiction for smokers who might otherwise quit. They note that Altria is adding flavorings to its smokeless products that have long been used in candy. Furthermore, critics say, Altria’s suggestion to the F.D.A. that it be allowed to market its products as less risky is part of an effort to dodge indoor-smoking laws (which are credited with encouraging more smokers to quit) and to encourage smokers to use oral tobacco products as supplements. “If you look at how they’re marketing smokeless now, they’re marketing for dual use, and to protect the cigarette market, which is their big money maker,” says Stanton A. Glantz, a professor of cardiology and a specialist in tobacco research at the University of California, San Francisco. UNDER its gregarious chief executive, an occasional smoker named Michael E. Szymanczyk, Altria is treading carefully when it comes to talking about its business strategies or its relationship with the F.D.A. After its letters to the regulator made headlines this month, the company canceled interviews for this article with top executives at its headquarters in Richmond, Va. An Altria spokesman says the executives declined to comment because “we don’t want to be perceived as leading the discussion” on the regulatory front. Brendan J. McCormick, another Altria spokesman, says the company supported the legislation enacted last summer because it believed that the F.D.A. offered the best way to settle the debates about tobacco use and marketing, which have raged for decades. He says the company believes that F.D.A. standards will create more predictability in the industry and a level playing field for competitors. Moreover, he says, the F.D.A. provides a forum to evaluate products that are potentially less harmful — and if the agency agrees with its argument, the company could market them with a federal imprimatur. Mr. McCormick says Altria doesn’t agree with criticisms that the new tobacco law and the company’s willingness to work closely with its regulator cement its market dominance. “This is a dynamic industry,” he says. And Altria is a changing company. It spent $11.7 billion last year to acquire UST, formerly the United States Tobacco Company and home to popular snuff brands like Copenhagen and Skoal. The merger made Altria the biggest cigarette and chew company in the country, controlling 50 percent of the cigarette market and 55 percent of the smokeless market. The deal also solved several quandaries facing the company. The biggest was that, after its spinoff of Kraft Foods and the less-regulated, faster-growing Philip Morris International units in recent years, Altria had become a stand-alone domestic cigarette company in a declining industry. Bans on indoor smoking, along with rising federal and state excise taxes, have accelerated a long-term decline in the volume of domestic cigarette sales. Volumes may be declining, but cigarettes remain Altria’s biggest business by far, accounting for $14.4 billion in revenue in 2009. (Smokeless brought in $1.2 billion.) Cigarette profits are growing thanks to price increases and a customer base of people who haven’t kicked the habit. About 70 percent of the nation’s 46 million smokers say they want to quit, government surveys show, and about 40 percent try every year. But only 2.5 percent succeed, the surveys say. The government estimates that 400,000 Americans die of smoking-related diseases each year.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/opinion/27fri3.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">A Big Loss for Big Tobacco<date>Published: November 26, 2009</date><text>A Florida jury has ordered Philip Morris USA to pay $300 million to a former smoker who developed severe emphysema and may need a lung transplant.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Altria Group Go to your Portfolio » If it survives an appeal, the verdict late Thursday would be the nation’s largest award of damages to an individual suing a tobacco company and could encourage thousands of plaintiffs who have filed similar cases in Florida, according to Clifford E. Douglas of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network. A state supreme court ruling in Florida a few years ago made it easier to pursue tobacco lawsuits there than in other states. But the tobacco industry, which plans to appeal, appeared unfazed. Tobacco companies have considered product liability suits as little more than a cost of doing business since the seven biggest companies agreed to pay $206 billion in a master settlement agreement with 46 states in 1998. Florida, despite being one of those states, had a major legal ruling in 2006 that lowered a plaintiff’s burden of proof against a tobacco company. The Florida Supreme Court rejected a class-action verdict and a $145 billion award to plaintiffs, saying smokers would have to sue individually. But the court said plaintiffs would not have to prove some key elements that had been upheld in the first stage of the class action: that nicotine is addictive, that smoking causes diseases, and that cigarette companies fraudulently hid those facts. “That makes these cases in Florida unique,” Mr. Douglas said. Smokers in other states are still suing cigarette makers, he said, but they have higher legal hurdles. A spokesman for the Altria Group, the Virginia-based parent company of Philip Morris USA, indicated it would appeal the verdict and said the Florida rules were “fundamentally unfair and unconstitutional.” Shares of Altria, which had been up more than 27 percent this year, dropped 1.2 percent Friday, to $18.98. Lucinda Naugle, the 61-year-old sister of a former Fort Lauderdale mayor, was awarded $56 million in compensatory damages and $244 million in punitive damages Thursday after a three-week trial and three hours of jury deliberation in Broward County Circuit Court. Ms. Naugle, an office manager, had started smoking when she was 20 and quit when she was 45 years old, her lawyer, Robert W. Kelley of Fort Lauderdale, said in a telephone interview Friday. She now has severe emphysema and needs a lung transplant she cannot afford, he said. The jury assigned her 10 percent of the liability for her smoking and disease, and Philip Morris 90 percent. “She’ll get paid, I would hope, within a year or two,” Mr. Kelley said. “The question is will she live long enough.” Mr. Kelley said about 25 more cases were lined up for trial in Florida next year. In all, more than 9,000 people from the former class action filed individual suits in various courts in Florida against tobacco makers by January 2008, the deadline set by the state Supreme Court. About 4,000 of those cases were filed in federal court and have been stayed, pending a review scheduled in January by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta. Brendan J. McCormick, a spokesman for Altria, said Friday that the company expected the federal appellate court to reject the standards of proof set by the state Supreme Court. “What you have is a defined number of cases in Florida with unique issues that will ultimately be resolved on appeal,” he said. David J. Adelman, a tobacco analyst for Morgan Stanley, said the Florida case and, separately, forthcoming class-action lawsuits over light cigarette claims pose an “undeniable” increase in the industry’s legal risk “which had previously declined to an unprecedented low point.” In an interview, Mr. Adelman noted that there were no jury trials in cigarette cases all of last year, and that other states had decertified class-action suits in ways more favorable to the tobacco industry. Further, Mr. Adelman said, the major legal threats to the industry were removed by the 1998 settlement with states. And since then, the industry has fended off calls in court and Congress for a huge disgorgement of its profits. Even in light of the Florida verdict, Mr. Adelman said the tobacco industry could afford several hundred million dollars a year in legal losses if it had to. “That is a financially manageable issue,” he said. Of more concern, he said in the interview and a note to investors, is a coming round of cases claiming fraud and damages from past marketing of so-called light cigarettes. Those products have been shown to be no less harmful than regular cigarettes because smokers inhale them more deeply. Congress, in landmark tobacco legislation earlier this year, prohibited the use of the terms “light,” “low” or “mild” in all cigarette labeling and marketing, effective June 22, 2010. The first of the “light cigarette” class-action cases is scheduled in Minnesota next October, followed by Missouri in January 2011.

But the investor Warren Buffett has said that some apparently drooping businesses can deliver more puff than expected. He called such stocks cigar butts, and Altria could be one of them. Most of Altria’s profit comes from its cigarette subsidiary, Philip Morris USA, which in turn relies heavily on Marlboro. So it’s somewhat alarming that Altria shipped 16 percent fewer cigarettes in the third quarter than a year earlier  even though Marlboro’s share of the United States market actually edged up to 41.9 percent in the quarter. With health care reform top of the agenda in Washington, the tobacco business is also still an obvious target. From 2000 to 2004, smoking was responsible for $193 billion in annual health-related economic losses, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the government tries to cut health care costs by discouraging smoking, there could be more taxes imposed like the April increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes. Yet it wasn’t all bad at Altria in the third quarter. Net revenue excluding excise taxes fell 11.3 percent in the cigarette segment  less than the decline in volume, suggesting the company managed to raise average prices. Add in other businesses including UST, the chewing tobacco and snuff maker acquired by Altria this year, and the group managed to eke out a 1.7 percent overall increase in profit as net revenue excluding taxes slid just 0.5 percent in the quarter. Cost cutting helped, too. Altria’s stock currently trades at just under 10 times consensus estimates of 2010 earnings, slightly below Reynolds American’s multiple, despite what some analysts view as a more powerful stable of products. Pricing power, especially at Marlboro, could surprise  as could cost cutting and contributions by the smaller business units. It would be oddly fitting if the tobacco-dominated company did turn out to be one of Mr. Buffett’s cigar butts. Overvalued Euro? How times have changed for the euro. It was once widely seen as an experiment bound to fail. Now, as the dollar wanes, the common European currency is the star, riding high at $1.50. But does the euro deserve it? The answer is probably not. Back in October 2000, the single currency was at $0.84. Then, commentators wrote about how it was at a “critical stage.” The obituaries were ready to run. But the euro didn’t die. Over the next nine years, it strengthened by 79 percent. Buying the euro when all looked dark would have been a good idea. Now, investors are writing obituaries for the dollar. It seems to have nothing going for it. The Federal Reserve’s target overnight interest rate is virtually zero. The Obama administration’s fiscal deficit is stratospheric. And even good news about United States economic growth provokes dollar selling. But the euro really isn’t worthy of its current star status. The strains in the region where it is used weren’t serious in 2000, but they are now. Germany and Italy are on course for 5 percent declines in their economies  twice the pullback seen in the supposedly hopeless United States. The German unemployment rate, at 8.2 percent, is healthy compared with Belgium’s or Ireland’s, at over 12 percent. Spain’s is a horrific 19 percent. To aid recovery, the euro zone needs an active economic policy and a competitive currency. But estimates of the euro’s purchasing power against other currencies suggest it is close to 30 percent overvalued. For countries like Spain, Greece, Italy and Ireland, where wages raced ahead in the good years, the effective level of overvaluation is even higher. What can be done? Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, can try to talk the euro down. But more effective would be recognition that reports of the dollar’s demise are exaggerated. That will come when the Fed hints that growth has returned and that interest rates will soon be rising. For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.

But the euro really isn’t worthy of its current star status. The strains in the region where it is used weren’t serious in 2000, but they are now. Germany and Italy are on course for 5 percent declines in their economies  twice the pullback seen in the supposedly hopeless United States. The German unemployment rate, at 8.2 percent, is healthy compared with Belgium’s or Ireland’s, at over 12 percent. Spain’s is a horrific 19 percent. To aid recovery, the euro zone needs an active economic policy and a competitive currency. But estimates of the euro’s purchasing power against other currencies suggest it is close to 30 percent overvalued. For countries like Spain, Greece, Italy and Ireland, where wages raced ahead in the good years, the effective level of overvaluation is even higher. What can be done? Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, can try to talk the euro down. But more effective would be recognition that reports of the dollar’s demise are exaggerated. That will come when the Fed hints that growth has returned and that interest rates will soon be rising.

Mr. Weissman began his corporate ascent in the movie and public relations businesses, and one of his early tasks as a young marketing executive at Philip Morris  which became part of the Altria group in 2003  was to help develop the very effective masculine mythology of Marlboro cigarettes. He applied similar deftness when Philip Morris acquired Miller Brewing in 1969 and came up with the new Miller Lite brand. Mr. Weissman also pushed Philip Morris to become a major donor to arts groups, particularly experimental undertakings like the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He said in an interview with The New York Times in 1990 that the arts initiative began with a traveling exhibition of modern art in 1965. “We wanted to demonstrate to our own employees that we were an open-minded company seeking creativity in all aspects of our business,” Mr. Weissman said. “And we were determined to do this by sponsoring things that made a difference, that were really dangerous.” In an interview with Forbes in 1983, he said that giving to the arts also impressed customers, and that more people go to museums than ballgames. In 1983, Mr. Weissman installed a branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art on the ground floor of the company’s new Park Avenue headquarters, across from Grand Central Terminal. He was on the Whitney board from 1979 to 1990. When Mr. Weissman retired as chairman of the company in 1984, he spoke of fishing for salmon.

He also encouraged the Classical Jazz series, a forerunner of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which eventually got its own space, in 2004. George Weissman, the son of immigrants from Eastern Europe, was born in the Bronx on July 12, 1919. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School, he earned a degree in business administration from the business school of the City College of New York. He then edited a small weekly newspaper in New Jersey and worked as a reporter for The Star-Ledger, based in Newark. He joined the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor, helping to chase submarines and shell beachheads for 3 1/2 years. After his discharge, he wrote a review of the Samuel Goldwyn movie “The Best Years of Our Lives” for some labor papers. Goldwyn hired him as a publicity agent at $125 a week. After Goldwyn fired him in a dispute over promoting a movie, he got a job with Benjamin Sonnenberg, who is credited with helping create the modern public relations industry. Soon, Mr. Weissman was devoted full time to the Philip Morris account. He was hired in 1952 as assistant to the president of Philip Morris. In 1960, Mr. Weissman became chief executive of Philip Morris International, where he helped build up overseas sales to the point that they accounted for a third of both sales and earnings for the entire company. In 1966, he was named president of Philip Morris itself, and he guided the company’s strategy of using profits from cigarettes to expand into other businesses, including the acquisition of the Seven-Up Company in 1978. When Mr. Weissman became chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris in 1978, he told Fortune magazine that he saw himself as the quintessential Marlboro man. “I’m no cowboy and I don’t ride horseback,” he said, “but I like to think I have the freedom the Marlboro man exemplifies. He’s the man who doesn’t punch a clock. He’s not computerized. He’s a free spirit.” Mr. Weissman had few compunctions about describing his own habits. “Forty cigarettes a day, one or two beers and I also drink some wine,” he said in a press conference in Paris in 1980. Under his leadership, Philip Morris employed blacks in prominent executive positions, resulting in boycotts in some places in the South. The company also advertised in black and Hispanic newspapers and magazines. Mr. Weissman joined other business leaders in signing petitions against the Vietnam War.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Heidi Schumann for The New York Times Analynn LaChica smoking on a work break in San Francisco. Related Cost of Cigarette Litter May Fall on San Franciscos Smokers (May 19, 2009) “Littering is one of my pet peeves, and I always told my kids they’d be in big trouble if I catch them doing it,” said Ms. Scott, a 43-year-old financial executive, as she sat outside an office tower on Michigan Avenue in Chicago on a recent sunny afternoon. “I see people throw stuff out their car windows, and I cringe.” Yet she confesses that she routinely discards cigarette butts on the sidewalk. For her and countless other American smokers, cigarette butts are an exception to the no-littering rule. “Aren’t cigarettes biodegradable?” volunteered Libby Moustakas, a co-worker who was enjoying a smoking break with Ms. Scott. But dozens of municipalities across the nation have had enough. Weary of the butts’ unsightliness and the costs of sweeping them up, cities have passed bans on smoking on beaches and playgrounds. In San Francisco, Mayor Gavin Newsom said last week that he would go a step further, seeking a 33-cents-a-pack tax to cover the $11 million that the city spends annually to remove cigarette litter. Nationally, cigarette butts account for one-quarter or more of the items tossed onto streets and other roadways, San Francisco and other cities report. Nathan Ballard, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, described this as a predictable outcome of poor product design. “There is no good practical way of dealing with cigarettes,” he said. “You have a fiery object in your hand and so you have to throw it down and crush it under your heel. And then we have to clean it up.” In her defense, Ms. Scott, the Chicago executive, pointed out that her city does not provide enough receptacles, like concrete planters filled with sand. And she fears that throwing them in a trash can could ignite a fire. Still other smokers see butts as a more natural kind of trash than, say, a plastic bottle. But they are not biodegradable: they contain plastic filters that enter sewers and storm drains, and get swept into rivers and then out to sea, where they can release toxic chemicals including nicotine, benzene and cadmium. For years, campaigns for heavy per-pack taxes and smoking bans in office buildings, restaurants and bars were driven mainly by health concerns about secondhand smoke, which can lead to lung cancer, emphysema and other diseases. In moving on to butt litter, municipalities are reckoning with the broader environmental consequences of the country’s most vilified personal habit. Cigarette companies acknowledge the problem. The Cigarette Litter Prevention Program, created by the nonprofit group Keep America Beautiful, is financed by Philip Morris, the cigarette giant. The prevention program’s statistics show that butts constitute 28 percent to 33 percent of all litter nationwide  measured by item number, not volume. Similarly, the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, which also receives money from Philip Morris, has found that butts account for 28 percent of littered items washing up on beaches worldwide. The manufacturers say they are working on making their product more environmentally friendly. Frank Lester, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation’s second-largest cigarette maker, said the industry viewed the development of a biodegradable cigarette to be its “holy grail,” but that challenges persisted. Cigarette company documents indicate that consumers have not liked the taste or the draw of alternative filters. William R. Phelps, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said his company favored programs that hold smokers and cities responsible for reducing the trash. For example, the Keep America Beautiful campaign promotes solutions like portable ashtrays, more receptacles in public areas and better enforcement of littering laws, he said. Last year, the program had 178 cities or urban districts enlisted  the university district in Philadelphia and the arts district in Dallas, for example  that reduced cigarette littering by an average of 46 percent, officials said. That approach is favored by Analynn LaChica, 34, who works for AT&amp;T in San Francisco. Ms. LaChica estimates that of the 5 to 10 cigarettes she smokes each day, at least three butts end up on the ground. “People who smoke use it as a stress reliever,” she explained. “It is satisfying to just toss it down when you are done.” Nonetheless, she said, she would change her behavior if San Francisco installed ashtrays on top of trash receptacles. Putting it out that way would be more “ladylike,” she said. For many environmentalists, the problem is not just the litter, but the toxicity. Thomas Novotny, a professor of global health at San Diego State University who supports the San Francisco proposal and beach bans elsewhere, said recent experiments had shown that one butt has enough poisons to kill half the minnows in a liter of water  a standard laboratory test for toxins  in 96 hours. “Butts are full of poisonous substances, including nicotine, which is a pesticide,” Professor Novotny said. Some smokers are getting the message. Alex Ceruti, 32, a business owner in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, said he had always discarded his butt in an ashtray or other receptacle after finishing a cigarette. “That’s the only part of the cigarette that is not biodegradable,” he said. “I think it’s nasty the way people throw them on the ground,” Mr. Ceruti added, observing a young tattooed woman who cast her cigarette on the sidewalk before entering a coffee shop. Mr. Ceruti and his friend Marcos van Dulken, 26, who also smokes, say they even patrol their favorite beach once in a while to pick up filters. “I’m not going to lie,” said Mr. van Dulken, an actor who owns a small production company. “Sometimes I throw them on the ground. But I really try not to do that.” Karen Ann Cullotta contributed reporting from Chicago, Malia Wollan from San Francisco and Carmen Gentile Jr. from Miami Beach.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Jim Wilson/The New York Times San Francisco spends an estimated $10.7 million a year removing cigarette butts from gutters, drainpipes and sidewalks. The proposal, to be introduced next month to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, would add 33 cents to the cost of a pack of cigarettes, to offset the estimated $10.7 million the city spends annually removing discarded butts from gutters, drainpipes and sidewalks. The added cost, Mr. Newsom hopes, will also dampen smokers’ urge to light up. “In general, fees help reduce the consumption and use of tobacco,” he said in an interview. “And we think that will have a very beneficial public health component.” Officials here say the municipal fee would be the first in the country to take aim specifically at cigarette butts, particularly filters, which are not biodegradable. But the idea is expected to run into fierce opposition from tobacco companies. “Obviously we think people should follow the littering laws, in California and elsewhere,” said Frank Lester, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation’s second-largest manufacturer of cigarettes. “But we oppose any additional taxation on smokers to pay for that.” Philip Morris USA, the nation’s biggest cigarette company, generally echoed that anti-fee sentiment, though it said it would not comment on Mr. Newsom’s proposal specifically until it was formally presented to the board.

The proposal, to be introduced next month to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, would add 33 cents to the cost of a pack of cigarettes, to offset the estimated $10.7 million the city spends annually removing discarded butts from gutters, drainpipes and sidewalks. The added cost, Mr. Newsom hopes, will also dampen smokers’ urge to light up. “In general, fees help reduce the consumption and use of tobacco,” he said in an interview. “And we think that will have a very beneficial public health component.” Officials here say the municipal fee would be the first in the country to take aim specifically at cigarette butts, particularly filters, which are not biodegradable. But the idea is expected to run into fierce opposition from tobacco companies. “Obviously we think people should follow the littering laws, in California and elsewhere,” said Frank Lester, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation’s second-largest manufacturer of cigarettes. “But we oppose any additional taxation on smokers to pay for that.” Philip Morris USA, the nation’s biggest cigarette company, generally echoed that anti-fee sentiment, though it said it would not comment on Mr. Newsom’s proposal specifically until it was formally presented to the board.

Louis C. Camilleri, the chairman of Philip Morris International, noted that profits rose from a range of price increases, even as sales of cigarette units were virtually flat.

First-quarter 2009 sales increased another 6.3 percent, he said, “driven by price increases across a broad range of markets.” While many in the audience of about 200 shareholders seemed pleased with the data, about 30 dissidents in the room used the event to protest smoking’s toll.

I just really hope this can help all the thousands of families who have also suffered.” The Hess case was the first to go to trial since the Florida Supreme Court in 2006 voided a $145 billion jury award in another class-action case, the highest punitive damage award in American history. The court said each smoker’s case had to be decided individually, but let stand that jury’s findings that tobacco companies knowingly sold dangerous products and hid their risks. “We plan to challenge the verdict in the trial court and, if necessary, on appeal,” said Murray Garnick, an Altria Client Services vice president and associate general counsel. “We do not believe today’s verdict is predictive of the outcome of future cases.” The Hess case has been closely watched by the tobacco industry and by thousands of other Florida smokers and survivors who have sued. The original class-action lawsuit was filed in 1994 by a Miami Beach pediatrician, Dr. Howard Engle, who had smoked for decades and could not quit.

Skip to next paragraph The Board Blog Additional commentary, background information and other items by Times editorial writers. Go to The Board » The 5-to-4 ruling  with Justice Anthony Kennedy casting his swing vote with the court’s four most liberal members  could do a great deal to rein in deceptive advertising by cigarette manufacturers. It was a welcome departure for a court that has been far too deferential to business. We hope it signals that the justices are moving toward a more balanced approach to business cases. The case was brought by Maine residents who have smoked light cigarettes made by Philip Morris, whose parent company is Altria, for more than 15 years. They argue that Philip Morris’s contention that these cigarettes deliver less tar and nicotine to smokers than regular brands was untrue. Even though each light cigarette has less tar and nicotine than a regular cigarette, the plaintiffs say that Philip Morris knew that smokers unconsciously smoke them differently, taking larger puffs, for instance, or holding the smoke longer in their lungs to make up for the difference in the cigarettes’ strength. Because that allows them to extract the same amount of tar and nicotine as they would from regular cigarettes, the smokers argue that the company’s marketing violates the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act’s prohibition on deceptive business practices. Philip Morris, which denied that its marketing was inaccurate, argued that the smokers’ case had to be thrown out because state laws like Maine’s are pre-empted by federal cigarette regulations when they are applied to cigarette marketing. The pre-emption defense is based on the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which says that where there are conflicts between federal and state laws, federal laws must prevail. The majority opinion, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, rightly said that there is no actual conflict between federal and state law. Philip Morris argued that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, passed in 1965, wiped away the plaintiffs’ state deceptive-marketing claim. But as the majority pointed out, the labeling act  which requires health warnings on cigarette packages  was intended to prevent states from imposing their own rules relating to smoking and health. It does not pre-empt laws like Maine’s that create a general duty not to deceive consumers. The ruling, which breaks with the court’s previous major decision involving cigarettes and pre-emption, clears the way for similar lawsuits against cigarette companies to proceed in other states. Important as such litigation is for deterring false cigarette advertising, the case may have broader reverberations. In recent years, the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings  on everything from punitive damages to the criminal case against Enron’s accounting firm  that have made it harder for ordinary Americans to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable. In these troubled economic times, as the nation is still trying to come to terms with the enormous damage done by the deregulation of the mortgage industry, the national mood is turning strongly toward greater regulation. It has often been observed that the Supreme Court has a tendency to follow the election returns, and it may have done so here. With this decision, the court might be indicating a greater appreciation that when companies do wrong, there needs to be a legal means of holding them accountable.

Go to The Board » The 5-to-4 ruling  with Justice Anthony Kennedy casting his swing vote with the court’s four most liberal members  could do a great deal to rein in deceptive advertising by cigarette manufacturers. It was a welcome departure for a court that has been far too deferential to business. We hope it signals that the justices are moving toward a more balanced approach to business cases. The case was brought by Maine residents who have smoked light cigarettes made by Philip Morris, whose parent company is Altria, for more than 15 years. They argue that Philip Morris’s contention that these cigarettes deliver less tar and nicotine to smokers than regular brands was untrue. Even though each light cigarette has less tar and nicotine than a regular cigarette, the plaintiffs say that Philip Morris knew that smokers unconsciously smoke them differently, taking larger puffs, for instance, or holding the smoke longer in their lungs to make up for the difference in the cigarettes’ strength. Because that allows them to extract the same amount of tar and nicotine as they would from regular cigarettes, the smokers argue that the company’s marketing violates the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act’s prohibition on deceptive business practices. Philip Morris, which denied that its marketing was inaccurate, argued that the smokers’ case had to be thrown out because state laws like Maine’s are pre-empted by federal cigarette regulations when they are applied to cigarette marketing. The pre-emption defense is based on the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which says that where there are conflicts between federal and state laws, federal laws must prevail. The majority opinion, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, rightly said that there is no actual conflict between federal and state law. Philip Morris argued that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, passed in 1965, wiped away the plaintiffs’ state deceptive-marketing claim. But as the majority pointed out, the labeling act  which requires health warnings on cigarette packages  was intended to prevent states from imposing their own rules relating to smoking and health. It does not pre-empt laws like Maine’s that create a general duty not to deceive consumers. The ruling, which breaks with the court’s previous major decision involving cigarettes and pre-emption, clears the way for similar lawsuits against cigarette companies to proceed in other states. Important as such litigation is for deterring false cigarette advertising, the case may have broader reverberations. In recent years, the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings  on everything from punitive damages to the criminal case against Enron’s accounting firm  that have made it harder for ordinary Americans to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable. In these troubled economic times, as the nation is still trying to come to terms with the enormous damage done by the deregulation of the mortgage industry, the national mood is turning strongly toward greater regulation. It has often been observed that the Supreme Court has a tendency to follow the election returns, and it may have done so here.

Citing the long history of warnings about the dangers of smoking, Representative John D. Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said that it was hard to believe that the federal government had not yet regulated the tobacco industry. ''With this legislation, we change this,'' said Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat. The White House has signaled its opposition to the bill. And while the legislation has strong support in the Senate, which could take up the measure this fall, it is not clear whether the bill has a veto-proof majority there. The show of support in the House, which passed the bill by a vote of 326 to 102, illustrated not only the strength of antismoking sentiment in the country but the benefit of enlisting a powerful ally. The legislation was partly the result of negotiations with Philip Morris USA, the nation's largest cigarette company, which split with other companies by endorsing it. Most large public health groups supported the measure -- and its passage was applauded by groups including the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association -- but some antismoking advocates said the bargain struck with Philip Morris gave too many concessions to the industry. The bill specifically states that the F.D.A.'s new powers would stop short of the ability to order the elimination of nicotine from tobacco products or place an outright ban on all tobacco products. But the agency could reduce nicotine to nonaddictive levels if it determined that doing so would benefit public health. The F.D.A. could also require changes in tobacco products, like the reduction or elimination of other harmful ingredients. The bill bans flavored cigarettes that appeal to young people but exempts menthol from that ban. The exemption raised objections from black antismoking advocates because mentholated cigarettes are frequently chosen by black smokers. To satisfy the Congressional Black Caucus on that issue, last-minute changes were made in the bill to direct a scientific advisory committee to issue recommendations on menthol in cigarettes within one year. In a statement, Lorillard Tobacco Company, whose Newport cigarettes are the leading menthol brand, said it opposed the bill but ''welcomes the provision in this bill that calls for a scientific review of menthol in cigarettes.'' Lorillard said that scientific studies to date do not support a conclusion that menthol cigarettes are more hazardous or addictive than non-menthol cigarettes. The amendments also require the F.D.A. to publish an action plan on the advertising and promotion of menthol and other cigarettes to young people, giving priority to minority communities. The bill was opposed by many Republicans. Many said they objected to expansion of the federal bureaucracy, and complained in particular that the F.D.A. was already unable to fulfill its work overseeing pharmaceuticals and food. In floor discussion, John A. Boehner, the House minority leader, a smoker, called the legislation a ''boneheaded idea.'' ''How much is enough?'' Mr. Boehner said. ''How much government do we need? There's not a smoker in America that doesn't understand that smoking isn't good for you.'' But Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who sponsored the bill, responded, ''The minority leader said 'When is enough, enough?' Well cigarettes, one of the most dangerous products on sale today, are not regulated at all.'' The legislation would finance the F.D.A.'s tobacco supervision primarily through new fees paid by tobacco companies that are earmarked for that purpose. If the legislation is enacted, consumers would see a wholesale revamping of the warning labels on tobacco products. The small messages currently on cigarette packs warning of the negative health effects would be replaced by graphic images of the physical ravages often caused by cigarettes, such as lung tumors and mouth growths. The bill will also require cigarette makers to provide detailed disclosure about the type and quantities of ingredients in their products -- like ammonia and acetaldehyde -- which are believed to work with nicotine to increase the addictiveness of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The requirements mean that companies would be required to disclose internal research on the biological effects of those additives. Cigarette companies could no longer advertise their products as ''light'' or ''ultralight'' to convey the notion of less harmful ingredients. Some companies have anticipated those changes by packaging their products so that cigarettes packs are color-coded to denote different blends. Under the bill, any outdoor advertising of cigarettes, and advertising in publications seen by children, would have to be in black and white, to reduce their visual allure. House approval of the bill follows years of debate over whether tobacco products should be regulated. While attempts to place tobacco products under the agency's jurisdiction date back at least to the 1980s, the impetus for the current bill originates in 1995, when Dr. David A. Kessler, then F.D.A. commissioner, proposed a set of regulations governing tobacco. Dr. Kessler asserted that nicotine was an addictive drug and that tobacco companies deliberately manipulated the nicotine content of their products. Dr. Kessler had tried to impose regulations on the industry but the Supreme Court overturned them in 2000. A bill that would have placed tobacco under F.D.A. jurisdiction was passed by the Senate in 2004 but was never approved by the House. The bill that the House approved Wednesday was introduced in both chambers in 2007.

Go to The Board » Related Times Topics: Food and Drug Administration In the 1990s, the F.D.A. tried to regulate tobacco products under existing statutes, but the Supreme Court ruled that the agency had exceeded the authority granted by Congress. Now both houses are considering bills that would write the agency’s 1996 rules into law and add many other tools and powers as well. David Kessler, the former food and drug commissioner who led the regulatory battle more than a decade ago, called it “as strong a tobacco bill as we have seen in our lifetimes.” The bill pending in the House would empower the F.D.A. to regulate both the content and marketing of tobacco products. The agency could not ban tobacco products outright or eliminate all nicotine from them, but it could reduce the levels of nicotine, eliminate other harmful ingredients and set product standards to protect the public’s health. It could also restrict advertising and promotion to the extent permitted by the First Amendment. The Bush administration has opposed the bill on several grounds  none of them compelling. Its core objection is that the bill would heap new responsibilities on the F.D.A. at a time when the agency is struggling to enhance food safety and improve oversight of imported drugs, devices and foods. Of course, the reason the agency is struggling is that the administration, true to its animus against regulation, has failed to provide adequate resources during most of its tenure. The solution is to provide enough money and people to perform all vital tasks, not to duck a new one. The administration further frets that user fees imposed on the tobacco industry won’t cover all costs of the regulatory effort, thus forcing the F.D.A. to cannibalize other programs to make up the difference. But the bill now clarifies that only the designated user fees and no other F.D.A. funds can be used to regulate tobacco. The administration also contends  as do some anti-tobacco activists  that F.D.A. oversight could leave the public with the misperception that tobacco products are safe, or at least safer, with regulation. But the bill prohibits tobacco companies from implying that they have F.D.A. approval, and the agency has ample ways to remind the public that tobacco is harmful. The bill has strong support from such organizations as The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. It is supported by Philip Morris, but opposed by most of the tobacco industry. It has strong bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation needs to be passed this year by veto-proof margins in both houses, lest the reform impulse dissipate next year as a new administration and new Congress grapple with a host of complicated foreign, military and domestic issues.

The report could further inflame a controversy over menthol in pending tobacco legislation. Skip to next paragraph The study by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, released Wednesday, concludes that manufacturers have marketed brands to what it called a “vulnerable population” of adolescents and young adults by “manipulating sensory elements of cigarettes to promote initiation and dependence.” Young people, the study said, tolerate menthol cigarettes better than harsher nonmenthol cigarettes. In low-level menthol cigarettes, the menthol primarily masks harshness, making it easier to begin smoking. But as smokers become more accustomed to menthol, they prefer stronger menthol sensations, according to the study. “Tobacco companies researched how controlling menthol levels could increase brand sales among specific groups,” the study said. “They discovered that products with higher menthol levels and stronger perceived menthol sensations suited long-term smokers of menthol cigarettes, and milder brands with lower menthol levels appealed to younger smokers.” The study concludes that 44 percent of smokers age 12 to 17 prefer menthol cigarettes, and it urges regulation of the tobacco industry and menthol, in particular. Menthol cigarettes currently make up about 28 percent of the $70 billion cigarette industry in America. A spokesman for the company that owns Philip Morris, whose Marlboro menthol brands are among those cited in the study, denied Wednesday that it has adjusted menthol levels as a way to lure young smokers. But the study contends that Philip Morris used a two-pronged strategy to compete better in the menthol market, a segment of its business that had been lagging before 2000. The company introduced a low-level menthol brand, Marlboro Milds, to compete with cigarettes like Newport, which contains a low level of menthol. At the same time, the study concluded, Philip Morris raised the menthol level in its Marlboro Menthol brand by 25 percent to appeal to adult smokers. “Marlboro needed a lower-menthol product that would cater to young smokers’ sensory needs, as well as a higher-menthol cigarette for older smokers,” the study said. Since then, Philip Morris’s share of the menthol market has increased, and it is currently the second-largest seller of menthol cigarettes in the United States. A spokesman for Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, challenged both the hypothesis and the facts contained in the study. “We disagree with the conclusions that menthol levels in our products were manipulated to gain market share among adolescents,” David M. Sylvia, the Altria spokesman, said Wednesday. “We do not do research among, nor design products for, nor market to those who are underage.” The leading menthol brand is Newport, made by Lorillard. A company spokesman, Michael W. Robinson, said Wednesday that the claim that Lorillard manipulated its products for specific markets was false. “Lorillard does not control levels of menthol to promote smoking among adolescents and young adults,” Mr. Robinson’s statement said. The study, published by The American Journal of Public Health, also found various changes in menthol levels in cigarettes since 2000, which the authors contend were designed to attract specific categories of smokers. They are Lorillard’s Newport and cigarettes manufactured by R. J. Reynolds: Salem Black Label, Salem Green Label, Camel Menthol, Kool and Kool Milds. Dr. Howard Koh, an author of the study, accused the tobacco industry of pursuing “a very sophisticated strategy to lure in youth with lower menthol levels and then lock in adult customers who become acclimated to menthol and give them the higher levels they want.” In a statement, a spokesman for R. J. Reynolds said the allegations were untrue. “It would appear this report is simply an effort to push support for federal regulation of the tobacco industry, not a scientific review of the menthol category,” David P. Howard, the Reynolds spokesman, said. A bill currently pending in Congress would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products and remove cigarette additives, including menthol. But while the legislation would immediately ban many other flavorings, it specifically exempts menthol from such a ban. The issue is particularly controversial because menthol cigarettes are heavily favored by black smokers, who have high rates of smoking-related cancers. Dr. Koh, director of the division of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that his team was not calling for the outright ban of menthol that some antismoking activists have demanded. “The view of our team is that the F.D.A. bill has the authority to regulate menthol and to do it in a scientifically sound fashion in a very, very complex area,” Dr. Koh said. He said the study, begun more than two years ago, was prompted by data showing that menthol sales had not declined along with other segments of the tobacco industry. “This is an area where the industry was clearly maintaining market share, if not increasing it among certain parts of the population,” Dr. Koh said, “so we wanted to dig deeper and explore exactly the mechanism.” More Articles in Business »A new Harvard study claims that the tobacco industry in recent years has manipulated menthol levels in cigarettes to hook youngsters and maintain loyalty among smoking adults.

The study, published by The American Journal of Public Health, also found various changes in menthol levels in cigarettes since 2000, which the authors contend were designed to attract specific categories of smokers. They are Lorillard’s Newport and cigarettes manufactured by R. J. Reynolds: Salem Black Label, Salem Green Label, Camel Menthol, Kool and Kool Milds. Dr. Howard Koh, an author of the study, accused the tobacco industry of pursuing “a very sophisticated strategy to lure in youth with lower menthol levels and then lock in adult customers who become acclimated to menthol and give them the higher levels they want.” In a statement, a spokesman for R. J. Reynolds said the allegations were untrue. “It would appear this report is simply an effort to push support for federal regulation of the tobacco industry, not a scientific review of the menthol category,” David P. Howard, the Reynolds spokesman, said. A bill currently pending in Congress would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products and remove cigarette additives, including menthol. But while the legislation would immediately ban many other flavorings, it specifically exempts menthol from such a ban. The issue is particularly controversial because menthol cigarettes are heavily favored by black smokers, who have high rates of smoking-related cancers. Dr. Koh, director of the division of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that his team was not calling for the outright ban of menthol that some antismoking activists have demanded. “The view of our team is that the F.D.A. bill has the authority to regulate menthol and to do it in a scientifically sound fashion in a very, very complex area,” Dr. Koh said. He said the study, begun more than two years ago, was prompted by data showing that menthol sales had not declined along with other segments of the tobacco industry. “This is an area where the industry was clearly maintaining market share, if not increasing it among certain parts of the population,” Dr. Koh said, “so we wanted to dig deeper and explore exactly the mechanism.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/business/10bizcourt.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Justices to See Philip Morris Case a Third Time<date>Published: June 10, 2008</date><text>WASHINGTON  A staring contest between the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Oregon over a $79.5 million punitive damage award to a smoker’s widow has entered its fifth year, and so far neither side has blinked. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Dennis Cook/Associated Press Mayola Williams, whose husband died of lung cancer, won her case in Oregon, but the Supreme Court will review the award. The justices have twice vacated the award against the cigarette maker Philip Morris, once in 2003 and again last year, and the Oregon court has twice reinstated it. On Monday, the justices announced that they would review the case for a third time. The scope of their review will be deliberately narrow. Philip Morris, a unit of the Altria Group, appealed the latest Oregon Supreme Court decision on two grounds. One was that the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, nearly 100 to one, was so great as to be constitutionally impermissible. The second was that the Oregon court’s invocation of a state procedural law in its latest ruling against Philip Morris came too late in the day to be sustained and represented little more than an effort to evade the instruction the justices gave last year to reconsider the damages award. The justices denied review on the first question, which would have had broad application to all punitive damages cases. In earlier rulings, the Supreme Court has suggested that punitive damages should be no more than nine times the compensatory damages, and perhaps a good deal less than that, but there is evidently not a clear majority to convert the suggestion into a firm rule. Instead, they will hear Philip Morris’s appeal only on the second question, which applies to this convoluted case, now in its ninth postverdict year, and to no other. The justices, in other words, appeared less concerned with making law than with asserting their own authority over that of state courts on the issue of punitive damages. In its February 2007 ruling in Philip Morris USA v. Williams, the court overturned the award on the ground that the jurors might have been allowed to calculate the amount based on harm to other, unnamed smokers in addition to Jesse D. Williams, the man whose widow, Mayola Williams, brought the lawsuit. The 5-to-4 majority ordered the Oregon Supreme Court to reconsider the award and make sure it was not calculated based on harm to “nonparties.” The Oregon trial court that originally heard the case had rejected a proposed jury instruction from the cigarette maker that would have told the jurors “not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own.” In its latest ruling reinstating the $79.5 million award, the Oregon Supreme Court said the trial court had been correct to reject the proposed instruction because it was flawed as a matter of state law by including too many unrelated issues. Philip Morris’s appeal, also called Philip Morris v. Williams but with a new docket number, 07-1216, told the justices that the state court had never raised this objection in any of the previous proceedings. “The Oregon Supreme Court’s defiance of this court’s directive should not be countenanced,” the appeal said. In other action on Monday, the court held unanimously that in a racketeering suit between one company and another alleging a violation of the federal mail fraud statute, the plaintiff need not show that it actually relied on the misleading statements. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion in the case, Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co., No. 07-210, which grew out of a dispute between bidders for delinquent properties in Cook County, Ill. As it did here, the Supreme Court has generally given a broad interpretation to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News Newport is the largest selling menthol cigarette in America. Related Text of Letter to Senators on Menthol Exemption for Cigarettes (June 5, 2008) The seven, from Democratic and Republican administrations, faxed a letter to members of the Senate and House of Representatives demanding that menthol-flavored cigarettes be banned just like various other cigarette flavorings the legislation would outlaw. One of the former secretaries, Joseph A. Califano Jr., said the legislation was “clearly putting black children in the back of the bus.” He was referring to menthol cigarettes as being the choice of three out of four black smokers and being frequently preferred by young smokers. An estimated 80 percent of African-American teenage smokers pick menthol brands, the letter said. The letter reflects a growing controversy over the bill’s current exemption of menthol from a list of banned flavorings  an exemption some lawmakers said was intended to garner support from Philip Morris. The maker of Marlboro Menthol, the second-leading menthol brand after Lorillard’s Newport, Philip Morris has endorsed the bill, although most other cigarette companies oppose it. The bill would for the first time give the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco. While several groups have said the bill does not go far enough to regulate the tobacco industry and fails to promote safer tobacco products, most major public health advocacy groups have endorsed it. Some antismoking advocates have said they see the menthol exemption as a necessary compromise toward getting the legislation passed, and they have said that the bill as currently drafted would give the F.D.A. the authority to limit or eliminate additives, including menthol, if they are proved to be harmful. As now written the legislation would ban cigarettes flavored with strawberry, chocolate and a number of other fruit, candy and spice flavorings. Those flavorings have occasionally been added to cigarettes in what critics say are a lure to children. But the bill specifically protects menthol from the ban, even though menthol is the most widely used flavoring. Menthol brands account for 28 percent of the $70 billion American cigarette market. The bill has cleared key committees in both the Senate and the House but it is not yet scheduled for floor votes. Responding to the letter from the former secretaries, the bill’s House sponsor, Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said Wednesday that he believes an outright ban on menthol is not the best way to address it. “I’m determined to see tobacco legislation pass Congress that protects all our children,” Mr. Waxman said. “Leading public health experts have told us that giving F.D.A. the authority to ban menthol is the best way to balance both public health considerations with the reality that many adults only smoke menthol cigarettes. I’ll continue our ongoing review to make sure we are dealing with this issue in the most effective way possible." Menthol is derived from mint and is also available synthetically. Smoking menthol-flavored cigarettes gives the mouth a cool feeling, similar to sucking on a peppermint, and can help mask the harsh taste of tobacco. The bill’s treatment of menthol “caves to the financial interests of tobacco companies and discriminates against African-Americans  the segment of our population at greatest risk for the killing and crippling smoking-related diseases,” the letter from the former secretaries said. “It sends a message that African American youngsters are valued less than white youngsters.” Mr. Califano said that even though the bill gives the F.D.A. the authority to remove additives it would require a lengthy process that “could go on and on and on, and you’re talking about years before you get through the administrative process and the courts.” Mr. Califano, who served as health secretary under President Jimmy Carter, said the idea to send the letter began when Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the health secretary during the administration of President George H. W. Bush, called him to complain about the bill’s treatment of menthol. “We both got our blood boiling,” Mr. Califano said in a telephone interview. They also decided to contact other past health secretaries. Five of them were reached and all agreed to sign onto the letter, according to Mr. Califano, who now runs the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. They are Tommy G. Thompson, who was a health secretary under the current President Bush; Donna E. Shalala, from the Clinton administration; Richard S. Schweicker and Dr. Otis R. Bowen, from the Reagan administration; and F. David Matthews from the Ford administration. In a telephone interview, Dr. Sullivan, the president emeritus of Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, said, “My issue is that menthol should not be added because it’s added as an inducement, an enabler, to induce young people to smoke.” In 1990, Dr. Sullivan was instrumental in pressuring R. J. Reynolds not to market its Uptown cigarette, a menthol brand intended to appeal to black smokers. In addition to the former secretaries, two other people signed the letter. They were Dr. Julius B. Richmond, who served as surgeon general in the Carter administration, and William S. Robinson, the executive director of the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network, a nonprofit organization in Durham, N.C. Mr. Robinson’s organization said last week that it was withdrawing its support from the bill because of the menthol exemption.

But not at Virginia Commonwealth University, a public institution in Richmond, Va. That is largely because hardly any faculty members or students there know that there is something to debate  a contract with extremely restrictive terms that the university signed in 2006 to do research for Philip Morris USA, the nation’s largest tobacco company and a unit of Altria Group. The contract bars professors from publishing the results of their studies, or even talking about them, without Philip Morris’s permission. If “a third party,” including news organizations, asks about the agreement, university officials have to decline to comment and tell the company. Nearly all patent and other intellectual property rights go to the company, not the university or its professors. “There is restrictive language in here,” said Francis L. Macrina, Virginia Commonwealth’s vice president for research, who acknowledged that many of the provisions violated the university’s guidelines for industry-sponsored research. “In the end, it was language we thought we could agree to. It’s a balancing act.” But the contract, a copy of which The New York Times obtained under the Virginia Freedom of Information law, is highly unusual and raises questions about how far universities will go in search of scarce research dollars to enhance their standing. It also brings a new dimension to the already divisive debate on many campuses over whether it is appropriate for universities to accept tobacco money for research. Dr. Macrina would not specify how much money Philip Morris gave for the restricted research. Historically, the company has not been a major contributor to the university. Last year, it gave $1.3 million in research grants that included the restricted contract and a more traditional independent grant, Dr. Macrina said. Over all last year, Virginia Commonwealth, with nearly 32,000 students, received $227 million in research grants from government and private sources, a sum dwarfed by the amounts the nation’s largest research universities take in. For example, the University of Washington received $1 billion in grants last year, while Johns Hopkins got $1.4 billion in federal money alone. Philip Morris, based in Richmond, is a likely source for Virginia Commonwealth in its hunt for dollars from a finite number of corporations. Among tobacco companies, Philip Morris is the leader in investing in academic research. And for Virginia Commonwealth, expanding ties with its neighbor could produce other benefits like additional grants and support for other university functions. About a dozen researchers and research ethicists from other universities were astonished at the restrictions in the contract, when they were told about it. “When universities sign contracts with these covenants, they are basically giving up their ethos, compromising their values as a university,” said Sheldon Krimsky, a professor at Tufts University who is an expert on corporate influence on medical research. “There should be no debate about having a sponsor with control over the publishing of results.” Stanton A. Glantz, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine who has lobbied for banning tobacco money on campuses, said, “University administrators who are desperate for money will basically do anything they have to for money.” Although Dr. Macrina would not discuss many details of the research, Philip Morris officials were less reticent. Rick Solana, the senior vice president for research and technology, said university scientists were studying how to identify early warning signs of pulmonary disease, and how to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus drained into rivers from processing tobacco leaves. Dr. Solana also said the contract represented a new focus on developing tobacco products with reduced risks, a shift in strategy in underwriting university research that requires more confidentiality to protect the corporation’s intellectual property rights. And he said Philip Morris had similar arrangements with other universities  although he declined to say how many or which ones. About 15 public health and medical schools no longer accept donations from the tobacco industry, and many major research universities continue to do so only if guaranteed independence to carry out the research and publish the results. The business school at the University of Texas at Austin decided in December to stop accepting tobacco money. The University of California system tightened its oversight of tobacco-financed research last fall, after rejecting a proposal for a ban. Virginia Commonwealth’s president, Eugene P. Trani, declined to be interviewed. But Dr. Macrina defended the contract, saying it struck a reasonable balance between the university’s need for openness and Philip Morris’s need for confidentiality, even though it violated Virginia Commonwealth’s own rules. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US »On campuses nationwide, professors and administrators have passionately debated whether their universities should accept money for research from tobacco companies.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show The Marketing of Menthol Related A Flavoring Seen as a Means of Marketing to Blacks (May 13, 2008) The legislation, which would give the Food and Drug Administration the power to oversee tobacco products, would try to reduce smoking’s allure to young people by banning most flavored cigarettes, including clove and cinnamon. But those new strictures would exempt menthol  even though menthol masks the harsh taste of cigarettes for beginners and may make it harder for the addicted to kick the smoking habit. For years, public health authorities have worried that menthol might be a factor in high cancer rates in African-Americans. The reason menthol is seen as politically off limits, despite those concerns, is that mentholated brands are so crucial to the American cigarette industry. They make up more than one-fourth of the $70 billion American cigarette market and are becoming increasingly important to the industry leader, Philip Morris USA, without whose lobbying support the legislation might have no chance of passage. “I would have been in favor of banning menthol,” said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who supports the bill. “But as a practical matter that simply wasn’t doable.” Even the head of the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network, a nonprofit group that has been adamantly against menthol, acknowledges that the ingredient needed to be off the bargaining table  for now  because he does not want to imperil the bill’s chances. “The bottom line is we want the legislation,” said William S. Robinson, the group’s executive director. “But we want to reserve the right to address this issue at some critical point because of the percentage of people of African descent who use mentholated products.” Supporters of the tobacco legislation, including the Senate bill’s sponsor, Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, say the bill addresses the potential health risks of menthol by giving the F.D.A. the authority to remove cigarette additives, including menthol, if they are proved harmful. Menthol is particularly controversial because public health authorities have worried about its health effects on African-Americans. Nearly 75 percent of black smokers use menthol brands, compared with only about one in four white smokers. That is why one former public health official says the legislation’s menthol exemption is a “cave-in to the industry,” an opinion shared by some other public health advocates. “I think we can say definitively that menthol induces smoking in the African-American community and subsequently serves as a direct link to African-American death and disease,” said the former official, Robert G. Robinson, who retired two years ago as an associate director in the office of smoking and health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current lead scientist on tobacco related issues for the C.D.C, Terry F. Pechacek, said the legislation’s exemption for menthol was an issue being discussed in the scientific community. "I would just say this is an area of clear scientific interest and it merits very careful attention." The legislation could soon be up for vote in both chambers of Congress, where it has broad support. It is by no means a sure bet  though not because of the menthol exemption. Despite the support of Mr. Kennedy and 56 co-sponsors in the Senate, the legislation faces some determined opposition from tobacco-state lawmakers who resist industry regulation. And the White House has said it opposes the legislation, arguing that F.D.A. regulation could create the false impression that tobacco is safe. The legislation is largely a result of negotiations during sessions in 2003 and 2004 between lawmakers, antismoking groups and Philip Morris  the only major American cigarette company that supports the effort to regulate the industry. “My recollection is that we were able to eliminate the use of flavored cigarettes, strawberry, mocha, and all this stuff that is clearly targeted at young kids and to start them smoking tobacco,” Mike DeWine, the former Ohio senator who helped arrange a series of negotiations between Philip Morris and an influential antismoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a recent telephone interview. “Where the compromise was made as I recall was on menthol,” Mr. DeWine said. While Philip Morris and other tobacco companies acknowledge the health hazards of smoking, they contend that menthol does nothing to worsen those risks. One of the government’s current top public health scientists on tobacco, however, says there are few definitive answers about the health impact of menthol cigarettes. Still, he points to several studies that suggest menthol smokers may be exposed to higher levels of dangerous compounds than nonmenthol smokers. “There are multiple lines of evidence, generally consistent, suggesting that there’s reason for concern,” said Dr. Pechacek, the associate science director of the office on smoking for the C.D.C. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Some public health experts are questioning why menthol, the most widely used cigarette flavoring and the most popular cigarette choice of African-American smokers, is receiving special protection as Congress tries to regulate tobacco for the first time.

But those new strictures would exempt menthol  even though menthol masks the harsh taste of cigarettes for beginners and may make it harder for the addicted to kick the smoking habit.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News Newport is the largest selling menthol cigarette in America. Related Text of Letter to Senators on Menthol Exemption for Cigarettes (June 5, 2008) The seven, from Democratic and Republican administrations, faxed a letter to members of the Senate and House of Representatives demanding that menthol-flavored cigarettes be banned just like various other cigarette flavorings the legislation would outlaw. One of the former secretaries, Joseph A. Califano Jr., said the legislation was “clearly putting black children in the back of the bus.” He was referring to menthol cigarettes as being the choice of three out of four black smokers and being frequently preferred by young smokers. An estimated 80 percent of African-American teenage smokers pick menthol brands, the letter said. The letter reflects a growing controversy over the bill’s current exemption of menthol from a list of banned flavorings  an exemption some lawmakers said was intended to garner support from Philip Morris. The maker of Marlboro Menthol, the second-leading menthol brand after Lorillard’s Newport, Philip Morris has endorsed the bill, although most other cigarette companies oppose it. The bill would for the first time give the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco. While several groups have said the bill does not go far enough to regulate the tobacco industry and fails to promote safer tobacco products, most major public health advocacy groups have endorsed it. Some antismoking advocates have said they see the menthol exemption as a necessary compromise toward getting the legislation passed, and they have said that the bill as currently drafted would give the F.D.A. the authority to limit or eliminate additives, including menthol, if they are proved to be harmful. As now written the legislation would ban cigarettes flavored with strawberry, chocolate and a number of other fruit, candy and spice flavorings. Those flavorings have occasionally been added to cigarettes in what critics say are a lure to children. But the bill specifically protects menthol from the ban, even though menthol is the most widely used flavoring. Menthol brands account for 28 percent of the $70 billion American cigarette market. The bill has cleared key committees in both the Senate and the House but it is not yet scheduled for floor votes. Responding to the letter from the former secretaries, the bill’s House sponsor, Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said Wednesday that he believes an outright ban on menthol is not the best way to address it. “I’m determined to see tobacco legislation pass Congress that protects all our children,” Mr. Waxman said. “Leading public health experts have told us that giving F.D.A. the authority to ban menthol is the best way to balance both public health considerations with the reality that many adults only smoke menthol cigarettes. I’ll continue our ongoing review to make sure we are dealing with this issue in the most effective way possible." Menthol is derived from mint and is also available synthetically. Smoking menthol-flavored cigarettes gives the mouth a cool feeling, similar to sucking on a peppermint, and can help mask the harsh taste of tobacco. The bill’s treatment of menthol “caves to the financial interests of tobacco companies and discriminates against African-Americans  the segment of our population at greatest risk for the killing and crippling smoking-related diseases,” the letter from the former secretaries said. “It sends a message that African American youngsters are valued less than white youngsters.” Mr. Califano said that even though the bill gives the F.D.A. the authority to remove additives it would require a lengthy process that “could go on and on and on, and you’re talking about years before you get through the administrative process and the courts.” Mr. Califano, who served as health secretary under President Jimmy Carter, said the idea to send the letter began when Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the health secretary during the administration of President George H. W. Bush, called him to complain about the bill’s treatment of menthol. “We both got our blood boiling,” Mr. Califano said in a telephone interview. They also decided to contact other past health secretaries. Five of them were reached and all agreed to sign onto the letter, according to Mr. Califano, who now runs the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. They are Tommy G. Thompson, who was a health secretary under the current President Bush; Donna E. Shalala, from the Clinton administration; Richard S. Schweicker and Dr. Otis R. Bowen, from the Reagan administration; and F. David Matthews from the Ford administration. In a telephone interview, Dr. Sullivan, the president emeritus of Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, said, “My issue is that menthol should not be added because it’s added as an inducement, an enabler, to induce young people to smoke.” In 1990, Dr. Sullivan was instrumental in pressuring R. J. Reynolds not to market its Uptown cigarette, a menthol brand intended to appeal to black smokers. In addition to the former secretaries, two other people signed the letter. They were Dr. Julius B. Richmond, who served as surgeon general in the Carter administration, and William S. Robinson, the executive director of the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network, a nonprofit organization in Durham, N.C. Mr. Robinson’s organization said last week that it was withdrawing its support from the bill because of the menthol exemption.

But not at Virginia Commonwealth University, a public institution in Richmond, Va. That is largely because hardly any faculty members or students there know that there is something to debate  a contract with extremely restrictive terms that the university signed in 2006 to do research for Philip Morris USA, the nation’s largest tobacco company and a unit of Altria Group. The contract bars professors from publishing the results of their studies, or even talking about them, without Philip Morris’s permission. If “a third party,” including news organizations, asks about the agreement, university officials have to decline to comment and tell the company. Nearly all patent and other intellectual property rights go to the company, not the university or its professors. “There is restrictive language in here,” said Francis L. Macrina, Virginia Commonwealth’s vice president for research, who acknowledged that many of the provisions violated the university’s guidelines for industry-sponsored research. “In the end, it was language we thought we could agree to. It’s a balancing act.” But the contract, a copy of which The New York Times obtained under the Virginia Freedom of Information law, is highly unusual and raises questions about how far universities will go in search of scarce research dollars to enhance their standing. It also brings a new dimension to the already divisive debate on many campuses over whether it is appropriate for universities to accept tobacco money for research. Dr. Macrina would not specify how much money Philip Morris gave for the restricted research. Historically, the company has not been a major contributor to the university. Last year, it gave $1.3 million in research grants that included the restricted contract and a more traditional independent grant, Dr. Macrina said. Over all last year, Virginia Commonwealth, with nearly 32,000 students, received $227 million in research grants from government and private sources, a sum dwarfed by the amounts the nation’s largest research universities take in. For example, the University of Washington received $1 billion in grants last year, while Johns Hopkins got $1.4 billion in federal money alone. Philip Morris, based in Richmond, is a likely source for Virginia Commonwealth in its hunt for dollars from a finite number of corporations. Among tobacco companies, Philip Morris is the leader in investing in academic research. And for Virginia Commonwealth, expanding ties with its neighbor could produce other benefits like additional grants and support for other university functions. About a dozen researchers and research ethicists from other universities were astonished at the restrictions in the contract, when they were told about it. “When universities sign contracts with these covenants, they are basically giving up their ethos, compromising their values as a university,” said Sheldon Krimsky, a professor at Tufts University who is an expert on corporate influence on medical research. “There should be no debate about having a sponsor with control over the publishing of results.” Stanton A. Glantz, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine who has lobbied for banning tobacco money on campuses, said, “University administrators who are desperate for money will basically do anything they have to for money.” Although Dr. Macrina would not discuss many details of the research, Philip Morris officials were less reticent. Rick Solana, the senior vice president for research and technology, said university scientists were studying how to identify early warning signs of pulmonary disease, and how to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus drained into rivers from processing tobacco leaves. Dr. Solana also said the contract represented a new focus on developing tobacco products with reduced risks, a shift in strategy in underwriting university research that requires more confidentiality to protect the corporation’s intellectual property rights. And he said Philip Morris had similar arrangements with other universities  although he declined to say how many or which ones. About 15 public health and medical schools no longer accept donations from the tobacco industry, and many major research universities continue to do so only if guaranteed independence to carry out the research and publish the results. The business school at the University of Texas at Austin decided in December to stop accepting tobacco money. The University of California system tightened its oversight of tobacco-financed research last fall, after rejecting a proposal for a ban. Virginia Commonwealth’s president, Eugene P. Trani, declined to be interviewed. But Dr. Macrina defended the contract, saying it struck a reasonable balance between the university’s need for openness and Philip Morris’s need for confidentiality, even though it violated Virginia Commonwealth’s own rules. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US »On campuses nationwide, professors and administrators have passionately debated whether their universities should accept money for research from tobacco companies.

But Dr. Macrina defended the contract, saying it struck a reasonable balance between the university’s need for openness and Philip Morris’s need for confidentiality, even though it violated Virginia Commonwealth’s own rules. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/business/13menthol.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Cigarette Bill Treats Menthol With Leniency<date>Published: May 13, 2008</date><text>Some public health experts are questioning why menthol, the most widely used cigarette flavoring and the most popular cigarette choice of African-American smokers, is receiving special protection as Congress tries to regulate tobacco for the first time. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show The Marketing of Menthol Related A Flavoring Seen as a Means of Marketing to Blacks (May 13, 2008) The legislation, which would give the Food and Drug Administration the power to oversee tobacco products, would try to reduce smoking’s allure to young people by banning most flavored cigarettes, including clove and cinnamon. But those new strictures would exempt menthol  even though menthol masks the harsh taste of cigarettes for beginners and may make it harder for the addicted to kick the smoking habit. For years, public health authorities have worried that menthol might be a factor in high cancer rates in African-Americans. The reason menthol is seen as politically off limits, despite those concerns, is that mentholated brands are so crucial to the American cigarette industry. They make up more than one-fourth of the $70 billion American cigarette market and are becoming increasingly important to the industry leader, Philip Morris USA, without whose lobbying support the legislation might have no chance of passage. “I would have been in favor of banning menthol,” said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who supports the bill. “But as a practical matter that simply wasn’t doable.” Even the head of the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network, a nonprofit group that has been adamantly against menthol, acknowledges that the ingredient needed to be off the bargaining table  for now  because he does not want to imperil the bill’s chances. “The bottom line is we want the legislation,” said William S. Robinson, the group’s executive director. “But we want to reserve the right to address this issue at some critical point because of the percentage of people of African descent who use mentholated products.” Supporters of the tobacco legislation, including the Senate bill’s sponsor, Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, say the bill addresses the potential health risks of menthol by giving the F.D.A. the authority to remove cigarette additives, including menthol, if they are proved harmful. Menthol is particularly controversial because public health authorities have worried about its health effects on African-Americans. Nearly 75 percent of black smokers use menthol brands, compared with only about one in four white smokers. That is why one former public health official says the legislation’s menthol exemption is a “cave-in to the industry,” an opinion shared by some other public health advocates. “I think we can say definitively that menthol induces smoking in the African-American community and subsequently serves as a direct link to African-American death and disease,” said the former official, Robert G. Robinson, who retired two years ago as an associate director in the office of smoking and health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current lead scientist on tobacco related issues for the C.D.C, Terry F. Pechacek, said the legislation’s exemption for menthol was an issue being discussed in the scientific community. "I would just say this is an area of clear scientific interest and it merits very careful attention." The legislation could soon be up for vote in both chambers of Congress, where it has broad support. It is by no means a sure bet  though not because of the menthol exemption. Despite the support of Mr. Kennedy and 56 co-sponsors in the Senate, the legislation faces some determined opposition from tobacco-state lawmakers who resist industry regulation. And the White House has said it opposes the legislation, arguing that F.D.A. regulation could create the false impression that tobacco is safe. The legislation is largely a result of negotiations during sessions in 2003 and 2004 between lawmakers, antismoking groups and Philip Morris  the only major American cigarette company that supports the effort to regulate the industry. “My recollection is that we were able to eliminate the use of flavored cigarettes, strawberry, mocha, and all this stuff that is clearly targeted at young kids and to start them smoking tobacco,” Mike DeWine, the former Ohio senator who helped arrange a series of negotiations between Philip Morris and an influential antismoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a recent telephone interview. “Where the compromise was made as I recall was on menthol,” Mr. DeWine said. While Philip Morris and other tobacco companies acknowledge the health hazards of smoking, they contend that menthol does nothing to worsen those risks. One of the government’s current top public health scientists on tobacco, however, says there are few definitive answers about the health impact of menthol cigarettes. Still, he points to several studies that suggest menthol smokers may be exposed to higher levels of dangerous compounds than nonmenthol smokers. “There are multiple lines of evidence, generally consistent, suggesting that there’s reason for concern,” said Dr. Pechacek, the associate science director of the office on smoking for the C.D.C. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Some public health experts are questioning why menthol, the most widely used cigarette flavoring and the most popular cigarette choice of African-American smokers, is receiving special protection as Congress tries to regulate tobacco for the first time.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Altria Group Inc. U.S. Court of Appeals Decision (pdf) Plaintiffs’ lawyers wanted to represent millions of people across the country who had smoked light cigarettes. But the court, saying it was impossible to generalize about why smokers chose light cigarettes, ruled that the group could not be treated as a class. Instead, smokers wanting to sue over the issue would have to do so individually. There might be various reasons for a smoker to choose a light brand other than “the belief that lights were a healthier alternative,” the ruling said. Other possibilities are that a lights smoker “was unaware of that representation, preferred the taste of lights, or chose lights as an expression of personal style.” Even though the ruling had been generally expected, and tobacco company stocks were little affected by the decision, analysts still viewed it as positive for the industry. Several experts said the ruling, the latest in a string of industry victories in cases involving light cigarettes, relieved the tobacco industry of potentially billions in damages and could also deter other similar class-action lawsuits around the country. “It may be persuasive to judges around the country who might well be watching it,” said Carl W. Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. The decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a ruling in September 2006 by a federal district judge, Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, that certified the suit as a class action. Judge Weinstein’s ruling represented the first time that a so-called lights case received class-action certification in federal court. At the time, the ruling was viewed as potentially opening the door to a major legal threat against the industry, exposing cigarette companies to large damages for their marketing of light cigarettes. Yet, as a number of such lawsuits have been filed in state courts around the country, plaintiffs so far have had little success. One Illinois case, in which plaintiffs initially won a $10 billion judgment, was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. More than a half-dozen such state cases are currently in legal limbo, awaiting a United States Supreme Court decision in a Maine case involving light cigarettes. The issue in those cases involves federal pre-emption, whether the fact that the Federal Trade Commission allowed marketing of cigarettes as light would bar legal action against tobacco companies on that count. Clifford E. Douglas, the executive director of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network, said there was generally a high “win rate” in cases against the tobacco industry, but not when it came to class actions. “Some courts have been very sympathetic, but many have had problems with the individualized nature of smoking and smoking-related injuries,” Mr. Douglas said. Mr. Douglas, a lawyer who has been involved in litigation against the tobacco industry, said the ruling illustrates that the courts are a poor surrogate for government regulation when it comes to holding the industry accountable. “I think this underscores the need to combat the light cigarette scam in the public policy arena,” Mr. Douglas said, citing a bill in Congress that would give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco. The bill would ban the use of terms like light and low-tar in marketing such cigarettes, which contain the same tobacco as other cigarettes but have filters that allow more air to mix with the smoke, diluting it. Unlike most tobacco lawsuits, the Brooklyn federal case did not contend that smokers’ health was injured by the cigarettes. Instead it claimed that consumers had been subjected to an economic fraud since 1971, when Philip Morris began selling Marlboro Lights, the first light cigarette. The lawsuit claimed that if smokers had known that light cigarettes were no healthier than other cigarettes, the cigarettes would have been cheaper. But the appeals court ruled that even after disclosures by the National Cancer Institute in 2001 that light cigarettes were no healthier than others, smokers continued to smoke them. That included three of the six named plaintiffs in the case, the court said. “Given the lack of an appreciable drop in the demand or price of light cigarettes after the truth about lights was revealed,” the ruling said, “plaintiffs’ argument that defendants’ misrepresentation caused the market to shift and the price of lights to be inflated fails as a matter of law.” Theodore M. Grossman, the lawyer who argued the case in July on behalf of tobacco companies, said the ruling could have implications in other class-action cases across the country involving light cigarettes. “One of the central points of the opinion was that the reasons that people bought light cigarettes were highly individual and that this kind of case can’t be resolved in a class context,” said Mr. Grossman, a partner at Jones Day who represented the R. J. Reynolds unit of Reynolds American. The lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, Michael D. Hausfeld, said he was saddened by the ruling. “We have options and we have to evaluate them,” Mr. Hausfeld said. Among them are asking for a rehearing by the entire appeals court, appealing to the United States Supreme Court or pursuing the cases individually. The Supreme Court infrequently reviews cases involving questions of whether class actions should be allowed, however. While the ruling does not preclude individual lawsuits, the small compensation each person could collect under the theory of the case  which would be calculated based on economic losses from smoking light cigarettes, and damages  could make such lawsuits financially untenable for plaintiffs’ lawyers. “I can’t imagine that individual cases will go forward; they’re just too expensive,” said Mr. Tobias, who teaches product liability law. In a note to investors, a tobacco industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, Judy E. Hong, said that the ruling “should continue to increase investors’ confidence about the legal environment and allow the cigarette companies to have more balance-sheet flexibility.” Besides Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds, tobacco companies that market light cigarettes include the Lorillard Tobacco unit of the Loews Corporation, whose brands include Newport. Shares of the Altria Group, which owns Philip Morris USA, the marketer of Marlboro cigarettes in this country, closed down 7 cents, at $22.01, Thursday. Stock in Reynolds American, whose R. J. Reynolds Tobacco unit markets the Camel brand, was up 29 cents, closing at $60.

The legislation cleared by a House panel on Wednesday focused on regulatory authority, labeling and health and marketing claims. Related Reynolds Ads Say Tobacco Oversight Is Burden F.D.A. Doesnt Need (April 2, 2008) The bill is meant to severely curtail tobacco marketing, to emphasize health warnings on tobacco products, to ban many flavored cigarettes, and to prohibit labeling of cigarettes as “light” or “low tar.” Dozens of health groups have supported the bill as potentially life-saving. But despite broad support in both the House and the Senate, where a similar proposal cleared a committee in July, the legislation faces formidable obstacles. The Bush administration and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have indicated their opposition. In a statement shortly after the vote, a White House spokeswoman, Emily A. Lawrimore, said the administration thought that the legislation would do more harm than good, creating a false impression that regulated tobacco products were safe. “The administration believes that tobacco is not a drug or device to be regulated by the F.D.A.,” Ms. Lawrimore said. A spokesman for Senator McConnell noted that he had said he would review the bill. Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, has reportedly threatened to filibuster the legislation if it reaches a vote on the Senate floor. In a statement Wednesday, shortly after the House committee vote, Mr. Burr said he remained opposed to the legislation, in part, he said, because it would strain an already burdened agency. The bill is also running up against an abbreviated election-year legislative schedule. The House committee approved the bill 38 to 12, with much of the opposition from Republicans who argued that the F.D.A. was already overwhelmed and could not handle regulating another industry. That position has recently been articulated in an advertising campaign by Reynolds American, the tobacco company that sells Camel cigarettes and other brands. But Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who sponsored the bill, said such arguments were “clearly red herrings from those who are fundamentally opposed to regulating tobacco at all.” And Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the Commerce Committee chairman, said he was separately working on legislation to “clean up this mess at Food and Drug, and we plan to do it with all vigor and enthusiasm.” The tobacco bill has been endorsed by the cigarette maker Philip Morris, and some people have criticized it as a compromise that does not go far enough. For example, it prohibits the F.D.A. from raising the legal age for buying cigarettes beyond the current level of 18. And while the bill prohibits the sale of candy-flavored cigarettes  which account for less than 1 percent of the market  it allows the continued sale of popular menthol cigarettes. One menthol brand, Newport, marketed by Lorillard Tobacco, is the nation’s second-leading cigarette, after the Philip Morris brand Marlboro. Lorillard has not yet taken a position on the legislation, a spokesman said. Representative Mike Ferguson, Republican of New Jersey, offered an amendment that would have prohibited menthol flavoring. “I think it’s inconsistent to say we want to protect kids from flavored cigarettes, ” Mr. Ferguson said, “but then we have a provision in the bill that allows menthol cigarettes.” Mr. Dingell acknowledged that the legislation was not ideal. “In a perfect world, we’d ban all cigarettes,” he said. “But the hard fact of the matter is that there are a lot of jobs depending on this. And more importantly, there are a lot of people out there who are addicted to this, and they’ve got to have their fix.” Antismoking groups have sought regulation of the tobacco industry for years. In 1995, a former F.D.A. commissioner, David A. Kessler, drafted regulations declaring nicotine a drug and cigarettes a drug delivery device subject to F.D.A. authority, but these were struck down by federal courts. The Senate approved a proposal in 2004, but the House has never voted on one. Within minutes of Wednesday’s action, statements supporting the committee’s vote were issued by supporters including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who sponsored the Senate version of the bill; the American Academy of Pediatrics; and the American Cancer Society. Although the White House had expressed its opposition, it has not yet threatened to veto the legislation. In testimony last fall, Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the current F.D.A. commissioner, indicated the Bush administration’s reluctance to embrace a new regulatory role, citing wide efforts already begun by both state and federal agencies to reduce tobacco use. The bill would create a center within the F.D.A specifically for tobacco regulation financed by industry fees projected to exceed $5 billion over the next 10 years. It would also require disclosure of the contents of tobacco-based products and set standards that would require removal or reduction of harmful ingredients; require that the findings of industry research be made public; prohibit companies from making health claims about tobacco products, and require larger and more effective warning labels.

The bill would create a center within the F.D.A specifically for tobacco regulation financed by industry fees projected to exceed $5 billion over the next 10 years. It would also require disclosure of the contents of tobacco-based products and set standards that would require removal or reduction of harmful ingredients; require that the findings of industry research be made public; prohibit companies from making health claims about tobacco products, and require larger and more effective warning labels.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16supreme-t.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Supreme Court Inc.<date>Correction: May 18, 2008Published: March 16, 2008</date><text>Correction Appended Skip to next paragraph Related Letters: Supreme Court Inc.

The headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, located across from Lafayette Park in Washington, is a limestone structure that looks almost as majestic as the Supreme Court. The similarity is no coincidence: both buildings were designed by the same architect, Cass Gilbert. Lately, however, the affinities between the court and the chamber, a lavishly financed business-advocacy organization, seem to be more than just architectural. The Supreme Court term that ended last June was, by all measures, exceptionally good for American business. The chamber’s litigation center filed briefs in 15 cases and its side won in 13 of them  the highest percentage of victories in the center’s 30-year history. The current term, which ends this summer, has also been shaping up nicely for business interests. I visited the chamber recently to talk with Robin Conrad, who heads the litigation effort, about her recent triumphs. Conrad, an appealing, soft-spoken woman, lives with her family on a horse farm in Maryland, where she rides with a fox-chasing club called the Howard County-Iron Bridge Hounds. Her office, playfully adorned by action figures of women like Xena the Warrior Princess and Hillary Rodham Clinton, has one of the most impressive views in Washington. “You can see the White House through the trees,” she said as we peered through a window overlooking the park. “In the old days, you could actually see people bathing in the fountain. Homeless people.” Conrad was in an understandably cheerful mood. Though the current Supreme Court has a well-earned reputation for divisiveness, it has been surprisingly united in cases affecting business interests. Of the 30 business cases last term, 22 were decided unanimously, or with only one or two dissenting votes. Conrad said she was especially pleased that several of the most important decisions were written by liberal justices, speaking for liberal and conservative colleagues alike. In opinions last term, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and David Souter each went out of his or her way to question the use of lawsuits to challenge corporate wrongdoing  a strategy championed by progressive groups like Public Citizen but routinely denounced by conservatives as “regulation by litigation.” Conrad reeled off some of her favorite moments: “Justice Ginsburg talked about how ‘private-securities fraud actions, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively.’ Justice Breyer had a wonderful quote about how Congress was trying to ‘weed out unmeritorious securities lawsuits.’ Justice Souter talked about how the threat of litigation ‘will push cost-conscious defendants to settle.’ ” Examples like these point to an ideological sea change on the Supreme Court. A generation ago, progressive and consumer groups petitioning the court could count on favorable majority opinions written by justices who viewed big business with skepticism  or even outright prejudice. An economic populist like William O. Douglas, the former New Deal crusader who served on the court from 1939 to 1975, once unapologetically announced that he was “ready to bend the law in favor of the environment and against the corporations.” Today, however, there are no economic populists on the court, even on the liberal wing. And ever since John Roberts was appointed chief justice in 2005, the court has seemed only more receptive to business concerns. Forty percent of the cases the court heard last term involved business interests, up from around 30 percent in recent years. While the Rehnquist Court heard less than one antitrust decision a year, on average, between 1988 and 2003, the Roberts Court has heard seven in its first two terms  and all of them were decided in favor of the corporate defendants. Business cases at the Supreme Court typically receive less attention than cases concerning issues like affirmative action, abortion or the death penalty. The disputes tend to be harder to follow: the legal arguments are more technical, the underlying stories less emotional. But these cases  which include shareholder suits, antitrust challenges to corporate mergers, patent disputes and efforts to reduce punitive-damage awards and prevent product-liability suits  are no less important. They involve billions of dollars, have huge consequences for the economy and can have a greater effect on people’s daily lives than the often symbolic battles of the culture wars. In the current Supreme Court term, the justices have already blocked a liability suit against Medtronic, the manufacturer of a heart catheter, and rejected a type of shareholder suit that includes a claim against Enron. In the coming months, the court will decide whether to reduce the largest punitive-damage award in American history, which resulted from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. What should we make of the Supreme Court’s transformation? Throughout its history, the court has tended to issue opinions, in areas from free speech to gender equality, that reflect or consolidate a social consensus. With their pro-business jurisprudence, the justices may be capturing an emerging spirit of agreement among liberal and conservative elites about the value of free markets. Among the professional classes, many Democrats and Republicans, whatever their other disagreements, have come to share a relatively laissez-faire, technocratic vision of the economy and are suspicious of excessive regulation and reflexive efforts to vilify big business. Judges, lawyers and law professors (such as myself) drilled in cost-benefit analysis over the past three decades, are no exception.

So the school decided two months ago to draw a line, and refuse all tobacco money for student groups, as well as for faculty research. “What it came down to for us was the ethical dimension,” said George W. Gau, dean of the Texas school, the McCombs School of Business. “The leadership of the school felt that in some sense it was tainted money, that it is money gotten from a product that is significantly harming people.” Across academia, universities and graduate schools are wrestling with whether to accept financing from tobacco companies for research or student activities. In the past few years, 15 public health and medical schools have turned away donations from the industry; McCombs’ move was unusual because of its longstanding ties to an array of corporations. But on some campuses, faculty who get tobacco money for research grants have led pitched battles over proposed bans. Last spring, because of such faculty opposition, Stanford University and regents of the University of California system rejected prohibitions on tobacco dollars. Many faculty members argued that the restrictions would infringe on academic freedom and lead to fights over money from other potentially controversial sources, like liquor, pharmaceutical or oil companies. They said that even if tobacco companies financed research, professors would guard their independence and not permit the companies to influence their results. “We take funding from corporations, from the Department of Defense, from many, many sources, but ultimately the responsibility for the science belongs to the faculty member who did the science,” said Robert C. Dynes, president of the University of California system. The California Board of Regents decided in September that rather than ban tobacco money, it would require research financed by tobacco companies to be approved by the chancellor on each campus. The origins of the movement to ban tobacco money are traced to Australia, where nearly 20 universities stopped accepting money from the industry during the 1990s, said Stanton A. Glantz, a professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco medical school. Dr. Glantz was among the prime proponents of a tobacco ban in the California university system. Universities also received a nudge from the American Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit group created as part of a $206 billion settlement in 1998 of a lawsuit filed by 46 states against the tobacco industry. The foundation, dedicated to reducing tobacco use, awards research and other grants to universities, but only if the unit of the university seeking financing does not accept tobacco money. The medical school at Emory University and the public health schools at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Ohio State, Louisiana State and the Universities of Arizona, Iowa and North Carolina have also banned tobacco money. Proponents of bans often argue that universities should stop accepting tobacco money not only because of the public health impact of smoking, but because of what they view as the industry’s misuse of scientific research to confuse consumers about the risks of smoking and second-hand smoke. “The argument for rejecting funding is that the tobacco industry has a 50-plus-year history of a corrupting influence on medical research,” said Dr. Michael J. Thun, the chief of epidemiological research at the American Cancer Society. Philip Morris says the money it donates for research is given with no strings attached. “When we make those grants, the control of the grant is by the researchers, and we ask them to publish their results and to make sure to make public that we funded it,” said Bill Phelps, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A., the largest tobacco company in the United States. “We think that the research we’ve funded has contributed to the base of scientific knowledge.” He declined to disclose how much the company spends on research grants. Philip Morris is currently financing one research project at the University of Texas at Austin, a three-year, $455,000 effort to study how certain toxic compounds in cigarette smoke react with DNA, causing damage that can lead to cancer. Jennifer S. Brodbelt, a chemist who is a researcher on the study, said the company has had no role in the research. “We are all struggling to maintain our research programs,” Dr. Brodbelt said. “If we can find new sources to support meritorious research, I say let’s make the most of it.” Some of the nearly $150,000 that Philip Morris or its parent company, the Altria Group, gave to the McCombs school in recent years helped support two research centers. But most of the money went to student groups and activities, from the Hispanic Business Students Association to a conference on women in business leadership. Because Philip Morris recruits employees from the business school  an activity not affected by the ban  it wants to support student events and educational programs, said Mr. Phelps, the company spokesman. The company donates money for similar activities at several dozen colleges and universities, he said. But department chairmen and deans at the business school had become uncomfortable with the company’s role, and in particular its desire for more interaction with undergraduates. Some wondered whether giving the company more prominence on campus would suggest that the university was in some way endorsing it, said Dr. Gau, the dean. Paula C. Murray, associate dean for undergraduate programs at McCombs, was among those who pushed for the ban. “We know the product is deadly,” she said. “We know it causes cancer. And we know that the younger you start smoking, the more likely you will find it hard to quit. With two-thirds of our undergraduates under 21, to me it’s a no-brainer.” “Just because it’s green,” Ms. Murray added, “we don’t have to take it.” More Articles in Education »Officials at the University of Texas business school in Austin became uneasy when they realized that a reliable donor to student activities  the parent company of the tobacco maker Philip Morris  wanted a more prominent role in sponsoring events, and more interaction with students.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Altria has supported the Dance Theater Workshop. Multimedia Graphic Supported by Altria Enlarge This Image Spencer Platt/Getty Images Altria has supported established groups and experimental work. Its sponsorships included the 2006 Whitney Biennial. At first, some arts groups hesitated to take funds from a tobacco company. But most of them got over it, and now more than 200 organizations in New York, including many known for experimental work, receive a total of about $7 million every year from the company known for the last few years as the Altria Group. That money is about to go away as Altria prepares to move its headquarters out of New York because of a corporate reorganization of its tobacco business. The citys arts world is bracing for the money to run out. Arts groups as varied as the Urban Bush Women in Brooklyn and the Dance Theater Workshop in Manhattan are hustling to find other companies, hedge funds or real estate developers to replace Altrias grants. Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, said she was initially stunned when she learned that Altria would discontinue its funding, which included a $375,000 donation last year. The company has been the primary sponsor of the academys Next Wave Festival since its inception in 1983, and Ms. Hopkins and her staff are seeking new sponsors. They did it because they saw the vision. They got it, she said. Its hard to get money for the arts. Its even harder the more experimental and unusual the program. The separated companies will continue to make charitable contributions but are expected to spend most of their money in areas other than New York. Jennifer P. Goodale, a former actress who is Altrias vice president for contributions, said in an e-mail message: It is unlikely that Altria will be funding arts organizations in New York in the future because, as far as we know, there will be no Altria corporate contributions program, which is a result of the decentralization weve been working on over the past few years. In New York and elsewhere, it is not uncommon for corporate benefactors to come and go because of mergers, economic downturns or relocations. For instance, the Metropolitan Opera scrambled to find a new sponsor for its Saturday broadcasts after ChevronTexaco withdrew its financing in 2003. (Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2000, had sponsored the show for decades; Toll Brothers, the home builder, is now the sponsor.) The Metropolitan Museum of Art, meanwhile, was forced to raise its optional admission prices in the late 1990s after the Readers Digest Association cut its stock dividend during a slump. The museum was a beneficiary of a sizable chunk of stock. But few corporations have been as dependable in funding the arts over decades as Altria has. The company has been warning since 2005 that it would scale back its donations; the last checks to New York groups run through 2008. Several arts groups said they were not optimistic that another patron the size of Altria would emerge. Its going to be hard for many of us, said Patricia Cruz, executive director of the Harlem Stage, which received $125,000 last year from Altria. I hope people look at this as a vacuum to be filled rather than leading an exodus. Altria has consistently ranked among the top three corporate contributors to the arts in the city, while the other top spots rotated among companies that included Time Warner and American Express, said Will Maitland Weiss, executive director of the Arts and Business Council of New York. Nationally, Altria ranked 11th in corporate giving last year with about $200 million in cash and in-kind donations, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Besides plowing millions into the arts across the country, Altria has been a major contributor to domestic violence shelters, hunger programs and disaster relief. In the last decade, the company and its subsidiaries donated $1.5 billion in cash and in-kind contributions to charity. The charitable work for which Altria, called the Philip Morris Companies until 2003, is best known is its contributions to the arts, particularly in New York. The company is credited with being an early pioneer in corporate giving, not just for the sums it donated but for the cleverness with which it did so, encouraging new and innovative works. David Parsons, co-founder and artistic director of Parsons Dance, said a donation from Philip Morris in 1985 gave his new dance company a much-needed shot in the arm. He has received annual donations from Altria since. Heres what it was  the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, Mr. Parsons said during a break in a recent rehearsal. It opens doors. Other funders see that, and they take a second look at you. Philip Morris made its first corporate donation in the mid-1950s to the United Negro College Fund. Its first donation to the arts was in 1958, when it offered the Philip Morris Festival of the Stars, a free outdoor concert in Louisville, Ky., where it operated a factory. In 1965, the company sponsored a traveling exhibition of modern art called Pop &amp; Op that featured 65 artists, including Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. Two years later, it made its first contribution to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and a year after that to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Philip Morris began providing money to dance companies in the 1970s and aggressively funded new works beginning in 1983 with the New York City Ballet. Since then, it has paid for new works by troupes as varied as the Mark Morris Dance Group and Shen Wei Dance Arts. The company focused its dollars on visual arts and dance because several former chief executives, including Joseph F. Cullman III and George Weissman, were passionate about them. Both Mr. Cullman and Mr. Weissman served on the boards of directors of arts organizations, like many subsequent Philip Morris and Altria executives. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: October 9, 2007 Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the effect Altrias decision to move its corporate headquarters to Virginia would have on financing for arts programs in New York misstated the corporations current holdings.

Skip to next paragraph Share Your Thoughts What do you think of using smokeless tobacco as an alternative to smoking? Post a Comment Enlarge This Image Paul Hansen for The New York Times Snus is a moist, ground tobacco. Im really concerned about my health, said Mr. Froberg, a maître dhôtel, who tries to limit his smoking. This stuff is safer than cigarettes, its discreet, and its really good. Now this form of tobacco is coming to America, in the midst of an intensifying debate over how to define reduced risk tobacco products and how to market them. On Wednesday, a House committee is scheduled to hold hearings on whether the Food and Drug Administration should be given the power to regulate tobacco. Snus (rhymes with loose) is a moist ground tobacco that a user tucks between the cheek and the gum. Unlike chewing tobacco and moist smokeless tobacco  commonly known as dip  snus requires no spitting. Thanks partly to its popularity here, Sweden has the lowest smoking rates in Europe. It also has fewer incidences than its neighbors of smoking-related diseases, including lung and oral cancer. Snus is not without its dangers. It contains nicotine, which speeds the metabolism, and is as addictive as cigarettes. It has also been linked in a recent clinical trial to pancreatic cancer, though, unlike cigarettes, not to lung or mouth cancers. With the Sweden experience as a blueprint, the American tobacco industry is looking to snus as a potentially profitable, less dangerous alternative to cigarettes. Philip Morris USA and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco have begun test-marketing it around the country under their most famous names, Marlboro and Camel. But recalling the false promise of light and mild cigarettes, critics say smokeless tobacco is a Trojan horse, meant to enable companies to hold on to customers who might otherwise quit their tobacco habit outright. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that smokers are able to switch to smokeless tobacco and remain switched, said Thomas Glynn, the director of cancer science and trends at the American Cancer Society. Still, Mr. Glynn also believes that if every smoker in the United States were to switch to smokeless tobacco, in the next decade we would see fewer cancers and less heart disease. The European Union banned the sale of snus in 1992, partly out of concern that it would be marketed to young people  a policy that almost derailed Swedens membership bid, until a waiver was granted. There are no such restrictions in the United States, where there is a long tradition of smokeless tobacco and a growing market for it. Moreover, advocates say, snus is less harmful than American dip, which is fermented rather than pasteurized, and can cause mouth cancer. I think its a potentially huge market, said Lennart Freeman, president of the North America division for Swedish Match, which dominates the market here, selling some 250 million slim cans of snus a year. The company has begun to sell snus in tobacco shops in New York, Chicago and other cities. Given the negative perception of tobacco and the restrictions on advertising, though, company officials said it would take time to educate Americans about snuss advantages over other tobacco products. In Sweden, snus has existed for some 200 years, enjoying a revival in popularity over the last 20 years. There is little dispute that it has had an impact on smoking habits, at least among Swedish men. In 1976, 43 percent of men here smoked regularly; by 2005, only 14 percent did. During that period, the percentage of men using snus jumped to 22 percent, from 9 percent. But not everyone who takes up snus is a smoker. And not every smoker stops when they use it. A few continue to smoke daily, while others, like Mr. Froberg, smoke now and then. An estimated 5 percent of Swedish men have quit smoking altogether in favor of snus. If you have a product that works well as a smoking-cessation product, then why not use it? asked Dr. Lars E. Rutqvist, the vice president for scientific affairs at Swedish Match. Societies should adopt all measures that are effective in combating smoking-related diseases. Dr. Rutqvist, an oncologist who used to think snus was disgusting, has become one of its most ardent advocates. He argues snus can serve as a less risky alternative for chronically addicted smokers and as a way for less addicted smokers to wean themselves. Those claims  not to mention his recent decision to take a job at a tobacco company  have put Dr. Rutqvist at odds with colleagues in the Swedish medical establishment. Doctors here are deeply divided about the proper role of snus, with some arguing that its risks should not be discounted. 1 2 Next Page » Mark Landler reported from Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden, and Andrew Martin from New York.

The plans, announced yesterday, would leave Altria with its much smaller domestic tobacco business, which still is the biggest in the United States. The spinoff would clear the international tobacco business from the legal and regulatory constraints facing its domestic counterpart, Philip Morris USA. The companys board announced it would confirm its decision and give the exact timing of the spinoff at its board meeting on Jan. 30. The company plans to close its New York City headquarters as part of the plans, helping save at least $250 million a year in overhead, Altrias chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said in a conference call. Altrias offices and some jobs will move to Richmond, Va., where Philip Morris USA is based. Philip Morris International will maintain a small office in New York. About 400 of 600 current New York employees will lose their jobs, Mr. Camilleri said. Mr. Camilleri will become chief executive of Philip Morris International once the spinoff is completed. Michael E. Szymanczyk, the current chief executive of Philip Morris USA, will succeed Mr. Camilleri at Altria. The proposal is subject to approval by the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. A spinoff of Philip Morris International would be the latest step in a revamping started in March when Altria spun off its majority stake in Kraft Foods. Altria also owns the Philip Morris Capital Corporation, a finance company that is being wound down, and a 29 percent stake in SABMiller, based in London, which brews Miller Lite beer. Under a spinoff, Altria shareholders would get shares in a stand-alone Philip Morris International. Sales at Philip Morris International, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, are more than double those at the United States unit, with 2006 revenue of $48.26 billion, compared with Philip Morris USAs $18.47 billion. Last year, Philip Morris International sold 831 billion cigarettes, making it the worlds largest nongovernment tobacco company by volume. It holds 15.4 percent of the global market.

David Parsons, co-founder and artistic director of Parsons Dance, said a donation from Philip Morris in 1985 gave his new dance company a much-needed shot in the arm. He has received annual donations from Altria since. Heres what it was  the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, Mr. Parsons said during a break in a recent rehearsal. It opens doors. Other funders see that, and they take a second look at you. Philip Morris made its first corporate donation in the mid-1950s to the United Negro College Fund. Its first donation to the arts was in 1958, when it offered the Philip Morris Festival of the Stars, a free outdoor concert in Louisville, Ky., where it operated a factory. In 1965, the company sponsored a traveling exhibition of modern art called Pop &amp; Op that featured 65 artists, including Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. Two years later, it made its first contribution to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and a year after that to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Philip Morris began providing money to dance companies in the 1970s and aggressively funded new works beginning in 1983 with the New York City Ballet. Since then, it has paid for new works by troupes as varied as the Mark Morris Dance Group and Shen Wei Dance Arts. The company focused its dollars on visual arts and dance because several former chief executives, including Joseph F. Cullman III and George Weissman, were passionate about them. Both Mr. Cullman and Mr. Weissman served on the boards of directors of arts organizations, like many subsequent Philip Morris and Altria executives. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: October 9, 2007 Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the effect Altrias decision to move its corporate headquarters to Virginia would have on financing for arts programs in New York misstated the corporations current holdings.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Altria has supported the Dance Theater Workshop. Multimedia Graphic Supported by Altria Enlarge This Image Spencer Platt/Getty Images Altria has supported established groups and experimental work. Its sponsorships included the 2006 Whitney Biennial. At first, some arts groups hesitated to take funds from a tobacco company. But most of them got over it, and now more than 200 organizations in New York, including many known for experimental work, receive a total of about $7 million every year from the company known for the last few years as the Altria Group. That money is about to go away as Altria prepares to move its headquarters out of New York because of a corporate reorganization of its tobacco business. The citys arts world is bracing for the money to run out. Arts groups as varied as the Urban Bush Women in Brooklyn and the Dance Theater Workshop in Manhattan are hustling to find other companies, hedge funds or real estate developers to replace Altrias grants. Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, said she was initially stunned when she learned that Altria would discontinue its funding, which included a $375,000 donation last year. The company has been the primary sponsor of the academys Next Wave Festival since its inception in 1983, and Ms. Hopkins and her staff are seeking new sponsors. They did it because they saw the vision. They got it, she said. Its hard to get money for the arts. Its even harder the more experimental and unusual the program. The separated companies will continue to make charitable contributions but are expected to spend most of their money in areas other than New York. Jennifer P. Goodale, a former actress who is Altrias vice president for contributions, said in an e-mail message: It is unlikely that Altria will be funding arts organizations in New York in the future because, as far as we know, there will be no Altria corporate contributions program, which is a result of the decentralization weve been working on over the past few years. In New York and elsewhere, it is not uncommon for corporate benefactors to come and go because of mergers, economic downturns or relocations. For instance, the Metropolitan Opera scrambled to find a new sponsor for its Saturday broadcasts after ChevronTexaco withdrew its financing in 2003. (Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2000, had sponsored the show for decades; Toll Brothers, the home builder, is now the sponsor.) The Metropolitan Museum of Art, meanwhile, was forced to raise its optional admission prices in the late 1990s after the Readers Digest Association cut its stock dividend during a slump. The museum was a beneficiary of a sizable chunk of stock. But few corporations have been as dependable in funding the arts over decades as Altria has. The company has been warning since 2005 that it would scale back its donations; the last checks to New York groups run through 2008. Several arts groups said they were not optimistic that another patron the size of Altria would emerge. Its going to be hard for many of us, said Patricia Cruz, executive director of the Harlem Stage, which received $125,000 last year from Altria. I hope people look at this as a vacuum to be filled rather than leading an exodus. Altria has consistently ranked among the top three corporate contributors to the arts in the city, while the other top spots rotated among companies that included Time Warner and American Express, said Will Maitland Weiss, executive director of the Arts and Business Council of New York. Nationally, Altria ranked 11th in corporate giving last year with about $200 million in cash and in-kind donations, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Besides plowing millions into the arts across the country, Altria has been a major contributor to domestic violence shelters, hunger programs and disaster relief. In the last decade, the company and its subsidiaries donated $1.5 billion in cash and in-kind contributions to charity.

Post a Comment Enlarge This Image Paul Hansen for The New York Times Snus is a moist, ground tobacco. Im really concerned about my health, said Mr. Froberg, a maître dhôtel, who tries to limit his smoking. This stuff is safer than cigarettes, its discreet, and its really good. Now this form of tobacco is coming to America, in the midst of an intensifying debate over how to define reduced risk tobacco products and how to market them. On Wednesday, a House committee is scheduled to hold hearings on whether the Food and Drug Administration should be given the power to regulate tobacco. Snus (rhymes with loose) is a moist ground tobacco that a user tucks between the cheek and the gum. Unlike chewing tobacco and moist smokeless tobacco  commonly known as dip  snus requires no spitting. Thanks partly to its popularity here, Sweden has the lowest smoking rates in Europe. It also has fewer incidences than its neighbors of smoking-related diseases, including lung and oral cancer. Snus is not without its dangers. It contains nicotine, which speeds the metabolism, and is as addictive as cigarettes. It has also been linked in a recent clinical trial to pancreatic cancer, though, unlike cigarettes, not to lung or mouth cancers. With the Sweden experience as a blueprint, the American tobacco industry is looking to snus as a potentially profitable, less dangerous alternative to cigarettes. Philip Morris USA and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco have begun test-marketing it around the country under their most famous names, Marlboro and Camel. But recalling the false promise of light and mild cigarettes, critics say smokeless tobacco is a Trojan horse, meant to enable companies to hold on to customers who might otherwise quit their tobacco habit outright. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that smokers are able to switch to smokeless tobacco and remain switched, said Thomas Glynn, the director of cancer science and trends at the American Cancer Society. Still, Mr. Glynn also believes that if every smoker in the United States were to switch to smokeless tobacco, in the next decade we would see fewer cancers and less heart disease. The European Union banned the sale of snus in 1992, partly out of concern that it would be marketed to young people  a policy that almost derailed Swedens membership bid, until a waiver was granted. There are no such restrictions in the United States, where there is a long tradition of smokeless tobacco and a growing market for it. Moreover, advocates say, snus is less harmful than American dip, which is fermented rather than pasteurized, and can cause mouth cancer. I think its a potentially huge market, said Lennart Freeman, president of the North America division for Swedish Match, which dominates the market here, selling some 250 million slim cans of snus a year. The company has begun to sell snus in tobacco shops in New York, Chicago and other cities. Given the negative perception of tobacco and the restrictions on advertising, though, company officials said it would take time to educate Americans about snuss advantages over other tobacco products. In Sweden, snus has existed for some 200 years, enjoying a revival in popularity over the last 20 years. There is little dispute that it has had an impact on smoking habits, at least among Swedish men. In 1976, 43 percent of men here smoked regularly; by 2005, only 14 percent did. During that period, the percentage of men using snus jumped to 22 percent, from 9 percent. But not everyone who takes up snus is a smoker. And not every smoker stops when they use it. A few continue to smoke daily, while others, like Mr. Froberg, smoke now and then. An estimated 5 percent of Swedish men have quit smoking altogether in favor of snus. If you have a product that works well as a smoking-cessation product, then why not use it? asked Dr. Lars E. Rutqvist, the vice president for scientific affairs at Swedish Match. Societies should adopt all measures that are effective in combating smoking-related diseases. Dr. Rutqvist, an oncologist who used to think snus was disgusting, has become one of its most ardent advocates. He argues snus can serve as a less risky alternative for chronically addicted smokers and as a way for less addicted smokers to wean themselves. Those claims  not to mention his recent decision to take a job at a tobacco company  have put Dr. Rutqvist at odds with colleagues in the Swedish medical establishment. Doctors here are deeply divided about the proper role of snus, with some arguing that its risks should not be discounted. 1 2 Next Page » Mark Landler reported from Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden, and Andrew Martin from New York.

The plans, announced yesterday, would leave Altria with its much smaller domestic tobacco business, which still is the biggest in the United States. The spinoff would clear the international tobacco business from the legal and regulatory constraints facing its domestic counterpart, Philip Morris USA. The companys board announced it would confirm its decision and give the exact timing of the spinoff at its board meeting on Jan. 30. The company plans to close its New York City headquarters as part of the plans, helping save at least $250 million a year in overhead, Altrias chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said in a conference call. Altrias offices and some jobs will move to Richmond, Va., where Philip Morris USA is based. Philip Morris International will maintain a small office in New York. About 400 of 600 current New York employees will lose their jobs, Mr. Camilleri said. Mr. Camilleri will become chief executive of Philip Morris International once the spinoff is completed. Michael E. Szymanczyk, the current chief executive of Philip Morris USA, will succeed Mr. Camilleri at Altria. The proposal is subject to approval by the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. A spinoff of Philip Morris International would be the latest step in a revamping started in March when Altria spun off its majority stake in Kraft Foods. Altria also owns the Philip Morris Capital Corporation, a finance company that is being wound down, and a 29 percent stake in SABMiller, based in London, which brews Miller Lite beer. Under a spinoff, Altria shareholders would get shares in a stand-alone Philip Morris International. Sales at Philip Morris International, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, are more than double those at the United States unit, with 2006 revenue of $48.26 billion, compared with Philip Morris USAs $18.47 billion. Last year, Philip Morris International sold 831 billion cigarettes, making it the worlds largest nongovernment tobacco company by volume. It holds 15.4 percent of the global market.

Skip to next paragraph The New York Times The board of the Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International, is meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to spin off the international arm of its cigarette business as part of a restructuring plan to increase shareholder value, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The American business has hindered the stock price because of fears of more litigation, threats of government intervention and declining cigarette sales in the United States, analysts said. Altria officials declined to comment about the potential spinoff of Philip Morris International. But several Wall Street analysts who cover the company said they believed it was inevitable. This is something that has been in the works for years, said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup. To me, its a done deal. By splitting the two companies, Philip Morris International could expand more aggressively abroad, either through innovation or acquisition. Philip Morris USA, meanwhile, would focus on expanding into other tobacco products  like the recent introduction of Marlboro smokeless tobacco  and making its own acquisitions, probably other tobacco companies. It allows P.M.I. to become much more free to pursue growth opportunities, Ms. Herzog said. The Altria Group would probably remain as a holding company for Philip Morris USA and the companys 29 percent stake in SABMiller, the beer company, she said. Marc Greenberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said spinning off the international business would allow shareholders finally to benefit from the companys robust balance sheet. For instance, he said the company has not repurchased Altria stock in about four years because it was holding back money for such things as litigation risk and legal constraints. Longer term, it will provide more financial flexibility, he said of the spinoff. The demand for cigarettes in the United States is in a gradual decline of about 1 or 2 percent a year. Philip Morris USA controls 51 percent of the American cigarette market and generates $18 billion in net revenue. To compensate for the declining smoking market, the company is trying to extend its brand names to new products. For instance, it is now testing a Marlboro smokeless tobacco product, and it also is testing Marlboro snus, which are tobacco packets placed between the cheek and gum that do not generate spit like smokeless tobacco. Snus are geared more toward smokers than aficionados of chewing tobacco. As part of an effort to ramp up its innovation pipeline, Philip Morris USA plans to unveil a $350 million research center in Richmond, Va., that will focus, in part, in developing reduced harm tobacco products. In my opinion, technology will play an incredible role in this industry, particularly reduced risk, Ms. Herzog said. Outside the United States, the demand for cigarettes is relatively flat. Still, Philip Morris International has much more room for growth because it has only about 15 percent of the international market. Philip Morris International generated $48 billion in net revenue last year. Philip Morris Companies changed its name to the Altria Group in January 2003, a name derived from the Latin word altus, which means high. The company said the name was intended to convey the notion of reaching ever higher and was meant to differentiate the parent company from Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International and to reflect the fact that the company had evolved beyond tobacco. Some critics say the name was changed to escape the stigma of selling cigarettes. Regardless, Altrias chairman and chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, has said for several years that he wants to restructure the company as soon as the litigation environment surrounding tobacco settles down. Last October, citing an improvement, Altrias board announced that it would spin off Kraft Foods as a first step.

Surprisingly, it is not just the foes of Big Tobacco that support the proposed law, which was approved by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Wednesday. Philip Morris, the worlds largest tobacco company, is also firmly behind the bill. In fact, it played a pivotal role in writing the legislation, working with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. What these strange bedfellows came up with is bad for competition in the tobacco industry and bad for public health. One problem is that under the proposed law, the F.D.A. would regulate any new reduced-risk tobacco products. And in so doing, the agency would be responsible for setting standards to determine which tobacco products pose a reduced health hazard. Since the F.D.A. has neither the resources nor the expertise to do this job itself, it most likely would need to turn to the industry for help. Philip Morris, which is miles ahead of its competitors in developing the next generation of tobacco products, would be only too happy to assist. In effect, it would be Philip Morriss standards and products that would define the F.D.A.s definition of reduced-risk cigarettes. This would give the company an unassailable competitive advantage. Unable to match Philip Morriss technical prowess, its competitors would be reduced to licensing its technology and producing pale imitations. Moreover, by setting regulatory standards for reduced-risk cigarettes, the F.D.A. would send a message to both smokers and nonsmokers that smoking is really not very risky. However, it will take several decades before anyone is able to do the epidemiological studies that could demonstrate whether this is true. In effect, this bill tosses aside decades of work by the public health community to convince people either to stop smoking or not to start in the first place. By assigning the F.D.A. responsibility for all tobacco products, the new law would also relieve the industry of any liability for tobacco safety  and pass it along to the government. Few lawmakers seem to understand either the bills origins or ramifications. But the Senate should send it back to the committee and start from scratch. Come up with a law that would give the F.D.A. authority to regulate tobacco, but do so in a way that would truly protect public health. Patrick Basham, the director of the Democracy Institute, is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. More Articles in Opinion »Washington ACCORDING to anti-smoking groups, the current Congressional attempt to give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco is the most important piece of legislation since the surgeon general spoke out on the dangers of smoking 40 years ago. Surprisingly, it is not just the foes of Big Tobacco that support the proposed law, which was approved by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Wednesday. Philip Morris, the worlds largest tobacco company, is also firmly behind the bill. In fact, it played a pivotal role in writing the legislation, working with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. What these strange bedfellows came up with is bad for competition in the tobacco industry and bad for public health. One problem is that under the proposed law, the F.D.A. would regulate any new reduced-risk tobacco products. And in so doing, the agency would be responsible for setting standards to determine which tobacco products pose a reduced health hazard. Since the F.D.A. has neither the resources nor the expertise to do this job itself, it most likely would need to turn to the industry for help. Philip Morris, which is miles ahead of its competitors in developing the next generation of tobacco products, would be only too happy to assist. In effect, it would be Philip Morriss standards and products that would define the F.D.A.s definition of reduced-risk cigarettes. This would give the company an unassailable competitive advantage. Unable to match Philip Morriss technical prowess, its competitors would be reduced to licensing its technology and producing pale imitations. Moreover, by setting regulatory standards for reduced-risk cigarettes, the F.D.A. would send a message to both smokers and nonsmokers that smoking is really not very risky. However, it will take several decades before anyone is able to do the epidemiological studies that could demonstrate whether this is true. In effect, this bill tosses aside decades of work by the public health community to convince people either to stop smoking or not to start in the first place. By assigning the F.D.A. responsibility for all tobacco products, the new law would also relieve the industry of any liability for tobacco safety  and pass it along to the government. Few lawmakers seem to understand either the bills origins or ramifications. But the Senate should send it back to the committee and start from scratch. Come up with a law that would give the F.D.A. authority to regulate tobacco, but do so in a way that would truly protect public health.

The Senate health committee is scheduled on Wednesday to consider a bill that would for the first time allow the Food and Drug Administration to regulate cigarettes. The bill now has 52 sponsors in the Senate, and a top House Republican predicted it would pass there by 2 to 1. Health advocates are predicting that, after more than a decade of debate, this may be the year tobacco regulation is made law. But many are holding their noses at some of the bill’s provisions, like the shift on cloves. A version of the legislation released in February included cloves in a list of artificial or natural flavors like strawberry, chocolate and cocoa that would be banned from cigarettes largely because they had been used to appeal to children. Last week, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the health committee and the principal author of the legislation, released the latest version of the bill. In it, cloves joined menthol as the only additives specifically allowed in tobacco. The main beneficiary of the change seems to be Philip Morris, the nation’s largest cigarette manufacturer, which recently introduced a clove-flavored version of its Marlboro brand in Indonesia. The company spent $5 billion in 2005 to buy a controlling stake in Sampoerna of Indonesia, a large maker of clove cigarettes. Philip Morris, a division of Altria, has become a crucial ally for the bill, splitting what had been united industry opposition to regulation. Carol Springstun, a company spokeswoman, said it had no plans to import clove cigarettes into the United States. The American Lung Association and other health advocates said they were disappointed by the change in the bill but still supported it. “We would prefer that the bill continue to prohibit clove-flavored cigarettes,” said Paul G. Billings, a spokesman for the American Lung Association. “But Senator Kennedy is trying to craft a path that can move the legislation through to final passage.” Other public health experts were more dismayed. “This industry doesn’t miss a trick, and anything that Philip Morris wants can’t be good,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the nicotine dependence program at the Mayo Clinic. Mr. Kennedy was contacted by at least six Senate offices after the Indonesian government wrote a letter opposing the ban and suggesting it might violate trade laws. After that, the clove exception was born. “Concerns were raised that the provision violated trade laws since it prohibited clove cigarettes, which are exclusively imported from Indonesia, but treated menthol, a domestic product, less restrictively,” said Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kennedy. To Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, the change is emblematic of the underlying flaw in the legislation. Mr. Enzi points out that, under the legislation, Congress is asking the drug administration, one of the world’s premier health agencies, to regulate a product that kills more than 400,000 people each year in the United States. “Poison peddlers shouldn’t get to decide how we as responsible legislators fight the war against their deadly products,” he said. There are no national estimates about the prevalence of clove cigarette smoking, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 3 percent of high school students and 2 percent of middle school students smoke clove cigarettes, also known as kreteks. The drug agency is a bit uncertain about whether it wants to regulate cigarettes. In public testimony recently, Andrew von Eschenbach, the commissioner of food and drugs, said he would not want his agency to have to decide whether a cigarette was safe. The bill would give the agency up to $450 million annually from a tax on tobacco to hire the staff needed to regulate the industry. In 2004, President Bush said he opposed an earlier version of the tobacco legislation, but he has yet to make a public statement about the latest proposal. A White House spokesman did not offer a comment Monday. The bill would give the drug agency the power to regulate all tobacco advertisements and ban any that were intended to attract children and teenagers. The agency would police any claims, stated or implied, that some cigarettes were healthier than others. The legislation would also prevent tobacco companies from tinkering with cigarette ingredients without F.D.A. approval. That is intended to stop the industry from increasing the addictiveness of cigarettes. Some cigarette makers say the bill favors Philip Morris because the bill’s strict regulation of tobacco advertisements and new products will make it all but impossible to unseat the company from its dominant position. “We believe the legislation being considered would put us at a competitive disadvantage in that we would not have the ability to communicate product differences with adult tobacco consumers,” said David Howard, a spokesman for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Dr. Gregory N. Connolly, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, said cloves and menthol had similar effects. Both make cigarette smoke seem cooler and smoother, which is crucial for luring younger smokers into becoming addicted, Dr. Connolly said. Both are also popular mostly among nonwhites, he said. Still, Dr. David A. Kessler, the former F.D.A. commissioner whose efforts to regulate tobacco without specific Congressional legislation were struck down by the Supreme Court, said the cloves compromise, like others in the bill, was acceptable. “There is a clear consensus now that more lives will be saved by this legislation than not,” Dr. Kessler said.

Snus (rhymes with loose) is a moist, spit-free variant on traditional chew and dip tobaccos. It comes in a small pouch similar to a tea bag that users most often place inside the upper lip. Snus is widely used in Scandinavia, where numerous studies have shown that it offers smokers an alternative way to get the nicotine and taste of cigarettes with less risk of cancer. Opponents of tobacco use have been divided on whether to encourage smokers to switch to snus because they believe that quitting tobacco altogether is the safest course of action. Philip Morris said the Marlboro snus line would be made at a factory it reopened recently in York County, Va. That factory was brought online as part of a strategy to expand the companys smokeless products and to develop tobacco-related products, a company spokesman, Brendan McCormick, said. Sales of smokeless products have increased at a 6 percent annual rate over the last five years. Philip Morris has been test-marketing two versions of a snus product in Indianapolis under the name Tobaka, with less than stellar results, industry analysts said. One analyst, Christopher Growe at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, said last month that most retailers he surveyed in Indianapolis had stopped selling Tobaka. But Philip Morris said last night that it was learning from the test and would continue it. In moving to attach the name of the companys best-selling cigarette brand to snus, Philip Morris, a division of Altria, is following the lead of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, which put its Camel brand name on a snus product it is test-marketing in Austin, Tex., and Portland, Ore., and selling over the Internet. This is a very positive signal to current smokers, said Brad K. Rodu, a professor of medicine at the University of Louisville who has long been an advocate of smokeless tobacco products as the best way to reduce the health impact of tobacco. Professor Rodu, whose research program is sponsored by smokeless tobacco companies, said studies had shown that snus cut the cancer risks of smoking by as much as 98 percent. The most recent research, published in The Lancet, the medical journal published in Britain, reported an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer among Swedish snus users compared with Swedes who used no tobacco. But the combined rate of lung, oral and pancreatic cancer was still far lower than that of Swedish smokers, Professor Rodu said.

Skip to next paragraph Top, The Oregonian, via Associated Press; Dennis Cook/Associated Press Mayola Williams won a suit against Philip Morris after her husband, Jesse Williams, top, died of cancer. Multimedia Graphic The Opinion Related Text: Supreme Court Ruling (pdf) Multimedia Back Story With The Timess Daniel L. Niemi Although of limited scope, the 5 to 4 decision was a victory for the cigarette industry and for other corporate defendants whose products or behavior have caused widespread injury and who are thus likely to face skeptical or hostile juries. The court was tightly focused on a question of procedural fairness: the need, in the majority’s view, to make sure that juries do not punish defendants for harm to others who are not parties to the lawsuit, or who even may have brought their own lawsuits previously and lost. “The due process clause prohibits a state’s inflicting punishment for harm caused strangers to the litigation,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. The court thus steered clear of the issue that most animates the debate over punitive damages: whether a punitive damage award that is much greater than the compensatory damages awarded by the jury can be considered unconstitutionally excessive. In this case, the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was nearly 100 to one, but the court did not address the issue despite Philip Morris having raised it. What happens next in this lawsuit may provide an early indication of the practical significance of the court’s ruling, as far as it went. The case now goes back to the Oregon Supreme Court, which has options ranging from reinstating the award to ordering a new trial. The original trial of the suit, brought by Mayola Williams, whose husband, Jesse, died of lung cancer after smoking two packs of Marlboros a day for 45 years, took place in 1999. Mrs. Williams’s lawyer asked the jury to “think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the state of Oregon there have been.” The trial judge rejected a request by Philip Morris for an instruction warning the jury that “you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons.” The Supreme Court on Tuesday did not require any particular wording in the form of a jury instruction. But Justice Breyer said that state judicial systems had a constitutional obligation to avoid “an unreasonable and unnecessary risk” that a jury would calculate the punitive damages based on harm to those not before the court. The issue is complicated because, under the Supreme Court’s precedents, the “reprehensibility” of a defendant’s conduct is a factor that a jury is explicitly directed to consider in setting a punitive damages award. Justice Breyer acknowledged that harm to others can serve as a measure of reprehensibility, and that jurors will necessarily consider it. That was appropriate, he said, as long as courts “provide some form of protection” against jurors seeking “to punish the defendant for having caused injury to others.” Sheila L. Birnbaum, a punitive damages specialist with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in New York, said the court was requiring jurors to “unring the bell” in a way that might prove difficult. “It’s very hard for jurors to disregard something they have heard,” she said. Ms. Birnbaum, who successfully argued the most recent punitive damages case heard by the court before this one, on behalf of the State Farm insurance company in 2003, added that the decision was nonetheless “a step in the right direction” for corporate defendants because it would require trial judges and appellate courts to be attentive to the guidance that jurors receive. Justice Breyer’s majority opinion, Philip Morris USA v. Williams, No. 05-1256, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Samuel A. Alito Jr. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. It is typical for the court’s punitive damages rulings to cut across the usual ideological lines. In fact, the only real surprise was the vote by Justice Stevens, who had previously voted with the court’s majority to support limits on punitive damages. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens said he was “firmly convinced” that those earlier decisions were correct. But he said that “in my view the Oregon Supreme Court faithfully applied the reasoning in those opinions to the egregious facts disclosed by this record.” He said that “no procedural error even arguably justifying reversal occurred at the trial in this case.” The court’s two new members, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, succeeded justices who supported limits on punitive damages, as they themselves did on Tuesday. But the narrowness of the court’s opinion and its avoidance of the excessiveness issue raised the question of whether, beneath the surface stability, the court’s polarity may have shifted. In the State Farm case that Ms. Birnbaum argued four years ago, the court overturned a punitive damage award that was 145 times greater than the compensatory award. “Few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio” would meet the test of due process, Justice Kennedy wrote then for a 6-to-3 majority, a strong statement that made the court’s failure on Tuesday to address the 97 to one ratio in the Philip Morris case all the more curious. (The Oregon jury awarded Mrs. Williams $821,000 in compensatory damages.) To hold that a damage award is unconstitutionally excessive requires the court to accept the argument that the due process clause contains a substantive component as well as a procedural one. It is on this basis that Justices Scalia and Thomas, who do not accept the modern doctrine of “substantive due process,” have dissented from the leading punitive damages decisions. It is not implausible that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito might share that view. Whether they do might become apparent if the Oregon Supreme Court reinstates the punitive damages verdict and Philip Morris comes back before the justices with a new appeal based on excessiveness. The dissenters tweaked the majority for what they characterized as judicial activism and refusal to give state courts proper respect. “I would accord more respectful treatment to the proceedings and disposition of state courts that sought diligently to adhere to our changing, less than crystalline precedent,” Justice Ginsburg said in an opinion that Justices Scalia and Thomas also signed. In a prepared statement, William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel of Philip Morris, a unit of Altria, said the decision would give the company “an opportunity to fully and fairly defend itself in this and other cases.” Market analysts generally viewed the decision as positive for industry. “Despite a more narrow opinion than we had hoped for, we view the ruling as a positive as it effectively limits the size of punitive damages in future cases,” said Christopher R. Growe, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, in a note to investors. In recent months, investors have pushed Altria’s stock to record highs, in part because they believe the litigation environment against tobacco companies has significantly improved. On Tuesday, Altria’s stock closed at $85.95, down 25 cents. Andrew Martin contributed reporting.

Niemi Although of limited scope, the 5 to 4 decision was a victory for the cigarette industry and for other corporate defendants whose products or behavior have caused widespread injury and who are thus likely to face skeptical or hostile juries. The court was tightly focused on a question of procedural fairness: the need, in the majority’s view, to make sure that juries do not punish defendants for harm to others who are not parties to the lawsuit, or who even may have brought their own lawsuits previously and lost. “The due process clause prohibits a state’s inflicting punishment for harm caused strangers to the litigation,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. The court thus steered clear of the issue that most animates the debate over punitive damages: whether a punitive damage award that is much greater than the compensatory damages awarded by the jury can be considered unconstitutionally excessive. In this case, the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was nearly 100 to one, but the court did not address the issue despite Philip Morris having raised it. What happens next in this lawsuit may provide an early indication of the practical significance of the court’s ruling, as far as it went. The case now goes back to the Oregon Supreme Court, which has options ranging from reinstating the award to ordering a new trial. The original trial of the suit, brought by Mayola Williams, whose husband, Jesse, died of lung cancer after smoking two packs of Marlboros a day for 45 years, took place in 1999. Mrs. Williams’s lawyer asked the jury to “think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the state of Oregon there have been.” The trial judge rejected a request by Philip Morris for an instruction warning the jury that “you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons.” The Supreme Court on Tuesday did not require any particular wording in the form of a jury instruction. But Justice Breyer said that state judicial systems had a constitutional obligation to avoid “an unreasonable and unnecessary risk” that a jury would calculate the punitive damages based on harm to those not before the court. The issue is complicated because, under the Supreme Court’s precedents, the “reprehensibility” of a defendant’s conduct is a factor that a jury is explicitly directed to consider in setting a punitive damages award. Justice Breyer acknowledged that harm to others can serve as a measure of reprehensibility, and that jurors will necessarily consider it. That was appropriate, he said, as long as courts “provide some form of protection” against jurors seeking “to punish the defendant for having caused injury to others.” Sheila L. Birnbaum, a punitive damages specialist with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in New York, said the court was requiring jurors to “unring the bell” in a way that might prove difficult. “It’s very hard for jurors to disregard something they have heard,” she said. Ms. Birnbaum, who successfully argued the most recent punitive damages case heard by the court before this one, on behalf of the State Farm insurance company in 2003, added that the decision was nonetheless “a step in the right direction” for corporate defendants because it would require trial judges and appellate courts to be attentive to the guidance that jurors receive. Justice Breyer’s majority opinion, Philip Morris USA v. Williams, No. 05-1256, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Samuel A. Alito Jr. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. It is typical for the court’s punitive damages rulings to cut across the usual ideological lines. In fact, the only real surprise was the vote by Justice Stevens, who had previously voted with the court’s majority to support limits on punitive damages. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens said he was “firmly convinced” that those earlier decisions were correct. But he said that “in my view the Oregon Supreme Court faithfully applied the reasoning in those opinions to the egregious facts disclosed by this record.” He said that “no procedural error even arguably justifying reversal occurred at the trial in this case.” The court’s two new members, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, succeeded justices who supported limits on punitive damages, as they themselves did on Tuesday. But the narrowness of the court’s opinion and its avoidance of the excessiveness issue raised the question of whether, beneath the surface stability, the court’s polarity may have shifted. In the State Farm case that Ms. Birnbaum argued four years ago, the court overturned a punitive damage award that was 145 times greater than the compensatory award. “Few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio” would meet the test of due process, Justice Kennedy wrote then for a 6-to-3 majority, a strong statement that made the court’s failure on Tuesday to address the 97 to one ratio in the Philip Morris case all the more curious. (The Oregon jury awarded Mrs. Williams $821,000 in compensatory damages.) To hold that a damage award is unconstitutionally excessive requires the court to accept the argument that the due process clause contains a substantive component as well as a procedural one. It is on this basis that Justices Scalia and Thomas, who do not accept the modern doctrine of “substantive due process,” have dissented from the leading punitive damages decisions. It is not implausible that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito might share that view. Whether they do might become apparent if the Oregon Supreme Court reinstates the punitive damages verdict and Philip Morris comes back before the justices with a new appeal based on excessiveness. The dissenters tweaked the majority for what they characterized as judicial activism and refusal to give state courts proper respect. “I would accord more respectful treatment to the proceedings and disposition of state courts that sought diligently to adhere to our changing, less than crystalline precedent,” Justice Ginsburg said in an opinion that Justices Scalia and Thomas also signed. In a prepared statement, William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel of Philip Morris, a unit of Altria, said the decision would give the company “an opportunity to fully and fairly defend itself in this and other cases.” Market analysts generally viewed the decision as positive for industry. “Despite a more narrow opinion than we had hoped for, we view the ruling as a positive as it effectively limits the size of punitive damages in future cases,” said Christopher R. Growe, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, in a note to investors. In recent months, investors have pushed Altria’s stock to record highs, in part because they believe the litigation environment against tobacco companies has significantly improved. On Tuesday, Altria’s stock closed at $85.95, down 25 cents.

It stretches the Constitutions guarantee of due process in a way that will make it easier for companies that act reprehensibly to sidestep serious punishments. It also provides unsettling new evidence that the court is more concerned about  and more willing to protect  the powerful than the powerless. An Oregon jury awarded Mayola Williams, the widow of a cigarette smoker, about $821,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages. Ms. Williams argued that Philip Morris had spent 40 years denying the connection between smoking and cancer, even though it knew cigarettes were deadly. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the punitive damages award, saying that Philip Morriss actions had been extraordinarily reprehensible. By keeping Oregonians smoking longer than they otherwise would have, the court said, the companys actions would, naturally and inevitably, lead to significant injury or death. By a 5-to-4 vote that did not follow the usual ideological lines, the court ruled that the award was improper because it punished Philip Morris for harm done to people who were not part of the lawsuit. There is nothing unusual, or wrong, about courts considering the broader impact of a wrongdoers misdeeds. As Justice John Paul Stevens noted in dissent, A murderer who kills his victim by throwing a bomb that injures dozens of bystanders should be punished more severely than one who harms no one other than his intended victim. The fact that Philip Morris hurt so many other smokers along with Jesse Williams is surely relevant to its punishment. The court in recent years has become increasingly activist when it comes to defending the rights of corporations by striking down punitive damage awards. And yesterdays ruling continues that trend. It expands the notion of due process. And it overturns the decisions of a jury and a state supreme court. Unfortunately, the court has been far less activist when ordinary people seek protection or challenge their punishments. The ruling stands in particular contrast with the courts 2003 decision that the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishments did not bar California, under its three strikes law, from sentencing a man to 50 years in prison for stealing $153.53 worth of videotapes. Yesterdays decision is another disturbing sign that  as the current court reads the Constitution  powerful parties have more rights than regular people.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Tobaccos Road Back The number of American smokers usually drops about 1 or 2 percent a year. Government agencies keep adding cigarette taxes and outlawing smoking in restaurants, workplaces and even on public sidewalks. And tobacco companies continue to pay billions of dollars in legal settlements, money that is used in part to produce antismoking ads. For all the industrys apparent troubles, however, the future of cigarettes appears to be brighter than ever. That at least is the message investors are sending as the Altria Group  the company once known as Philip Morris and the maker of the worlds most popular cigarette, Marlboro  prepares to split itself by spinning off its Kraft Foods division to shareholders and become, once again, primarily a tobacco company. Today, Louis C. Camilleri, the chief executive of Altria, is expected to set a timetable for completing the spinoff. It is a move that Wall Street is responding to with the equivalent of a standing ovation, but it is not because Kraft Foods, the worlds second-largest food company, after Nestlé, will finally shed the taint of tobacco. Investors are glad that Altria will finally be rid of Kraft Foods, the maker of Oreo cookies, Velveeta and Tang. Since October, when the company announced its plan for the move, its shares have risen 10 percent. Something that is forgotten in all of this is people like to smoke, said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who noted that United States tobacco stocks have beaten the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index in each of the last six years. Its enjoyable and theres not an alternative product. He added: If frozen dinners get too expensive, people will try something else. Thats not true with cigarettes  you are not up at night worried about that product that is going to make cigarettes obsolete. In the five and a half years since Altria sold 280 million shares of Kraft at $31 each in an initial public offering, the stock has remained relatively unchanged, closing yesterday at $34.83. Altria owns 88.6 percent of Krafts stock. By contrast, shares of Altria have nearly doubled during that period, moving from $47 to yesterdays price of $87.54. It is a remarkable turnabout, considering that in late 2001, Philip Morris announced its plan to change its name to the Altria Group (drawn from the Latin word altus, meaning high, to suggest high performance). At the time, executives said the name change was intended to reduce the damage to the companys reputation that cigarettes were causing, reflected in the long-depressed share price at the time. Now, it is Kraft that is seen by many investors as a hindrance to the company. Why is Wall Street so infatuated with cigarettes? Cigarettes have certain advantages over other consumer products, not the least of which is that they are addictive. They are inexpensive to make, require almost no innovation, there is a global market for them, and cigarette makers can raise prices without seeing much of a drop in business. On top of all that, a recent string of court decisions has convinced investors that the worst of the litigation against tobacco companies is over. That, in turn, has allowed Altria to move forward with a revamping that begins with cutting Kraft loose and will ultimately allow Altria to use the huge amounts of cash generated by cigarettes to buy back stock or acquire other tobacco companies, particularly overseas. You take away Kraft out of Altria and you are left with a balance sheet that is extremely strong, said Charles Norton, portfolio manager at the Vice Fund, a mutual fund that invests in tobacco, gambling, alcohol and military contractors. Altria is the funds biggest holding. Its just a cash cow. The free cash flow on this business is just tremendous. The future prospects are particularly attractive in developing countries, where smoking has not yet declined as it has in more developed parts of the world like the United States and Europe. In China, for instance, the Philip Morris International unit of Altria signed a deal in 2005 that allows it to manufacture and sell Marlboro cigarettes to the countrys 350 million smokers. There are an estimated 1.3 billion smokers worldwide. But even in the United States, with 45 million smokers, the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria continues to generate sizable profits by raising prices. It also hopes eventually to lure consumers with new tobacco products, including a small tea-bag-like pouch that is smoke-free, spit-free and tucks into the cheek. It says it is also working on developing cigarettes that are less harmful. The exciting part for me, said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup, is that tobacco use today will evolve. Its unlikely that there will ever be a 100 percent safe cigarette, but we feel that a reduced-risk cigarette is on the horizon. But some health advocates say that the diminished social acceptability of cigarettes will hurt the long-term prospects of companies like Altria. The industry knows that its days of successfully selling their product in this country are limited, said Dr. David A. Kessler, who called for regulating the tobacco industry as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s and is now dean of the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco. They may be finding favor on Wall Street, but theyre not finding favor in the public arena, he added. There are fewer and fewer places that you can go and smoke in public. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »There are plenty of reasons cigarettes would seem to be a terrible business.

Anti-smoking groups have seized on the report as evidence that the Food and Drug Administration must begin regulating tobacco products. A steady and significant increase in nicotine in cigarettes over the past eight years or so certainly seems worrisome. It sounds as though companies like Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros, are secretly and deceptively increasing the nicotine in their cigarettes and, apparently, lying about it (since they deny the assertions of the report), all in an effort to increase the addictive potential of their cigarettes and harm the publics health. There are, however, a number of problems here. First, though I dont dispute the reports assertion that overall nicotine yields in cigarettes have increased, this does not appear to be the case for Marlboro, the leading cigarette brand that commands over 40 percent of the market. Using the data on nicotine yields of Marlboro cigarettes provided by Philip Morris to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for 1997 through 2006, I conducted my own analysis of the trends in Marlboro nicotine yields. The average nicotine yield of 16 Marlboro brands consistently reported for the entire time period was 1.81 milligrams in 1997; in 2006, it was also 1.81 milligrams. Thus, the average nicotine yield of these cigarettes in 2006 was exactly the same as in 1997, nine years earlier. Second, an increase in nicotine yields does not necessarily mean an increase in the harm to smokers. It is well documented that smokers compensate for changes in nicotine levels to get a relatively constant nicotine dose. This is why light cigarettes are not safer products. The nicotine levels in each cigarette may be lower, but smokers simply smoke more of them, negating the potential benefits of reduced nicotine levels. Indeed, smoking many light cigarettes is every bit as dangerous, if not more so, because of the increased exposure to other pollutants in cigarettes, than smoking fewer regular cigarettes. Similarly, if nicotine yields increase, smokers might be expected to compensate by smoking slightly less. This could actually have a marginally positive health benefit if it reduces overall cigarette consumption. Third, tobacco companies are not necessarily doing anything wrong if they are, in fact, increasing nicotine yields. The paradox of light cigarettes demonstrates that reducing nicotine yields is actually the last thing we would want  it would, again, result only in people smoking more, and thus increasing tar delivery and the resulting carcinogenic health effects. The nicotine in cigarettes is indeed a public health problem. But anti-smoking groups have drawn the wrong conclusion from the Harvard report: the problem isnt whether or not nicotine levels are increasing; its that this deadly, addictive product is available in the first place. For the past two years, public health groups  led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids  have lobbied for passage of legislation that would grant the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco products; shockingly, this bill, which Senator Edward Kennedy is preparing to re-introduce in the next few weeks, would expressly preclude the F.D.A. from simply removing nicotine from cigarettes. It remains unclear why public health groups would support such a provision, though presumably its their attempt to appease Philip Morris, whose support is deemed necessary to get the proposed legislation through Congress. Its not enough to regulate the varying degrees of nicotine in cigarettes. Ultimately, theres only one way to deal with the addictive effects of nicotine, especially on children: grant the F.D.A. the authority to get nicotine out of cigarettes altogether. Anti-smoking groups shouldnt settle for anything less. Michael Siegel is a professor of social and behavioral sciences at Boston University.

Philip Morris did not divert any of its share into the account and will not this year, the company said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/washington/21scotus.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Justices Overturn $79.5 Million Tobacco Ruling<date>Published: February 21, 2007</date><text>WASHINGTON, Feb. 20  The Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned an Oregon jury’s award of $79.5 million in punitive damages against Philip Morris on the ground that jurors might have improperly calculated the figure to punish the cigarette maker for the harm it caused to smokers other than the man whose widow brought the case.

Multimedia Graphic The Opinion Related Text: Supreme Court Ruling (pdf) Multimedia Back Story With The Timess Daniel L. Niemi Although of limited scope, the 5 to 4 decision was a victory for the cigarette industry and for other corporate defendants whose products or behavior have caused widespread injury and who are thus likely to face skeptical or hostile juries. The court was tightly focused on a question of procedural fairness: the need, in the majority’s view, to make sure that juries do not punish defendants for harm to others who are not parties to the lawsuit, or who even may have brought their own lawsuits previously and lost. “The due process clause prohibits a state’s inflicting punishment for harm caused strangers to the litigation,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. The court thus steered clear of the issue that most animates the debate over punitive damages: whether a punitive damage award that is much greater than the compensatory damages awarded by the jury can be considered unconstitutionally excessive. In this case, the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was nearly 100 to one, but the court did not address the issue despite Philip Morris having raised it. What happens next in this lawsuit may provide an early indication of the practical significance of the court’s ruling, as far as it went. The case now goes back to the Oregon Supreme Court, which has options ranging from reinstating the award to ordering a new trial. The original trial of the suit, brought by Mayola Williams, whose husband, Jesse, died of lung cancer after smoking two packs of Marlboros a day for 45 years, took place in 1999. Mrs. Williams’s lawyer asked the jury to “think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the state of Oregon there have been.” The trial judge rejected a request by Philip Morris for an instruction warning the jury that “you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons.” The Supreme Court on Tuesday did not require any particular wording in the form of a jury instruction. But Justice Breyer said that state judicial systems had a constitutional obligation to avoid “an unreasonable and unnecessary risk” that a jury would calculate the punitive damages based on harm to those not before the court. The issue is complicated because, under the Supreme Court’s precedents, the “reprehensibility” of a defendant’s conduct is a factor that a jury is explicitly directed to consider in setting a punitive damages award. Justice Breyer acknowledged that harm to others can serve as a measure of reprehensibility, and that jurors will necessarily consider it. That was appropriate, he said, as long as courts “provide some form of protection” against jurors seeking “to punish the defendant for having caused injury to others.” Sheila L. Birnbaum, a punitive damages specialist with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in New York, said the court was requiring jurors to “unring the bell” in a way that might prove difficult. “It’s very hard for jurors to disregard something they have heard,” she said. Ms. Birnbaum, who successfully argued the most recent punitive damages case heard by the court before this one, on behalf of the State Farm insurance company in 2003, added that the decision was nonetheless “a step in the right direction” for corporate defendants because it would require trial judges and appellate courts to be attentive to the guidance that jurors receive. Justice Breyer’s majority opinion, Philip Morris USA v. Williams, No. 05-1256, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Samuel A. Alito Jr. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. It is typical for the court’s punitive damages rulings to cut across the usual ideological lines. In fact, the only real surprise was the vote by Justice Stevens, who had previously voted with the court’s majority to support limits on punitive damages. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens said he was “firmly convinced” that those earlier decisions were correct. But he said that “in my view the Oregon Supreme Court faithfully applied the reasoning in those opinions to the egregious facts disclosed by this record.” He said that “no procedural error even arguably justifying reversal occurred at the trial in this case.” The court’s two new members, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, succeeded justices who supported limits on punitive damages, as they themselves did on Tuesday. But the narrowness of the court’s opinion and its avoidance of the excessiveness issue raised the question of whether, beneath the surface stability, the court’s polarity may have shifted. In the State Farm case that Ms. Birnbaum argued four years ago, the court overturned a punitive damage award that was 145 times greater than the compensatory award. “Few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio” would meet the test of due process, Justice Kennedy wrote then for a 6-to-3 majority, a strong statement that made the court’s failure on Tuesday to address the 97 to one ratio in the Philip Morris case all the more curious. (The Oregon jury awarded Mrs. Williams $821,000 in compensatory damages.) To hold that a damage award is unconstitutionally excessive requires the court to accept the argument that the due process clause contains a substantive component as well as a procedural one. It is on this basis that Justices Scalia and Thomas, who do not accept the modern doctrine of “substantive due process,” have dissented from the leading punitive damages decisions. It is not implausible that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito might share that view. Whether they do might become apparent if the Oregon Supreme Court reinstates the punitive damages verdict and Philip Morris comes back before the justices with a new appeal based on excessiveness. The dissenters tweaked the majority for what they characterized as judicial activism and refusal to give state courts proper respect. “I would accord more respectful treatment to the proceedings and disposition of state courts that sought diligently to adhere to our changing, less than crystalline precedent,” Justice Ginsburg said in an opinion that Justices Scalia and Thomas also signed. In a prepared statement, William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel of Philip Morris, a unit of Altria, said the decision would give the company “an opportunity to fully and fairly defend itself in this and other cases.” Market analysts generally viewed the decision as positive for industry. “Despite a more narrow opinion than we had hoped for, we view the ruling as a positive as it effectively limits the size of punitive damages in future cases,” said Christopher R. Growe, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, in a note to investors. In recent months, investors have pushed Altria’s stock to record highs, in part because they believe the litigation environment against tobacco companies has significantly improved. On Tuesday, Altria’s stock closed at $85.95, down 25 cents. Andrew Martin contributed reporting.

It stretches the Constitutions guarantee of due process in a way that will make it easier for companies that act reprehensibly to sidestep serious punishments. It also provides unsettling new evidence that the court is more concerned about  and more willing to protect  the powerful than the powerless. An Oregon jury awarded Mayola Williams, the widow of a cigarette smoker, about $821,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages. Ms. Williams argued that Philip Morris had spent 40 years denying the connection between smoking and cancer, even though it knew cigarettes were deadly. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the punitive damages award, saying that Philip Morriss actions had been extraordinarily reprehensible. By keeping Oregonians smoking longer than they otherwise would have, the court said, the companys actions would, naturally and inevitably, lead to significant injury or death. By a 5-to-4 vote that did not follow the usual ideological lines, the court ruled that the award was improper because it punished Philip Morris for harm done to people who were not part of the lawsuit. There is nothing unusual, or wrong, about courts considering the broader impact of a wrongdoers misdeeds. As Justice John Paul Stevens noted in dissent, A murderer who kills his victim by throwing a bomb that injures dozens of bystanders should be punished more severely than one who harms no one other than his intended victim. The fact that Philip Morris hurt so many other smokers along with Jesse Williams is surely relevant to its punishment. The court in recent years has become increasingly activist when it comes to defending the rights of corporations by striking down punitive damage awards. And yesterdays ruling continues that trend. It expands the notion of due process. And it overturns the decisions of a jury and a state supreme court. Unfortunately, the court has been far less activist when ordinary people seek protection or challenge their punishments. The ruling stands in particular contrast with the courts 2003 decision that the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishments did not bar California, under its three strikes law, from sentencing a man to 50 years in prison for stealing $153.53 worth of videotapes. Yesterdays decision is another disturbing sign that  as the current court reads the Constitution  powerful parties have more rights than regular people.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Tobaccos Road Back The number of American smokers usually drops about 1 or 2 percent a year. Government agencies keep adding cigarette taxes and outlawing smoking in restaurants, workplaces and even on public sidewalks. And tobacco companies continue to pay billions of dollars in legal settlements, money that is used in part to produce antismoking ads. For all the industrys apparent troubles, however, the future of cigarettes appears to be brighter than ever. That at least is the message investors are sending as the Altria Group  the company once known as Philip Morris and the maker of the worlds most popular cigarette, Marlboro  prepares to split itself by spinning off its Kraft Foods division to shareholders and become, once again, primarily a tobacco company. Today, Louis C. Camilleri, the chief executive of Altria, is expected to set a timetable for completing the spinoff. It is a move that Wall Street is responding to with the equivalent of a standing ovation, but it is not because Kraft Foods, the worlds second-largest food company, after Nestlé, will finally shed the taint of tobacco. Investors are glad that Altria will finally be rid of Kraft Foods, the maker of Oreo cookies, Velveeta and Tang. Since October, when the company announced its plan for the move, its shares have risen 10 percent. Something that is forgotten in all of this is people like to smoke, said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who noted that United States tobacco stocks have beaten the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index in each of the last six years. Its enjoyable and theres not an alternative product. He added: If frozen dinners get too expensive, people will try something else. Thats not true with cigarettes  you are not up at night worried about that product that is going to make cigarettes obsolete. In the five and a half years since Altria sold 280 million shares of Kraft at $31 each in an initial public offering, the stock has remained relatively unchanged, closing yesterday at $34.83. Altria owns 88.6 percent of Krafts stock. By contrast, shares of Altria have nearly doubled during that period, moving from $47 to yesterdays price of $87.54. It is a remarkable turnabout, considering that in late 2001, Philip Morris announced its plan to change its name to the Altria Group (drawn from the Latin word altus, meaning high, to suggest high performance). At the time, executives said the name change was intended to reduce the damage to the companys reputation that cigarettes were causing, reflected in the long-depressed share price at the time. Now, it is Kraft that is seen by many investors as a hindrance to the company. Why is Wall Street so infatuated with cigarettes? Cigarettes have certain advantages over other consumer products, not the least of which is that they are addictive. They are inexpensive to make, require almost no innovation, there is a global market for them, and cigarette makers can raise prices without seeing much of a drop in business. On top of all that, a recent string of court decisions has convinced investors that the worst of the litigation against tobacco companies is over. That, in turn, has allowed Altria to move forward with a revamping that begins with cutting Kraft loose and will ultimately allow Altria to use the huge amounts of cash generated by cigarettes to buy back stock or acquire other tobacco companies, particularly overseas. You take away Kraft out of Altria and you are left with a balance sheet that is extremely strong, said Charles Norton, portfolio manager at the Vice Fund, a mutual fund that invests in tobacco, gambling, alcohol and military contractors. Altria is the funds biggest holding. Its just a cash cow. The free cash flow on this business is just tremendous. The future prospects are particularly attractive in developing countries, where smoking has not yet declined as it has in more developed parts of the world like the United States and Europe. In China, for instance, the Philip Morris International unit of Altria signed a deal in 2005 that allows it to manufacture and sell Marlboro cigarettes to the countrys 350 million smokers. There are an estimated 1.3 billion smokers worldwide. But even in the United States, with 45 million smokers, the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria continues to generate sizable profits by raising prices. It also hopes eventually to lure consumers with new tobacco products, including a small tea-bag-like pouch that is smoke-free, spit-free and tucks into the cheek. It says it is also working on developing cigarettes that are less harmful. The exciting part for me, said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup, is that tobacco use today will evolve. Its unlikely that there will ever be a 100 percent safe cigarette, but we feel that a reduced-risk cigarette is on the horizon. But some health advocates say that the diminished social acceptability of cigarettes will hurt the long-term prospects of companies like Altria. The industry knows that its days of successfully selling their product in this country are limited, said Dr. David A. Kessler, who called for regulating the tobacco industry as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s and is now dean of the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco. They may be finding favor on Wall Street, but theyre not finding favor in the public arena, he added. There are fewer and fewer places that you can go and smoke in public. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »There are plenty of reasons cigarettes would seem to be a terrible business.

Anti-smoking groups have seized on the report as evidence that the Food and Drug Administration must begin regulating tobacco products. A steady and significant increase in nicotine in cigarettes over the past eight years or so certainly seems worrisome. It sounds as though companies like Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros, are secretly and deceptively increasing the nicotine in their cigarettes and, apparently, lying about it (since they deny the assertions of the report), all in an effort to increase the addictive potential of their cigarettes and harm the publics health. There are, however, a number of problems here. First, though I dont dispute the reports assertion that overall nicotine yields in cigarettes have increased, this does not appear to be the case for Marlboro, the leading cigarette brand that commands over 40 percent of the market. Using the data on nicotine yields of Marlboro cigarettes provided by Philip Morris to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for 1997 through 2006, I conducted my own analysis of the trends in Marlboro nicotine yields. The average nicotine yield of 16 Marlboro brands consistently reported for the entire time period was 1.81 milligrams in 1997; in 2006, it was also 1.81 milligrams. Thus, the average nicotine yield of these cigarettes in 2006 was exactly the same as in 1997, nine years earlier. Second, an increase in nicotine yields does not necessarily mean an increase in the harm to smokers. It is well documented that smokers compensate for changes in nicotine levels to get a relatively constant nicotine dose. This is why light cigarettes are not safer products. The nicotine levels in each cigarette may be lower, but smokers simply smoke more of them, negating the potential benefits of reduced nicotine levels. Indeed, smoking many light cigarettes is every bit as dangerous, if not more so, because of the increased exposure to other pollutants in cigarettes, than smoking fewer regular cigarettes. Similarly, if nicotine yields increase, smokers might be expected to compensate by smoking slightly less. This could actually have a marginally positive health benefit if it reduces overall cigarette consumption. Third, tobacco companies are not necessarily doing anything wrong if they are, in fact, increasing nicotine yields. The paradox of light cigarettes demonstrates that reducing nicotine yields is actually the last thing we would want  it would, again, result only in people smoking more, and thus increasing tar delivery and the resulting carcinogenic health effects. The nicotine in cigarettes is indeed a public health problem. But anti-smoking groups have drawn the wrong conclusion from the Harvard report: the problem isnt whether or not nicotine levels are increasing; its that this deadly, addictive product is available in the first place. For the past two years, public health groups  led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids  have lobbied for passage of legislation that would grant the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco products; shockingly, this bill, which Senator Edward Kennedy is preparing to re-introduce in the next few weeks, would expressly preclude the F.D.A. from simply removing nicotine from cigarettes. It remains unclear why public health groups would support such a provision, though presumably its their attempt to appease Philip Morris, whose support is deemed necessary to get the proposed legislation through Congress. Its not enough to regulate the varying degrees of nicotine in cigarettes. Ultimately, theres only one way to deal with the addictive effects of nicotine, especially on children: grant the F.D.A. the authority to get nicotine out of cigarettes altogether. Anti-smoking groups shouldnt settle for anything less. Michael Siegel is a professor of social and behavioral sciences at Boston University. More Articles in Opinion »Boston ACCORDING to a report released last week by the Harvard School of Public Health, cigarette companies have been steadily increasing the nicotine yield of their cigarettes  the report describes an average total increase of 11 percent from 1998 to 2005. Anti-smoking groups have seized on the report as evidence that the Food and Drug Administration must begin regulating tobacco products. A steady and significant increase in nicotine in cigarettes over the past eight years or so certainly seems worrisome. It sounds as though companies like Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros, are secretly and deceptively increasing the nicotine in their cigarettes and, apparently, lying about it (since they deny the assertions of the report), all in an effort to increase the addictive potential of their cigarettes and harm the publics health. There are, however, a number of problems here. First, though I dont dispute the reports assertion that overall nicotine yields in cigarettes have increased, this does not appear to be the case for Marlboro, the leading cigarette brand that commands over 40 percent of the market. Using the data on nicotine yields of Marlboro cigarettes provided by Philip Morris to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for 1997 through 2006, I conducted my own analysis of the trends in Marlboro nicotine yields. The average nicotine yield of 16 Marlboro brands consistently reported for the entire time period was 1.81 milligrams in 1997; in 2006, it was also 1.81 milligrams. Thus, the average nicotine yield of these cigarettes in 2006 was exactly the same as in 1997, nine years earlier. Second, an increase in nicotine yields does not necessarily mean an increase in the harm to smokers. It is well documented that smokers compensate for changes in nicotine levels to get a relatively constant nicotine dose. This is why light cigarettes are not safer products. The nicotine levels in each cigarette may be lower, but smokers simply smoke more of them, negating the potential benefits of reduced nicotine levels. Indeed, smoking many light cigarettes is every bit as dangerous, if not more so, because of the increased exposure to other pollutants in cigarettes, than smoking fewer regular cigarettes. Similarly, if nicotine yields increase, smokers might be expected to compensate by smoking slightly less. This could actually have a marginally positive health benefit if it reduces overall cigarette consumption. Third, tobacco companies are not necessarily doing anything wrong if they are, in fact, increasing nicotine yields. The paradox of light cigarettes demonstrates that reducing nicotine yields is actually the last thing we would want  it would, again, result only in people smoking more, and thus increasing tar delivery and the resulting carcinogenic health effects. The nicotine in cigarettes is indeed a public health problem. But anti-smoking groups have drawn the wrong conclusion from the Harvard report: the problem isnt whether or not nicotine levels are increasing; its that this deadly, addictive product is available in the first place. For the past two years, public health groups  led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids  have lobbied for passage of legislation that would grant the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco products; shockingly, this bill, which Senator Edward Kennedy is preparing to re-introduce in the next few weeks, would expressly preclude the F.D.A. from simply removing nicotine from cigarettes.

The justices, without comment, left intact an Illinois Supreme Court decision that threw out the case against Philip Morris, which is a division of the Altria Group and is the nation’s largest cigarette maker. Antismoking activists had hoped the verdict would be the first in a series of awards around the country against the industry over light cigarettes. “It’s clearly the end of lights litigation in Illinois,” said David Adelman, a Morgan Stanley analyst who has an overweight rating on Altria. Altria shares fell 33 cents, to $83.42, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. In overturning the award last year, the Illinois Supreme Court said smokers could not invoke a state consumer protection law because the Federal Trade Commission had endorsed the “light” and “low tar” descriptions in settlements with other cigarette makers. Like many states, Illinois bars claims over actions specifically authorized by a government agency. Supreme Court intervention might have complicated plans by Altria, which is based in New York, to spin off its Kraft Foods unit. On Nov. 16, Altria’s chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said the company was ready to split off the food company, pointing to what he said was a waning risk of costly tobacco-related awards. The tobacco industry is still defending a separate nationwide class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in New York on behalf of light cigarette smokers. That suit, which invokes federal racketeering law, also raises questions about the legal force of the F.T.C. settlements. Arguments in Major Antitrust Case WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (AP)  The Supreme Court pressed both sides Monday in a case that turns on the question of how much evidence plaintiffs must provide to litigate a private antitrust-conspiracy suit. Some experts consider the case, Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, which stems from the deregulation of the telecommunications industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as the most important antitrust case to reach the Supreme Court in 20 years. The class-action suit was filed in 2003 on behalf of United States consumers of local telephone and Internet service, claiming that incumbent local telephone companies, or Baby Bells, illegally conspired to prevent competition by excluding new local phone companies from their territories and agreeing not to compete against each other. The original seven incumbent local phone companies have been reduced to four through mergers and acquisitions: Verizon Communications, the BellSouth Corporation, Qwest Communications and AT&amp;T. A federal district court dismissed the case, saying plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to show that a conspiracy would most likely be proved at trial. That decision was reversed by the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which ruled in October 2005 that a plaintiff must submit only a “short and plain statement of the claim” to survive a motion to dismiss. The case is being closely watched by numerous companies, who contend that a low standard would allow “meritless” and “abusive” cases to go forward. But the plaintiffs argue that a higher standard could make it too difficult for individuals to bring valid antitrust cases.

Its Web site brims with information on the dangers of smoking, and it has mounted a campaign of television spots that urge parents, oh so earnestly, to warn their children against smoking.

All this seems to fly against the economic interests of the company, which presumably depends on a continuing crop of new smokers to replace those who drop out or die from their habit. But in practice, it turns out, these industry-run campaigns are notably ineffective and possibly even a sham. New research shows that the ads aimed at youths had no discernible effect in discouraging smoking and that the ads currently aimed at parents may be counterproductive. That disturbing insight comes from a study just published in The American Journal of Public Health by respected academic researchers who were supported by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Using sophisticated analytical techniques, the researchers concluded that the ads aimed directly at young people had no beneficial effect, while those aimed at parents were actually harmful to young people apt to see them, especially older teenagers. The greater the teenagers’ potential exposure to the ads, the stronger their intention to smoke and the greater their likelihood of having smoked in the past 30 days. Just why the costly advertising campaigns produce no health benefits is a rich subject for exploration. The ads are fuzzy-warm, which could actually generate favorable feelings for the tobacco industry and, by extension, its products. And their theme  that adults should tell young people not to smoke mostly because they are young people  is exactly the sort of message that would make many teenagers feel like lighting up.

The most exhaustive judicial analysis of the industry’s tactics, by Judge Gladys Kessler of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, concluded that the youth smoking prevention programs were not really designed to effectively prevent youth smoking but rather to head off a government crackdown. They are minimally financed compared with the vast sums spent on cigarette marketing and promotion; they are understaffed and run by people with no expertise; and they ignore the strategies that have proved effective in preventing adolescent smoking. The television ads, for example, do not stress the deadly and addictive impacts of smoking, an emphasis that has been shown to work in other antitobacco campaigns. Philip Morris says it has spent more than $1 billion on its youth smoking prevention programs since 1998 and that it devised its current advertising campaign on the advice of experts who deem parental influence extremely important. But the company has done only the skimpiest research on how the campaign is working. It cites June 2006 data indicating that 37 percent of parents with children age 10 to 17 were both aware of its ads and spoke to their children about not smoking. How the children reacted has not been explored. And somehow the company forgot to tell the parents, as role models, to stop smoking themselves. Philip Morris, the industry’s biggest and most influential company, is renowned for its marketing savvy.

Last month in Brazil, at the last race of the season, AT&amp;T announced a multiyear deal to become lead sponsor of the Williams team, the highest-profile involvement in Formula One for the American telecommunications company. Days earlier, the Dutch bank ING Group detailed a broad sponsorship of the Renault team, the first involvement in the sport for ING. The bank said it would also sponsor the first race of the season, in Melbourne, Australia. Last week, Grupo Santander, a Spanish bank, announced a five-year deal to support the McLaren Mercedes team, joining Mutua Madrileña, a Spanish insurer, on the McLaren roster. Now executives at these and other brands, as well as the racing teams they support, are scrambling to put together marketing strategies for the next season, which begins in March. The flurry of activity comes as Formula One draws ever closer to ending its long-term relationship with tobacco companies. With regulators in Europe and elsewhere moving to close some of the last loopholes that permitted cigarette companies to sponsor auto racing, the hundreds of millions of dollars that these brands used to lavish on Formula One are dwindling. As of next season, two tobacco brands that have long been high-profile Formula One sponsors will be out of the circuit. Mild Seven, owned by Japan Tobacco, has ended its relationship with the Renault team, while a deal between British American Tobaccos Lucky Strike brand and the Honda team has also expired. Other cigarette brands, like West and Benson &amp; Hedges, previously bowed out. Tobacco brands had been willing to pay a premium for these sponsorships because Formula One was one of the last marketing options left for the industry. With that money now disappearing, some teams feared a financing crisis. Instead, analysts say, as racing executives prepare to gather next week in Monaco for a conference on the commercial side of the sport, the sponsorship market looks surprisingly healthy. The departure of the tobacco brands may actually have helped to attract a new kind of marketer, analysts say. The recent agreements are not the first involving banks and telecommunication firms, but the ING and AT&amp;T deals give these brands so-called title sponsorships at some of the most prominent teams  positions that in the past were typically held by tobacco brands. For the financial services community, this is an opportunity to get involved in one of the only sports available that actually reaches a truly global audience, said Nanne Bos, a spokesman for ING. Global television audiences for the races typically are rivaled by only a few other annual sporting events, including the Champions League soccer final and the Super Bowl in America, said Kevin Alavy, a London-based analyst at Initiative, a media-buying agency. Jean-François Caubet, a spokesman for Renault, acknowledged that the deal with ING was slightly less lucrative than the Mild Seven sponsorship, though he declined to provide numbers. But he said the new arrangement would be more valuable for Renault, adding that the French carmaker planned to step up its promotional spending for the Formula One team. The problem we had with a tobacco company is that it was difficult to build a global communications strategy around it, Mr. Caubet said, noting that in the past, Renault had to block out the Mild Seven logo on much of the promotional material.

Philip Morris, a unit of the Altria Group and the largest cigarette maker in the nation, has said it might be forced into bankruptcy court if it is ordered to post the full $12 billion.Judge Byron said any order he made in the case would leave one side or the other unhappy.''I saw concepts here that have to be addressed by an appellate court,'' he said.The judge's proposal is essentially the same as in his April 14 order, the only substantial difference being the guaranteed $100 million that would remain if Philip Morris were to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Under the order, Philip Morris agreed to pay $800 million in cash and pledge a $6 billion note that Altria Group issued a year ago. With most of the amount coming in a note, the smokers said they would not be adequately protected.Because the first cash payment is not due for several months, the proposed $100 million would not be guaranteed safe from bankruptcy until the end of the year, leaving the plaintiffs in a difficult spot, said a lawyer, Stephen Tillery.''We want to begin the appellate process as quick as we can,'' said William Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris vice president and associate general counsel.''We want to comply with the judge's order as quickly as possible,'' he added. ''At some point we have to conclude the process here.''Altria shares fell 34 cents, or about 1.1 percent, to $31.03 today on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/us/shift-in-bonds-has-states-rethinking-tobacco-plans.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Shift in Bonds Has States Rethinking Tobacco Plans<date>Published: April 10, 2003</date><text>State governments from New York to Oregon are pulling back from their plans to borrow directly against future payments of tobacco settlements and are scrambling to find other ways to use the payments to ease their expanding financial problems.An Illinois judgment last month against Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, prompted investors to demand higher interest rates on bonds backed by the tobacco payments.As a result, some states, like California, have delayed their plans to enter the tobacco bond market. Others, like New York, which saw tobacco borrowing as central to closing its budget gap, are finding other ways to borrow using the tobacco payments. In those cases, the states are paying less to borrow but are taking on more long-range risk.Only three months ago, governors saw the billions of dollars in payouts from the nation's cigarette makers as a magic elixir for various financial crises.Turning the revenue from a 1998 settlement into immediate cash was accepted by Democrats and Republicans alike as a palatable alternative to less popular budget fixes, like tax increases or service cuts.But Philip Morris's warning that it might forgo its next payment to the states next week and could face bankruptcy if it has to post a $12 billion bond to appeal the Illinois judgment, has taken the shine off the pot of tobacco gold. Even if the Philip Morris situation is resolved, the tobacco bonds are still tainted.States are now coming up with new ways to tap a combined $206 billion in tobacco payments they are owed over 25 years.''The risk of these bonds has obviously been raised,'' said Lee Dixon, director of the health policy tracking service at the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''It is certainly chilling the states' actions. How long it stalls it, I really could not predict.''The states' responses run the gamut. Virginia canceled its $767 million tobacco bond sale April 1. California has put off its $2.3 billion issue scheduled for next week and paused to consider its options. Oregon and Missouri are turning to alternative bonds, freer of the tobacco taint. Colorado, Illinois, Indiana and Kansas are mulling their options.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/04/opinion/too-costly-an-appeal.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Too Costly an Appeal<date>Published: April 04, 2003</date><text>When it comes to civil lawsuits, tobacco companies are high on the list of disliked defendants. That makes it even more important that judges be vigilant in making sure that cigarette makers, like other unpopular parties, are given the full protection of constitutional due process. Mindful of that, an Illinois trial court acted wrongly when it required Philip Morris to post a $12 billion bond before it could appeal an adverse judgment.On March 21, Judge Nicholas Byron of Madison County, Ill., found Philip Morris, now a subsidiary of the virtuous-sounding Altria, liable in a class-action lawsuit. The plaintiffs, more than a million smokers, convinced the judge that despite federally mandated warnings, they had been fraudulently misled by Philip Morris into believing that light and low-tar cigarettes were less harmful. The judge awarded them $7.1 billion in damages, their lawyers $1.78 billion and Illinois $3 billion. He then set the appeal bond required at the total liability, plus interest.Whatever the merits of the underlying decision, it is absurd to require someone -- even a cigarette manufacturer -- to put up $12 billion to file an appeal. That is the kind of ruling that erodes the credibility of our legal system.Even if Philip Morris fails to overturn the judge's ruling on appeal, it stands a good chance of getting those damages reduced. Yet in making an appeal so prohibitively costly -- the company claims that it would have to file for bankruptcy to post it -- Judge Byron renders the right to an appeal nearly meaningless, thus violating the defendant's due process rights. The plaintiffs may hope that the situation forces Philip Morris to settle now, but such pressure would be akin to extortion.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/27/business/ratings-of-tobacco-bonds-face-possible-downgrading.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Ratings of Tobacco Bonds Face Possible Downgrading<date>Published: March 27, 2003</date><text>Fitch Ratings said yesterday that it might downgrade the credit ratings for about $18 billion of tobacco bonds in the near future because of last week's $10.1 billion court judgment against Philip Morris.The announcement, which includes about $6 billion in tobacco bonds issued by New York, New York City and New Jersey, did not lead to an immediate sell-off in the sector.But if the bond credit ratings are reduced it will mean that many states, including New York, will have to pay higher interest rates if they want to use tobacco bonds to help cover their state budgets. The two top legislative leaders in New York agreed on Tuesday to a compromise that would include the issuing of $700 million in tobacco bonds.To generate revenue now, states are selling municipal bonds tied to some or all of the first 25 years of expected payments from the tobacco companies, under a pact signed with 46 states that has been valued at $206 billion. The rush of states to use this deficit plug has already flooded the municipal bond market with about $18 billion in bonds and pushed yields higher to attract investors.In its announcement, Fitch said that the decision to put the tobacco bonds on what is called rating watch negative was prompted by the decision Monday to put the Altria Group, the parent of Philip Morris, on the same watch list, with the threat of a credit downgrading.Last Friday, a judge in Madison County, Ill., ruled that Philip Morris must pay a $10.1 billion settlement. To appeal that judgment, Philip Morris has to put up a bond of about $12 billion. Michael Dean, a managing director in the asset-backed securities group at Fitch, said that if all $12 billion were put up for the bond, Fitch would be concerned ''about the short-term financial flexibility'' of Philip Morris.It is possible that Philip Morris could obtain a court waiver that would allow a smaller amount to be put up on appeal. In addition, Philip Morris is seeking legislation from the Illinois Legislature that would exempt all the companies that signed the tobacco agreement from such appeal bonds.With Altria faced with a credit downgrading, Fitch had to re-evaluate the financial health of the tobacco industry and its ability to make the payments under the agreement reached with the government, Mr. Dean said. And that led to the decision to put the tobacco bonds on the watch list.But the Fitch statement said that a downgrading for Altria did not necessarily mean a downgrading for the tobacco industry as a whole and, therefore, the tobacco bonds. In addition, Fitch can decide after review not to downgrade the current credit rating of the tobacco bonds.The current rating, which is not official, for the tobacco industry over all is A and all the official ratings on the tobacco bonds are A- to A+. Mr. Dean said he expected a decision to be made within a month.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/08/us/juries-rule-for-tobacco-companies-in-2-suits.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Juries Rule for Tobacco Companies in 2 Suits<date>Published: February 08, 2003</date><text>Tobacco companies won victories yesterday in separate court cases brought by a longtime smoker who contracted terminal cancer and by a flight attendant who said secondhand smoke in airplanes worsened his lung disease.A state court jury in Sacramento ruled that two tobacco companies, Philip Morris U.S.A. and the R.

Others, like New York, which saw tobacco borrowing as central to closing its budget gap, are finding other ways to borrow using the tobacco payments. In those cases, the states are paying less to borrow but are taking on more long-range risk.Only three months ago, governors saw the billions of dollars in payouts from the nation's cigarette makers as a magic elixir for various financial crises.Turning the revenue from a 1998 settlement into immediate cash was accepted by Democrats and Republicans alike as a palatable alternative to less popular budget fixes, like tax increases or service cuts.But Philip Morris's warning that it might forgo its next payment to the states next week and could face bankruptcy if it has to post a $12 billion bond to appeal the Illinois judgment, has taken the shine off the pot of tobacco gold. Even if the Philip Morris situation is resolved, the tobacco bonds are still tainted.States are now coming up with new ways to tap a combined $206 billion in tobacco payments they are owed over 25 years.''The risk of these bonds has obviously been raised,'' said Lee Dixon, director of the health policy tracking service at the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''It is certainly chilling the states' actions. How long it stalls it, I really could not predict.''The states' responses run the gamut. Virginia canceled its $767 million tobacco bond sale April 1. California has put off its $2.3 billion issue scheduled for next week and paused to consider its options. Oregon and Missouri are turning to alternative bonds, freer of the tobacco taint. Colorado, Illinois, Indiana and Kansas are mulling their options.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/04/opinion/too-costly-an-appeal.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Too Costly an Appeal<date>Published: April 04, 2003</date><text>When it comes to civil lawsuits, tobacco companies are high on the list of disliked defendants.

McCoy of Los Angeles County Superior Court, ruled on a request by Philip Morris, which argued that the punitive award was excessive and that it would probably face similar cases and could not pay $3 billion to every plaintiff.In June, a jury awarded the plaintiff, Richard Boeken, 56, $3 billion in punitive damages in addition to $5.5 million in compensatory damages. It was the largest award in an individual lawsuit against a tobacco company.Mr. Boeken, a lifelong smoker with lung cancer, said in his suit that he was the victim of a tobacco industry campaign that portrayed smoking as ''cool'' but concealed its dangers.Unless Mr. Boeken agrees to settle for $100 million by Aug. 24, Philip Morris will be granted a new trial ''solely on the issue of punitive damages,'' Judge McCoy wrote.The judge added that the evidence was ''sufficient to support a punitive damages verdict.''Judge McCoy, who presided over the trial, denied a request by Philip Morris for a new trial on grounds that he had erred in refusing to let the company present evidence of Mr. Boeken's criminal record. The company contended that the convictions challenged the credibility of Mr. Boeken's assertion that he believed smoking was safe.In the 1970's Mr. Boeken was convicted of two felonies involving stolen property and possession of a small amount of heroin.In 1993, he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of aiding and abetting wire fraud. The case involved telephone sales of oil and gas properties in Wyoming from 1986 to 1988. Mr. Boeken testified against a former boss, pleaded guilty to the felony and was ordered to pay a fine and $50,000 in restitution.Judge McCoy ruled at the trial that Mr. Boeken's convictions were irrelevant to the tobacco lawsuit and could prejudice the jury.Mr. Boeken said he began smoking cigarettes at age 13 and smoked at least two packs of Marlboros daily for more than 40 years. His lawyer said Mr. Boeken was able to break addictions to heroin and alcohol, but resumed smoking after trying to quit several times.In 1999 Mr. Boeken was found to have lung cancer, which then spread to his lymph nodes, back and brain. He quit smoking for eight months after the diagnosis but later resumed.Correction: August 11, 2001, Saturday An article by The Associated Press yesterday about a Los Angeles County judge's rejection of a $3 billion damage award in a smoker's lawsuit against Philip Morris referred incorrectly to the offer of $100 million that replaced it. The sum was proposed by the judge himself, not offered by Philip Morris.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/10/business/investing-can-kraft-lay-enough-golden-eggs.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Investing; Can Kraft Lay Enough Golden Eggs?<date>Published: June 10, 2001</date><text>KRAFT is America's biggest food company by almost any measure. Its brands, including Maxwell House coffee, Oreo cookies, Jell-O pudding, Velveeta, Philadelphia cream cheese, Kool-Aid and Oscar Mayer hot dogs, are consumed in most American homes, and it dwarfs its domestic competitors.But whether Kraft shares are a good deal for investors is likely to hinge on whether its earnings can be expected to increase faster than a typical food company's.Philip Morris, the corporate parent of Kraft Foods, is selling 16 percent of its subsidiary this week, in what is likely to be the second-largest initial offering by an American company. The 280 million shares are expected to be priced from $27 to $30 a share. At $30, Kraft, based in Northfield, Ill., would raise $8.4 billion. (The largest initial offering was AT&amp;T Wireless in April 2000, at $10.6 billion.) At this price range, Kraft would have a market capitalization of more than $50 billion -- more than three times the size of Sara Lee, the second-largest domestic food company.People who believe that Kraft's shares will rise appreciably are convinced that the company can increase its earnings at a faster pace than its peers. They argue that Kraft has an advantage derived from economies of scale. And they say Kraft's earnings will be bolstered by improvements in its balance sheet and by acquisitions.''We think this belongs in the company of elite consumer-goods companies,'' says Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation in New York.Investors like Mr. Ghriskey, who put Kraft in the company of consumer giants like Procter &amp; Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, are inclined to look at the midpoint of the price range, $28.50 a share, as a good deal. But those who place Kraft among food companies like Heinz, General Mills and Campbell consider this price rather rich.A RESEARCH report on April 24 by Goldman, Sachs, which is not involved in the deal, compared Kraft with other food companies. According to Goldman's analysis, even the midpoint price would be high. Romitha S. Mally, the author of the report, told investors on April 27 that a fair price for Kraft's initial offering would be $25 a share. The Goldman report said that the stock should be priced at nine times estimated 2001 Ebitda -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- and that it would be a good buy at up to $28 a share.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/07/business/philip-morris-seeks-backers-for-tobacco-legislation.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Philip Morris Seeks Backers for Tobacco Legislation<date>Published: June 07, 2001</date><text>Three years after its last attempt to spur legislation that would have empowered the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the marketing of cigarettes, Philip Morris is shopping around the contours of a bill that would, once again, let the agency limit the tobacco industry's reach. But in contrast to its last efforts, the company is having a hard time finding Congressional backers for its plan.The company's latest endeavor comes just one year after winning a Supreme Court ruling that the F.D.A. does not have the authority to regulate cigarettes as a drug or a medical device. Yet the company is still hoping lawmakers will enable the agency to limit tobacco marketing, curb youth smoking and require more warning labels on cigarette packs.In recent months, Philip Morris says it has met with Congressional leaders from both parties, as well as most of the members of the Senate and House committees that oversee the F.D.A., searching for a champion for its regulatory agenda. What it has found, however, is that volunteers are in very short supply.''There hasn't even been a hearing,'' said Steven C. Parrish, head of legislative affairs for Philip Morris. ''It's going to be tough to get anything passed this year.''Not that Philip Morris is masquerading as an antitobacco crusader. On the contrary, the company believes that regulation will actually make it easier to do business, setting a single standard on issues like labeling instead of a different one for every state. With the F.D.A.'s blessing, cigarette companies could also start selling so-called safer cigarettes, which contain fewer carcinogens, without worrying that the agency would punish them for making unapproved health claims.But aside from a general skepticism about regulation among many Republicans and a distrust of the company's motives by many Democrats, Philip Morris is fast finding that tobacco is no longer the pressing issue in Congress that it was just a few years ago.In 1998, under mounting pressure from antismoking advocates and state attorneys general, the tobacco industry enlisted lawmakers from both parties to create legislation that included the regulation of cigarette marketing and advertising. Spearheaded by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the effort quickly disintegrated into a partisan brawl as legislators piled amendments upon amendments, trying to fashion a bill to their liking.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/31/nyregion/in-business-purchase-of-nabisco-means-more-workers-in-rye.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">IN BUSINESS; Purchase of Nabisco Means More Workers in Rye<date>Published: December 31, 2000</date><text>Philip Morris's $18.9 billion purchase of Nabisco Holdings means about 40 more employees will be working at Philip Morris's Kraft Foods International headquarters in Rye Brook, Jane Barr, a spokeswoman, said.

Now some magazine publishers, after seeing a market research study released last week, are hoping to recoup some of that lost money -- but Philip Morris is not budging.After the Massachusetts Public Health Department released a study in May that said cigarette advertising in magazines with a significant percentage of teenage readers had increased in the first nine months of 1999 by almost $30 million, to $119.9 million, the tobacco companies wanted to burnish their public images.The Massachusetts study specifically criticized the Marlboro-Spears combination in Rolling Stone.In June, Philip Morris said it would suspend cigarette advertising in the 41 publications -- those in which readers younger than 18 make up 15 percent or more of the total readership, or in magazines that have more than two million readers younger than 18.Some publishers decided to fight back. Cosmopolitan magazine -- which took in $6.5 million in tobacco advertising in 1999, according to Competitive Media Reporting -- commissioned its own study, using twice the data of the two market-research firms that Philip Morris had consulted, according to Susan Plagemann, the publisher of Cosmopolitan. Donna Kalajian Lagani, the publishing director of the Cosmopolitan group, said that the survey proved that Cosmopolitan would indeed qualify for Philip Morris advertising.Last week, the Simmons Market Research Bureau, an independent research firm, released its study of teenage readership. And 18 magazines -- most of which appeared on Philip Morris's list -- are now, according to the study, eligible for the company's advertising. (Rolling Stone still does not qualify, but Cosmopolitan does.)Some publishers do not expect the research to change Philip Morris's plans. Kent Brownridge, the general manager of Wenner Media, publishers of Us Weekly and Rolling Stone, said that Philip Morris simply wanted to appear to be doing the right thing.Mr. Brownridge said the magazine executives at Hearst, which publishes Cosmopolitan, were a bunch of ''whining crybabies'' for commissioning their own study and ought to just get used to the fact that Philip Morris will not advertise in Cosmopolitan.Ms. Kalajian Lagani differed.''Well, I hope he is not right,'' she said. ''We have been told by Philip Morris that they would evaluate the new Simmons research and make decisions based on the new research.''But Tom Ryan, a Philip Morris spokesman, said the company would stay out of Cosmopolitan for now.''At this point, we are not currently reconsidering making changes in our advertising practices or the publications in which we run brand advertising,'' he said.

The World Health Organization, which is spearheading the push for a tough international agreement to curb smoking by 2003, made its views plain. It wrapped conference papers in a cover that took direct aim at the best-selling Marlboro cigarette brand. Silhouetted against an orange sky, one cowboy tells the other, ''Bob, I've got cancer.''The agency also became the first United Nations body every to hold two days of public hearings on tobacco which were dominated by anti-smoking groups. Philip Morris, which makes the top-selling Marlboro brand, and British American Tobacco (BAT) were unusually contrite, acknowledging that their products are deadly and addictive.They made clear, however, that they will resist stringent global rules, insisting that they are free to sell and advertise their wares. ''Today, with near-universal awareness of the health risks, a billion adults choose to smoke,'' said Christopher Proctor, BAT's science director, who argued that regulatory schemes can only work at the national level.The negotiations here will be fierce, tussling over whether to ban tobacco multinationals from advertising and sponsoring sports events; whether to increase taxes to make cigarettes more expensive, and whether to discourage tobacco growing and adopt measures to deter young people from smoking.The World Health Organization maintains that tobacco use already kills four million people annually and will worsen over the next two decades. Unchecked, tobacco's death toll will rise to 10 million yearly by 2030, according to the agency, which would take huge chunks out of budgets of both rich and poor countries.American medical groups have argued in recent days that the consequences of inaction are dire, and urged the Clinton administration to apply its tough domestic smoking stand to the international arena. ''If smoking is not curbed, China alone will have one million lung cancer deaths in 2025,'' said Dr. Randolph D. Smoak, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, who recently returned from China, where about 70 percent of men smoke.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/13/nyregion/in-new-york-a-record-fine-over-lobbying.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">In New York, A Record Fine Over Lobbying<date>Published: November 13, 1999</date><text>Philip Morris has agreed to pay a $75,000 fine, the largest ever imposed by state lobbying regulators, for underreporting the amount of money it spent to lobby New York lawmakers on tobacco legislation, officials announced today.In addition, one of the company's chief lobbyists in the Capitol has been barred from lobbying on any issue before state government for three years, as part of a settlement with the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying. The lobbyist, Sharon T.

But in contrast to its last efforts, the company is having a hard time finding Congressional backers for its plan.The company's latest endeavor comes just one year after winning a Supreme Court ruling that the F.D.A. does not have the authority to regulate cigarettes as a drug or a medical device. Yet the company is still hoping lawmakers will enable the agency to limit tobacco marketing, curb youth smoking and require more warning labels on cigarette packs.In recent months, Philip Morris says it has met with Congressional leaders from both parties, as well as most of the members of the Senate and House committees that oversee the F.D.A., searching for a champion for its regulatory agenda. What it has found, however, is that volunteers are in very short supply.''There hasn't even been a hearing,'' said Steven C. Parrish, head of legislative affairs for Philip Morris. ''It's going to be tough to get anything passed this year.''Not that Philip Morris is masquerading as an antitobacco crusader. On the contrary, the company believes that regulation will actually make it easier to do business, setting a single standard on issues like labeling instead of a different one for every state. With the F.D.A.'s blessing, cigarette companies could also start selling so-called safer cigarettes, which contain fewer carcinogens, without worrying that the agency would punish them for making unapproved health claims.But aside from a general skepticism about regulation among many Republicans and a distrust of the company's motives by many Democrats, Philip Morris is fast finding that tobacco is no longer the pressing issue in Congress that it was just a few years ago.In 1998, under mounting pressure from antismoking advocates and state attorneys general, the tobacco industry enlisted lawmakers from both parties to create legislation that included the regulation of cigarette marketing and advertising. Spearheaded by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the effort quickly disintegrated into a partisan brawl as legislators piled amendments upon amendments, trying to fashion a bill to their liking.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/31/nyregion/in-business-purchase-of-nabisco-means-more-workers-in-rye.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">IN BUSINESS; Purchase of Nabisco Means More Workers in Rye<date>Published: December 31, 2000</date><text>Philip Morris's $18.9 billion purchase of Nabisco Holdings means about 40 more employees will be working at Philip Morris's Kraft Foods International headquarters in Rye Brook, Jane Barr, a spokeswoman, said.

Now some magazine publishers, after seeing a market research study released last week, are hoping to recoup some of that lost money -- but Philip Morris is not budging.After the Massachusetts Public Health Department released a study in May that said cigarette advertising in magazines with a significant percentage of teenage readers had increased in the first nine months of 1999 by almost $30 million, to $119.9 million, the tobacco companies wanted to burnish their public images.The Massachusetts study specifically criticized the Marlboro-Spears combination in Rolling Stone.In June, Philip Morris said it would suspend cigarette advertising in the 41 publications -- those in which readers younger than 18 make up 15 percent or more of the total readership, or in magazines that have more than two million readers younger than 18.Some publishers decided to fight back. Cosmopolitan magazine -- which took in $6.5 million in tobacco advertising in 1999, according to Competitive Media Reporting -- commissioned its own study, using twice the data of the two market-research firms that Philip Morris had consulted, according to Susan Plagemann, the publisher of Cosmopolitan. Donna Kalajian Lagani, the publishing director of the Cosmopolitan group, said that the survey proved that Cosmopolitan would indeed qualify for Philip Morris advertising.Last week, the Simmons Market Research Bureau, an independent research firm, released its study of teenage readership. And 18 magazines -- most of which appeared on Philip Morris's list -- are now, according to the study, eligible for the company's advertising. (Rolling Stone still does not qualify, but Cosmopolitan does.)Some publishers do not expect the research to change Philip Morris's plans. Kent Brownridge, the general manager of Wenner Media, publishers of Us Weekly and Rolling Stone, said that Philip Morris simply wanted to appear to be doing the right thing.Mr. Brownridge said the magazine executives at Hearst, which publishes Cosmopolitan, were a bunch of ''whining crybabies'' for commissioning their own study and ought to just get used to the fact that Philip Morris will not advertise in Cosmopolitan.Ms. Kalajian Lagani differed.''Well, I hope he is not right,'' she said. ''We have been told by Philip Morris that they would evaluate the new Simmons research and make decisions based on the new research.''But Tom Ryan, a Philip Morris spokesman, said the company would stay out of Cosmopolitan for now.''At this point, we are not currently reconsidering making changes in our advertising practices or the publications in which we run brand advertising,'' he said.

The World Health Organization, which is spearheading the push for a tough international agreement to curb smoking by 2003, made its views plain. It wrapped conference papers in a cover that took direct aim at the best-selling Marlboro cigarette brand. Silhouetted against an orange sky, one cowboy tells the other, ''Bob, I've got cancer.''The agency also became the first United Nations body every to hold two days of public hearings on tobacco which were dominated by anti-smoking groups. Philip Morris, which makes the top-selling Marlboro brand, and British American Tobacco (BAT) were unusually contrite, acknowledging that their products are deadly and addictive.They made clear, however, that they will resist stringent global rules, insisting that they are free to sell and advertise their wares. ''Today, with near-universal awareness of the health risks, a billion adults choose to smoke,'' said Christopher Proctor, BAT's science director, who argued that regulatory schemes can only work at the national level.The negotiations here will be fierce, tussling over whether to ban tobacco multinationals from advertising and sponsoring sports events; whether to increase taxes to make cigarettes more expensive, and whether to discourage tobacco growing and adopt measures to deter young people from smoking.The World Health Organization maintains that tobacco use already kills four million people annually and will worsen over the next two decades. Unchecked, tobacco's death toll will rise to 10 million yearly by 2030, according to the agency, which would take huge chunks out of budgets of both rich and poor countries.American medical groups have argued in recent days that the consequences of inaction are dire, and urged the Clinton administration to apply its tough domestic smoking stand to the international arena. ''If smoking is not curbed, China alone will have one million lung cancer deaths in 2025,'' said Dr. Randolph D. Smoak, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, who recently returned from China, where about 70 percent of men smoke.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/13/nyregion/in-new-york-a-record-fine-over-lobbying.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">In New York, A Record Fine Over Lobbying<date>Published: November 13, 1999</date><text>Philip Morris has agreed to pay a $75,000 fine, the largest ever imposed by state lobbying regulators, for underreporting the amount of money it spent to lobby New York lawmakers on tobacco legislation, officials announced today.In addition, one of the company's chief lobbyists in the Capitol has been barred from lobbying on any issue before state government for three years, as part of a settlement with the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying. The lobbyist, Sharon T.

A company spokesman, Chris Kircher, said it did not dispute a report in Pensions and Investments Age, a trade publication, on Aug. 9 that Philip Morris had moved all of its pension assets to index funds.For years, Philip Morris pension managers had failed to meet the company's benchmarks for investment performance, the magazine said.The magazine said the shift to index investing was revealed in a form the company submitted to the publication for an annual listing of the 1,000 largest pension funds. Counting both its defined-benefit, or traditional, pension plans and its defined-contribution plans, Philip Morris has $14.9 billion in employee retirement assets and ranks 58th among companies and state and local governments.Many large pension funds put the bulk of their assets into index funds, which try to mirror the performance of broad sectors of the stock market like the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. The largest fund, the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, has 48 percent of its $133.5 billion of assets in index funds.The change at Philip Morris does not affect workers' pension checks, because the defined-benefit plan bases its benefits on earnings and years of service; the company assumes the investment risk. DAVID CAY JOHNSTONCorrection: September 5, 1999, Sunday Because of an editing error, a brief report in the Diary column on the Investing page last Sunday about retirement plans at the Philip Morris Companies misstated the name of the publication that reported the company's shift of assets in its defined-benefit pension plans to index funds. It is Pensions and Investments, not Pensions and Investments Age.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/17/nyregion/philip-morris-reviews-its-lobbying-disclosures.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Philip Morris Reviews Its Lobbying Disclosures<date>Published: August 17, 1999</date><text>The world's largest cigarette maker, responding to an investigation into its lobbying in Albany, said yesterday that it may have failed to disclose all of the money it spent on dinners and other gifts that it used to court state lawmakers.The company, Philip Morris, said it had told state regulators that it was examining the disclosure statements it had filed for recent years to determine whether they were accurate. The company had asserted last month that it was confident that it had abided by the lobbying rules, but it said yesterday that it might have to revise the statements.''We are in the process of reviewing our previous filings to determine whether any need to be amended in order to bring them into full compliance with the law,'' said K. Richmond Temple, a spokesman for Philip Morris.Under the state's relatively lax lobbying law, if the company revises its filings to the satisfaction of the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, it will not face penalties.The New York Times reported last month that at least 115 current and former members of the 211-person Legislature had accepted gifts in recent years from Philip Morris, which has largely been triumphant in its lobbying campaign to block anti-tobacco measures in Albany in recent years. The gifts ranged from meals at expensive restaurants to tickets for sporting events like the Indianapolis 500 and the United States Open tennis tournament.The information about the gifts did not appear in the disclosure statements that Philip Morris is required to file under the lobbying law. It was found in internal company records that the company submitted in smoking-related lawsuits brought by state attorneys general and other plaintiffs. Those records appeared to contradict some information in the reports at the lobbying commission.Reacting to the article in The Times, the commission began an inquiry on July 27, asking Philip Morris for more information about its lobbying. The disclosures about the gifts also prompted legislative leaders to shelve plans to extend the current lobbying law, which some have attacked as ineffective.The commission itself has maintained that because the law allows lobbyists and clients to change their filings after an investigation has begun and then not incur punishment, there is little to discourage them from withholding information. It has asked the Legislature for more enforcement power.''If we are limited to just permitting them to amend their filing at this late date to correct the prior inadequate filing, that seems to be a very mild deterrent,'' said Milton Mollen, a member of the commission's board.Legislative leaders, who had said for months that the lobbying law did not need to be revamped, reversed themselves after the gifts were made public. They said they would consider toughening the law, which expires on Dec. 31, at a special legislative session in the fall.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/14/business/company-news-philip-morris-to-cut-prices-on-maxwell-house-coffee.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; PHILIP MORRIS TO CUT PRICES ON MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE<date>Published: August 14, 1999</date><text>The Philip Morris Companies said it would cut the price of its Maxwell House coffee to reflect the falling price of raw beans, matching a cut last week from the Procter &amp; Gamble Company, maker of Folgers coffee.

What shape reform might take was not clear.The move on lobbying came as Gov. George E. Pataki and the leaders negotiated until the late evening on several issues on which they have been at an impasse for months, including a measure that would impose new penalties for blocking abortion clinics and for stalking, and another that would greatly expand the state's database of DNA specimens from criminals by requiring many convicted felons, not just sex offenders, to provide samples. The sides also bargained over whether to permit New York to enter into the multistate Powerball lottery.The Governor and Republican lawmakers continued to reject Democrats' entreaties to renew a law that allows thousands of tenants to live in otherwise illegal loft apartments, mostly in lower Manhattan. The Republicans do not in principle oppose the law, which expired on June 30, but are holding it up in an effort to wrest concessions from the Democrats on other matters.The possibility that the state would join Powerball surfaced suddenly in the negotiations tonight, and it seemed that the Governor and Legislature could approve the new game with little or no public debate. Mr. Pataki was pressing especially hard for the measure, but the Democratic majority in the Assembly, which has traditionally been lukewarm to gambling, was balking.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/14/us/reynolds-files-suit-against-philip-morris.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Reynolds Files Suit Against Philip Morris<date>Published: March 14, 1999</date><text>The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has filed a Federal lawsuit against Philip Morris Inc., accusing the world's largest cigarette maker of trying to monopolize the retail arena by shutting out competitors.The suit, filed on Friday in Federal District Court here, claims that a Philip Morris program scheduled to begin on April 1 effectively prevents other cigarette brands from competing at participating stores.The suit seeks a preliminary injunction barring Philip Morris from signing up any more retailers for its Retail Leaders program. The program violates Federal and state antitrust laws, says the suit, which seeks unspecified damages.The suit says the Retail Leaders program promises lucrative discounts to retailers that give Philip Morris 100 percent of the store's visible retail space three months out of the year. It gives smaller discounts to retailers that make a commitment of 75 percent of their visible space, the lawsuit says.Participating retailers then pass along the discounts to customers in the promotion period, but cannot discount any other cigarette brands in that time, the lawsuit says.Calls to Philip Morris officials at its New York corporate headquarters were not returned late on Friday.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/11/business/a-food-fight-nabisco-is-seen-as-hot-target.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">A Food Fight: Nabisco Is Seen As Hot Target<date>Published: March 11, 1999</date><text>The breakup of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation that was announced on Tuesday may have satisfied a good many shareholders who had lobbied for such a change for years. But more fireworks may be in store for the separate companies that will be created by RJR's decision to abandon its 14-year effort to run food and tobacco operations under the same corporate roof.Several analysts and industry experts think a contest could erupt over Nabisco, the cookie-and-cracker giant that is mostly held by RJR, now renamed Nabisco Group Holdings. Many expect the Philip Morris Companies to make a run at Nabisco, and some also mention Pepsico, which made its first foray outside the soft-drink and snack aisles in July when it spent $3.3 billion to acquire Tropicana.Some analysts think that Philip Morris, which bought General Foods in 1985 -- the same year that R. J. Reynolds Industries bought Nabisco Brands Inc. -- and Kraft Foods in 1988, needs to expand its portfolio of food products. Those now range from Jell-O to frozen pizza to shredded wheat, a product that was acquired from Nabisco a few years ago.In both tobacco and food, Philip Morris has enjoyed more success than RJR, dominating the domestic and international cigarette markets. Though both RJR and Philip Morris face expensive settlements stemming from lawsuits filed by smokers and state attorneys general, Philip Morris has continued a healthy cash flow and enjoyed a more manageable debt load than RJR, which labored mightily to reduce the $30 billion in debt it inherited after a hotly contested leveraged buyout in 1988.But Philip Morris has gaps in food. Although its Kraft unit sells chocolate and other confectionery products abroad, for example, it does not have a niche in the United States in snack food, cookies or crackers.''Kraft is very large, but it is conspicuously absent from that very important biscuit category,'' said Jaine Mehring, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. Kraft's sales are about $27 billion, compared with $8 billion for Nabisco.Nabisco recently won new affection from Wall Street as sales rose for the first time in many months. And the spinoff of RJR's domestic tobacco business, combined with the sale of its international tobacco operations, leaves Nabisco essentially alone and, some say, an attractive target.''We don't speculate on what will happen in the future, but clearly, this new structure makes a sale a possibility,'' said Nomi Ghez, a food analyst for Goldman, Sachs.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/11/us/51-million-verdict-awarded-to-smoker-is-biggest-of-its-kind.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">$51 Million Verdict Awarded to Smoker Is Biggest of Its Kind<date>Published: February 11, 1999</date><text>A state jury in San Francisco has ordered the Philip Morris Companies to pay $51.5 million to a woman who says her inoperable lung cancer was caused by more than 35 years of smoking cigarettes, primarily Philip Morris's Marlboro brand.The judgment is by far the largest ever reached in a smoking-related lawsuit.The verdicts were for $1.5 million in compensatory damages, awarded on Tuesday, and $50 million in punitive damages, awarded late yesterday. They resulted from the first cigarette lawsuit to reach a California jury in more than a decade, following the 1997 repeal of a state law that barred product liability suits by individuals against tobacco companies.William S. Ohlemeyer, a lawyer representing Philip Morris, said the company would appeal. He said there were sure to be substantial grounds, since, in the absence for so long of any smoker's suit in California, the law there was somewhat unsettled.But while the judgment could be sharply reduced on appeal, or even thrown out, it signals that the cigarette companies may well have to fight a brushfire of similar suits just as the industry hoped that its legal troubles had been put to rest with a $206 billion settlement reached with 46 states three months ago. Defending themselves against thousands of suits brought by individual smokers or their survivors -- particularly in California, where juries lean to high damage awards -- would prove extremely expensive for the companies.Indeed, analysts who were interviewed about the size of the award said they believed that its lure to prospective plaintiffs could bring a new rush of litigation against cigarette makers.''This will give incredible new strength to claims against tobacco companies,'' said Mary Aronson, president of Aronson Washington Research, which follows tobacco litigation for institutional investors.The verdict awarding the 53-year-old plaintiff, Patricia Henley, $50 million in punitive damages -- more than three times the $15 million her lawyer had asked for -- was not returned until after the stock market had closed yesterday. But on the basis of just the $1.5 million in compensatory damages awarded late the day before, prices of cigarette company stocks fell sharply. Philip Morris was off $3.9375 a share, to close at $41.4375, and the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation was down $1.375, closing at $27.3125.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-win-one-lose-one-for-true-north-unit.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Win One, Lose One For True North Unit<date>Published: December 29, 1998</date><text>It was win one, lose one for the New York office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, a unit of True North Communications, as the agency gained an assignment from a client while losing another.Foote, Cone was selected by the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies to develop advertising for its joint venture with the Starbucks Coffee Company, to distribute a line of Starbucks brand grocery products in supermarkets.

They will also pledge not to market to those under 18.''We have reached an agreement on all the issues,'' said Christine A. Gregoire, the Washington State Attorney General. ''We are in the final drafting stage and hope to have a settlement sometime Saturday.''Last-minute disputes could delay or derail the settlement, but those involved said they did not consider such problems likely. Once the eight states and the companies agree, the plan will be sent to officials of the other 38 states that have lawsuits pending or have yet to file one.Correction: January 14, 2005, Friday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the inauguration of the Washington State governor, whose election is being contested, misstated her initial.

Many expect the Philip Morris Companies to make a run at Nabisco, and some also mention Pepsico, which made its first foray outside the soft-drink and snack aisles in July when it spent $3.3 billion to acquire Tropicana.Some analysts think that Philip Morris, which bought General Foods in 1985 -- the same year that R. J. Reynolds Industries bought Nabisco Brands Inc. -- and Kraft Foods in 1988, needs to expand its portfolio of food products. Those now range from Jell-O to frozen pizza to shredded wheat, a product that was acquired from Nabisco a few years ago.In both tobacco and food, Philip Morris has enjoyed more success than RJR, dominating the domestic and international cigarette markets. Though both RJR and Philip Morris face expensive settlements stemming from lawsuits filed by smokers and state attorneys general, Philip Morris has continued a healthy cash flow and enjoyed a more manageable debt load than RJR, which labored mightily to reduce the $30 billion in debt it inherited after a hotly contested leveraged buyout in 1988.But Philip Morris has gaps in food. Although its Kraft unit sells chocolate and other confectionery products abroad, for example, it does not have a niche in the United States in snack food, cookies or crackers.''Kraft is very large, but it is conspicuously absent from that very important biscuit category,'' said Jaine Mehring, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. Kraft's sales are about $27 billion, compared with $8 billion for Nabisco.Nabisco recently won new affection from Wall Street as sales rose for the first time in many months. And the spinoff of RJR's domestic tobacco business, combined with the sale of its international tobacco operations, leaves Nabisco essentially alone and, some say, an attractive target.''We don't speculate on what will happen in the future, but clearly, this new structure makes a sale a possibility,'' said Nomi Ghez, a food analyst for Goldman, Sachs.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/11/us/51-million-verdict-awarded-to-smoker-is-biggest-of-its-kind.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">$51 Million Verdict Awarded to Smoker Is Biggest of Its Kind<date>Published: February 11, 1999</date><text>A state jury in San Francisco has ordered the Philip Morris Companies to pay $51.5 million to a woman who says her inoperable lung cancer was caused by more than 35 years of smoking cigarettes, primarily Philip Morris's Marlboro brand.The judgment is by far the largest ever reached in a smoking-related lawsuit.The verdicts were for $1.5 million in compensatory damages, awarded on Tuesday, and $50 million in punitive damages, awarded late yesterday. They resulted from the first cigarette lawsuit to reach a California jury in more than a decade, following the 1997 repeal of a state law that barred product liability suits by individuals against tobacco companies.William S. Ohlemeyer, a lawyer representing Philip Morris, said the company would appeal. He said there were sure to be substantial grounds, since, in the absence for so long of any smoker's suit in California, the law there was somewhat unsettled.But while the judgment could be sharply reduced on appeal, or even thrown out, it signals that the cigarette companies may well have to fight a brushfire of similar suits just as the industry hoped that its legal troubles had been put to rest with a $206 billion settlement reached with 46 states three months ago. Defending themselves against thousands of suits brought by individual smokers or their survivors -- particularly in California, where juries lean to high damage awards -- would prove extremely expensive for the companies.Indeed, analysts who were interviewed about the size of the award said they believed that its lure to prospective plaintiffs could bring a new rush of litigation against cigarette makers.''This will give incredible new strength to claims against tobacco companies,'' said Mary Aronson, president of Aronson Washington Research, which follows tobacco litigation for institutional investors.The verdict awarding the 53-year-old plaintiff, Patricia Henley, $50 million in punitive damages -- more than three times the $15 million her lawyer had asked for -- was not returned until after the stock market had closed yesterday. But on the basis of just the $1.5 million in compensatory damages awarded late the day before, prices of cigarette company stocks fell sharply. Philip Morris was off $3.9375 a share, to close at $41.4375, and the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation was down $1.375, closing at $27.3125.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-win-one-lose-one-for-true-north-unit.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Win One, Lose One For True North Unit<date>Published: December 29, 1998</date><text>It was win one, lose one for the New York office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, a unit of True North Communications, as the agency gained an assignment from a client while losing another.Foote, Cone was selected by the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies to develop advertising for its joint venture with the Starbucks Coffee Company, to distribute a line of Starbucks brand grocery products in supermarkets.

They will also pledge not to market to those under 18.''We have reached an agreement on all the issues,'' said Christine A. Gregoire, the Washington State Attorney General. ''We are in the final drafting stage and hope to have a settlement sometime Saturday.''Last-minute disputes could delay or derail the settlement, but those involved said they did not consider such problems likely. Once the eight states and the companies agree, the plan will be sent to officials of the other 38 states that have lawsuits pending or have yet to file one.Correction: January 14, 2005, Friday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the inauguration of the Washington State governor, whose election is being contested, misstated her initial.

Analysts expected the company to earn 83 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks estimates.Unit sales, or the number of cigarettes sold, fell for the first time since 1993, in both the United States and international divisions. Philip Morris has seen slower demand as a result of economic slumps in Asia and in Russia.The company's Kraft North America unit, the nation's largest food company, said operating profit rose 5.1 percent, helped by increased unit sales and cost savings.The Miller Brewing unit, the nation's No. 2 beer company, said operating profit rose 1.7 percent, to $118 million, mainly because of lower brewing costs. Unit sales fell 4.2 percent, the company said.Shares of Philip Morris rose $2 yesterday, to $49.875.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/27/business/company-news-philip-morris-increases-dividend-after-one-year-hiatus.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; PHILIP MORRIS INCREASES DIVIDEND AFTER ONE-YEAR HIATUS<date>Published: August 27, 1998</date><text>The Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest cigarette maker, said yesterday that its board had voted to increase its regular quarterly dividend by 10 percent. The increase to 44 cents a share from 40 cents comes after a one-year hiatus during which the company, the maker of Marlboro and other major cigarette brands, kept its dividend unchanged to raise cash to cover what was then a pending $368.5 billion tobacco litigation settlement with several states. The settlement collapsed earlier this summer when Congress failed to enact a comprehensive tobacco bill. The new dividend is payable Oct. 13 to shareholders of record as of Sept. 15.

Gregoire, the Washington State Attorney General, was told yesterday by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which is owned by the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, and the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, a subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries, that they would not take part for now in renewed discussions, said Fred Olson, a spokesman for Ms. Gregoire.That means that the only companies at the bargaining table tomorrow will be Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, and the Lorillard Tobacco Company, which is owned by the Loews Corporation and is often represented by Philip Morris lawyers in such settlement discussions.The industry's posture is the latest development in an effort that began this summer to reach a new settlement between tobacco producers and about 40 states suing the companies to recover the costs of smoking-related health care.But that process, which followed the collapse in Congress this spring of the $368.5 billion tobacco settlement proposal reached in June 1997 between the industry and state attorneys general, has moved ahead haltingly with little signs of unanimity on the part of either industry or the state officials.Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, declined comment on the talks.A spokesman for RJR Nabisco also declined comment, and officials of Brown &amp; Williamson did not return telephone calls seeking comment.Mr. Olson said the companies were concerned about cigarette marketing and restrictions proposed by state officials. But one lawyer familiar with the talks described the company's stance as a bargaining posture, and others held out the possibility that the two companies might soon join the talks.Still, the decision by R. J. Reynolds and Brown &amp; Williamson may be less a sign of industry dissension than a feeling on the part of producers that time and momentum are on their side, and that a toughened stance will result in a cheaper deal.In recent months, producers have scored several courtroom victories, including a decision earlier this month by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, that the Food and Drug Administration does not have the authority to regulate cigarettes or smokeless tobacco.At the same time, opponents of smoking appear to be scrambling to find new momentum.For example, Richard Scruggs, a plaintiffs lawyer from Pascagoula, Miss., who was an architect of last year's settlement proposal, has been pressing Federal officials to file a lawsuit to recover smoking-related Medicare expenses from cigarette producers, said lawyers familiar with those talks.Mr. Scruggs's strategy is not to proceed with the trial of such a lawsuit, but to convince cigarette producers to sign a consent decree with the Government under which they would agree to many of the advertising, marketing and regulatory restrictions in last year's plan, those lawyers said.Such an agreement could be more sweeping than any achieved by state officials. But one industry lawyer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Scruggs had presented the plan to producers and that cigarette makers had rejected it.Correction: January 14, 2005, Friday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the inauguration of the Washington State governor, whose election is being contested, misstated her initial.

It will decrease reported net earnings by $63 million, to $1.736 billion, or 71 cents a diluted share, from $1.799 billion, or 74 cents a diluted share.

The diversified food company, which also makes products such as Kraft cheeses and Miller beer, said earnings before one-time charges rose to $2 billion, or 82 cents a diluted share, from $1.84 billion, or 75 cents, a year earlier. That matched the average forecast of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation, which tracks earnings estimates.The one-time charges reflected previously announced voluntary early retirement and other costs in its domestic tobacco and corporate operations as well as litigation costs. Accounting for those charges Philip Morris earned $1.8 billion, or 74 cents a share.Sales of American-style cigarettes such as Marlboro are growing overseas, which helped increase profit from international tobacco by 11 percent in the quarter. That helped overcome slower profit growth in the United States as cigarette price increases from legal settlements led smokers to cut back.Philip Morris shares ended unchanged at $40.125.Revenue rose 4 percent, to $18.98 billion from $18.3 billion.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/06/us/trial-to-begin-in-big-lawsuit-by-smokers-in-florida.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Trial to Begin In Big Lawsuit By Smokers In Florida<date>Published: July 06, 1998</date><text>The resolve of cigarette makers to fight lawsuits following the collapse of last year's nationwide settlement plan faces its toughest test today with the start of a large class-action case brought on behalf of smokers in Florida.The case, in which an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people are seeking some $100 billion in compensatory and punitive damages, is the nation's first class-action lawsuit involving smokers to come to trial. Jury selection will begin today and is expected to take three to five weeks.The trial will unfold in stages, with the first one determining whether producers are liable for tobacco-related health problems and should face punitive damages.The case comes at an uncertain point in the course of tobacco litigation. Last month, in a rare victory for plaintiffs, a Florida jury ordered the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation to pay $1 million, including $500,000 in punitive damages, to the family of a smoker. But just days later, a Florida appeals court struck down a 1996 jury award of $750,000 against Brown &amp; Williamson, holding that the smoker in that case had waited too long to sue and that evidence had been improperly admitted at the trial.Stephen Sugarman, a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on tobacco litigation, said he believed that the trial's first phase would be critical. The industry will either knock out the case, he said, or if it cannot, move to settle it, despite recent tough talk against settlements.''I think the plaintiffs must hope that if they can win Round 1 then the industry will come to the bargaining table,'' Mr. Sugarman said.If jurors hold producers liable, and there is no settlement, the jury will next hear the cases of six smokers representing the class. In the third stage, the claim of each class member will be reviewed to see whether their illness was smoking-related.Stanley Rosenblatt, the Miami lawyer who brought the lawsuit, estimated the number of class members at 100,000 to 200,000. And legal experts like Mr. Sugarman said that a case-by-case review of those claims would be so cumbersome that producers would be likely to settle if the case proved unfavorable.But for now, no one is talking about settling. Robert C. Heim, a lawyer for Philip Morris, said that tobacco producers planned to stake their defense on data showing that the public was aware of smoking risks.''You are dealing with the issue of personal choice and responsibility,'' Mr. Heim said.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/19/business/tobacco-stocks-recoup-after-legislation-fizzles.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Tobacco Stocks Recoup After Legislation Fizzles<date>Published: June 19, 1998</date><text>Tobacco stocks rebounded yesterday, the day after the latest version of a tobacco-settlement bill was stubbed out like, well, a cigarette.Shares of the Philip Morris Companies, the maker of Marlboro, rose $1.125, to $39.5625. RJR Nabisco climbed 75 cents, to $25.0625. Even the Brooke Group, the parent of the maker of Liggett &amp; Myers that became popular recently because of an earlier deal that freed it from tax penalties proposed in the McCain bill, showed some spark during trading, though it closed down 25 cents.Was this a sigh of relief from investors who have been on a rough ride for the last several years? A momentary uptick in the sagging fortunes of corporations stuck with products destined for the ash heap of history? Or was it a long-overdue recognition of the inherent value of companies like RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris, regardless of the all-too-visible hand of Congress?It may be none, or all, of the above. Certainly the biggest worry for investors -- the threat of interminable litigation and overwhelming punitive damages from the hundreds of lawsuits that have been filed against tobacco companies -- remained. Without restrictions on such lawsuits and awards, many people who might otherwise buy into tobacco companies were staying away, not wanting to put money into companies whose earnings could be siphoned off by having to make all those payments.Management itself has not been too encouraging. The 1997 annual report from Philip Morris stated, ''Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation.'' The report, though, does suggest that the original tobacco pact -- reached 364 days ago, on June 20, 1997 -- would have resolved ''the most significant tobacco litigation'' facing the company.''Clearly, the litigation is a large issue for the industry to deal with,'' said Jan Smith, a spokeswoman for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the cigarette-making branch of RJR Nabisco, based in Winston-Salem, N.C. ''And the whole youth- smoking issue is something we would like to resolve.''There are other issues that went away, more or less, along with the McCain bill. One was the specter of higher prices for cigarettes, which some feared would create a contraband market for them. Another was spending for programs to reduce youth smoking, which was also a major element of the June 20 plan.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/13/nyregion/tobacco-company-paid-ferraro-20000.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Tobacco Company Paid Ferraro $20,000<date>Published: June 13, 1998</date><text>Geraldine A. Ferraro, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Senate, accepted a $20,000 speaking honorarium from the Philip Morris Companies last year, according to financial disclosure forms made public today.The payment was for a debate in February 1997 between Ms. Ferraro and Robert Novak, one of her regular opponents on CNN's ''Crossfire'' program, before Philip Morris executives in Palm Beach, Fla. Ms. Ferraro provided the liberal commentary on ''Crossfire'' until stepping down in January to campaign full time.Ms. Ferraro's disclosure, which she was required to make under Congressional ethics rules, could harm her among Democratic primary voters who many politicians believe are angry with the tobacco industry. It could also make it harder for her to attack Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican incumbent, over the $56,200 in contributions he has received from the tobacco industry since 1991.Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, said it was wrong for Ms. Ferraro ''to profit politically or personally from tobacco.''''You really have to ask yourself what she was thinking to take $20,000 in tobacco money at a time when Democrats from President Clinton to Congressman Waxman to me locally were trying to crack down on the industry for addicting children,'' Mr. Green said in a statement, referring to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, a proponent of anti-tobacco legislation in Congress.Ms. Ferraro's campaign manager, David Eichenbaum, responded by saying: ''Gerry is staunchly in favor of the anti-tobacco legislation now in Congress. She is strongly for raising the tax on cigarettes. If her position were different from that, it would be one thing. But the fact that she has taken such a strong position against the interests of the tobacco industry makes this a nonissue.''Like her rivals, Ms. Ferraro has pledged not to accept any contributions from the tobacco industry's political action committee.Mr. Green's attack represented the latest bit of sniping among those seeking the Democratic Senate nomination, a trend party leaders worry will escalate into full-fledged intraparty strife even though the candidates have pledged to avoid personal attacks.The third Democratic candidate, Representative Charles E. Schumer, who represents Brooklyn and Queens, declined to comment on Ms. Ferraro's honorarium, as did Mr. D'Amato. Still, Mr. Green's attack could benefit both Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato by undermining Ms. Ferraro, who is widely considered the Democratic front-runner.The incident also showed that Ms. Ferraro's personal finances are likely to be major issues throughout the campaign. That was also the case when she lost the Democratic Senate primary in 1992; her opponents then focused on the real estate dealings of her husband, John A. Zaccaro.Ms. Ferraro helped rekindle the debate over her finances by restricting public review of her 1997 tax returns earlier this year, allowing reporters just three hours to study the complex documents and refusing to make copies available. Mr. Green and Mr. Schumer handed out copies of their returns, though Mr. D'Amato did not.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/10/us/cancer-group-is-upset-over-gift-because-of-link-to-philip-morris.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Cancer Group Is Upset Over Gift Because of Link to Philip Morris<date>Published: June 10, 1998</date><text>Carolyn Aldige, president of the Cancer Research Foundation of America, said she was pleased to hear last month that her organization would receive money from Dresses for Humanity, a traveling charity exhibition of designer gowns worn by Diana, Princess of Wales.But soon afterward, Ms. Aldige said, she was shocked that a tobacco company had joined the list of benefactors, a fact she learned only upon seeing a banner at a news conference that listed the Philip Morris Companies as a sponsor of a gala banquet set for Thursday to kick off the tour of the exhibition.Ms. Aldige said that if she had known of Philip Morris's involvement, her organization would not have accepted an offer of money last month from the People's Princess Charitable Foundation.The foundation, based in Tampa, Fla., was set up after Diana's death last summer and is sponsoring a tour of the exhibition in 20 cities to raise $100 million for causes supported by Diana. The foundation was established by Maureen Rorech, who bought at auction the 14 dresses that will be shown at the exhibition.Ms. Aldige's organization will not receive any money directly from Philip Morris, said officials at People's Princess Charitable Foundation. But Philip Morris has reserved a table at $25,000 at the gala, whose proceeds are to be donated to the Boys and Girls Club of America.Ms. Aldige said the Cancer Research Foundation of America, based in Alexandria, Va., was ''categorically opposed to receiving money from any tobacco-related industry'' and was assessing its future association to the People's Princess Charitable Foundation.Andrea Cheney, the chief operating officer of the People's Princess Charitable Foundation, said donations would be made to local charities in the 20 cities.''It is the commitment of the foundation to raise as much money as we can,'' Ms. Cheney said, ''and give back to the cities.''Of the controversy, she said: ''It is unfortunate that this scenario has put anyone in an awkward position. And by no means was it intentional.''Ms. Cheney said her organization should have let the cancer foundation know of Philip Morris's involvement.''Was that a faux pas on our part?'' she said.

And legal experts like Mr. Sugarman said that a case-by-case review of those claims would be so cumbersome that producers would be likely to settle if the case proved unfavorable.But for now, no one is talking about settling. Robert C. Heim, a lawyer for Philip Morris, said that tobacco producers planned to stake their defense on data showing that the public was aware of smoking risks.''You are dealing with the issue of personal choice and responsibility,'' Mr. Heim said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/19/business/tobacco-stocks-recoup-after-legislation-fizzles.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Tobacco Stocks Recoup After Legislation Fizzles<date>Published: June 19, 1998</date><text>Tobacco stocks rebounded yesterday, the day after the latest version of a tobacco-settlement bill was stubbed out like, well, a cigarette.Shares of the Philip Morris Companies, the maker of Marlboro, rose $1.125, to $39.5625. RJR Nabisco climbed 75 cents, to $25.0625. Even the Brooke Group, the parent of the maker of Liggett &amp; Myers that became popular recently because of an earlier deal that freed it from tax penalties proposed in the McCain bill, showed some spark during trading, though it closed down 25 cents.Was this a sigh of relief from investors who have been on a rough ride for the last several years? A momentary uptick in the sagging fortunes of corporations stuck with products destined for the ash heap of history? Or was it a long-overdue recognition of the inherent value of companies like RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris, regardless of the all-too-visible hand of Congress?It may be none, or all, of the above. Certainly the biggest worry for investors -- the threat of interminable litigation and overwhelming punitive damages from the hundreds of lawsuits that have been filed against tobacco companies -- remained. Without restrictions on such lawsuits and awards, many people who might otherwise buy into tobacco companies were staying away, not wanting to put money into companies whose earnings could be siphoned off by having to make all those payments.Management itself has not been too encouraging. The 1997 annual report from Philip Morris stated, ''Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation.'' The report, though, does suggest that the original tobacco pact -- reached 364 days ago, on June 20, 1997 -- would have resolved ''the most significant tobacco litigation'' facing the company.''Clearly, the litigation is a large issue for the industry to deal with,'' said Jan Smith, a spokeswoman for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the cigarette-making branch of RJR Nabisco, based in Winston-Salem, N.C. ''And the whole youth- smoking issue is something we would like to resolve.''There are other issues that went away, more or less, along with the McCain bill. One was the specter of higher prices for cigarettes, which some feared would create a contraband market for them. Another was spending for programs to reduce youth smoking, which was also a major element of the June 20 plan.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/13/nyregion/tobacco-company-paid-ferraro-20000.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Tobacco Company Paid Ferraro $20,000<date>Published: June 13, 1998</date><text>Geraldine A. Ferraro, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Senate, accepted a $20,000 speaking honorarium from the Philip Morris Companies last year, according to financial disclosure forms made public today.The payment was for a debate in February 1997 between Ms. Ferraro and Robert Novak, one of her regular opponents on CNN's ''Crossfire'' program, before Philip Morris executives in Palm Beach, Fla. Ms. Ferraro provided the liberal commentary on ''Crossfire'' until stepping down in January to campaign full time.Ms. Ferraro's disclosure, which she was required to make under Congressional ethics rules, could harm her among Democratic primary voters who many politicians believe are angry with the tobacco industry. It could also make it harder for her to attack Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican incumbent, over the $56,200 in contributions he has received from the tobacco industry since 1991.Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, said it was wrong for Ms. Ferraro ''to profit politically or personally from tobacco.''''You really have to ask yourself what she was thinking to take $20,000 in tobacco money at a time when Democrats from President Clinton to Congressman Waxman to me locally were trying to crack down on the industry for addicting children,'' Mr. Green said in a statement, referring to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, a proponent of anti-tobacco legislation in Congress.Ms. Ferraro's campaign manager, David Eichenbaum, responded by saying: ''Gerry is staunchly in favor of the anti-tobacco legislation now in Congress. She is strongly for raising the tax on cigarettes. If her position were different from that, it would be one thing. But the fact that she has taken such a strong position against the interests of the tobacco industry makes this a nonissue.''Like her rivals, Ms. Ferraro has pledged not to accept any contributions from the tobacco industry's political action committee.Mr. Green's attack represented the latest bit of sniping among those seeking the Democratic Senate nomination, a trend party leaders worry will escalate into full-fledged intraparty strife even though the candidates have pledged to avoid personal attacks.The third Democratic candidate, Representative Charles E. Schumer, who represents Brooklyn and Queens, declined to comment on Ms. Ferraro's honorarium, as did Mr. D'Amato. Still, Mr. Green's attack could benefit both Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato by undermining Ms. Ferraro, who is widely considered the Democratic front-runner.The incident also showed that Ms. Ferraro's personal finances are likely to be major issues throughout the campaign. That was also the case when she lost the Democratic Senate primary in 1992; her opponents then focused on the real estate dealings of her husband, John A. Zaccaro.Ms. Ferraro helped rekindle the debate over her finances by restricting public review of her 1997 tax returns earlier this year, allowing reporters just three hours to study the complex documents and refusing to make copies available. Mr. Green and Mr. Schumer handed out copies of their returns, though Mr. D'Amato did not.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/10/us/cancer-group-is-upset-over-gift-because-of-link-to-philip-morris.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Cancer Group Is Upset Over Gift Because of Link to Philip Morris<date>Published: June 10, 1998</date><text>Carolyn Aldige, president of the Cancer Research Foundation of America, said she was pleased to hear last month that her organization would receive money from Dresses for Humanity, a traveling charity exhibition of designer gowns worn by Diana, Princess of Wales.But soon afterward, Ms. Aldige said, she was shocked that a tobacco company had joined the list of benefactors, a fact she learned only upon seeing a banner at a news conference that listed the Philip Morris Companies as a sponsor of a gala banquet set for Thursday to kick off the tour of the exhibition.Ms. Aldige said that if she had known of Philip Morris's involvement, her organization would not have accepted an offer of money last month from the People's Princess Charitable Foundation.The foundation, based in Tampa, Fla., was set up after Diana's death last summer and is sponsoring a tour of the exhibition in 20 cities to raise $100 million for causes supported by Diana. The foundation was established by Maureen Rorech, who bought at auction the 14 dresses that will be shown at the exhibition.Ms. Aldige's organization will not receive any money directly from Philip Morris, said officials at People's Princess Charitable Foundation. But Philip Morris has reserved a table at $25,000 at the gala, whose proceeds are to be donated to the Boys and Girls Club of America.Ms. Aldige said the Cancer Research Foundation of America, based in Alexandria, Va., was ''categorically opposed to receiving money from any tobacco-related industry'' and was assessing its future association to the People's Princess Charitable Foundation.Andrea Cheney, the chief operating officer of the People's Princess Charitable Foundation, said donations would be made to local charities in the 20 cities.''It is the commitment of the foundation to raise as much money as we can,'' Ms. Cheney said, ''and give back to the cities.''Of the controversy, she said: ''It is unfortunate that this scenario has put anyone in an awkward position. And by no means was it intentional.''Ms. Cheney said her organization should have let the cancer foundation know of Philip Morris's involvement.''Was that a faux pas on our part?'' she said. ''Absolutely.''</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/06/business/company-news-agreement-is-set-on-class-action-litigation.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; AGREEMENT IS SET ON CLASS-ACTION LITIGATION<date>Published: June 06, 1998</date><text>The Philip Morris Companies said yesterday that it had agreed to settle pending shareholder securities class-action litigation against it and several former officers.

The fund will also cover any lawyers' fees and other expenses ordered by the court.

Does he think that this advertising is neither seen by children or, if so, that it does not have any effect on them?Perhaps we could respect this ''high-quality advertising'' if the tobacco companies and their advertising agencies put as much energy and money into creating advertising that shows the dangers of smoking as well as life-style-enhancing images.MICHAEL VARCOE-COCKSNew York, May 14, 1998</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/16/opinion/l-more-tobacco-smoke-979511.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">More Tobacco Smoke<date>Published: May 16, 1998</date><text>To the Editor:The May 14 letter by Joseph F.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, said the price rises of $2.50 per thousand cigarettes were effective immediately.A spokesman for Reynolds, Richard Williams, said the increase ''reflects the ongoing cost of conducting business.''Typically, once one company announces an increase, other cigarette companies raise their prices. The Philip Morris rise was disclosed first by industry analysts and confirmed by the company before Reynolds made its own announcement.The companies last raised prices in January, by $1.25 a thousand, or 2.5 cents a pack. The latest round of increases began in March 1997, when the companies raised the price 5 cents a pack, followed by a 7-cent rise in September.The January increase came one day after a Federal judge approved a record-setting $15.3 billion settlement by Texas with the industry.On Friday, tobacco companies including Philip Morris reached a $6.5 billion settlement with Minnesota and an insurance company.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/09/us/tobacco-companies-settle-a-suit-with-minnesota-for-6.5-billion.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Tobacco Companies Settle a Suit With Minnesota for $6.5 Billion<date>Published: May 09, 1998</date><text>The first state lawsuit against tobacco companies to go to trial was settled today in Minnesota for $6.5 billion as jurors were hearing closing arguments. The agreement is likely to raise sharply the cost of future settlements between states and the tobacco industry, or of any tobacco bill in Congress.The $6.1 billion that Minnesota will receive over 25 years under the agreement is 50 percent more than it would have gained under the settlement that tobacco companies reached last June with 40 state attorneys general.The settlement was also the industry's first with a health insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, which will receive $469 million. Last week, 38 other Blue Cross organizations filed similar suits against tobacco companies to recover their costs from smoking-related health care.The plaintiffs' lawyers did not say exactly how they arrived at the $6.5 billion figure.Although the agreement is with one state, some of its provisions have national implications. The five tobacco companies sued by Minnesota in its effort to recover Medicaid costs related to smoking agreed to disband the Council for Tobacco Research, a nonprofit research group that the state accused the industry of using as a public relations front. And, for the first time, the tobacco companies entered into a consent decree promising not to misrepresent the health hazards of smoking.The amount each tobacco company will pay will be proportional to its share of the market.Minnesota's attorney general, Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, claimed victory as he announced details of the settlement. ''Today the tobacco industry has surrendered, and they have surrendered on our terms,'' he said.Other opponents of the tobacco industry were disappointed that Mr. Humphrey, who had trumpeted his determination to deal the industry a punishing blow, had settled after presenting a case that was considered extremely strong. ''Of course I would have liked the case to have gone to the jury,'' said Dr. David A. Kessler, who as head of the Food and Drug Administration proposed regulating nicotine as a drug. ''I really do believe that the state would have won -- but I understand the risks and the reasons for settling.''In explaining their decision to settle, the tobacco companies cited the odds against them in the Minnesota courtroom.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/07/us/philip-morris-censored-data-about-addiction.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Philip Morris Censored Data About Addiction<date>Published: May 07, 1998</date><text>The world's largest cigarette maker stopped the publication of research in 1983 that found evidence that nicotine was addictive, days after outside lawyers warned the company that such research had ''undesirable and dangerous implications'' for smoking-related lawsuits.And two months after receiving the lawyers' warning that nicotine research at one of its laboratories could damage the industry in trials, the cigarette maker, the Philip Morris Companies, tried to move the laboratory to Europe and, failing in that, closed it in early 1984.The memorandum, written by lawyers at Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon, a tobacco law firm in Kansas City, Mo., is among the industry documents that the state of Minnesota entered as evidence this week in its lawsuit against five tobacco companies. The state contends that the companies and their lawyers concealed evidence of smoking's health hazards.Separately, talks aimed at reaching a settlement of that case collapsed yesterday, said a lawyer with direct knowledge of the discussions. The development makes it far more likely that the Minnesota case may be the first state action against the industry to go to a jury. Barring a resumption of those talks, this could occur as early as tomorrow.The Shook, Hardy memorandum submitted by lawyers for Minnesota warned: ''This kind of research is a major tool of our adversaries on the addiction issue. The irony is that industry-sponsored research is honing that tool.''The closing of the Philip Morris laboratory and the blocking of a study reporting evidence that nicotine was addictive was first disclosed in 1994 by two former Philip Morris scientists, Victor DeNoble and Paul Mele, testifying before a Congressional committee.The industry still maintains that nicotine is not addictive. Responding to the accusations of Mr. DeNoble and Mr. Mele, Philip Morris's president, William I. Campbell, testified before Congress in 1994 that the researchers' findings had suggested only that nicotine was a weak ''reinforcer,'' or desirable substance, in the category of saccharin or water.The company also asserted at that time that the nicotine laboratory had been closed because its work was no longer important.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/22/business/company-reports-philip-morris-posts-6-rise-in-earnings.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">COMPANY REPORTS; Philip Morris Posts 6% Rise In Earnings<date>Published: April 22, 1998</date><text>The Philip Morris Companies said yesterday that earnings rose 6 percent in the first quarter, as it sold more than half the cigarettes in the United States for the first time, even though it raised prices to pay for legal costs.Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette company, said net income rose to $1.87 billion, or 77 cents a diluted share, from $1.77 billion, or 72 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.3 percent, to $18.4 billion from $18.0 billion. Earnings rose 9 percent, to 79 cents a share, matching analysts' expectations, before a charge to pay for a voluntary retirement program at its United States tobacco business.Nonetheless, the company's shares fell 62.5 cents, to $39.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.Philip Morris's cigarette sales in the United States rose 2.1 percent, helped by new Marlboro Ultra Lights, allowing the company to capture 50.4 percent of the market. At the same time, industry sales fell almost 2 percent over all, showing that Philip Morris may do better than competitors even if it continues to raise cigarette prices to pay for legislation being considered by Congress.''They're best positioned for the vagaries of Congress,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. who has a ''buy'' rating on Philip Morris's shares. ''They're larger and they have Marlboro,'' the world's No. 1 cigarette.Full-priced cigarette brands like Marlboro cost about $2.15 a pack at the end of the first quarter, up from about $2.10 a pack in December, analysts said. The extra revenue from increased prices can be put toward the tobacco industry's legal settlements. Philip Morris is responsible for paying about half of about $30 billion over 25 years in three settlements of health-related suits brought by Texas, Florida and Mississippi. Philip Morris and other tobacco companies may raise prices even more, depending on the outcome of Congressional talks on a nationwide tobacco settlement.International tobacco unit sales rose 4.7 percent and operating profit rose 11 percent, to $1.4 billion, even as weaker economies in Asia reduced demand.The company's Kraft North America unit had operating profit of $802 million, up 9.6 percent, largely as it cut costs. The company said it posted double-digit unit sales gains in its Tombstone and Di Giorno frozen pizza businesses as well as its Taco Bell and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese home meals.Profit from the company's international food business fell 2.9 percent, to $235 million, largely because of lower coffee sales and the effect of the strong dollar.Profit from Miller Brewing, the second-largest brewer in America, rose 1.6 percent, to $128 million, on slightly higher shipments.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/11/business/maxwell-house-price-cut.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">Maxwell House Price Cut<date>Published: April 11, 1998</date><text>The Kraft Foods Inc. unit of the Philip Morris Companies will cut the price of Maxwell House regular and decaffeinated coffee by 25 cents for a 13-ounce can, effective May 11. The suggested price of Maxwell House regular ground coffee will be lowered to $2.51 a can, from $2.76, while a can of decaffeinated coffee will drop to $3.21, from $3.46, said Patricia Brown Resso, a Kraft spokeswoman.

Goldstone, announced the new policy in a luncheon speech at the National Press Club, saying his company would begin aggressively advertising cigarettes and fighting for their position in court.The three other big tobacco companies -- the Philip Morris Companies; the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, a subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries, and Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the Loews Corporation -- quickly issued statements supporting Mr. Goldstone's position.The industry asserts that legislation approved last week by the Senate Commerce Committee would drive companies into bankruptcy. The bill would not give the companies the protection they want from lawsuits based on smoking-related illnesses.Many influential lawmakers said they thought the industry was bluffing, and Congressional leaders said they would press ahead with the legislation.''The public demands action, with or without the industry's support,'' said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Commerce Committee.President Clinton called the industry's position ''a big mistake'' and said: ''We're going to get this done. Now they can be part of it or they can fight it.''Mr. Goldstone declared in his luncheon speech, ''There is no process which is even remotely likely to lead to an acceptable comprehensive solution this year.''I have a business to run an industry on which millions of people depend,'' he added. ''So we will continue to manage our business in the most responsible and competitive way we can.''Philip Morris said, ''We regret that a historic opportunity to resolve decades-old controversies surrounding tobacco has been lost.''Mr. Goldstone said the industry's new advertising campaign would be intended only for adults. The tobacco manufacturers have not conceded that they ever marketed cigarettes to teen-agers.On Wall Street, the stock prices of all the main tobacco companies rose today.The industry, with its battery of lobbyists and public relations specialists and deep pockets for campaign contributions, had been advocating Congressional approval of the $368.5 billion, 25-year legal settlement the manufacturers and state attorneys general reached last June.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/31/arts/to-save-mayan-artifacts-from-looters-a-form-of-protective-custody.html?ref=philipmorrisinternationalinc">To Save Mayan Artifacts From Looters, a Form of Protective Custody<date>Published: March 31, 1998</date><text>To get to this remote Mayan ruin deep in the heart of northern Guatemala, a visitor must drive south for an hour and a half on a dirt road from the Flores Airport, ride a motor boat up La Pasion River for close to an hour and climb for 20 minutes or so up a steep, narrow path through the jungle to the first clearing. There the flat, round Temple of the Wind sits, crowned by a platform where Mayan dancers performed ritual ceremonies some 1,200 years ago. A little further on are more temples and many tall, carved limestone tablets known as stelae. Here and there, stone steps run up the side of a mound, signaling that another building in this still largely unexcavated city lies below.For a growing number of tourists, the ruins of Ceibal (pronounced say-BALL) are more than worth the rigors of the trip.The trouble is, Ceibal is even more rewarding for less benign visitors. Looters regularly attack it and hundreds of equally remote Mayan ruins with picks, shovels, jackhammers and saws, seeking ancient objects and slicing off pieces of stelae for illicit sale in the international art market. And each year Guatemala's growing population clears more rain forest surrounding the ruins for farmland, robbing them of their natural protection from the strong winds and heavy rains that cause erosion.In a drastic measure to halt the destruction, Guatemala's Minister of Culture and Sports, Augusto Vela Mena, plans to move more than 200 stelae and some altars and other carvings from here and about 10 other sites in the Petex Batun region, which was the center of the Mayan world in the classic period from A.D. 200 to 900.The uprooted artifacts will go on view in a visitors' center to be built in Sayaxche (pronounced sah-yash-CHAY), a small town nearby. Visitors to the ruins will see replicas instead of the real thing.Half the cost is being covered by a $160,000 gift from the Guatemalan unit of the Philip Morris Companies, the embattled American tobacco giant, whose business in Guatemala is growing. Mr. Vela Mena announced the initiative with fanfare on Friday evening in Guatemala City before leaving on a two-day publicity tour of a few sites.</text></article></page></root>
