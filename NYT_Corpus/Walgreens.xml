The pharmacy chain, based in Deerfield, Ill., and the nation’s largest, has renovated 20 stores in the Chicago area and is converting more than 40 in Indianapolis to get the pharmacist closer to patients. Pharmacists in the revamped stores are being kept away from the telephone, where dealing with insurance coverage questions and other administrative tasks occupy 25 percent of their time, Walgreen says. “What we are seeing now is pharmacists should be using their knowledge to help consumers manage their medications appropriately,” said Nimesh Jhaveri, executive director of pharmacy and health care experience at Walgreen. “It’s not about the product but the care we give.” The reinvention of the pharmacist’s role comes at a critical time for Walgreen, as it vies to keep its customer base. The company has so far been unable to reach a new contract with the pharmacy benefit giant, Express Scripts. At the same time, Greg Wasson, the chief executive, is trying to remake the company into a national provider of health care services. This last summer, Walgreen sold its own pharmacy benefit management company for more than $500 million to a Maryland firm in a deal that Mr. Wasson said would help the company focus on becoming the consumer’s “most convenient choice for health and daily living needs.” Walgreen braced investors last month for the potential loss next year of more than $3 billion in sales in 2012 if it lost the customers whose prescription coverage was managed by Express Scripts. In the most recent fiscal year for the company, it filled about 90 million prescriptions managed by Express Scripts. The two are parting ways effective Jan. 1 over payment issues, leaving Walgreen scrambling to contract with major employers directly in hopes that they will want to opt out of Express Scripts’ pharmacy network. Walgreen’s new model resembles the type of service that CVS and other major drugstore chains are trying to achieve by developing deeper relationships with customers and their doctors. Big pharmacy companies are hoping to increase reimbursements from insurers and employers as they become more integral in managing customers’ medical care. At the newly converted Walgreen stores, one of the ways pharmacists hope to develop longstanding relationships with customers is through private or semi-private consulting areas away from the busy pharmacy counter. On Chicago’s North Side, Walgreen has a pharmacy in the Andersonville neighborhood on North Clark Street that dispenses a substantial amount of medications to patients with the AIDS virus, so privacy for patients was critical and figured in the overall idea behind the new store model, company executives said. Behind the pharmacy counter, the familiar bags of medications are tagged and labeled alphabetically in plastic containers, but they cannot be seen from in front of the pharmacy counter. “Customers want privacy,” Mr. Jhaveri said. The Andersonville neighborhood store includes a 50-square-foot room behind sliding doors where a pharmacist, James Wu, can sit and counsel patients, who sit on a padded bench that has enough room for the patient and a family member or two. Mr. Wu’s desk is steps to the right of the private room. Mr. Wu said he could now spend more time talking to patients or out in the store aisles, and rarely is distracted now by the orders being placed for prescriptions. “I would take calls, asking ‘Is it ready?’ ‘Is it covered?’ ” Mr. Wu said. “The phone doesn’t ring anymore.” Walgreen said it would route routine questions about insurance coverage and co-payment issues to a call center in Orlando, Fla., that is staffed around the clock by pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Another new feature is a “health guide,” a concierge of sorts who answers questions, markets new services and triages patients who may need other health care services, like treatment at a Walgreen Take Care retail clinic. At 354 of the chain’s more than 7,700 stores, nurse practitioners at such clinics are available to handle routine maladies. 1 2 Next Page » </text></article>

The lower unit, embedded in a parking space, would send the power to the relay unit attached to an E.V. For all the recent debate about plug and charger standards, one company wants to do away with such talk altogether. WiTricity, a company based in the Boston suburb of Watertown, is working to commercialize wireless-charging technology that works through the principle of magnetic resonance, where an embedded device in an E.V.’s own parking space sends a charge to the vehicle. Mitsubishi and Toyota have been wooed by this vision and have both launched wireless charging research projects with WiTricity, which began developing its operating principle at M.I.T. from 2005 to 2007. Toyota announced what it called a technological collaboration with WiTricity in April. Meanwhile, in a statement released Tuesday, WiTricity, Mitsubishi and the IHI Corporation, an engineering company in Japan, said they would explore ways to incorporate wireless technology into E.V. charging infrastructure, clarify legal issues and test the systems on Mitsubishi vehicles. Maurice Durand, a Mitsubishi Motors North America spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the advantage of wireless charging was primarily one of convenience. “You won’t have to attach cables to your vehicle,” he said. “It’s also unobtrusive, and it helps to make E.V. charging easier to deploy and more widespread.” But Mr. Durand cautioned that wireless charging was not around the corner. “There is not a lot of relevance for the consumer in the near term,” he said. “This is an agreement to collaborate and push the technology along, and we’re essentially entering a testing phase.” Two issues that could affect this form of charging are safety and line losses. Wireless chargers typically create a magnetic field, as do the high-voltage power lines that have raised cancer fears. But according to Yinon Weiss, a spokesman for WiTricity, the concept is safe. “Electricity itself is not passed through the air,” he said of the magnetic-resonance principle in a telephone interview. “It’s a completely nonradiative energy transfer using resonant magnetic fields, which are very safe and localized. WiTricity systems are designed to comply with all known health and safety guidelines.” Mr. Weiss conceded that transfer losses, that is, the amount of current that is lost in transit from the embedded device to an E.V.’s charge receiver, were greater using wireless technology than a wired unit, but the company asserted that its system could still deliver up to 3.3 kilowatts of power over a distance of nearly eight inches while losing just 10 percent in transfer. And Mr. Weiss said that the company could limit transfer loss to just 3 percent. He compared WiTricity’s targeted transfer technology to an opera singer whose voice could shatter only one preselected glass out of 50, whereas a traditional inductive system might be less efficient and break all the glasses, he said. According to Mr. Weiss, the company could bring a commercial wireless charging system to market in several years. “It’s not a decade out,” he said. “This is not some science-fiction stuff.” Companies like HaloIPT and Evatran are at work on wireless charging systems, and the technology, or at least the idea of it, appears to be gaining momentum. Also on Tuesday, Michael Farkas, co-founder and chief executive of the Car Charging Group, said his company had filed for a patent to protect his concept of a wireless charger built into the bumper that marked the end of a parking space. The company is one of the partners supplying Walgreen parking lots with E.V. chargers, and Mr. Farkas said those units would be the traditional, wired type, at least for now. “Ultimately, we feel that wireless charging is the way to go,” he said in a telephone interview.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/walgreen-projects-loss-without-express-scripts/?ref=walgreencompany">Walgreen Projects Loss Without Express Scripts<date>September 27, 2011, 12:35 pm</date><text>The Walgreen Company on Tuesday braced Wall Street for a projected loss in 2012 of more than $3 billion in revenue because of the planned loss of business from customers who have their prescription drug coverage managed by Express Scripts. Express Scripts is the large pharmacy benefit manager that Walgreen is battling over payment issues. The proposed merger between Express Scripts and Medco Health complicates matters, given that federal regulators are scrutinizing the deal. Going without Express Scripts is a gamble for Walgreen, the nation’s largest pharmacy chain. Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., generated $5.3 billion, or 7 percent, of its $72 billion fiscal 2011 revenue from customers with drug coverage managed by Express Scripts, but the company is hoping to retain some of that money. Much of the rift, which began three months ago, centers on how much Walgreen is getting paid by Express Scripts to dispense prescriptions and how much the company pays Walgreen for the costs of the drugs. Express Scripts is a pharmacy benefit manager, which works as a middleman between employers and drug makers when it comes to buying prescription drugs. “We are planning not to be part of the Express Script network as of the first of the year,” Gregory D. Wasson, the chief executive of Walgreen, told analysts and investors. In a conference call after the company’s fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2011 earnings release, Walgreen executives outlined three potential situations in which they could retain 25 to 75 percent of the customers who have Express Scripts benefit plans. Depending on retention, Walgreen said the company could experience a negative impact of 7 to 21 cents a share for its fiscal 2012, which began Sept. 1 and runs through Aug. 31, 2012. Its contract with Express Scripts expires at the end of this year, leaving open the possibility that some resolution could be reached in the coming months. To mitigate the threatened loss of business from Express Scripts customers, Walgreen said it had been in talks with large health plans and employers about ending relationships with Express Scripts and contracting directly with Walgreen, but it would not provide specifics or name companies that were considering leaving. “We’re not going to speculate on retention,” Mr. Wasson said. “We’re encouraged by the response we are receiving.” The dispute comes at the peak of fall open enrollment season when companies disclose to workers their benefit options for the following year. It is during this time that workers will be deciding which health plans to choose. In addition, senior citizens covered by Medicare health insurance will also soon be choosing their drug coverage options for 2012. Both sides say they are trying to provide the best deal to employers while saving the health care system money. Express Scripts says Walgreen’s fees and costs to provide prescriptions are too high. “We would still welcome back Walgreens in our network at rates that are more aligned with rates that are right for our clients,” said Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts. But Walgreen says its rates are in line with the market and it gives customers the best buy at the pharmacy counter with its services that include educating customers and moving them to cheaper generic drugs. Walgreen also markets a program where consumers can get 90-day prescriptions at the pharmacy counter. In its fiscal fourth quarter that ended Aug. 31, Walgreen said profits jumped 69 percent to $792 million, or 87 cents a share, because of strong prescription sales and a gain from the sale of its Walgreens Health Initiatives business, a manager of pharmacy benefits. Revenue increased 6.5 percent to $18 billion. Walgreen sold the health initiatives unit in June to Catalyst Health Solutions, which is based in Maryland. Fourth-quarter earnings excluding the sale of the health initiatives business were 57 cents a share. Shares of Walgreen fell 6.2 percent, or $2.26 a share, to close at $33.77</text></article>

Chargers by End of 2011<date>July 22, 2011, 3:41 pm</date><text>Business Wire, via WalgreenA simulation of a charging station at a Walgreen store. The charger depicted is provided by NRG Energy, a partner in the drugstore chain’s charging-station introduction. Walgreen describes itself as the nation’s largest drugstore chain, and the company has another superlative to promote. On Thursday, it vowed to become the country’s biggest host for public electric vehicle charging stations by the end of the year. In total, stores will have about 800 chargers. “Our stores are located along major commuting corridors, so we saw this as a great way to serve the environment,” said Menno Enters, director of energy and sustainability at Walgreen, in a telephone interview. “We got a great customer response from the first stations we hosted, so for us this is a great fit. A national rollout seemed like the right thing to do.” Walgreen said that its providers already had installed or were in the process of installing chargers at 60 stores in Houston, the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Chicago. The retailer has signed on partners including 350Green, a charging-infrastructure provider, to perform the installations. The introduction will begin with the New York metropolitan area, particularly the outer boroughs, according to Tim Mason, the president and co-founder of 350Green. The company will account for 425 of the nationwide total. Mr. Mason said in an interview that the company would own the 240-volt chargers, though providers had yet to be determined. He added that 350Green would bill customers about $3 to $4 for a 90-minute connection, and prices would vary with the cost of grid electricity, he said. “This is a very ambitious rollout,” Mr. Mason said. In a statement, Walgreen identified other partners, including the Car Charging Group and NRG Energy, to assist in the installation project. The New York plan calls for as many as 60 stations, including 10 480-volt D.C. fast chargers. The major market regions in addition to New York are Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the District of Columbia. The retailer said that select locations in Florida, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon and Tennessee also would get chargers. Tiffani Washington, a Walgreen spokeswoman, said the retailer catered to a “grab and go” customer base, and that patrons could find it convenient to stop off at a store on the way home and plug in while shopping. Since their stay could be short, many would likely opt for a quick jolt rather than a full charge, she said. In June, a $5.2 million loan from the advanced energy portion of the Ohio Bipartisan Job Stimulus Program was approved for Walgreen to install rooftop photovoltaic systems at 52 stores in the state. Mr. Enters said that connecting its solar installations to E.V. charging was “something we would definitely like to explore.”</text></article>

Despite the beleaguered stock market, Duane Reade is turning to Wall Street to make a profit. On Wednesday, the chain will open a roughly 22,000-square-foot pharmacy in the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street. Joe Magnacca, president of Duane Reade and Everyday Living Solutions at the Walgreen Company, which owns Duane Reade, said it is the largest Duane Reade ever built. The drugstore occupies 40 Wall Street’s cavernous old bank space, with vaulted ceilings rising two stories above the marble floor. It includes opulent amenities like a hair salon for shampoos, blow dries and blowouts; a nail bar for manicures and massages; a pharmacy with a doctor on hand for consultation during the week; and a grocery market featuring sushi and smoothie bars. There is also a stock ticker. The Wall Street store’s extensive services are an attempt to rethink the American pharmacy model, which Mr. Magnacca said “hasn’t changed much since the removal of soda fountains 50 years ago.” “We believe it’s the most exciting drugstore in the world,” he said in an interview last week. Mr. Magnacca said this Duane Reade cost around 20 percent more than usual to build. It is the company’s latest effort to custom-fit a store to the surrounding neighborhood, a strategy that has touched off controversy in the past. One that opened last year on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, drew threats of a boycott from residents who feared it would force out independent pharmacies and homogenize the neighborhood. But the Williamsburg store, which features a bar that sells 64-ounce bottles of beer called growlers, proved so popular that Duane Reade adopted the growler bar at a second pharmacy on the Upper West Side. Mr. Magnacca said the new store was designed to preserve relics like black marble columns and gilded escalators from 40 Wall Street’s former life as the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building. He said he did not think financial district customers would see this Duane Reade as an encroachment; after all, there are already 14 locations around the neighborhood. Michael Fram and Tom McDonnell, who work at 40 Wall Street, were chatting outside the building Thursday afternoon. Both men said they were unaware that the store was opening, despite the gigantic banners that flapped directly overhead. Told of its arrival, they said they thought the store would be convenient, but they were not sure they would go there for lunch. “I don’t know about the sushi,” Mr. Fram said. “I’d have to smell it first. But I’ll try anything once.”</text></article>

Tags: Autism, Disabilities, Hiring and Promotion, Labor and Jobs, Tiaa-Cref, walgreens In recent years, there has been a dramatic rise in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (A.S.D.). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 730,000 people in the U.S. under age 21 have an A.S.D. It’s much harder to estimate the number of adults on the autism spectrum because only in recent decades has the condition been regularly diagnosed. Some companies are designing whole work environments to accommodate people with differences. What is clear is that almost all people with A.S.D. — which is four to five times more prevalent among males than females — struggle to find work where they feel comfortable and valued and where their abilities are well used. In the coming years, there is going to be a wave of young people with A.S.D. graduating from schools and embarking on careers. It will take significant changes in workplaces across the country to accommodate them. There is much to learn. On Friday, I reported on a Danish company called Specialisterne, which can supply a piece of the answer. Specialisterne trains people with autism to work as consultants in large companies where they excel at jobs like testing software and managing data. The model has inspired similar initiatives in a variety of countries, including the U.S. Thorkil Sonne, the founder, notes: “There are so many people who do not fit in today — who have skills but cannot find a way to make use of their skills.” Many readers agreed — and they wrote in to share stories of the difficulties they, or their children, have faced. “As a parent of a young person living with a disability, I’m inspired by what’s happening in Denmark,” wrote CDM from Providence, R.I. (3). “It’s very difficult to watch a person you love be forced to face the fact that, because of his disability, he isn’t valued as someone who can contribute in significant ways in the workplace. The only jobs that are made available are menial ones.” Jennifer from North Carolina (44) added: “In my 13-year career, I’ve yet to find an employer who tolerates my A.S.D. issues, much less embraces them. Thank you for letting me know that someday, some employer may accept my unique contributions to the workplace, or even value them.” And CHN, a special education teacher from Houston,  who works in a program that supports high school students with A.S.D. (65), noted: “Transition out of high school and into the real world is by far the most troubling and challenging issue we face.” (In April, a job skills training Web site called JobTIPS, designed for young adults with A.S.D., was launched by a group called do2learn, with support from the National Institute of Mental Health.) Traditional job placement strategies are often not effective for people with many types of disabilities. Alexa from Upstate New York (41) recalled her son’s experiences with a state supported “job coach” who did little more than provide him with job listings. “It would have been better to pick one job announcement and work through the whole process with him, including role-playing for a job interview, talking on the phone, writing applications, resumes and thank you letters and advocating for him on the other side of the fence.” The U.S. Office of Disabilities Employment Policy advocates an approach called “Customized Employment” in which a vocational specialist creates an in-depth profile of a person with a disability and, working with both employee and employer, defines the specific conditions of employment in which both parties are most likely to benefit. That’s what Specialisterne does, focusing on a subset of people with autism. A Chicago-based organization called Aspiritech, works in a similar fashion, training people with autism as software testers. Aspiritech’s co-founder Moshe Weitzberg, from Highland Park, Ill. (49) commented that the company has hundreds of potential employees on its waiting list. “[O]ne of our recent customers mentioned: ‘I am amazed by the level of detail that your testers are able to catch.’ In spite of our very satisfied customers, we still find it difficult to convince the business community that people on the [autism] spectrum can provide incredibly high quality work, which is critical to software development.” But it’s not just in software testing that people with autism could excel. “We started off in the IT sector because I worked in that sector,” explained Sonne. But if I had been working in a hospital, I probably would be talking about how good people with autism are at assessing X-rays, testing life-critical equipment, or entering medical data. In any business there may be five percent of all tasks that would fit very well with our consultants.” Specialisterne consultants are involved in jobs like monitoring the cable network for a utility company and digitizing correspondence for a Danish municipality. They are also well suited for things like motor repair, piano tuning, and pharmacy, explains Sonne. But companies can also become more broadly inclusive by designing whole work environments to accommodate people with differences. One example is Walgreens, which has designed regional distribution centers in South Carolina, Connecticut and Florida so people with disabilities, particularly autism, can work side by side with non-disabled employees. Having clear visual cues, for example, is extremely helpful, as is helping to reduce stress for people who may be highly sensitive to noise, light and touch. The financial services firm TIAA-CREF, which owns more than 400 farms, has established a program called Fruits of Employment, which hires people with autism to do farm work in two of its orchards and vineyards. One reader, Yukarisakamoto from Tokyo and Singapore (55), offered the example of the Coco Farm &amp; Winery in Japan, which employs many people with autism. Scott from Arizona (63) drew attention to Uzmanlar Danismanlik in Turkey, Autism Works in the U.K., and Kaien in Japan, all of which hire people with autism, and drew inspiration from Specialisterne. It’s notable that many of the initiatives above — including those at Walgreens and TIAA-CREF, as well as Specialisterne and Aspiritech — were started by entrepreneurs or managers who themselves had a child with autism. “I wonder what would have been if Thorkil Sonne’s child had not been diagnosed with autism,” commented ETF from New Jersey (16). It’s an important question. Developing employment for people with a wider range of disabilities will require a far more concerted and generalized effort from businesses than currently exists. It will also require a range of models for people who do not fit the kind of corporate consulting that Specialisterne or Aspiritech offer. “Turning the disability into a strength is a great idea,” explains Scott Standifer, a clinical instructor for disability policy and studies in the School of Health Professions at the University of Missouri, who has authored a highly referenced guide on adult autism and employment. “My concern is that there is a whole group of people with classical autism and more significant issues for whom this kind of model can’t address.” One company that has experience customizing employment for a wider range of clients is Montana-based Griffin-Hammis Associates, which, among other services, develops profiles of people with disabilities and surveys the needs of a range of employers in the community to come up with good matches. It would seem that the combination of in-depth personal assessments and a detailed mapping of community employment needs would be essential to any systematic solution. Related More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series. From the corporate perspective, hiring and managing people with disabilities has historically been seen as a burden, not an opportunity. But there is one industry in which many people with what would (elsewhere) be considered disabilities have thrived: information technology. “There are a lot of people who have been very important in the history of IT who would probably rate high on the autism scales,” explains Robert Austin, dean of the faculty of business administration at the University of New Brunswick, who is author of a Harvard Business Review case study on Specialisterne. “Some of the most brilliant people in the industry have been effective because companies have been willing to work with them.” Austin says that businesses in general, as well as business schools, haven’t paid sufficient attention to the competitive value of employees with differences. “When you find somebody who is different there might be something remarkable and important in that,” he says. That’s because innovation often comes from the margins of society. When anything can be copied cheaper somewhere in the world, companies that figure out how to do things differently gain the advantage. That means companies benefit when they generate valuable accidents and harness the talents of people with a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds. “The 20th century tried to make people fit into the system,” explains Austin. “The 21st century will be about managing people who don’t fit in.” Sonne hopes to bring the Specialisterne model to every state in the United States — but not through a franchise model. He plans to work closely with companies – guiding and mentoring them so they learn how to assess, hire and manage many more people with autism. “I hope this spreads!” writes Sleepygirl, from California (36) “Not just for those with ‘disabilities,’ but for everyone who does not conform to the ideal personality.” As Sonne says: “When we send the message to our children that it’s O.K. to be different, we create a very attractive world for them.” ﻿Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/business/22walgreen.html?ref=walgreencompany">Walgreens and Express Scripts at a Contract Impasse<date>Published: June 21, 2011</date><text>The Walgreen Company said on Tuesday that it was willing to walk away from more than $5 billion in annual revenue because the pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts did not pay it enough to fill prescriptions.If the companies do not settle their dispute, people whose prescription benefits are handled by Express Scripts will not be able to get their prescriptions filled at the biggest drugstore chain in the United States, and Walgreens will give up about 7 percent of its annual revenue. The announcement on Tuesday follows a similar contract fight a year ago between Walgreens and the CVS Caremark Corporation that was resolved less than two weeks after it became public. The impasse with Express Scripts overshadowed news that Walgreens’ net income climbed 30 percent in its third quarter. Walgreens’ stock fell $1.90, or 4.2 percent, to $43.28 a share. Express Scripts rose 20 cents to $54.99 a share. Walgreens, which has spent months negotiating a new contract with Express Scripts, said it would stop participating in Express Scripts’ prescription plans starting Jan. 1. Express Scripts is the second-largest pharmacy benefits manager in the United States, and it expects to handle at least 750 million prescription claims in 2011. Walgreens said about 90 million of those prescriptions would be filled at its stores. Express Scripts, which is based in St. Louis, said that it had been preparing for Walgreens’ departure and that more than 50,000 other pharmacies participated in its network. Walgreens, based in Deerfield, Ill., also reported that net income grew to $603 million, or 65 cents a share, during the three months ended May 31, up from $463 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier when its results were weighed down by costs associated with the health care reform law and its acquisition of the Duane Reade chain. Revenue climbed to $18.37 billion from $17.2 billion.The Walgreen Company said on Tuesday that it was willing to walk away from more than $5 billion in annual revenue because the pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts did not pay it enough to fill prescriptions.</text></article>

As a result, the chain said it was not planning on continuing to offer its retail pharmacies in the Express Script’s network in 2012. “While we have sought to negotiate a contract renewal agreement over the past several months, those talks have been unsuccessful,” said Greg Wasson, Walgreens’ chief executive in a statement announcing the decision. “Under the terms proposed by Express Scripts, it would not make good business sense for the strategic direction of our company to continue our relationship with them. “Walgreens is committed to providing quality, convenient and cost-effective pharmacy services to our patients, but we cannot continue to deliver these services under the terms and rates Express Scripts offered. As the largest retail provider in their pharmacy network, we were surprised by Express Scripts’ ultimate stance during our talks, which made it clear to us that they no longer had an interest in continuing a meaningful relationship.” In his statement, Express Scripts’ chairman and chief executive, George Paz, said: “In these challenging economic times, it is critical that we all work together to keep medicines affordable and accessible. It is shocking to us that Walgreens would back away from the table with six months to go in the current agreement, especially considering that negotiations are part of the normal course of business.” This is not the first impasse Walgreens has experienced with a pharmacy benefit manager. A year ago, Walgreens got into a similar showdown with CVS Caremark, which also operates a large chain of drugstores. The standoff was resolved pretty quickly, according to the article we wrote at the time. So it’s no surprise that some Wall Street analysts are predicting this dispute will again be settled. “We believe the most likely outcome to this dispute is some sort of resolution where Walgreen will remain in Express Scripts’ network,” David Larsen, an analyst with Leerink Swann Research, told investors. An article by The Associated Press has more details.</text></article>

Going into the week of release, industry projections were for about 700,000 records sold, but once Amazon put the album on sale for 99 cents — a surprise to Lady Gaga’s record label and management, in addition to her fans — expectations shot past one million. If the album had scanned 1.15 million copies, as Billboard predicted it might, “Born This Way” would have been the best-selling release since Eminem’s album “The Eminem Show” nine years ago. Sales of “Born This Way” were also helped by a blitz of marketing through big-box retailers, traditional media outlets like HBO and lots of new media partnerships, and by a strategy of stocking the album at thousands of nontraditional retail outlets, like Hudson News, Walgreens and CVS. The idea was to make the album available everywhere, Troy Carter, Lady Gaga’s manager, said in an interview on Tuesday. “To purchase a CD now, there aren’t a lot of places you can go,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s Best Buy, it’s Target, it’s Wal-Mart. So our thing was, with Gaga being such a household name, being able to put her in places where people shop. To be on an endcap at Whole Foods, if you see a Gaga CD, you might be familiar with her as an artist, and you might give it a chance.”</text></article>

The company’s expertise in edible oils was used widely by the potato chip industry in the 1950s and 1960s, and shaped the invention of Pringles, the thinly sliced saddle-shaped crisp. Company officials still aren’t sure how the chips got their name, but one theory holds that two Procter advertising employees lived on Pringle Drive in Cincinnati and the name paired well with potato. The creator of the famous Pringles can was so proud of his invention that he asked that his ashes be buried in one. Yet Pringles, which is basically dehydrated potato flakes that are rolled and then fried, was not universally loved. It was such a dud in its early years that some called for Procter to dump the brand. The brand did not take off until the company tweaked the flavor in 1980 and introduced the “Fever for the Flavor of Pringles” advertising campaign. By the late 1990s, Pringles had become a $1 billion a year brand. On the television series “Ally McBeal,” Ally got into a grocery store skirmish with a woman over a can of Pringles. “When I was there 30 years ago, it was dead,” said Charles Jarvie, vice president of Procter’s food division in the late 1970s. “It’s a great example where they just didn’t give up.” Nonetheless, the sale of Pringles was not unexpected, as Procter has refocused its attention on the core businesses of beauty, grooming and household care. “Pringles is an iconic, billion-dollar snack brand with significant global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure,” said Michael J. Mendes, chief executive of Diamond Foods, in a statement. The $2.35 billion transaction includes $1.5 billion of Diamond stock, which goes to P.&amp; G. shareholders who elect to participate in the deal, and the assumption of $850 million of Pringles debt by the merged company. The sale will barely make a dent in Procter, with $80 billion in annual sales. “It really didn’t fit what they are looking to do,” said Jason Gere, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who tracks the company. “For a long time, this was one of those products that felt more appropriate in someone else’s portfolio.” Pringles has kept up with some of its rivals in the flavor department, offering salt-and-vinegar, cheddar and pizza versions. While Pringles’ sales had been growing of late, Mr. Gere said that they had not been nearly as robust as many of P.&amp; G.’s other megabrands. Mr. Jarvie said the company had hoped to replicate the great science breakthroughs it had with laundry detergents, toothpaste and disposable diapers. But, he said, “food is as much an art as it is a science. Procter never got that.” In the 1950s, roughly 25 percent of the company’s sales were in food, particularly in shortening and other cooking oils. “We provided most of the oils to the potato chip industry,’ said Greg McCoy, a corporate archivist. “We were already frying up potato chips to test the oils.” But it lacked a distribution network to ship perishable bags of chips to grocery stores, so it directed its researchers to come up with a longer-lasting chip that could be distributed with P.&amp; G.’s existing distribution network. “They knew from the get-go that they wanted it to be uniform in size, texture and taste,” Mr. McCoy said. Procter wanted to create a perfect chip to address consumer complaints about broken and stale chips and air in the bags. The task was assigned to a chemist named Fredric Baur, who from 1956 to 1958 created Pringles’ saddle shape out of fried dough and also its can. But Mr. Baur could not figure out how to make the chips taste good, and he eventually was pulled off the Pringles job to work on another brand. In the mid-1960s, another Procter researcher, Alexander Liepa, dusted off Mr. Baur’s work and set a out to improve on the Pringles taste, which he succeeded in doing. Another theory for the Pringles’ name comes from Mr. Liepa’s patent, which credits research done in the 1940s by Mark Pringle, Mr. McCoy said. The chips were test marketed in Evansville, Ind., in 1968 and were an “overnight sensation,” Mr. McCoy said. But when the chips went national in 1971, the taste issue resurfaced. Officially, Pringles are called crisps rather than chips, the result of a long-ago fracas between competitors and regulators over what could be called a potato chip. In the 1993 book “Soap Opera: the Inside Story of Procter &amp; Gamble,” the author Alecia Swasy writes that Pringles were considered one of the great flops in company history, “the P.&amp; G. Edsel.” Mr. McCoy maintains, however, that Pringles gained traction after a makeover in 1980s, which included a thicker chip and a new focus on the taste, rather than the can. Mr. Baur never lost his affection for the Pringles’ can, which he invented. When he died in 2008, his children honored his request to bury his ashes in a Pringles can. In an interview with Time, Mr. Baur’s son, Larry, said he and his siblings stopped at a Walgreen’s to pick up a can of Pringles on the way to the funeral home. “My siblings and I briefly debated what flavor to use,” Mr. Baur said, in the Time interview. “But I said, ‘Look we need to use the original.’ ”In announcing the sale of Pringles on Tuesday, Procter &amp; Gamble concluded what had been a tumultuous, sometimes zany, 50-year experiment in engineered food.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/with-drugstore-com-purchase-walgreen-diverges-from-cvs-strategy/?ref=walgreencompany">With Drugstore.com Purchase, Walgreen Diverges From CVS Strategy<date>March 24, 2011, 3:10 pm</date><text>Updated: Walgreen’s announcement today that it plans to purchase the Web business drugstore.com for $409 million highlights the radically different business strategies of the nation’s two leading drugstore chains. Walgreen, with about 7,600 stores, is focused on retail sales. Just two weeks ago, it announced it was selling its pharmacy benefits management business for $525 million. The purchase of drugstore.com means Walgreen will essentially flip the benefit management money into Web retail expansion. Drugstore.com sells 60,000 over-the-counter health, beauty, vision and skin care products. In May 2010, it sold its prescription drug business to BioScrip in a deal valued at $10.9 million. Walgreen also sells prescription drugs on its Web site. CVS, with just over 7,000 stores, has gone deeply into the benefit management business and stayed there, to the chagrin of some analysts. CVS bought Caremark, the nation’s third-largest pharmacy benefits manager, for about $26 billion in 2007 after a bidding war. Handling benefits for more than 50 million Americans, Caremark dwarfed Walgreen’s benefit management business. But the CVS-Caremark combination raised regulatory scrutiny and concerns from community pharmacies, not to mention complaints from Walgreen over how much Caremark would reimburse customers who shopped at Walgreen instead of CVS. That dispute, potentially affecting where millions of people filled their prescriptions, was settled last June with an agreement between the companies. There has been some talk of unwinding the CVS Caremark deal because the drugstore and benefit management businesses might possibly do better independently. Last quarter’s results continued to disappoint investors, and the new president and chief executive, Larry J. Merlo, told analysts, “One of my top priorities will be to ensure that the CVS Caremark merger is financially successful for our shareholders.” Matthew Coffina, a Morningstar analyst, said in an interview on Thursday that CVS Caremark had lost market share and taken hits on margins by aggressive pricing. “If they can’t find a way to keep the business without sacrificing so much on price, it’s logical sooner or later they’ll have to spin it off,” he said. As for the Walgreen purchase of drugstore.com, Mr. Coffina is no fan of that business move, either. Drugstore.com has never had a profitable year, and Walgreen said it would lower projected earnings for the next three years as retail pharmacies face increasing competition from superstores like WalMart, Web sites like Amazon and mail-order pharmacies. ““Spending $400 million and expected to generate losses through 2013,” Mr. Coffina noted. Walgreen stock rose 0.3 percent on Thursday to $39.95 a share. CVS closed 1.04 percent higher at $34.00 a share while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 percent.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/business/10views.html?ref=walgreencompany">An Anniversary to Bear in Mind<date>Published: March 9, 2011</date><text>   The rally in stocks is now two years old. The M.S.C.I. global index has nearly doubled since March 9, 2009, the postfinancial crisis nadir. Credit markets are thriving, and economic activity has returned. Yet the government actors behind the rebound look spent. Financial markets are on their own for future shocks. A call to arms from the world’s governments pulled the financial system back from the brink two years ago. Guaranteeing bank debt, slashing interest rates, buying more than $1 trillion of assets and stress testing large banks were among the moves that restored stability and revived markets. President Obama may have seen all the activity coming: On March 3, 2009, he called stocks “a potentially good deal.” Even the derivatives index used to hedge subprime mortgage loans is up 25 percent, according to Barclays Capital. With oil up more than 120 percent in two years and gold 55 percent higher, commodities look frothy. The International Monetary Fund on Monday noted “overheating” in emerging markets. Meanwhile, there remain plenty of potential flashpoints. Turmoil in the Middle East, which has increased the price of oil, is the most immediate. Sovereign debt stresses in Europe remain worrying. And rising inflation combined with an increase in interest rates is another situation that could torpedo market sentiment. For investors from banks to hedge funds, however, the safe options that may protect them against these risks just don’t make enough money. Short-term interest rates, for instance, are mostly still low, especially the Federal Reserve’s zero to 0.25 percent. They prefer, as before the crisis, to shoulder risk in return for more yield. But this time there’s no real government safety net. Huge budget deficits in the developed world leave little ammunition for governments. Politics won’t allow further large-scale intervention, especially in the United States. True, central banks like the Fed have shown themselves prepared to print money, even though doing more of that would run the risk of further undermining confidence. The government-fueled bull run is fresh in investors’ minds. But they might do well not to forget the dark days two years ago. A Dog of a Deal Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, has showed its arch-rival a solution to its problems by selling its pharmacy benefits management arm to better focus on retailing. Walgreens’ top competitor, CVS, has taken the opposite tack since it paid $26 billion for Caremark. That dog of a deal, which has dragged down performance and led to an antitrust inquiry, looks increasingly in need of unwinding. True, Walgreens’ pharmacy benefits management business was never a big part of the company. The unit, which is selling for $525 million in cash to Catalyst Health Solutions, contributes less than 2 percent to Walgreens’ bottom line. Still, with the middleman gone, Walgreens’ managers will be better concentrated on the firm’s core business. Contrast that with CVS-Caremark. The company runs a retail operation similar in scale to Walgreens along with a giant pharmacy benefits management company. Since the two merged, the Caremark business has lost some big contracts and downgraded its earnings forecasts. It has also spent precious management time explaining to the Federal Trade Commission why the combination doesn’t hurt consumers. Investors have noticed. The shares have underperformed and trade at a discount to other drugstore chains and pure-play pharmacy benefits firms Medco Health and Express Scripts. To the market, the group is neither fish nor fowl. The solution is to let them swim their separate ways again. CVS-Caremark claimed $700 million of synergies from merging. But even if these vanished, their net present value would still amount to less than the potential upside from splitting. Moreover, the looming presence of the antitrust inquiry would vanish. Here’s a case where the market might nicely do regulators’ dirty work. AGNES T.

By buying the Walgreens unit, Catalyst expects to increase the number of its prescription benefits customers to 18 million from 7 million, while raising the number of covered prescriptions to more than 165 million from 80 million. The takeover is the latest in the prescription benefits industry. In 2007, CVS pulled off the biggest such deal when it acquired CareMark Rx for $26.5 billion. The Walgreens deal is expected to close in the first half of the year. Catalyst has received loan commitments from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, SunTrust and Wells Fargo, though the company said it might also sell stock and use existing cash and credit lines to finance the deal. Catalyst was advised by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies &amp; Company and the law firms Latham &amp; Watkins and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo. Walgreens was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firms Sidley Austin and Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/business/media/11adco.html?ref=walgreencompany">Walgreens to Focus on Its Brand of Health Products<date>Published: February 10, 2011</date><text>THE next time consumers visit a Walgreens drugstore looking for something to soothe their achy heads, the company hopes they will reach for its private-label pain reliever and not a brand name.To help consumers make that choice, the drugstore chain will begin the first national advertising campaign for Walgreens branded health and wellness products on Sunday. The campaign is the first time Walgreens has gone beyond Sunday newspaper circulars and in-store signs to advertise its own brand. The campaign emphasizes the affordability and quality of the Walgreens brand products and uses the store’s 26,000 pharmacists as a central theme. Kim L. Feil, the chief marketing officer at Walgreens, said that while the ailing economy had spurred an increase in the number of people buying store-brand products, “It’s equally important that we elevate the Walgreens brand and product not just on the basis of lower cost.” Of 1,006 adults in the United States surveyed by Walgreens and the Opinion Research Corporation in January, 84 percent said they purchased store-brand over-the-counter medications when they were available and 36 percent said they had increased their purchases of store-brand products in the last year, according to a statement provided by the company.  For its new advertising effort, the company partnered with Digitas, part of the Publicis Groupe, on the digital portion of the campaign. Last spring, in conjunction with Digitas and DECA, a digital media company, Walgreens began a partnership with the health and parenting Web site ParentsAsk.com to present branded content. On the page dedicated to Walgreens, viewers see ads for the new campaign along with videos about things like choosing the right day care and protecting children from springtime risks like bee stings. The page also features advice videos from a Walgreens pharmacist, Stacia Woodcock. While the videos are not new to the campaign, the fact that Ms. Woodcock will begin recommending Walgreens brand products is, said Susan McNally, an associate media director at Digitas. Banner ads comparing Walgreens store brands to name brands will also appear on the page and on Web sites like ABC.com and CBS.com, where the company has purchased video spots that will run before prime-time shows like “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Modern Family,” “How I Met Your Mother,” “Survivor” and “The Big Bang Theory.” The banner ads list the crucial comparison points between store brands and brand names, including when store brands contain the same active ingredients or may be less expensive and usually backed by a guarantee. The ads also contain a link to the Walgreens Web site where users can purchase products and see the best-selling store-brand items. As part of its digital strategy, Walgreens also partnered with the women-centric blog publishing network, BlogHer, to reach its target demographic of women between the ages of 25 and 54. The company provided seasonal products like cold and flu remedies to bloggers at sites like TheFrugalGirl.com and SliceOfLemon.com so the bloggers could review them and encourage their readers to try them, Ms. McNally said. Walgreens will continue to provide products to a variety of bloggers — primarily those who focus on mothers and deal seekers — throughout the year. All of the participating bloggers will be paid to participate in the campaign and will be allowed to combine Walgreens brand principles in their posts, Ms. McNally said. Banner ads will also appear within the BlogHer.com network of sites that will incorporate comments from users and snippets of blog posts about the products. Walgreens spent $271 million on advertising for the 2010 fiscal year, $334 million in 2009 and $341 million in 2008, according to the company. Its new advertising effort is an extension of a campaign Walgreens began in 2009 called “There’s a Way,” which was aimed at increasing consumer awareness of all of its health services and products. For its new television commercial and the print ads, Walgreens worked with its agency of record, Downtown Partners. The work emphasizes the theme of pharmacists recommending the Walgreens private-label products. The television commercials show three scenes, including a woman in an elevator whose Walgreen pharmacist recommended “cold tablets and hot soup” for her cold. After she sneezes, a fellow elevator passenger gives her a cautious look.  The second and third scenes in the commercial include a mother whose Walgreen pharmacist recommends “bubble gum flavor and patience” as her son hides behind a toy shield, and a man standing in a restaurant who is recommended “antacid tablets and only one taco.” The idea was to make the spots memorable and warm so that viewers could identify with the characters, said Jim Schmidt, a creative partner at Downtown Partners. “It’s a pretty heavily informative commercial. We hopefully succeeded in making it likable,” Mr. Schmidt said. Consumers who purchase the store-brand products will also be able to make others feel better through the cause-marketing portion of the campaign. On Feb. 1, Walgreens began donating a penny from the purchase of every store-brand health and wellness product to its Walgreens Way to Well fund, which provides health services and educational efforts to local communities, including preventative health tests and vouchers for products. Walgreens will donate up to $3 million annually. To extend the store-brand campaign in the spring, Walgreens will introduce new in-store signs featuring frequently asked questions about health and wellness products on store shelves.THE next time consumers visit a Walgreens drugstore looking for something to soothe their achy heads, the company hopes they will reach for its private-label pain reliever and not a brand name.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/business/17grocery.html?ref=walgreencompany">Stores Like Target and CVS Add Groceries to Attract Shoppers<date>Published: January 16, 2011</date><text>For dinner tonight, pick up some sushi and salad — at Walgreens. Or maybe some Target chicken.Reflecting a major shift in the way Americans shop for food, retailers better known for selling clothes or aspirin, including Walgreens, CVS/Pharmacy and Target, are expanding in a big way into the grocery business, with fresh produce, frozen meats and, yes, even sushi. Target invested $500 million last year alone in a new push on groceries, retrofitting some of its general merchandise stores with full-blown food sections. Sales and traffic at stores with the new grocery areas are about 6 percent higher than at similar stores without them, the company says. Walgreens began making over some stores in Chicago and New York a year ago, and added up to 500 food items. CVS/Pharmacy last year redesigned about 200 of its stores in urban areas like Boston, Detroit and New York, and expects to make over about 20 percent of its 7,100 stores in all. As a result, people who typically went to the grocery store once a week to stock up are instead stopping by places whose food items used to be limited to a bag of chips or a can of soup. And retailers are viewing it as an opportunity to increase sales by getting people in their stores more frequently. “It’s going to be a big food fight in the sense that you’re going to have so many people going after this sector,” said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst with Deutsche Bank. The changes have hit the traditional grocery businesses, stores like Supervalu and Safeway, whose profits had already been declining because of rising food prices, fixed real estate and labor costs, and more competition. Like the grocers, the convenience stores and discount stores are not making a lot of money on their groceries. Instead, the goal is to draw more customers. People shop for food on average about 2.5 times a week, Mr. Dreher said, compared with once a month or so for a drugstore or Target. So if the stores can entice shoppers to pick up some groceries on the way home from work, marketing data shows they are likely to add some paper towels or nail polish or a DVD to their carts, spending around the same amount each time they visit. “Instead of having you stop at a supermarket or a fast-food place,” said Bryan Pugh, vice president for merchandising for Walgreens, “could I potentially entice our shoppers with a better range, better assortment?” So far, the drugstore sales of grocery items are too small to be statistically significant, but they are growing, according to Janney Capital Markets, which estimates that Wal-Mart has about 33 percent of the grocery market, and Target about 3 percent; Kroger, Safeway and Supervalu each represent 4 to 9 percent. “Stomachs haven’t gotten significantly larger, yet you have, probably, at least 10 percent per capita more square footage than you did in the ’80s” devoted to grocery, said Jonathan P. Feeney, an analyst with Janney. Target began opening stores primarily devoted to groceries, called SuperTargets, in the 1990s. But two years ago, seeking to lure customers during the economic downturn, it began trying out grocery areas in its traditional multipurpose stores. It now has groceries in about 450 of its 1,750 stores. Another 400 are planned for 2011, and Annette Miller, Target’s senior vice president for grocery, said she expected an expanded food department to move into most Target stores eventually. The grocery section is laid out with islands stacked with fresh vegetables and bakery items, surrounded by refrigerated cases carrying items like pizza, burritos and chicken. Target also carries sandwiches and quick lunches in stores near office buildings. “What we’re finding with this new layout is the number of trips is really increasing,” said Ms. Miller, adding that when customers come in, they are “still shopping the entire store.” Mr. Dreher of Deutsche Bank estimated that shoppers go to Targets with groceries almost twice as often as patrons visit regular Targets. While the gross margins of the grocery business are about 18 percent, well below those of retail, which are about 30.5 percent, groceries both drive visits and make existing stores more profitable, said Colin McGranahan, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. At drugstores, the emphasis on food goes beyond increasing foot traffic, to the broader goal of selling more items outside the pharmacy. 1 2 Next Page »For dinner tonight, pick up some sushi and salad — at Walgreens.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/business/23walgreen.html?ref=walgreencompany">Cost Controls Help Lift Walgreen’s Earnings<date>Published: December 22, 2010</date><text>The Walgreen Company posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, crediting cost controls and less discounting.Walgreen, the largest drugstore chain in the United States, said that it also increased sales while improving its gross profit margin. The company, which competes with CVS Caremark, Rite Aid, Wal-Mart Stores and others, has been able to cut back on profit-sapping promotions as it has improved its merchandise assortment and kept inventory under control. Walgreen continued to gain market share in the quarter. It filled 202 million prescriptions, up 4.6 percent from a year earlier, and more than double the rate of increase shown by the rest of the industry. The chain also has been slowing down the pace of new store openings and converting thousands of stores to a new, streamlined format that reduces some of the administrative workload for pharmacists. Earnings for the first quarter ended Nov. 30 rose to $580 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with $489 million or 49 cents a share for the same quarter in 2009. Earnings included a 2-cents-a-share inventory write-off for flu shots. Analysts on average forecast earnings of 54 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Quarterly revenue rose 6 percent to $17.34 billion. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, were up 0.8 percent for the quarter. Prescription sales, which account for nearly two-thirds of sales, were up 5.3 percent for the quarter. The increase in sales was driven by Walgreen’s growing share of the retail prescription market, which ended the quarter at 19.7 percent. The company’s pharmacies and clinics also administered 5.6 million flu shots, slightly more than last year’s first quarter. Executives said they could not predict how the current quarter would turn out. A large part of their holiday sales comes from last-minute shoppers this week, including on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Shares of Walgreen rose $2.02, or 5.8 percent, to $38.85. Shares of CVS rose 47 cents, to $34.95, and Rite Aid fell 2.2 percent to 90 cents.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14fob-consumed-t.html?ref=walgreencompany">Walgreens Tackles Food Deserts<date>Published: November 12, 2010</date><text>Among students of the contemporary metropolis, “food deserts” have become a widely known problem. The term is generally used to describe urban neighborhoods where there are few grocers selling fresh produce, but a cornucopia of fast-food places and convenience stores selling salty snacks (though, strictly speaking, the term can be applied to rural or suburban areas, too). Often the problem afflicts low-income areas abandoned or shunned by food businesses that focus on better-off consumers; the residents of food deserts, apparently, are not providing enough profit to be offered more healthful grub. These are places where the market for nutritious sustenance has essentially failed.Perhaps the marketplace can reverse its own failure, but a little prodding from other entities may be required. One example emerged this summer in Chicago when Walgreens, the drugstore chain founded in that city more than 100 years ago, started selling an expanded selection of food, including fresh fruits and vegetables, at 10 locations selected because they were in food deserts. The experiment in creating these “food oases” is intriguing because it involves a well-known retail brand not typically associated with groceries — and, really, because it involves a well-known retail brand at all. Chicago was the focus of a 2006 study by the Mari Gallagher Research and Consulting Group (commissioned by LaSalle Bank) that helped popularize the phrase “food desert” by linking it to block-by-block grocery-access data and made forceful arguments about the impact the lack of options had on public health. While the same issues exist in many places (and Gallagher has since assessed locales like Detroit and Birmingham, Ala.), it seems likely that the prominent association between Chicago and the food-desert problem played some role in motivating city politicians; the Walgreens foray into groceries followed an appeal from Mayor Richard Daley’s office. A drugstore might not seem the obvious venue for solving a grocery-store problem, but Walgreens offered something useful: ubiquity. “That’s the exciting thing about Walgreens, they’re in so many places,” Gallagher says. (It was during her research on Detroit that she was struck by the fact that pharmacies were practically the only mainstream chain presence, aside from fast food, in many neighborhoods.) Thus the pharmacy chain did not have to open new stores in food deserts, because it was already operating in plenty of them, and could use Gallagher’s data to pick locations for its experiment. Still, refitting the stores to offer 750 or so new products, including whole new categories, without expanding their actual size was a big undertaking. (About 20 to 25 percent of the square footage in each participating store is now given over to food.) And Walgreens had to line up new suppliers and adjust to the risks of selling things like lettuce and bananas that can go bad on the shelf if not bought quickly, says Jim Jensen, the chain’s divisional merchandise manager for consumables. Then again, if you’re a big retailer looking to explore a new category, there are advantages to knowing in advance that the market isn’t exactly saturated. Walgreens is offering few specifics about how the test run is going. (The company put me in touch with Bridgett James, manager of the 67th and Stony Island Avenue location, who said that customers love it.) But Don Whetstone, senior director of new format development, frames groceries as a business opportunity. “We didn’t build this just for Chicago” he says. It’s certainly easy, given the scope of the food-desert challenge, to imagine other municipalities encouraging Walgreens to bring its concept elsewhere; customers in other cities who have heard about the effort have already starting asking local Walgreens managers when produce will be available. Meanwhile, more non-junk-food items and ready-made meal options (sandwiches, for example) have been spotted at drugstore chains like CVS and Duane Reade; Wal-Mart has said it will test smaller stores within cities instead of at their fringes. Gallagher, whose research has evidently done a great deal to spark all this experimentation, has been working with new measurements to help more retailers adjust their product mix to more healthful foods in areas that lack access to them. Another clever attention-getting statistic she has come up with is a measurement of “years of life gained” through access to better food. While Gallagher is pleased to see the Walgreens experiment unfold, “there’s not a single solution,” she says. And in fact there’s an overlap between that view and her general theme, which is that the goal is fundamentally to increase choice. She is less concerned about purging food deserts of fast food or other processed-sustenance options than she is with adding more healthful options to the menu. “Choice,” she maintains, “is a good driver.” In other words, if this marketplace failure is going to be resolved, it’s hard to see how anything but the marketplace can do it.</text></article>

Walgreen said prescription drug sales improved, and sales of other items like cosmetics and food were more profitable because of better prices and successful promotions. Sales of nonpharmacy items have been hurt by the weak economy as shoppers have cut back on their spending. The company said sales since the beginning of flu shot season had been brisk. Since the middle of August, it has administered more than two million flu shots and sprays. Many of those sales are not included in its fourth-quarter results since the period ended Aug. 31, but Walgreen said it aimed to sell 15 million flu shots over the winter. That would be more than twice the seven million shots it sold in 2009-10. The company reported net income of $470 million, or 49 cents a share, for the quarter. That was up from $436 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 44 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. John Ransom, an analyst at Raymond James, said Walgreen’s gross margins were better than expected, and the savings from the company’s overhaul plan canceled out its spending on new stores and the Duane Reade acquisition, as well as weak revenue. The company’s results included 4 cents a share in expenses related to the purchase of Duane Reade, which was completed in April and brought the company 258 stores. It reported a 1 cent a share in costs from its reorganization plan, from which it aims to save $1 billion per year. Revenue rose 7 percent to $16.87 billion, up from $15.7 billion, as the company continued to expand, also topping analysts’ $16.84 billion average estimate. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.5 percent during the quarter, while prescription revenue at those stores rose 1.6 percent. Those comparisons are considered an important measure of retailer health because they exclude results from stores the company opened, acquired or closed over the previous year. For the full fiscal year, Walgreen reported net income of $2.09 billion, or $2.12 a share, up from $2.01 billion, or $2.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $67.42 billion, up from $63.34 billion.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/business/19drug.html?ref=walgreencompany">Walgreen and CVS Reach a Deal on Prescriptions<date>Published: June 18, 2010</date><text>Who blinked?After an unusually public showdown that threatened to restrict where millions of consumers could fill their prescriptions, Walgreen and CVS Caremark said on Friday that they had agreed to a new contract. In addition to being in the drugstore business, CVS Caremark is a leading provider of prescription benefit plans that many employers offer workers and their dependents. As a result of the deal announced Friday, people enrolled in those drug benefit plans will be able to continue shopping at Walgreen, which operates about 7,500 drugstores across the country, the two companies said. The two did not disclose the terms of the new contract and neither would elaborate beyond the joint statement they issued. Earlier this month, the rivals had threatened to stop doing business with each other. CVS operates more than 7,000 drugstores. After Walgreen said it would no longer accept customers in any new CVS Caremark drug plans because of its rival’s business practices, CVS Caremark countered by saying even people currently enrolled in its plans would no longer be able to fill prescriptions at Walgreen, starting next month. CVS Caremark said Walgreen was just holding out for higher prices. The split was potentially disruptive for many customers, and many analysts and benefit consultants saw the moves as potentially hurting both companies. Both Walgreen and CVS Caremark seem to have blinked, said Dave Shove, an analyst for BMO Capital Markets. “The obvious takeaways are that these folks need to do business with each other, whether they like each other or not,” he said. Without having the details of the new contract, he said it was impossible to know which company gave up more ground in the intense negotiations that came after the Walgreen announcement on June 7. Walgreen would have lost an important source of customers, and CVS Caremark risked its business relationships with employers intent on giving their workers a full choice of drugstores to fill their prescriptions. “There’s too much money at stake,” said Edward A. Kaplan, a benefits expert at the Segal Company, a consultant. “There’s too much for both of them to walk away.” But others saw this as a victory for CVS Caremark because Walgreen was ultimately forced to back down from its threat to stop letting consumers buy their prescriptions through the CVS Caremark plan. “Walgreens tried to force a negotiating situation when they really had no cards,” said George Hill, an analyst at Leerink Swann. “I might even go so far as to say that Walgreen bluffed and CVS called.” What this resolution does not make clear is whether so-called pharmacy benefit managers like CVS Caremark will be able to pursue a business model in which patients will be forced to use a select network of pharmacies. Employers, especially those with many workers in CVS Caremark plans who fill prescriptions at Walgreen, were particularly distressed over the face-off. “Most Americans do not like closed networks when it comes to health care,” said Mr. Shove. Shoppers want to know that if a drugstore cannot fill their prescription, they can easily go to another, he said. Still, some benefit consultants said at least some employers were intrigued by the idea of saving money on prescription drug costs by using a plan limiting the choice of drugstores — in the same way that some health insurers allow patients to use only certain doctors or hospitals. “It’s never really happened on the pharmacy side,” said David Dross, an executive for the consultant Mercer, who advises companies on pharmacy benefits. “I think it’s time for that to happen.” The dispute also raised questions about whether CVS Caremark, because of its dual businesses, was engaging in anticompetitive behavior in the Walgreen showdown. Small drugstore operators have already voiced concerns about the company’s dual roles, and the disagreement with Walgreen drew more attention to those issues. In an earlier statement, Walgreen had complained of “being more of a competitor to CVS drugstores within their network.” CVS Caremark said earlier that it was the subject of inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission, and attorneys general in 24 states. In response to earlier questions, CVS Caremark said it remained “confident that our business practices and service offerings are being conducted in compliance with antitrust laws.”</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/business/10drug.html?ref=walgreencompany">A Dispute Over Filling Prescriptions<date>Published: June 9, 2010</date><text>A fight has broken out between the nation’s biggest drugstore chains, Walgreen and CVS Caremark, potentially affecting where millions of consumers can fill their prescriptions.On Monday, Walgreen, which operates about 7,500 drugstores across the country, announced it would not participate as a prescription drug provider for customers in new drug benefit plans administered by CVS Caremark. CVS Caremark, besides operating more than 7,000 of its own drugstores, is also a leading provider of prescription drug benefit plans that many employers offer workers and their dependents. On Wednesday, CVS Caremark countered the Walgreen move. The company said that anyone now enrolled in its drug benefit plans would have to stop filling their prescriptions at Walgreen within a month. “It’s a real big game of chicken, and I don’t know who’s going to win this one,” said Edward A. Kaplan, a benefits expert at the Segal Company, a consultant to big employers. Mr. Kaplan said he was working with employers to determine how many of their workers might be affected if they were forced to stop using Walgreen under their plans. Smaller drugstore operators had already raised antitrust concerns against CVS Caremark, citing potential conflicts caused by its dual role as a pharmacy chain and a drug plan administrator. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent drugstores, said the Federal Trade Commission was investigating its accusations of anti-competitive practices by CVS Caremark. The commission confirmed the investigation but declined to comment on the nature of the inquiry. Attorneys general in 24 states are conducting a similar investigation, according to CVS Caremark. In a statement, CVS Caremark said Wednesday it remained “confident that our business practices and service offerings are being conducted in compliance with antitrust laws.” While CVS Caremark said that the vast majority of customers could easily find a nearby pharmacy other than Walgreen, Mr. Kaplan and other benefits consultants said the standoff could be disruptive. In certain companies, they say, as many as 20 to 30 percent of employees enrolled in plans administered by CVS Caremark are filling their prescriptions at Walgreen. For those corporations, “it is significant,” said David Dross, an executive for the consultant Mercer who advises companies on pharmacy benefits. This dispute, of course, could be brinksmanship of the sort that frequently occurs between health insurance plans and hospitals, in which consumers are threatened with the possibility of their hospital’s being dropped from an insurer’s network until the two parties finally reach an agreement on how much the hospital should be paid. In deciding to drop Walgreen before Walgreen could drop it, CVS Caremark said it was simply reacting to its rival’s attempt to extract higher payments for the drugs that CVS Caremark enrollees buy at its stores. “Walgreen’s announcement was nothing more than a transparent attempt to try to raise the pharmacy reimbursement rates it receives from CVS Caremark,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Besides battling over drugstore customers, Walgreen and CVS Caremark compete to a lesser extent in providing employee drug benefit plans, although CVS Caremark is a much bigger player in that field. The two companies “are effectively choosing to be direct competitors in administering plan benefits as well as prescription drugs,” said George Hill, an analyst with Leerink Swann. Because employers may resist limiting the choice of pharmacies for their workers, the dispute could benefit some competing drug plan managers like Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions, analysts said. In announcing Monday that it would no longer participate in CVS Caremark drug plans, Walgreen said that its rival was essentially using its prescription coverage business to steer patients to its own CVS drugstores, discriminating against competitors. Over time, “we went from being a valued provider within CVS Caremark’s network to, we believe, being more of a competitor to CVS drugstores within their network,” Gregory D. Wasson, the chief executive of Walgreen, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Certain CVS Caremark drug benefit plans have diverted long-standing customers away from Walgreen and the pharmacists with whom those customers have trusted relationships, Walgreen said. In particular, Walgreen cited Maintenance Choice, a CVS Caremark drug plan that requires people taking long-term medications to refill their prescriptions at a CVS pharmacy or through the company’s mail service — or to pay more, potentially full price, at a competing pharmacy. CVS Caremark said on Wednesday that those plans were meant to provide more choice for workers whose employers would otherwise restrict them to mail-order services for long-term prescriptions. The Walgreen complaints echo some of the concerns that smaller drugstores have raised about CVS Caremark, said B. Kemp Dolliver, a research analyst who follows the industry for Avondale Partners. Mr. Dolliver personally owns stock in two drug benefit competitors to CVS Caremark. The Federal Trade Commission is currently looking into some of the issues raised by the smaller pharmacies, he said, and the Walgreen dispute could draw even more attention to these potential concerns. Independent pharmacists argue CVS Caremark has limited consumers’ choices of where to refill their prescriptions. “When a patient does not have the right to choose the health care provider, in this case the pharmacy that they choose and trust, that’s not good,” said Joseph H. Harmison, the president of the National Community Pharmacists Association, a group representing nearly 23,000 independent community pharmacies and pharmacy chains. Some people who feel intimidated by physicians turn to their local pharmacists for medical advice about their prescriptions, he said. “The pharmacist is often the person a patient will wait to ask the questions to,” he said. Last May, his association filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that CVS Caremark had used its dominant position in the pharmaceutical service industry to eliminate consumer choice and drive consumers away from competing pharmacies. The F.T.C. confirmed Wednesday that it was investigating CVS Caremark, but Richard A. Feinstein, the director of the agency’s bureau of competition said the commission would not comment on the subject of the probe. Consultants and analysts say it is unclear whether the pharmacy benefit business will move toward a business model in which patients will no longer be able to fill their prescriptions at every drugstore but be forced to go to a select group of retailers.</text></article>

While similar tests have been sold over the Internet for more than two years, this would be the first such test sold through drugstores, making such testing more accessible. That appeared to catch the attention of the F.D.A. In a letter to Pathway that was written Monday but made public late Wednesday, the agency suggested that Pathway’s test needed regulatory approval before it could be sold. Walgreens then said in a statement that it would hold off selling the test “until we have further clarity on this matter.” The F.D.A. is also looking at the legality of similar direct-to-consumer genetic tests, an agency official said. Pathway’s test scans an individual’s DNA to provide information on the person’s risk of getting about two dozen diseases. It also looks at how a person might react to certain drugs and whether he or she carries mutations that could cause diseases in offspring. Pathway, a privately held company in San Diego, said it was “continuing discussions with the F.D.A. about the regulation of personal genomic information.” Such tests have long raised regulatory issues. One question is whether the tests are medical diagnostics or simply provide consumer information. The F.D.A. seems to be deciding that these are medical tests, in that they might influence the choice of a drug or perhaps cause a couple to terminate a pregnancy. Even if they are medical tests, there is a question of whether they need approval. The F.D.A. typically does not require approval of tests that are performed by a single laboratory, as opposed to a test kit that is sold to hospitals and doctors’ offices. Pathway considers its test such a laboratory-developed test. The F.D.A., in its letter, gives the company an opportunity to argue that its test does not need regulatory approval. Alberto Gutierrez, the director of the F.D.A.’s office of in vitro diagnostics, said in an interview Tuesday that the agency sent letters last fall to a number of companies selling genetic tests directly to consumers, asking them to explain their tests and their business models. He would not identify the companies or say whether any action had been taken. Navigenics, which sells a personal genomics test similar to that offered by Pathway, said it received an inquiry from the F.D.A. in May 2009 and met with the agency two months later. Navigenics said it believed it was in compliance with regulations. The company 23andMe, probably the best-known purveyor of such a test, declined to comment on whether it had been contacted by the agency. Dr. Gutierrez said the companies had different business models, making it difficult to clearly state which tests needed F.D.A. approval. But the saliva collection kit Pathway plans to sell through Walgreens seems to be a clearer case of one that does. “Once you take a collection device and you are marketing through a drugstore, it is very easy for me to say whether something would fall under our policy,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/health/11gene.html?ref=walgreencompany">Start-Up May Sell Genetic Tests Through Walgreens<date>Published: May 11, 2010</date><text>Genetic tests that assess a person’s risk of getting various diseases are heading to the corner drug store. Pathway Genomics, a start-up company, is expected to announce on Tuesday that it will sell such a test through most of the nation’s 7,500 Walgreens stores. The tests sold by Pathway, and others by its competitors, look at specific variations in a person’s DNA to derive information about their risk of getting diseases like diabetes, heart disease and various forms of cancer. Such tests have until now been sold directly to consumers through the Internet or through doctors’ offices. By capitalizing on the foot traffic in drug stores, Pathway hopes to gain an edge on rivals 23andMe and Navigenics, which are older and better known. “It’s more consumer awareness than we could get from advertising online,” said Jim Woodman, vice president for corporate strategy at Pathway, which is based in San Diego and is privately held. The personal genomics companies appear to have garnered fewer than 100,000 customers combined since starting nearly three years ago. Pathway, which started last summer, will not say how many customers it has. The tests, which generally cost $300 or more, have also stirred controversy. Some genetics experts say the tests cannot provide accurate or significant information because not enough is known yet about the genetic causes of disease. Some critics say doctors should be involved in interpreting the tests. New York State considers these medical tests, not consumer information, and requires a license. Pathway does not yet have one, so its test will not be carried by Walgreens in New York. Mr. Woodman of Pathway said he did not expect the move into drug stores to stir more criticism. What Walgreens will be selling, for a price expected to be $20 to $30, is Pathway’s saliva collection kit, packaged in a box that says “Discover Your DNA.” But the testing of the saliva will cost extra — from $79 to as much as $249, depending on how full a set of tests the consumer orders. Consumers would send their saliva sample, which contains their DNA, to the company’s lab. But they would still have to go to Pathway’s Web site to order the specific test they want and pay an additional fee. They would also receive the results via the Web. Even at $249 for the full test, in addition to the $20 to $30 for the kit, Pathway’s test through Walgreens will be cheaper than the $399 the company charges if the same test is ordered completely online, in which case Pathway sends the consumer a saliva kit that must be mailed back. Jim Cohn, a spokesman for Walgreens, said the chain decided to carry the test because “we recognize that genetic reports are for some becoming a more important component in managing one’s health care.” Drug stores already carry a variety of diagnostic tests, like those for pregnancy, cholesterol and blood sugar. When some of these tests were introduced, there was controversy about whether consumers could test themselves. Although broader in scope, Pathway’s test is not the first DNA-based analysis to be sold in drug stores. Sorenson Genomics began selling a paternity test through Rite Aid stores in late 2007. Sorenson has sold more than 100,000 tests through Rite Aid and other major pharmacy chains since then, according to Jacob Moon, a spokesman for the company.</text></article>

Sales in the period, which ended Feb. 28 and was the second quarter of Walgreen’s fiscal year, rose 3.1 percent, to $16.99 billion, from $16.48 billion. Walgreen has reduced the number of items sold at its stores to lower costs and to focus on its most profitable products. Prescription drug sales rose 3.2 percent as Walgreen sold more 90-day supplies, which were formerly offered only by mail. Pharmacy sales were lower because of fewer flu outbreaks than a year earlier, the company said. Shares of Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., rose 58 cents, to $35.91. Settlement in Advertising Case WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Walgreen Company agreed on Tuesday to pay nearly $6 million to settle deceptive advertising charges arising from its sale of dietary supplements the company said could help fight colds and flu. The Federal Trade Commission announced the settlement, which was related to Walgreen’s sales of Wal-Born. The F.T.C. said the company’s promotions that the supplements could prevent colds, fight germs and bolster the immune system were baseless.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/us/21cncwalgreen.html?ref=walgreencompany">Walgreen Drops Bid for City Contract After Employee Took Data<date>Published: March 20, 2010</date><text>A Walgreen Co. executive improperly took a competitor’s confidential financial data, forcing the drugstore giant to withdraw from the bidding for a lucrative contract to provide pharmacy services for the City of Chicago and most local government agencies, the Chicago News Cooperative has learned.Walgreen is out of the bidding for the contract, most likely worth hundreds of millions of dollars, after a company executive in January obtained bid materials from CVS Caremark as the two companies competed for the contract to manage the drug plans for employees at City Hall and other local government agencies, said a high-ranking City Hall official who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Walgreen executive is no longer with the company, and Walgreen promptly hired the law firm of a prominent former federal prosecutor, Patrick M. Collins, to conduct an internal investigation. In a statement sent to the Chicago News Cooperative, Walgreen officials on Friday characterized the incident as the action of a sole employee who did not have authorization from superiors. Public documents show that CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I., and acquired Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager, in 2007, has provided the service for at least the past six years for the city government, Cook County, Chicago’s school system and the Chicago Transit Authority. A spokeswoman for CVS Caremark declined comment on the incident involving the documents the company had created for its current bid. Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, was one of five companies that responded in November to a request for proposals to manage drug benefit programs, for at least three years, for employees of the City of Chicago, the county, the Chicago Board of Education, the City Colleges of Chicago, the transit agency and the agency’s retirees. While the ultimate dollar amount of the contract will not be determined until the bid process is finished, City Hall has paid Caremark more than $492 million since entering into a contract in 2004. The Chicago Public Schools cut checks to Caremark for almost $150 million in the last three years, and the transit authority’s Web site shows that Caremark’s work for the C.T.A. has been worth almost $100 million since 2007. The government agencies involved in the bidding employ tens of thousands of people, virtually all of whom are covered by a health plan with drug benefits. The documents provided to bidders request price quotes for filling 350,000 to three million prescriptions a month. The winning bidder will hold the contract for three years, with two one-year options. Walgreen’s withdrawal leaves four bidders: CVS Caremark, Medco Health Solutions, BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois and Sav-RX Prescription. An evaluation committee with representatives from each of the government agencies is expected to choose a winning bidder within a few months, said Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Public Schools, which is conducting the bid process. Walgreen is currently a minor player in the lucrative business of managing health benefits for government agencies and corporations, and so the withdrawal is a significant blow. The contract represented a chance for the company, founded in Chicago, to win a high-profile contract in a nationally competitive bid process. The company’s Walgreens Health Initiatives processes prescriptions and provides other services for more than 9.2 million people nationwide, and sends their business to more than 7,000 Walgreens pharmacies. CVS Caremark, in contrast, operates one of the largest pharmacy benefits management businesses in the United States, which serves an estimated 210 million Americans through a variety of health care plans. The CVS Caremark documents were taken as final bids were being prepared. CVS Caremark executives had mistakenly left the materials in a room where bidders took turns meeting with an evaluation panel, the City Hall official said. A Walgreen spokesman said the company responded “appropriately and responsibly,” quickly informing public officials in Chicago and executives at the other bidding companies. “In January 2010, the company discovered that an employee improperly obtained bid information during a pharmacy benefit management bidding process,” Michael Polzin, a Walgreen spokesman, said. “We immediately retained outside counsel to lead an internal investigation into the matter. “As a result of the internal investigation, we voluntarily withdrew our bid and notified the responsible city officials regarding the circumstances of our withdrawal.” The company’s investigation has been completed, Mr. Polzin said, and “the employee who took the information is no longer with the company.” He would not say whether the executive had been fired. Mr. Collins, who led the inquiry for Walgreen, declined comment. In hiring Mr. Collins to conduct the internal investigation, Walgreen engaged a high-profile former assistant United States attorney who played a significant role in obtaining public corruption convictions during his 12 years as a federal prosecutor in Chicago. Among the officials Mr. Collins helped send to jail were George H. Ryan, the former governor, and Robert A. Sorich, the longtime patronage chief for Mayor Richard M. Daley.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Mark Lennihan/Associated Press A Duane Reade store in New York City. Walgreen bought the 50-year-old chain for $1.1 billion. Related New Yorkers Ponder Sale of Duane Reade to Walgreen (February 18, 2010) Add to Portfolio Walgreen Co Credit Suisse Group Go to your Portfolio » Over the years, the chain that seemingly dots every corner of Manhattan has been in dire need of some strong medicine for what some thought was one of the sickest patients in the private equity world. Taken private by a small firm, Oak Hill Capital Partners, in 2004 for $750 million, the deal was described only two years later by BusinessWeek as “an L.B.O. on the critical list,” adding that a “three-year debt binge turned the drug chain from gem to junk.” Like a homeowner overstretched with a big mortgage on an underwater property, some bondholders whispered back then that the company might have to file for Chapter 11. Now, we have the latest chapter in the twists-and-turns story of a New York institution. Last week, Duane Reade agreed to be sold to its giant rival Walgreen for a whopping $1.1 billion, including debt  an earthshaking deal for Manhattan that even topped the local evening newscasts. After all, there are 253 of the stores in the city, and love ’em or hate ’em, everyone’s got an opinion (type Duane Reade and Facebook into Google, and the first two results are for an “I Hate Duane Reade” Facebook page, higher than Duane Reade’s own corporate Facebook page). But Duane Reade is as much a story about selling milk and toothpaste at 2 a.m. as it is about Wall Street, financial engineering and shifts in the private equity industry. Duane Reade was born in 1960 when a couple of brothers, the Cohens, started Duane Reade on Broadway between  you guessed it  Duane and Reade streets. In 1992, after building stores all around the city, the brothers looked to cash out, as many family-run businesses do. The brothers found a willing buyer in Bain Capital of Boston, which leveraged the business and took advantage of the favorable economic winds in 1997 and sold a majority stake to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (the investment bank that was later merged with Credit Suisse). Andrew Nathanson, a banker at D.L.J., then turned around and took Duane Reade public in 1998, just as the dot-com boom was in full swing and lifting everything under the sun, even mundane drugstores. For several years, Duane Reade continued to bumble along, expanding its footprint around New York City with its convenient yet famously cluttered stores. By 2004, the economy was just beginning to recover from the bubble’s bursting and Mr. Nathanson had left the sinking ship of D.L.J. once it was sold to Credit Suisse. Mr. Nathanson later found himself at Oak Hill, casting for acquisition targets. With debt at historically cheap prices, he went about rebuying Duane Reade, teaming up with the company’s chief executive, Anthony Cuti, taking the company private and loading it up with $500 million of debt. With private equity firms buying companies and flipping them within a year or two, Duane Reade looked like a sensible financial-engineering play. All the trend lines showed that as New Yorkers got older, Duane Reade would be in even greater demand. All they had to do was to keep the proverbial shopping cart from hitting the basket of ChapStick at the checkout line. And they blew it. By 2006, the business was hemorrhaging money and a series of scathing articles called Duane Reade a “zombie: dead, but walking among the living,” as BusinessWeek put it. It didn’t help that Mr. Cuti may have inflated the company’s income; he has since been indicted on charges of securities fraud. (Mr. Nathanson retired from Oak Hill that same year and died in a surfing accident last summer.) But here’s where the story takes a surprising, and positive, turn. While private equity firms often talk a good game claiming they are operators, and not financial engineers, Oak Hill proved that it actually could run a company. It installed a new management team led by John A. Lederer, the chief executive, that re-imagined the entire experience. Been to a Duane Reade in the last couple of months? Some of the refurbished stores are actually a delight to shop in; the sales lines are shorter and the stores refreshed. (Thank you in advance for all the e-mail messages from everyone who disagrees.) Indeed, it was these improvements that caught the eye of Walgreen’s management, many of whom had written off Duane Reade altogether. Usually rivals acquire each other to gain market share, but this deal appears to be as much about getting the knowledge that Duane Reade’s management has developed to help recreate that experience for Walgreen in other urban areas. That’s not to say that Walgreen wasn’t looking to gain market share and squeeze savings  it was  but it was also about taking advantage of its operational excellence. Walgreen first approached Duane Reade over the summer, but the talks went nowhere because Oak Hill was in the middle of refinancing its debt. But by December, Project Dakota, as it was known around Walgreen, was in full swing with the deal finally announced last week. Despite the $1.1 billion price tag for Duane Reade, the deal didn’t turn out to be a home run for Oak Hill, which is another theme of the changing landscape of private equity. Oak Hill made 1.5 times its money over six years, or about 11 percent on an annualized basis. On a relative basis to the market, that’s not a bad outcome. And considering what people were saying about Duane Reade four years ago, it is a great return. But compared with the returns of yore  firms making two, three, four times their money  this deal may actually represent the new normal. Nothing fancy, just the basics. Kind of like Duane Reade itself. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 26, 2010 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about the sale of the Duane Reade drugstore chain, misstated the location of the first store. It was on Broadway between Duane and Reade Streets  not “on the corner” of Duane and Reade, which run parallel. The column also gave an incomplete name for the private equity firm that took the chain private in 2004 and misidentified the location of that firm. It is Oak Hill Capital Partners, not Oak Hill Partners, and it is based in New York, not Chicago.

Taken private by a small firm, Oak Hill Capital Partners, in 2004 for $750 million, the deal was described only two years later by BusinessWeek as “an L.B.O. on the critical list,” adding that a “three-year debt binge turned the drug chain from gem to junk.” Like a homeowner overstretched with a big mortgage on an underwater property, some bondholders whispered back then that the company might have to file for Chapter 11. Now, we have the latest chapter in the twists-and-turns story of a New York institution. Last week, Duane Reade agreed to be sold to its giant rival Walgreen for a whopping $1.1 billion, including debt  an earthshaking deal for Manhattan that even topped the local evening newscasts. After all, there are 253 of the stores in the city, and love ’em or hate ’em, everyone’s got an opinion (type Duane Reade and Facebook into Google, and the first two results are for an “I Hate Duane Reade” Facebook page, higher than Duane Reade’s own corporate Facebook page). But Duane Reade is as much a story about selling milk and toothpaste at 2 a.m. as it is about Wall Street, financial engineering and shifts in the private equity industry. Duane Reade was born in 1960 when a couple of brothers, the Cohens, started Duane Reade on Broadway between  you guessed it  Duane and Reade streets. In 1992, after building stores all around the city, the brothers looked to cash out, as many family-run businesses do. The brothers found a willing buyer in Bain Capital of Boston, which leveraged the business and took advantage of the favorable economic winds in 1997 and sold a majority stake to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (the investment bank that was later merged with Credit Suisse). Andrew Nathanson, a banker at D.L.J., then turned around and took Duane Reade public in 1998, just as the dot-com boom was in full swing and lifting everything under the sun, even mundane drugstores. For several years, Duane Reade continued to bumble along, expanding its footprint around New York City with its convenient yet famously cluttered stores. By 2004, the economy was just beginning to recover from the bubble’s bursting and Mr. Nathanson had left the sinking ship of D.L.J. once it was sold to Credit Suisse. Mr. Nathanson later found himself at Oak Hill, casting for acquisition targets. With debt at historically cheap prices, he went about rebuying Duane Reade, teaming up with the company’s chief executive, Anthony Cuti, taking the company private and loading it up with $500 million of debt. With private equity firms buying companies and flipping them within a year or two, Duane Reade looked like a sensible financial-engineering play. All the trend lines showed that as New Yorkers got older, Duane Reade would be in even greater demand. All they had to do was to keep the proverbial shopping cart from hitting the basket of ChapStick at the checkout line. And they blew it. By 2006, the business was hemorrhaging money and a series of scathing articles called Duane Reade a “zombie: dead, but walking among the living,” as BusinessWeek put it. It didn’t help that Mr. Cuti may have inflated the company’s income; he has since been indicted on charges of securities fraud. (Mr. Nathanson retired from Oak Hill that same year and died in a surfing accident last summer.) But here’s where the story takes a surprising, and positive, turn. While private equity firms often talk a good game claiming they are operators, and not financial engineers, Oak Hill proved that it actually could run a company. It installed a new management team led by John A. Lederer, the chief executive, that re-imagined the entire experience. Been to a Duane Reade in the last couple of months? Some of the refurbished stores are actually a delight to shop in; the sales lines are shorter and the stores refreshed. (Thank you in advance for all the e-mail messages from everyone who disagrees.) Indeed, it was these improvements that caught the eye of Walgreen’s management, many of whom had written off Duane Reade altogether. Usually rivals acquire each other to gain market share, but this deal appears to be as much about getting the knowledge that Duane Reade’s management has developed to help recreate that experience for Walgreen in other urban areas. That’s not to say that Walgreen wasn’t looking to gain market share and squeeze savings  it was  but it was also about taking advantage of its operational excellence. Walgreen first approached Duane Reade over the summer, but the talks went nowhere because Oak Hill was in the middle of refinancing its debt. But by December, Project Dakota, as it was known around Walgreen, was in full swing with the deal finally announced last week. Despite the $1.1 billion price tag for Duane Reade, the deal didn’t turn out to be a home run for Oak Hill, which is another theme of the changing landscape of private equity. Oak Hill made 1.5 times its money over six years, or about 11 percent on an annualized basis. On a relative basis to the market, that’s not a bad outcome. And considering what people were saying about Duane Reade four years ago, it is a great return. But compared with the returns of yore  firms making two, three, four times their money  this deal may actually represent the new normal. Nothing fancy, just the basics. Kind of like Duane Reade itself. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 26, 2010 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about the sale of the Duane Reade drugstore chain, misstated the location of the first store. It was on Broadway between Duane and Reade Streets  not “on the corner” of Duane and Reade, which run parallel. The column also gave an incomplete name for the private equity firm that took the chain private in 2004 and misidentified the location of that firm. It is Oak Hill Capital Partners, not Oak Hill Partners, and it is based in New York, not Chicago.</text></article>

Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., already owns 7,162 stores nationwide and reported $63 billion in sales for its fiscal year 2009. The chain, however, has a relatively small presence in the city. “This accelerates our opportunity to gain a leading presence in the largest drugstore market in the country,” Gregory D. Wasson, Walgreen’s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts, adding that his company had studied a bid for several months. “That would take us a long time to continue to do organically,” Mr. Wasson said. Walgreen plans to operate Duane Reade stores under their own name and keep its current senior management, though it will study ways to meld the two brands. Walgreen has 70 stores in the New York area. The deal will bring yet another new owner for Duane Reade, which has grown from a warehouse located between the two Lower Manhattan streets that account for its name into a 257-store New York empire. Duane Reade’s founding family sold the retailer to Bain Capital in 1992, which took the company public six years later. Oak Hill Capital Partners, the private equity firm, bought the retailer in 2004 for about $700 million and remained its owner until now. (An Oak Hill spokesman said in a statement on Wednesday that Duane Reade had generated a “solid return” for the firm’s investors.) Despite its broad presence in New York, Duane Reade has struggled with two problems. A big debt load has weighed on the company’s finances. And New Yorkers have often regarded the stores as dark, cluttered places where cleaning products sometimes sit next to cookies. Narrow aisles sometimes make for uncomfortable shopping experiences as customers jostle into one another in a deliberate design meant to stuff as many products into stores as possible. In addition, customers often complained that Duane Reade’s prices were higher than at competitors. Under its current chief executive, John A. Lederer, Duane Reade sought to repair its problems. The retailer refinanced its debt last summer and has reported improved finances: the company posted about $1.8 billion in sales for 2009, and Mr. Lederer said in an interview that it has had consistent earnings growth quarter over quarter. Duane Reade also sought to completely revamp its image, replacing its simple blue-and-red logo with a sleeker look and remodeling stores to resemble airier suburban ones. The aisles were widened, the lighting improved and new sections like the Look Boutique, a collection of cosmetics and skincare products, were added. Some stores also now have doctors on site. Duane Reade has reported that sales have improved at the newly revamped stores, including one by Penn Station and one on Water Street in Lower Manhattan, often by double digits. “New Yorkers are always in a hurry,” Mr. Lederer said. “It’s clear they wanted cleaner stores.” He added that the sale would benefit the two companies in other ways. Walgreen would gain access to Duane Reade’s new portfolio of private-label brands, while his company would be able to tap into Walgreen’s extensive pharmacy services to bolster its own weaker business. Walgreen said it would assume Duane Reade's $457 million in debt and intended to invest about $60 million in its new acquisition over the next few years to would continue the improvement efforts. Walgreen said that it expected the deal to impair its earnings in the first year after completion, which is expected by August. However, the company said it expected to have increased earnings afterward. It expects to reap more than $120 million in cost savings beginning in the third year after the deal’s completion. Shares in Walgreen rose 11 cents on Wednesday to $34.19. Walgreen was advised on the deal by the Peter J. Solomon Company and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.

Complicated, unavoidable, convenient, annoying — whatever that relationship was, even Duane Reade seemed to understand how deeply it had worked its way into the municipal psyche.On Wednesday, Duane Reade added another layer to its relationship. The chain with the city-centric slogan — “Your city. Your drugstore.” — sold itself to another chain that also started with a single store. A chain from somewhere else. A chain even larger than Duane Reade. Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was buying Duane Reade, which, at last count, had 150 stores in Manhattan. Only the Starbucks and Subway chains had more stores in Manhattan. Citywide, Duane Reade has 229 stores, about three and a half times as many as Walgreen. But Walgreen has 7,162 stores nationwide. The deal left eyeliner and toothpaste buyers wondering what it would mean in places where Duane Reade and Walgreen’s drugstores stare at each other across the street. On East 86th Street near Lexington Avenue, a Duane Reade is on the odd-numbered side, opposite a Walgreen’s. In Times Square, Duane Reade occupies the storefront at 1470 Broadway; Walgreen’s is across the street, at 1471. But the transaction also left customers thinking about their emotional connection to places as mundane as drugstores. For some, the connection is not all that pleasant: The blog I Hate Duane Reade carried a photograph of a flaming bus, doctored to show a Duane Reade trademark on the side. Some customers said Duane Reade took the real estate maxim of location, location, location to new levels, squeezing in stores left and right. If there is not one across from the office building where you work, there is one steps from your apartment. “I appreciate convenience, I appreciate availability, knowing if I run out of milk I can be there and back in less than 10 minutes,” said Victoria Voketaitis, a booking representative with a company that arranges tours for Broadway and Off Broadway shows. “But when I start to see what used to be a neighborhood look like a shopping mall, chain after chain after chain, it’s hard not to feel it’s losing the particular neighborhoody warm feel.” Some say all Duane Reade stores are alike. But Norma Peña, a mail clerk who lives in the Bronx, disagrees. Ms. Peña said she shopped at the Duane Reade at Broadway and West 40th Street because it had more merchandise. “I come all the way down here,” she said while buying cough medicine for her 15-year-old daughter. To some customers, the rise of drugstore chains meant the demise of small, owner-operated pharmacies that were probably more expensive, but offered service the chains did not. Other customers said chains like Duane Reade had come to serve a different function. “Duane Reade has replaced the five-and-dimes that sold everything from clothing to pantyhose and cosmetics,” said Irene Wlodarski, the national coordinator for concert and artists department at the piano maker Steinway &amp; Sons. “You could find a five-and-dime on every block. Now look at Duane Reade. They’re selling stationery, DVDs, books.” Duane Reade has recently given itself a makeover. Under Robert Bass’s private equity firm, Oak Hill Capital Partners, which bought Duane Reade in 2004, the drugstore chain has spent the last few months redesigning and remodeling stores. The changes include widening the aisles, seeing that the shelves are not stacked to the ceiling and installing under-the-shelf lighting that does for makeup what makeup is supposed to do for the customer. By coincidence, a new Duane Reade opened at Eighth Avenue near West 16th Street on Wednesday, just after the Walgreen deal was announced. It impressed Angela Amato, who works at a law firm nearby. “It’s really fresh,” Ms. Amato said, adding that it looked more like a supermarket than a drugstore. “Some of these stores are old and dinky.”</text></article>

But in fact, prescriptions, and all the information on them  including not only the name and dosage of the drug and the name and address of the doctor, but also the patient’s address and Social Security number  are a commodity bought and sold in a murky marketplace, often without the patients’ knowledge or permission. That may change if some little-noted protections from the Obama administration are strictly enforced. The federal stimulus law enacted in February prohibits in most cases the sale of personal health information, with a few exceptions for research and public health measures like tracking flu epidemics. It also tightens rules for telling patients when hackers or health care workers have stolen their Social Security numbers or medical information, as happened to Britney Spears, Maria Shriver and Farrah Fawcett before she died in June. “The new rules will plug some gaping holes in our federal health privacy laws,” said Deven McGraw, a health privacy expert at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. “For the first time, pharmacy benefit managers that handle most prescriptions and banks and contractors that process millions of medical claims will be held accountable for complying with federal privacy and security rules.” The law won’t shut down the medical data mining industry, but there will be more restrictions on using private information without patients’ consent and penalties for civil violations will be increased. Government agencies are still writing new regulations called for in the law. Ms. Krinsk was never able to find out who sold her information, but companies that have been accused in lawsuits of buying and selling personal medical data include drugstore chains like Walgreens and data-mining companies like IMS Health and Verispan. CVS Caremark, which handles prescriptions for corporate clients, has also been accused of violating patients’ privacy. These companies all say that names of patients are removed or encrypted before data is sold, typically to drug manufacturers. But as Ms. Krinsk’s case shows, there are leaks in the system. Before the changes, privacy regulations mainly applied to hospitals and doctors. Enforcement was weak, and there were lots of loopholes. Privacy experts cite research by Latanya Sweeney, director of the Data Privacy Lab at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which shows that a computer-savvy snooper can easily match names, addresses, Social Security numbers and so on to “re-identify” information that had supposedly been rendered anonymous. “Our biggest concern is the complete lack of protection against re-identifying data that was supposed to be anonymous and secure,” Ms. McGraw said. TRACKING prescriptions has been a big business for decades. Data miners say their research is valuable because gathering and analyzing information from thousands of people helps identify trends and provides indications of potentially dangerous side effects of drugs. “Data stripped of patient identity is an important alternative in health research and managing quality of care,” said Randy Frankel, an IMS vice president. As for the ability to put the names back on anonymous data, he said IMS has “multiple encryptions and various ways of separating information to prevent a patient from being re-identified.” “De-identified health information is our core business,” he said. IMS Health reported operating revenue of $1.05 billion in the first half of 2009, down 10.6 percent from the period a year earlier. Mr. Frankel said he did not expect growing awareness of privacy issues to affect the business. CVS Caremark says it is careful about patient data. “In very limited circumstances, we exchange aggregated, de-identified data with third parties to assist the health care community in understanding patient use of prescription medications with the goal of achieving better health outcomes,” said Carolyn Castel, a company spokeswoman. Selling data to drug manufacturers is still allowed, if patients’ names are removed. But the stimulus law tightens one of the biggest loopholes in the old privacy rules. Pharmacy companies like Walgreens have been able to accept payments from drug makers to mail advice and reminders to customers to take their medications, without obtaining permission. Under the new law, the subsidized marketing is still permitted but it can no longer promote drugs other than those the customer already buys. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 16, 2009 An article last Sunday about the use of consumers’ health information referred incorrectly to Dr. Deborah Peel, a psychiatrist in Austin, Tex.

Ms. Krinsk was never able to find out who sold her information, but companies that have been accused in lawsuits of buying and selling personal medical data include drugstore chains like Walgreens and data-mining companies like IMS Health and Verispan. CVS Caremark, which handles prescriptions for corporate clients, has also been accused of violating patients’ privacy. These companies all say that names of patients are removed or encrypted before data is sold, typically to drug manufacturers. But as Ms. Krinsk’s case shows, there are leaks in the system. Before the changes, privacy regulations mainly applied to hospitals and doctors. Enforcement was weak, and there were lots of loopholes. Privacy experts cite research by Latanya Sweeney, director of the Data Privacy Lab at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which shows that a computer-savvy snooper can easily match names, addresses, Social Security numbers and so on to “re-identify” information that had supposedly been rendered anonymous. “Our biggest concern is the complete lack of protection against re-identifying data that was supposed to be anonymous and secure,” Ms. McGraw said. TRACKING prescriptions has been a big business for decades. Data miners say their research is valuable because gathering and analyzing information from thousands of people helps identify trends and provides indications of potentially dangerous side effects of drugs. “Data stripped of patient identity is an important alternative in health research and managing quality of care,” said Randy Frankel, an IMS vice president. As for the ability to put the names back on anonymous data, he said IMS has “multiple encryptions and various ways of separating information to prevent a patient from being re-identified.” “De-identified health information is our core business,” he said. IMS Health reported operating revenue of $1.05 billion in the first half of 2009, down 10.6 percent from the period a year earlier. Mr. Frankel said he did not expect growing awareness of privacy issues to affect the business. CVS Caremark says it is careful about patient data. “In very limited circumstances, we exchange aggregated, de-identified data with third parties to assist the health care community in understanding patient use of prescription medications with the goal of achieving better health outcomes,” said Carolyn Castel, a company spokeswoman. Selling data to drug manufacturers is still allowed, if patients’ names are removed. But the stimulus law tightens one of the biggest loopholes in the old privacy rules. Pharmacy companies like Walgreens have been able to accept payments from drug makers to mail advice and reminders to customers to take their medications, without obtaining permission. Under the new law, the subsidized marketing is still permitted but it can no longer promote drugs other than those the customer already buys. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 16, 2009 An article last Sunday about the use of consumers’ health information referred incorrectly to Dr. Deborah Peel, a psychiatrist in Austin, Tex.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Walgreen Co Go to your Portfolio » Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., aims to cut its annual expenses by $1 billion starting in 2011, an initiative that is adding to its costs this year. In the quarter ended May 31, it earned $522 million, or 53 cents a share, down from $572 million, or 58 cents a share. Analysts were expecting 56 cents a share, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 8 percent, to $16.21 billion, from $15.02 billion. Analysts forecast $16.16 billion in revenue, on average. Gross margins declined 0.8 percentage points to 27.5 percent. The company’s selling, general and administrative expenses rose 8 percent in the quarter, which included one percentage point from its savings plan, called “Rewiring for Growth.” Walgreen said the plan was on track for $1 billion in annual savings beginning in 2011. It hopes to save $500 million in 2010. As part of that plan, Walgreen said in January it would eliminate 1,000 jobs, mostly in management. Walgreen says cost-cutting and sales initiatives cost it 6 cents a share, but resulted in savings of 6 cents a share. Pharmacy sales improved, but sales of nonpharmacy items were hit by the recession. Walgreen said that sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 2.8 percent. That includes growth of 3.8 percent in the pharmacies, where Walgreen makes about two-thirds of its sales, and a decrease of 0.9 percent at the front end of the stores. The company is testing a program called “Consumer Centric Retailing” that is meant to improve its front-end results. The program is being tried at 35 stores, and Walgreen said those stores were doing better than expected. Walgreen has announced it will open fewer new stores in the coming years. It opened 45 stores in the second quarter, down from 122 a year ago. In total during the quarter, Walgreen opened or bought 162 stores, which gave it a total of 6,857. It also has about 500 health and wellness centers, along with specialty, institutional and mail-order pharmacies. On Monday, Walgreen’s shares fell $1.79, or 5.7 percent, to close at $29.64.

This one is different. Skip to next paragraph Brendan McDermid/Reuters Gregory D. Wasson Related Times Topics: Walgreen Company Add to Portfolio Walgreen Co Go to your Portfolio » There has been widespread consolidation of chains and more recently, a slowdown in prescription sales. Gregory D. Wasson, the president and chief operations officer of the Walgreen Company, recently discussed the changes in his industry and new initiatives he hopes mean continued profitability. Q. How is the slowdown affecting purchases of prescription drugs and health and beauty aids? A. We certainly are seeing a slowdown in prescription drugs. In this economy, patients are not seeing their doctors as frequently. There may be some cases they are skipping doses of medications to control costs. As far as over-the-counter items, we see consumers definitely looking for value. We’re also seeing a big increase in private label product. The consumer is willing to buy down. Q. What is driving the widespread consolidation in the industry? And now that credit is tighter, what do you think will happen to the trend? A. A lot of it is probably prescription reimbursement tightening over the years. Everybody is looking to control costs, from the government to managed care organizations to employers. I think a lot of the independent drugstores, as well as some of the smaller regional chains, have found this climate tough. I think it’s mainly margin driven. Q. What differentiates drugstores from drug departments in supermarkets and large stores? A. There are a lot of grocers and mass merchants that have pharmacy departments. In many cases, it’s a way to draw shoppers. It’s our franchise. We want to be the most convenient provider of consumer goods, pharmacy and health and wellness services in the country. Q. Who do you regard as your main competition and why? A. Today it’s anybody that fills a prescription, and that can be retail, it can be mail order or Internet pharmacies. Q. How has the downturn affected your expansion plans? A. We are slowing store growth from a 9 percent square footage growth in fiscal 2008 to 5 percent in 2011. It allows us to put about a half-billion dollars of capital expenditures back into the stores or other strategic opportunities. Q. Several years ago, senior citizens were arranging tours to Canada to buy drugs. With the recession, can we expect to see a resurgence of that phenomenon and might it spread to other segments of the population? A. Since then, we’ve had a Medicare part D benefit rolled out to seniors. In most cases, the seniors that have a part D benefit will have generic co-pays of $5 and many plans have free generic benefit design. We recently released a prescription savings club card targeted for the uninsured and underinsured with complete discounts on over 5,000 prescriptions with 400 generics at $1 a week. We have well over a million members on our card. Q. Your company is introducing a pharmacy system in Florida that you say will remove much of the routine of filling a prescription. How does it work? A. This approach to filling prescriptions transfers the data entry, insurance adjudication, follow-up with doctors’ offices and other administrative work out to a central processing facility. It also moves the actual filling of prescription refills to the central facility. The patient will still drop off and pick up their prescriptions at the retail pharmacy. It lowers the cost of filling prescriptions to keep us competitive with other retail and mail pharmacy providers. Q. Your company has created more than 600 in-store clinics and work site health centers. What’s the importance of the centers? On a work site, what steps have you taken to protect worker privacy? A. There are millions of Americans going to emergency rooms for care for common ailments we’re able to treat in our clinics. We feel there’s a huge cost reduction available to treat those types of conditions. We feel there’s opportunity to be a big part of this nation’s health care solution by providing nurse practitioners in our retail stores. Employers across the country are looking for ways to lower their health care costs and deliver better employee benefits. This is a way for an employer to do both. The employer has absolutely no access to the patient records that we care for on their campus. We’re looking to have 800 retail and employer retail clinics open by the end of calendar year 2009. Q. You have made a decision to enter the area of specialty pharmaceuticals. Why did you decide to pursue this strategy? How will this change the configuration of the pharmacy counter? A. Complex high-cost drug therapy, such as injectables and infusions, are close to a $70 billion sector. It’s where pharmacy is going, and we want to make sure we participate and make pharmacy services available for our patients. I don’t think you’ll see an actual change in the drugstore. If a patient comes into a pharmacy and has a prescription for an injectable or infused product, we’ll be able to take that prescription, scan it in and send the injectable to the patient’s home or a drugstore or refer them to one of our home infusion facilities for therapy. Q. What is hiring like for pharmacists in a period of escalating unemployment? A. There’s been a shortage of pharmacists for probably about the last decade; not as harsh today as it was probably a few years ago. We’ve put a lot of investment into benefits and store conditions and technology. We haven’t seen anything significant as far as that changing due to the economy.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Walgreen Co Go to your Portfolio » The company said it planned to slow store opening to save $500 million in response to the recession. Walgreen said it earned $408 million, or 41 cents a share, in the three months ended Nov. 30. That fell short of analyst expectations, and compares with $456 million, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue grew 7 percent, to $14.95 billion. Analysts expected 46 cents a share and $15.08 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Walgreen said its selling and general expenses grew 9 percent in the quarter as it opened 212 stores, and profit margins dipped because of greater expense provisions. Sales at its older stores grew 1.7 percent, with prescription revenue in older stores growing 2.6 percent. Front-end revenue, or sales of nonprescription products, was flat compared with last year, showing some resilience in a down economy. The company said prescriptions filled grew 3.7 percent in the quarter, while industry data has showed falling prescriptions for its rivals. In total, 66 percent of Walgreen’s revenue came from prescription sales. At stores open at least one year, prescriptions filled were roughly flat with last year. More customers filled 90-day prescriptions instead of 30-day orders, however, leading to adjusted growth of 1.5 percent. Walgreen said membership in its Prescription Savings Club grew more than 40 percent from the fourth quarter, and more than 30 percent of club members are new customers. The savings club, introduced in late 2007, allows members to buy a 90-day supply of many common generic drugs for $12. In the 2010 fiscal year, Walgreen said it would slow its organic store openings to a rate of 4.5 to 5 percent, with growth of 2.5 to 3 percent in fiscal 2011. In July the company said it would slow the pace of store openings to 5 percent in 2011, from 8 percent. The reductions are expected to save the company a $1 billion in annual spending. The president and chief operating officer, Gregory D. Wasson, said the cuts were a response to the recession. Walgreen operates 6,630 drugstores in 49 states. It plans to increase its store count by 475 in fiscal 2009, which ends in August.

On a familiar building in Times Square, the messages are becoming a medium. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Richard Perry/The New York Times Signs on the Walgreens store opening on Thursday at 1 Times Square. Some of the buildings signs will be as tall as 17 stories and advertise not only the drugstore but what it sells inside. Add to Portfolio Walgreen Co Go to your Portfolio » As the Walgreen Company  the largest American drugstore chain in sales  formally opens at 1 Times Square on Thursday, executives are describing plans for the giant signs that will festoon the building on three sides. The signs include some diagonal displays resembling wings as tall as 17 stories. It will also serve as an advertising network of sorts as Walgreen and its sales representative, a unit of ABC, peddle commercial time to other marketers. The new one-building network  WALG, if you will  is to display ads each day for 20 hours, ceasing their pitches from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. In addition to ads and other promotions for Walgreen, there will be messages from advertisers that produce the kinds of health and beauty items, food products and other merchandise sold in the drugstore.  Four advertisers have signed multiyear, multimillion-dollar deals to be charter sponsors of the signs: Colgate-Palmolive, Kraft Foods, Johnson &amp; Johnson and L’Oréal. Ads for Colgate Total toothpaste and several L’Oréal makeup products were visible on Wednesday morning as the signs were being tested. In selling ad space on its signs to companies, Walgreen joins a list of Times Square denizens that includes Thomson Reuters and ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, whose ABC New Media Services unit is handling ad sales for Walgreen. The Walgreen signs are indicative of the growing presence in the lives of consumers of new types of advertising outside the home. Media types count the influences on consumers by screens: the TV set is the first screen, the PC is the second and the cellphone or other mobile device the third. By that token, a big digital sign chockablock with light-emitting diodes, affixed to a building, bus shelter, mall kiosk, supermarket checkout or gasoline pump, is becoming the fourth screen. “It’s about saying ‘We’re here,’ ” said Kim L. Feil, who was recently named the first chief marketing officer at Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill. The store at 1 Times Square, occupying 16,200 square feet on three levels, replaces one that Walgreen operated at the site from the 1920s until 1970. The ad revenue that ABC New Media Services is to collect for Walgreen from other marketers will help defray the costs of the store. Walgreen is paying more than $4 million a year to lease the building from Sherwood Equities, which is a minority owner in and the manager of 1 Times Square. Plans for the store  the 11th in Manhattan for Walgreen and the 53rd in New York City  began well before the financial crisis that is slowing sales for just about every retailer in the United States not named Wal-Mart. “We wouldn’t be doing it if we didn’t think it was a business-wise proposition and a marketing-wise proposition,” said Ms. Feil, who is also a vice president of Walgreen, which she joined in September from the Sara Lee Company. “It isn’t inexpensive,” she added, declining to discuss specific figures, but it is about opening “a flagship store” in “one of the busiest neighborhoods in America.” The store and its gaudy signs, which have 12 million LEDs, are meant to raise the profile of Walgreen, a company that for decades has preferred to operate without public attention. “Walgreen wants to put its flag back into the ground” at Broadway and 42nd Street, said Arthur Gilmore, president and chief executive at the Gilmore Group in New York, a design and branding agency that devised the signs. The GG Media unit of Gilmore will produce the ads, promotions, video clips and other sign content being sponsored by Walgreen. “We’re talking to Wall Street, to shareholders, to customers, that Walgreen is up to something,” Mr. Gilmore said, “and moving the company ahead from a brand standpoint.” That is why the Walgreen presence on the building is so dominant, he added, joking that when “you turn that corner” on the way to 1 Times Square, “you’re going to get a suntan” from the signs’ light. Ms. Feil agreed with that approach. “You go to Times Square to be overwhelmed,” she said. As for the increasing difficulty in standing out in the neighborhood as more signs go up on more buildings, her philosophy is that more is, well, more. “If we’re going to go in,” Ms. Feil said, “we might as well go big.” A New Jersey company, D3 LED, is building the signs for Walgreen.  Other new signs in Times Square  long known as spectaculars, for their larger-than-life elements  include a billboard for the Ricoh Americas Corporation at 3 Times Square, designed to be ecologically friendly, and a redesigned LED sign for JVC at 1501 Broadway, to be introduced on Dec. 2. The Walgreen signs, which include 13 60-inch plasma screens facing 42nd Street, 7th Avenue and Broadway, will not only burnish the images of the brands advertised on them, said Teresa Rix, vice president for ABC New Media Sales, but “pull people off the street to purchase products as they walk by.” Walgreen will also “be involved in the ‘Good Morning America’ concert series in 2009,” Ms. Rix said. Her division sells the ad space on the giant sign that ABC operates above that show’s studio as well as commercials on TaxiTV in New York City taxi cabs and spots on plasma screens in college bookstores as part of the Digital College Network. Ads on the Walgreen signs and other Times Square signs are typically sold by the minute, at rates that range from $50 to $75, and scheduled in blocks like two minutes an hour for eight hours a day for eight weeks. The sums can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for major ad buys. The Walgreen signs are above and below the famous news ticker on 1 Times Square, known as the zipper, which was previously sponsored by The New York Times and New York Newsday and is now sponsored by the Dow Jones &amp; Company division of the News Corporation. Executives of Walgreen, Gilmore and D3 LED plan to attend a news conference at the store on Thursday morning; the signs are to be officially lighted at 8 p.m. More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 20, 2008, on page B9 of the New York edition.THE medium, Marshall McLuhan once said, is the message.

Media types count the influences on consumers by screens: the TV set is the first screen, the PC is the second and the cellphone or other mobile device the third. By that token, a big digital sign chockablock with light-emitting diodes, affixed to a building, bus shelter, mall kiosk, supermarket checkout or gasoline pump, is becoming the fourth screen. “It’s about saying ‘We’re here,’ ” said Kim L. Feil, who was recently named the first chief marketing officer at Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill. The store at 1 Times Square, occupying 16,200 square feet on three levels, replaces one that Walgreen operated at the site from the 1920s until 1970. The ad revenue that ABC New Media Services is to collect for Walgreen from other marketers will help defray the costs of the store. Walgreen is paying more than $4 million a year to lease the building from Sherwood Equities, which is a minority owner in and the manager of 1 Times Square. Plans for the store  the 11th in Manhattan for Walgreen and the 53rd in New York City  began well before the financial crisis that is slowing sales for just about every retailer in the United States not named Wal-Mart. “We wouldn’t be doing it if we didn’t think it was a business-wise proposition and a marketing-wise proposition,” said Ms. Feil, who is also a vice president of Walgreen, which she joined in September from the Sara Lee Company. “It isn’t inexpensive,” she added, declining to discuss specific figures, but it is about opening “a flagship store” in “one of the busiest neighborhoods in America.” The store and its gaudy signs, which have 12 million LEDs, are meant to raise the profile of Walgreen, a company that for decades has preferred to operate without public attention. “Walgreen wants to put its flag back into the ground” at Broadway and 42nd Street, said Arthur Gilmore, president and chief executive at the Gilmore Group in New York, a design and branding agency that devised the signs. The GG Media unit of Gilmore will produce the ads, promotions, video clips and other sign content being sponsored by Walgreen. “We’re talking to Wall Street, to shareholders, to customers, that Walgreen is up to something,” Mr. Gilmore said, “and moving the company ahead from a brand standpoint.” That is why the Walgreen presence on the building is so dominant, he added, joking that when “you turn that corner” on the way to 1 Times Square, “you’re going to get a suntan” from the signs’ light. Ms. Feil agreed with that approach. “You go to Times Square to be overwhelmed,” she said. As for the increasing difficulty in standing out in the neighborhood as more signs go up on more buildings, her philosophy is that more is, well, more. “If we’re going to go in,” Ms. Feil said, “we might as well go big.” A New Jersey company, D3 LED, is building the signs for Walgreen.  Other new signs in Times Square  long known as spectaculars, for their larger-than-life elements  include a billboard for the Ricoh Americas Corporation at 3 Times Square, designed to be ecologically friendly, and a redesigned LED sign for JVC at 1501 Broadway, to be introduced on Dec. 2. The Walgreen signs, which include 13 60-inch plasma screens facing 42nd Street, 7th Avenue and Broadway, will not only burnish the images of the brands advertised on them, said Teresa Rix, vice president for ABC New Media Sales, but “pull people off the street to purchase products as they walk by.” Walgreen will also “be involved in the ‘Good Morning America’ concert series in 2009,” Ms. Rix said. Her division sells the ad space on the giant sign that ABC operates above that show’s studio as well as commercials on TaxiTV in New York City taxi cabs and spots on plasma screens in college bookstores as part of the Digital College Network. Ads on the Walgreen signs and other Times Square signs are typically sold by the minute, at rates that range from $50 to $75, and scheduled in blocks like two minutes an hour for eight hours a day for eight weeks. The sums can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for major ad buys. The Walgreen signs are above and below the famous news ticker on 1 Times Square, known as the zipper, which was previously sponsored by The New York Times and New York Newsday and is now sponsored by the Dow Jones &amp; Company division of the News Corporation. Executives of Walgreen, Gilmore and D3 LED plan to attend a news conference at the store on Thursday morning; the signs are to be officially lighted at 8 p.m.</text></article>

So when word spread that a farmers’ market would open on Oct. 4 in the parking lot of the shuttered Key Food, much rejoicing ensued. The joy may prove short-lived. Three days before the market opened, an article in The Brooklyn Paper said that come January, the farmers and beekeepers would have to clear out or shut down to make way for a Walgreens drugstore. Michael Hurwitz, director of the city’s Greenmarket program, is hoping to persuade Walgreens to let the farmers stick around. At the same time, a number of local residents have rallied to save the market. David Marangio, a real estate agent, offered to help the farmers find a new location in the neighborhood. He has scouted a property on Shore Road, near the Belt Parkway. “Wherever it is,” he said, “it will be the destination.” Mr. Marangio, a native of neighboring Dyker Heights, moved to Bay Ridge three years ago after a sojourn in the Hudson Valley. Upon arriving, he was disappointed to find that many of the talismans of his Brooklyn childhood  the pork store, the pasta store  had been replaced by supermarkets and one-stop groceries. Like many of his friends, Mr. Marangio often found himself trooping off to the farmers’ market in Union Square. As the search for a permanent site continued, local residents were relishing what it would be like to have a Greenmarket permanently. On a recent Saturday, Mr. Marangio showed up just before 8 a.m. and bought a rib-eye steak and a bunch of beets. He went home, prepared lunch, and returned a few hours later for buckwheat honey, heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, a whole-grain baguette and a minty Peruvian herb called wakatay. Later, as the last vendors to call it a day stowed away their tables, Mr. Marangio dropped by the market for a third visit. He and his neighbors are trying to form a Bay Ridge food co-op, and some of his associates had been distributing surveys to gauge interest in the project. After picking up a stack of surveys, Mr. Marangio struck up a conversation with Harold Naupari, a farmer who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, and commutes each day to 10 family-owned acres in Goshen, N.Y. Mr. Naupari sells tomatoes, corn, squash and beets, among other items. Asked to identify his wares, he began rattling off the names of vegetables. Mr. Marangio chimed in: “Huge, beautiful leeks!” And he added: “There’s no way this market won’t reopen in the spring. I’ll have the guys come to my house and sell at my house, whatever it is.” More Articles in New York Region » A version of this article appeared in print on November 2, 2008, on page CY6 of the New York edition.FOR years, residents of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, have complained about a dearth of fresh produce in the neighborhood, and the problem seemed to only worsen in June with the closing of a Key Food on Third Avenue and 94th Street.

He who pays the piper supposedly calls the tune. And Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, is rightly insisting on some restrictions on bank bosses’ pay while their firms are benefiting from government cash. But the Treasury should show more ambition to change practices for the longer term. That’s not because banking titans shouldn’t be paid handsomely. Recent evidence shows that a pay philosophy under which bankers collect giant bonuses based on short-term, boom-time profits with little consideration of the pent-up risks can cost investors, governments and taxpayers dearly. Changes are needed in how pay is structured. The Treasury’s rules don’t take up this challenge with alacrity. For a start, they cover only the top five executives, and only at banks taking government cash. That’s unambitious compared with the approach of Hector Sants, who runs the Financial Services Authority of Britain. He suggested to dozens of British bank bosses that they should change how pay is structured for all relevant employees, and he didn’t single out banks receiving government help. Washington also seems focused narrowly on severance payments and the tax deductibility of top executives’ pay. Mr. Paulson is imposing further pay restrictions on banks in which the Treasury is investing directly. Unfortunately, these conditions, aimed at reducing unwarranted risk-taking, are vague. If the Treasury team has the will, the rules could be interpreted along the lines proposed by the F.S.A. Mr. Sants suggested basing bonuses on more than one year’s profit, taking risk and nonfinancial factors into account, and making some payments subject to claw-back in the case of future losses. The F.S.A. also wants boards, human resource functions and risk experts to have greater independence and scope to influence compensation. The United States will, for a few years, have an unprecedented chance to push such ideas hard. And the opportunity goes beyond the written rules, because heightened scrutiny by the taxpaying public and legislators may help change behavior in other ways. Neither Mr. Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs chief, nor any less Wall Street-friendly successor should try to tell banks how much to pay their people. But the Treasury can aim to have the bankers of the future paid well for lasting success, not fleeting profits. Deals in the Dust Judging by the speeches of the presidential candidates, one would think Wall Street and Main Street never meet. But take a closer look. See that drugstore on the corner where you fill your prescriptions? How about the trash cans where children throw their candy wrappers or the A.T.M.’s on nearly every block? In a roundabout way, these fixtures of Main Street America are all being buffeted by the Wall Street panic of 2008. In just the last week, some of the biggest corporations that install cash machines, operate pharmacies and haul America’s trash had hostile offers evaporate  in large part because of the misfortunes of the market, which made buyers skittish and financing more expensive. Consider Diebold, the tiny manufacturer of cash dispensers based in Ohio that spurned in February a $40-a-share cash offer from United Technologies, a sprawling conglomerate. For months, Diebold resisted, arguing the offer was too cheap. Last weekend, United Technologies finally walked, sending Diebold shares tumbling. Then there’s the corner pharmacy. As stock prices plunged last week, Walgreen withdrew its unsolicited $2.8 billion offer for a rival, Longs Drug Stores. Longs declined to engage in discussions with Walgreen because Longs had already agreed to a $2.7 billion merger with CVS Caremark. Longs shareholders may still get a deal  but with Walgreen out of the picture, it will be hard to squeeze more money out of CVS. And then there’s the trash. On Monday, Waste Management pulled its hostile $6.73 billion bid for Republic Services, citing a desire not to junk its credit rating. Again, that’s not the end of the world for Republic shareholders. The company was already involved in a tie-up with Allied Waste. Nonetheless, there are few better measures of animal spirits among the executive class than the unsolicited takeover, which tends to ensure the best price available for a corporate asset.

Build a Bigger and Brighter Billboard<date>Published: May 24, 2008</date><text>They could be 212-foot-high, flat black stealth bomber wings studded with tiny jewels, soaring 17 stories above the crossroads of the world. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Todd Heisler/The New York Times The big sign the Walgreen Company is building boasts distinctive wings that stretch up the facade past the Dow Jones zipper. Todd Heisler/The New York Times David Pelio was overseeing the installation of the sign. Soon enough, their gemlike lights will glow brilliantly as the signature elements of the largest advertising billboard in Times Square, trumpeted by its designers as the world’s most complex, powerful and digitally advanced new supersign, with unequaled high-resolution graphics. The billboard, traditionally called a “spectacular” on the Great White Way, is already visible, yet still very much under construction. In sheathing the east, west and south sides of 1 Times Square, it will show the flag of the Walgreen Company, the nation’s largest drugstore chain in sales, which is promoting a new three-level, 16,200-square-foot emporium in the building’s ground-floor retail space, which has been empty for seven years. The multicomponent, 250,000-pound sign will be programmed from street level to 341 feet high at the top of the building, on the traffic island between Broadway and Seventh Avenue at 42nd Street. Best known as the mother ship for a patchwork of billboards and the place where the ball drops on New Year’s Eve, the building was originally called the Times Tower, the 25-story, 1904 headquarters of the newspaper that gave the square its name. The store is expected to be unveiled, and the billboard officially illuminated, next fall. The sign will have 12 million light-emitting diodes, known as L.E.D.’s  17,000 square feet of them, “which is more than a third of an acre,” said Arthur Gilmore, president of the Gilmore Group, a Manhattan design and branding consulting firm, which created the sign. “Including its digital and vinyl decorative components, it will be 43,720 square feet in area.” The new spectacular “will be larger than any sign in Times Square,” said Barry E. Winston, a Times Square project consultant who has been a billboard expert for more than 50 years. He said it would surpass the current behemoth, the 11,000-square-foot Nasdaq sign on Broadway at 43rd Street. Walgreen is trying to raise its visibility in New York, a city seemingly overrun by Duane Reade, Rite Aid and CVS, where residents seem to need another drugstore even less than they need another bank. This does not deter Walgreen, which sees “the sign and the store as a focal point for us nationally,” said Craig M. Sinclair, a Walgreen divisional advertising vice president. Walgreen has 22 stores in the five boroughs; it will have 5 more by the end of the year, and plans a dozen more by 2010. Mr. Sinclair estimated that the sign would be seen by 1.6 million passers-by daily. “There was a jumble of signs at 1 Times Square, and no continuity,” Mr. Gilmore said. “Now, three sides of the building will be programmed as a single entity.” And so, the sign components of the east and west facades of the building, which are 341 feet tall and 143 feet wide, will be programmed “in a synchronized way, as a single animation,” said Meric Adriansen, a managing partner of D3, a digital design company in North Bergen, N.J., that designed the hardware and software for Walgreen. These animations  largely advertising spots  will run from 15 to 60 seconds. Enhancing the digital screens will be “passive,” or nondigital, custom-printed decorative opaque vinyls as well as lighter printed vinyl-mesh scrims of the kind used in bus graphics. The scrims are perforated so that they do not rip apart in the wind. Other advertisers with screens on the northern face of the building have long-term leases. Those screens will remain, as will several nondigital vinyl billboards on the east and west facades. In the language of supersigns, the Walgreen billboard will be “densely populated” with L.E.D.’s that are as close as six millimeters apart. The sign will marshal enough candlepower to withstand the sun at high noon. Its images will be projected by 12 million red, green and blue L.E.D.’s programmed to glow in different configurations so that the brains of human observers interpret them as images. A trillion colors are programmable. The elements of the sign, programmed and directed from a control room in the building, require 200 disk drives to govern both sides of the building. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in New York Region »They could be 212-foot-high, flat black stealth bomber wings studded with tiny jewels, soaring 17 stories above the crossroads of the world. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Todd Heisler/The New York Times The big sign the Walgreen Company is building boasts distinctive wings that stretch up the facade past the Dow Jones zipper. Todd Heisler/The New York Times David Pelio was overseeing the installation of the sign. Soon enough, their gemlike lights will glow brilliantly as the signature elements of the largest advertising billboard in Times Square, trumpeted by its designers as the world’s most complex, powerful and digitally advanced new supersign, with unequaled high-resolution graphics. The billboard, traditionally called a “spectacular” on the Great White Way, is already visible, yet still very much under construction. In sheathing the east, west and south sides of 1 Times Square, it will show the flag of the Walgreen Company, the nation’s largest drugstore chain in sales, which is promoting a new three-level, 16,200-square-foot emporium in the building’s ground-floor retail space, which has been empty for seven years. The multicomponent, 250,000-pound sign will be programmed from street level to 341 feet high at the top of the building, on the traffic island between Broadway and Seventh Avenue at 42nd Street. Best known as the mother ship for a patchwork of billboards and the place where the ball drops on New Year’s Eve, the building was originally called the Times Tower, the 25-story, 1904 headquarters of the newspaper that gave the square its name. The store is expected to be unveiled, and the billboard officially illuminated, next fall. The sign will have 12 million light-emitting diodes, known as L.E.D.’s  17,000 square feet of them, “which is more than a third of an acre,” said Arthur Gilmore, president of the Gilmore Group, a Manhattan design and branding consulting firm, which created the sign. “Including its digital and vinyl decorative components, it will be 43,720 square feet in area.” The new spectacular “will be larger than any sign in Times Square,” said Barry E.

At least four days a week, they eat breakfast there. Sometimes, it is just toast with coffee. Other mornings, a short stack or perhaps eggs over lightly, to mix things up. Sometimes, they even come back in the afternoon. But their days at the diner appear to be numbered. The owners, Donna Z. Vaccari and Joanne Zappavigna, sisters in a family of diner owners, have decided to close the Thru-ways doors, and Walgreens is planning to open a 9,560-square-foot store in its place. Personally, I dont like it, said Joseph Nardozzi, as he arrived for breakfast with his brother one morning recently, both in Yankee caps. We made a lot of friends here. He is not alone. More than 5,000 people have signed a petition to Save the Thru-way Diner, a Facebook site with hundreds of members has been organized to protest the closing, and community groups have appealed for reason. Ive been getting calls from all over the country, said Barbara Davis, the citys acting historian. Grown men have called saying they cried when they heard the news. Open 24 hours a day, the Thru-way has become an institution, a special place to gather after high school plays and proms, for birthday celebrations or simply to meet friends for a bite. Ive grown up at that diner, said Jason Latorre, who moved to a neighborhood near the diner when he was 2 and now lives two blocks away. Its like tearing down a house you grew up in. Beyond sentimentality, neighborhood opponents complain that they will be losing a popular restaurant for a Walgreens when there is already a CVS drugstore in a building that abuts the Thru-way property. Despite such sentiments, there seems to be little to stop the deal. After Ms. Vaccari and Ms. Zappavigna agreed to lease the property to Mark East Inc., a New York City-based developer, Ms. Zappavignas lawyer notified planning board officials in an Oct. 3 letter that she had changed her mind and withdrawn her support for the agreement. After the developer reminded city officials of the binding lease agreement, however, Ms. Zappavigna was back on board. The terms of the lease have not been disclosed. Unfortunately, its a long, tortured story about a family business, said Ronald L. Konove, her lawyer. At this point, its really in the hands of the city. Mayor Noam Branson said there was no legal mechanism by which to prevent a private property transaction of this kind. The sisters father owned several diners in the Bronx and Westchester until his death about 10 years ago, Mr. Konove said. The sisters each own 50 percent of the Thru-way, and Ms. Zappavigna operates another of the familys diners in Larchmont. The Walgreens does not require zoning changes, only site plan approval. Representatives will go before the planning board on Tuesday seeking that approval. Joel Sachs, a lawyer for the developers, said that Walgreens has realized from the beginning that the diner was an icon in the community and would be a sensitive tenant. We certainly respect the feelings of people who live in the city and have been patrons of the Thru-way Diner, he said. I grew up in Mount Vernon, and I used to go to the Thru-way with my family for special occasions. He added, People may be pointing fingers at Mark East or Walgreens, but this was really the decision of the owners to come to us. Its unclear how long the diner will continue to operate. Much of it will depend on the speed of the approval process. Although some incarnation of the Thru-way has been operating at 810 Main for much of the last 50 years, the current diner was built only about 20 years ago, said Phil De Rafelle, whose New Rochelle company manufactured all three diners that have operated at the site. The current restaurant, with its futuristic design, neon signs, brushed stainless steel facade and reflective mirrored windows, was unique when it opened, he said, but he later built about 24 more like it. Noting that diners are typically in sought-after locations and have become popular targets for banks and pharmacies looking to expand, Mr. De Raffele said his company had built nearly 1,000 diners, mostly on the Eastern Seaboard. The Thru-way happens to be one of my favorites, he said. It was such a beautiful diner, and it did such beautiful business for so many years, its hard to imagine it not being there. More Articles in New York Region »New Rochelle Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » AT 91 and 87, Joseph and Anthony Nardozzi have been going to the Thru-way Diner longer than they can remember.

Skip to next paragraph Related Fleeing Rents in Capital, Nonprofits Buy Condos More Commercial Real Estate Enlarge This Image Ronen Zilberman for The New York Times New stores, like Nordstrom are being built in Ala Moana, in Honolulu. But in the last four years, a wave of retail development has washed over Hawaii, as the state has experienced a post-2001 rebound in tourism and growing optimism among residents, as job growth has been strong and home prices in many areas have roughly doubled since 2003. As a result, they say, while Hawaii already had a number of familiar big-box retail chains like Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Costco and Home Depot, it has recently drawn attention from several national retailers trying to enter the market for the first time. National retailers have seen many of their competitors who have entered the market do the highest numbers of any of their stores, and that has changed their thinking, said Molly Mosher-Cates, the principal broker and owner of the Sperry Van Ness/MC Realty Advisors office in Kailua, a mostly residential town on the eastern side of Oahu. The newcomers to Hawaii include Target, which plans to open two large stores by 2009; Nordstrom, which plans to open a larger-than-average store in Honolulu next spring; and Whole Foods, which plans to open four stores in Hawaii in the next three years, although plans for its first store, on Oahu, were stalled by the discovery of an ancient Hawaiian burial ground on the site. Walgreens plans eventually to open 25 to 30 stores in Hawaii as part of its effort to compete with Longs Drugs, the dominant drugstore in the state. At Petco, the San Diego-based pet products retailer, a spokesman said his company was also looking for possible store sites in Hawaii. Mike Y. Hamasu, the consulting and research director for the Honolulu office of Colliers Monroe Friedlander, a large real estate brokerage firm, estimated Hawaii now has some 30 million square feet of retail development. Another 4.5 million square feet is either planned or already under construction statewide. Oahu, the most heavily populated island, accounts for only about half of that development, or some 2.3 million square feet. In some cases, the retail interest has prompted existing shopping centers to make big upgrades, like those under way at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center on Kalakaua Avenue in Honolulu. In other cases, the interest is in bringing retailing to parts of Hawaii that still have almost no stores, like the Kohala Coast section of Hawaii, the so-called Big Island, where Queens Marketplace, a 135,000-square-foot open-air lifestyle center was recently built amid barren lava fields that blanket much of the area. Although the Kohala area is already home to half a dozen large luxury resorts, as well as a growing community of time shares and luxury homes, many residents now have to drive at least half an hour to areas like Kailua-Kona or Waimea, for major shopping purchases and groceries. Setting up shop in Hawaii can pose distinct challenges, including the fact that construction costs continue to be at least 30 percent higher than those on the mainland. Still, the search for space has driven down the retail vacancy rate statewide to just 3 percent, and rents have risen appreciably. On Oahu alone, rents are up 41 percent over the last four years, Mr. Hamasu said. Rosalind J. Schurgin, a principal at the Festival Companies, a Los Angeles-based firm that is redeveloping the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, said that even though mainland retailers are showing very strong interest in expanding to Hawaii, the logistics can still be maddening. Among the factors that can slow the development process are the considerable travel time that mainland-based executives need to set aside while visiting the state, as well as increasingly common three- to six-month-long delays in obtaining building permits. Everything in Hawaii, like making deals, can take twice as long, she said. Ms. Schurgin said that two goals of the $110 million makeover at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center were to open up the centers once-forbidding concrete facade and also to find space for the growing number of national retailers, like Apple, that want to be on Kalakaua Avenue, the main thoroughfare in the Waikiki area. One retailer that has long wanted to establish a full-line store in Hawaii is Nordstrom, although it already has a shoe store and an discount store in Honolulu. In 1996, Nordstrom, which is based in Seattle, first announced plans to open a full-line store in Hawaii, and next March it expects to finally open a 210,000-square-foot store at the Ala Moana shopping center in Honolulu, as part of that centers fifth expansion since 1959. Ala Moana is already the largest shopping mall in Hawaii, as well as one of the most productive malls anywhere: sales at the 1.8-million-square-foot open-air mall now average more than $1,300 a square foot, versus $409 a square foot for shopping centers nationwide. The latest expansion, an addition of 300,000 square feet, is making room not only for Nordstrom but also for another 35 new retailers, said Sharon James, the regional vice president for marketing at General Growth Properties, the centers Chicago-based owner. According to Ms. James, 70 percent of the new stores at Ala Moana will be the first in Hawaii for retailers like J. Crew, Chicos, Vera Bradley and the home furnishings retailer Design Within Reach.

Net income was $396.5 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $412.3 million, or 41 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. It was the first decline in quarterly profit since early in the 1998 fiscal year, and executives warned that trouble could persist. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31, rose more than 10 percent, to $13.4 billion from $12.2 billion. Analysts expected earnings of 47 cents a share and revenue of $13.5 billion. “Many of the challenges we faced in this quarter will continue, including comparisons to last year’s blockbuster generics,” said Rick Hans, the company’s director of finance. A particular problem for Walgreen has been growing use of simvastatin, a generic version of the popular cholesterol drug Zocor. Since the generic medication reached the market last summer, reimbursement rates from insurance plans have sagged. Walgreen said it filled nearly three times the simvastatin prescriptions during the fourth quarter as it did last year. But the company made virtually the same amount of money selling the drug. Shares of Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., fell $7.08, or 15 percent, to $40.16. Total expenses climbed more than 11 percent, to $12.8 billion, which the chairman, Jeffrey A. Rein, said was out of line with reimbursements the company received. “Managing both expenses and lower reimbursements on some generic drugs is my top priority,” he said in a statement. “We’re going to fix this, and at the same time continue our aggressive growth plan.” More Articles in Business »CHICAGO, Oct. 1 (AP)  The Walgreen Company, one of the nation’s biggest drugstore chains, said Monday that its fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell nearly 4 percent because of lower reimbursements for some popular generic drugs and increased store and work force costs.

Analysts expected earnings of 47 cents a share and revenue of $13.5 billion. “Many of the challenges we faced in this quarter will continue, including comparisons to last year’s blockbuster generics,” said Rick Hans, the company’s director of finance. A particular problem for Walgreen has been growing use of simvastatin, a generic version of the popular cholesterol drug Zocor. Since the generic medication reached the market last summer, reimbursement rates from insurance plans have sagged. Walgreen said it filled nearly three times the simvastatin prescriptions during the fourth quarter as it did last year. But the company made virtually the same amount of money selling the drug. Shares of Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., fell $7.08, or 15 percent, to $40.16. Total expenses climbed more than 11 percent, to $12.8 billion, which the chairman, Jeffrey A. Rein, said was out of line with reimbursements the company received. “Managing both expenses and lower reimbursements on some generic drugs is my top priority,” he said in a statement. “We’re going to fix this, and at the same time continue our aggressive growth plan.”</text></article>

The company added seven new compounds to the list of drugs it sells for $4. Skip to next paragraph Related Helped by Generics, Inflation of Drug Costs Slows (September 21, 2007) But the announcement may give a glimpse of the future at Wal-Mart pharmacies. The company seems to be reaching out to a younger and broader drug clientele as it tries to expand its piece of the nations $250 billion retail pharmaceutical market beyond its current share of 5 to 6 percent. Many of the drugs previously on the Wal-Mart plan were heart, high blood pressure and diabetes drugs commonly used by older people. But yesterday, the company added to its $4 list methylphenidate, a drug for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder that is commonly used for school-age children. Perhaps more significant, Wal-Mart said it would start selling generic versions of two popular birth control pills for $9 a month, appealing to an estimated 11 million women in America, most of them under age 40, who use oral contraceptives. A fertility drug, clomiphene, will also be available for $9, Wal-Mart said. Versions of the two birth control pills  known by the brand names Ortho Cyclen and Ortho Tri-Cyclen  account for 20 percent of oral contraception prescriptions in this country. Although the average woman would save only $1 at Wal-Mart if she had insurance coverage for the pill, she would save $21 if she did not have coverage. The pills frequently sell for $30. Establishing a new $9 price point for certain generic drugs may prove a crucial step, according to analysts, some of whom have considered Wal-Marts pharmacies an underused asset. What theyve done here is, theyve gotten a bit more aggressive in creating a second tier, said Ronny Gal, who follows the generic drug industry for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. This is a very important development. Rather than just sell for $4 and be stuck with only the cheapest generics, theyve now created a tier and they have a business model for more expensive generics, as well. Mr. Gal predicted that the company might very well add more drugs to the $9 list and, ultimately, create a third, higher-priced, tier. A Wal-Mart senior vice president, John Agwunobi, said that there was more to come, adding that the company planned to grow the program and continue it into the future. Wal-Mart announced the programs expansion yesterday, just over a year after introducing the $4 generic plan. The discounts have prompted similar steps by many other retailers, including Target, which said yesterday that it would match Wal-Marts latest moves. Government economists recently credited the discount pricing plans with contributing to a slowdown of inflation in the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs, which is currently running at about 1 percent, a three-decade low. Still, two of the nations largest prescription drug retailers, Walgreens and CVS, have said the Wal-Mart promotions have not affected their businesses and they have not matched the discount prices. A spokeswoman for Walgreens said yesterday that the companys share of the nations retail pharmaceutical market had increased a percentage point, to 17 percent, since the Wal-Mart $4 plan began last year. In a conference call with the media and investment analysts yesterday, Wal-Marts chief operating officer, Bill Simon, estimated that the company has saved individual shoppers and the nations overall health care system $610 million since the program began last year. In all, the company said its generic plan would now cover 361 prescriptions representing various formulations of 157 medications, an increase of about 24 prescriptions. Wal-Mart said its $4 program now covered about 40 percent of the prescription drugs sold at its Wal-Mart, Sams Club and Neighborhood Market pharmacies. Wal-Mart has sought competitive bids from generic makers for at least some of the products, enabling it to still make money while selling the generics for $4. Two of the drugs the company added to its list yesterday  versions of the heart medication Coreg and the nail-fungus drug Lamisil  only recently became available as generics. Generic drugs are typically sold at small discounts just after their approval before falling to as low as 10 percent of the original brand-name drug cost a year or so later. In this case, however, generic versions of both Coreg and Lamisil have been heavily discounted early because of competition among the numerous generic manufacturers that received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell them. Coreg, used to treat congestive heart failure and hypertension, became available in this country as a generic drug this month. Wal-Mart, which said the brand-name version had been $119 just a month ago, said that its inclusion on the $4 list meant that customers would be saving $115 a prescription. The generic version of Coreg  made by more than a dozen manufacturers  is widely available from various Internet sources at retail prices from $37 to $102. Wal-Mart said that savings on the generic version of Lamisil would be extensive, comparing its $4 price with an average price a month ago of $337 for the branded version. Lamisil, however, has been available as a generic since July. Some retailers were selling it this week for as low as $45.

With demand for primary care doctors surpassing the supply in many parts of the country, the number of these retail clinics in drugstores has exploded over the past two years, and several companies operating them are now aggressively seeking to open clinics in New York City. But with their increasing popularity, the clinics are drawing mounting scrutiny. Several states including New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and California are examining ways to more closely monitor the clinics, which are overseen by a hodgepodge of state agencies applying a wide and inconsistent range of regulations. More than 700 clinics are operating across the country at chain stores including Wal-Mart, CVS, Walgreens and Duane Reade. New York State regulators are investigating the business relationships between drugstore companies and medical providers to determine whether the clinics are being used improperly to increase business or steer patients to the pharmacies in which the clinics are located. And doctors groups, whose members stand to lose business from the clinics, are citing concerns about standards of care, safety and hygiene, and they have urged the federal and state governments to step in to more rigorously regulate the new businesses. Weve got big problems in health care, and this is not the answer, said Dr. Rick Kellerman, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. They are a response, they are a niche market and an economic opportunity, but we still have an underlying primary care crisis in this country. Patients, however, have flocked to the clinics, according to a new industry group, the Convenient Care Association. I think its great you dont have to make an appointment.

The association estimated that 70 percent of clinic patients have health insurance and are using the clinics because of convenience. For them, costs may not be much different from those at doctors offices, because the same insurance co-payments apply. But uninsured patients could reap substantial savings. In New York City, one in five residents lacks a regular doctor and one in six is uninsured, according to a recent survey by the citys Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and overcrowded emergency rooms are often their first resort for routine care. State officials acknowledged the clinics appeal. But they said they were looking into possible violations of state law prohibiting unauthorized corporations like pharmacies, which are licensed only to provide pharmaceutical services, from delivering medical care. If we determine the business corporations are practicing medicine, then they are illegally practicing the profession and we have the authority to investigate, said Frank Munoz, associate commissioner of the State Education Departments Office of the Professions. MinuteClinic, a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Caremark, the drug chains formal name, and the largest of more than a dozen clinic operators nationwide, manages seven clinics at drugstores in New York state, including one on Staten Island, and 20 others in New Jersey and Connecticut. The company said it hoped to open as many as 150 more clinics in the New York area, which would be staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. New York law requires that nurse practitioners work closely with a physician, who oversees the practice but is not required to be at the clinic, and that the clinics operate as independent practices or professional corporations. In other states, the medical providers can work directly for a drugstore company, a practice that has touched off concern that the providers might place the interests of their employers above those of patients. MinuteClinic officials insisted that there was nothing improper in the relationships between providers and the drugstores and that medical care is not being compromised. 1 2 Next Page » Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

Walgreen has been expanding its lineup of health-related services through a series of acquisitions. The deal follows the companys purchases of Take Care Health Systems, an operator of in-store health clinics; Medmark Specialty Pharmacy Solutions; SeniorMed Pharmacy; and Schrafts, a specialty pharmacy focused on fertility medications and services. Walgreens latest move comes months after its main rival, CVS, became the largest provider of specialty pharmacy services with its acquisition of Caremark. Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., expects the acquisition to close in a few months and add slightly to earnings in the first year and more in future years, the chief financial officer, William M. Rudolphsen said in a conference call. Walgreen said it would pay $19.50 in cash for 34.5 million outstanding Option Care shares and 4.5 million in option equivalent shares, or a total of $760.5 million.

The company said that it also would consider “select” acquisitions and was looking for other pharmacy-related health care opportunities as it continued to open hundreds of stores. Profit rose to $561.2 million, or 56 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended May 31, up from $469.2 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected the chain, based in Deerfield, Ill., to earn 53 cents a share, Reuters Estimates said. Sales rose 12.5 percent, to $13.7 billion. Total sales in stores open at least a year, a measure of retail strength known as same-store sales, rose 7.8 percent in the quarter. Prescription sales rose 13.8 percent over all, and rose 9 percent in comparable stores. Comparable sales of general merchandise climbed 5.6 percent. Rick J. Hans, the finance director, said in a statement that Walgreen, which typically grows by opening new stores rather than through acquisitions, would look at “select acquisitions” as the drugstore industry continued to consolidate. He said the company was also looking for opportunities in health care. Walgreen bought an in-store health clinic operator, Take Care Health Systems, in May. Mr. Hans said that while the opening of more than 400 clinics by the end of calendar year 2008 would not have the same impact as opening 400 drugstores, the clinics would be central to the company’s expansion of health care services in the future. Walgreen operated 5,751 stores as of May 31, up from 5,251 a year earlier. Its largest rival, the CVS /Caremark Corporation, had 6,168 stores as of May 26. Walgreen is on track to surpass its goal of 7,000 stores in 2010, said its chief executive, Jeffrey A. Rein. Shares of Walgreen fell 1.6 percent to close at $44.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/business/28muslim.html?ref=walgreencompany">Rewriting the Ad Rules for Muslim-Americans<date>Published: April 28, 2007</date><text>For years, few advertisers in the United States have dared to reach out to Muslims. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Video Selling to Islam Either they did not see much potential for sales or they feared a political backlash. And there were practical reasons: American Muslims come from so many ethnic backgrounds that their only common ground is their religion, a subject most marketers avoid. That is beginning to change. Consumer companies and advertising executives are focusing on ways to use the cultural aspects of the Muslim religion to help sell their products. Grocers and consumer product companies are considering ways to adapt their goods to Muslim rules, which forbid among other things, gelatin and pig fat, which is often used in cosmetics and cleaning products. Retailers are looking into providing more conservative skirts, even during the summer months, and mainstream advertisers are planning to place some commercials on the satellite channels that Muslims often watch. Marketing to Muslims carries some risks. But advertising executives, used to dividing American consumers into every sort of category, say that ignoring this group  estimated to be about five million to eight million people, and growing fast  would be like missing the Hispanic market in the 1990s. I think Muslims have had to draw into themselves, said Marian Salzman, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of JWT, a large advertising agency in the WPP Group that plans to encourage clients like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Unilever to market to American Muslims. It puts an increased burden on a marketer post-9/11 to say, Look, we understand.  Companies in the Detroit area, where there is a dense population of Muslims, are leading the change. A McDonalds there serves halal Chicken McNuggets; Walgreens has Arabic signs in its aisles. And now, Ikea, which recently opened a store in the suburb of Canton, Mich., that has had trouble attracting as many Muslim customers as it had hoped, has been touring local homes and talking to Muslims to figure out their needs. The store there plans to sell decorations for Ramadan next fall and is adding halal meat to its restaurant menu, or meat that is prepared according to Islamic law. Catalogs in Arabic are being planned, and female Muslim employees are expected to be given an Ikea-branded hijab, to wear over their head if they wish. Video More Video » Marketing to Muslims is, of course, mostly intended to increase sales, but advertising has also long been a mirror of changes in society. Ms. Salzman pointed to ads in the 1960s that featured Jewish products like Levys rye bread, which, she said, helped bring that group more into mainstream advertising. She also noted that ads from companies like McDonalds in the early 1990s portrayed busy mothers who admitted that they did not cook every night like their mothers did. Marketers have actually helped us to rewrite the rules about what were comfortable with, she said. Because the Census Bureau does not ask about religion, there is no authoritative count of Muslims in America. Some Muslim organizations provide estimates as high as 10 million. Others say it could be as low as three million. Whatever the number, many Muslims have clustered in areas that include Orange County, Calif.; Houston; the state of Georgia; northern Virginia; New York City and Long Island; and the Detroit area. Over the last few months, JWT conducted a large study of Muslims in the United States and Britain to determine whether they would be receptive to specialized advertising. There were 835 people in the United States study. Muslim Americans spend about $170 billion on consumer products, JWT estimates; this figure is expected to grow rapidly as the population expands and younger Muslims build careers. Ms. Salzman said the study found that Muslims were buying many standard products but that they felt excluded from mainstream advertising. In particular, she said, they wanted companies to recognize their holidays. Ms. Salzman said JWT had little trouble surveying Muslims in Britain, but found it had to clarify at the start of each phone call in the United States that it was not calling from a government agency. Over the next few weeks, JWT plans to reach out to the chief executives of all of its major clients, including JetBlue, the Ford Motor Company and HSBC, to encourage them to market to Muslims in the United States and Britain. These advertisers have been in the Middle East and in the Far East Muslim countries for decades, so theyre already dealing with the Muslim market, said Tayyibah Taylor, publisher and editor in chief of Azizah magazine, a Muslim-focused magazine in Atlanta. They just havent been dealing with the Muslim marketer here at home. Almas Abbasi, a radiologist in Long Island who was one of the people interviewed by JWT, said she would be grateful for advertising that included Muslims. If Ramadan starts, and you see an ad in the newspaper saying, Happy Ramadan, heres a special in our store, everyone will run to that store, she said. Her daughter, Shaheen Magsi, a senior at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, N.Y., said her family turned off their cable television three years ago after seeing too many negative stereotypes about Muslims. She said she quickly grew tired of telling people at school that, no, she did not agree with Osama bin Laden. Itd be really good to say, Oh, theres a Muslim on TV, and theyre portraying something good other than Muslims killing people,  she said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »For years, few advertisers in the United States have dared to reach out to Muslims.

Consumer companies and advertising executives are focusing on ways to use the cultural aspects of the Muslim religion to help sell their products. Grocers and consumer product companies are considering ways to adapt their goods to Muslim rules, which forbid among other things, gelatin and pig fat, which is often used in cosmetics and cleaning products. Retailers are looking into providing more conservative skirts, even during the summer months, and mainstream advertisers are planning to place some commercials on the satellite channels that Muslims often watch. Marketing to Muslims carries some risks. But advertising executives, used to dividing American consumers into every sort of category, say that ignoring this group  estimated to be about five million to eight million people, and growing fast  would be like missing the Hispanic market in the 1990s. I think Muslims have had to draw into themselves, said Marian Salzman, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of JWT, a large advertising agency in the WPP Group that plans to encourage clients like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Unilever to market to American Muslims. It puts an increased burden on a marketer post-9/11 to say, Look, we understand.  Companies in the Detroit area, where there is a dense population of Muslims, are leading the change. A McDonalds there serves halal Chicken McNuggets; Walgreens has Arabic signs in its aisles. And now, Ikea, which recently opened a store in the suburb of Canton, Mich., that has had trouble attracting as many Muslim customers as it had hoped, has been touring local homes and talking to Muslims to figure out their needs. The store there plans to sell decorations for Ramadan next fall and is adding halal meat to its restaurant menu, or meat that is prepared according to Islamic law. Catalogs in Arabic are being planned, and female Muslim employees are expected to be given an Ikea-branded hijab, to wear over their head if they wish. Video More Video » Marketing to Muslims is, of course, mostly intended to increase sales, but advertising has also long been a mirror of changes in society. Ms. Salzman pointed to ads in the 1960s that featured Jewish products like Levys rye bread, which, she said, helped bring that group more into mainstream advertising. She also noted that ads from companies like McDonalds in the early 1990s portrayed busy mothers who admitted that they did not cook every night like their mothers did. Marketers have actually helped us to rewrite the rules about what were comfortable with, she said. Because the Census Bureau does not ask about religion, there is no authoritative count of Muslims in America. Some Muslim organizations provide estimates as high as 10 million. Others say it could be as low as three million. Whatever the number, many Muslims have clustered in areas that include Orange County, Calif.; Houston; the state of Georgia; northern Virginia; New York City and Long Island; and the Detroit area. Over the last few months, JWT conducted a large study of Muslims in the United States and Britain to determine whether they would be receptive to specialized advertising. There were 835 people in the United States study. Muslim Americans spend about $170 billion on consumer products, JWT estimates; this figure is expected to grow rapidly as the population expands and younger Muslims build careers. Ms. Salzman said the study found that Muslims were buying many standard products but that they felt excluded from mainstream advertising. In particular, she said, they wanted companies to recognize their holidays. Ms. Salzman said JWT had little trouble surveying Muslims in Britain, but found it had to clarify at the start of each phone call in the United States that it was not calling from a government agency. Over the next few weeks, JWT plans to reach out to the chief executives of all of its major clients, including JetBlue, the Ford Motor Company and HSBC, to encourage them to market to Muslims in the United States and Britain. These advertisers have been in the Middle East and in the Far East Muslim countries for decades, so theyre already dealing with the Muslim market, said Tayyibah Taylor, publisher and editor in chief of Azizah magazine, a Muslim-focused magazine in Atlanta. They just havent been dealing with the Muslim marketer here at home. Almas Abbasi, a radiologist in Long Island who was one of the people interviewed by JWT, said she would be grateful for advertising that included Muslims. If Ramadan starts, and you see an ad in the newspaper saying, Happy Ramadan, heres a special in our store, everyone will run to that store, she said. Her daughter, Shaheen Magsi, a senior at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, N.Y., said her family turned off their cable television three years ago after seeing too many negative stereotypes about Muslims. She said she quickly grew tired of telling people at school that, no, she did not agree with Osama bin Laden. Itd be really good to say, Oh, theres a Muslim on TV, and theyre portraying something good other than Muslims killing people,  she said. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Some analysts noted that a lower tax rate and a lower-than-expected inventory charge increased earnings by about a penny a share. Otherwise, analysts generally viewed the results favorably. “The changing prescription mix was a nice tailwind, but the strong performance was also the result of better store productivity,” Mitchell P.

The agencys action comes after a lawsuit filed in 2005 against Walgreen by several current and former black employees who said the company made store assignments based on race and gave the plaintiffs jobs in either predominantly black neighborhoods or less-desirable ones. Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., has disputed the accusations in that lawsuit and it said yesterday in a statement that it was disappointed by the agencys decision to bring its suit. Both actions were filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois in East St. Louis. Fairness and equality always have been the cornerstones of our business, the company said. Were the nations best-represented retailer in urban areas, and managers of all backgrounds are promoted to senior levels from those locations. Walgreen has 5,638 stores in 48 states and Puerto Rico, according to its Web site. It had sales of $47.4 billion in 2006. Agency officials described the Walgreen case as the biggest discrimination action brought by it in recent years. After more than 20 current and former employees nationwide complained to the agency, the E.E.O.C.s district offices in St. Louis and Miami conducted an investigation, the agency said in a statement. It said it decided to bring the case after attempts to reach a voluntary settlement were unsuccessful. Robert G. Johnson, a lawyer in the agencys St. Louis office, said that it had reviewed an analysis commissioned by plaintiffs lawyers that looked at how Walgreen assigned its stores and paid managers. After doing so, the agency determined that black managers were frequently assigned to poorer-performing stores, which made them less likely to be promoted, he said. It also concluded that discrimination at Walgreen was widespread, institutional and directed at blacks working as managers, pharmacists and trainees. Blacks were being paid less, Mr. Johnson said. Johnny Tucker, a store manager who is a plaintiff in the private lawsuit, said in a telephone interview that he had spent his entire 21-year career at Walgreen working primarily at stores in black or inner-city neighborhoods. As a result, he said he realized that he and other black managers were not keeping up with their white counterparts. The reason is that we were placed in low-income, low-profit, low-sales locations, said Mr. Tucker, who was among the employees who complained to the E.E.O.C. He applauded Walgreen for having stores in inner-city neighborhoods. But he said the company needed to spread the challenges of managing such stores among all its employees, not just black ones. Over the years, he added, he had been held up at gunpoint and threatened with a knife. I didnt live in these neighborhoods, so why was I working there, Mr. Tucker said. Walgreen, in its statement issued yesterday, said that it was committed to providing opportunity to all employees not only because it is the right thing to do but because our business was built on this principle. Amy Coopman, one of the plaintiffs lawyers suing Walgreen on behalf of Mr. Tucker and several other current and former Walgreen employees, said she was seeking to have it certified as a class action on behalf of all the companys employees. The E.E.O.C. action is seeking both money damages for Walgreen employees who have been the subject of discrimination as well as changes in the company practices.

Net income climbed to $523.5 million, or 51 cents a share, from $490.9 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier, Walgreen said. Revenue in the period, which ended Feb. 28 and was the second quarter of the company's fiscal year, increased 11 percent, to $12.2 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year gained 6.5 percent as shoppers bought holiday gifts, cards and wrapping paper. Pharmacy orders were down because there were fewer flu cases compared with last year, said Walgreen's director of finance, Rick Hans. Same-store prescription sales growth fell in the quarter from a year earlier. "Given the negatives that were in the quarter, such as a very mild flu season compared to a fairly severe one a year earlier, the slow start to the new Medicare drug plan and the ramping of salaries associated with the new drug plan, the quarter turned out fairly well," said Don Gher, an asset manager at Coldstream Capital Management in Bellevue, Wash. Pharmacy sales were also hurt by concerns about side effects from Vioxx and other drugs and by Medicaid issues in Tennessee and Puerto Rico, Mr. Hans said in a recorded message. Prescription sales accounted for 62 percent of revenue in the quarter, down from 65 percent in the first quarter. Same-store pharmacy sales rose 7.4 percent, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. Same-store sales of nonpharmacy goods climbed 5 percent, helped by demand for Christmas and Valentine's Day merchandise.

Either Way, Ink Is Getting Cheaper<date>Published: February 4, 2006</date><text>Bill Powell, a sports photographer in Tulsa, Okla., shoots high school and college games and sells his work to the players and their parents. Skip to next paragraph Matthew Staver for The New York Times An inkjet cartridge being refilled at a Cartridge World store. John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times Brenda Byrd demonstrating a new inkjet cartridge refiller at a Walgreens store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. He prints on a Canon Pixma photo printer, but he does not use Canon ink. For the last eight months he has been buying refilled cartridges from Cartridge World. "I couldn't tell the difference, and my customers couldn't tell the difference," Mr. Powell said. "It saves me about 50 percent." On the face of it, the logic of buying refilled ink cartridges seems pretty obvious. A new HP 26A cartridge, for use in about two dozen Hewlett-Packard printers, costs $29 at Staples. Buy a $21 Staples-brand remanufactured unit and you save 28 percent. Go to Cartridge World and you pay $18.39, a 37 percent discount. Walgreens is installing cartridge refilling machines in the photo department of 1,500 of its 5,120 drugstores. Office Depot is testing the same kiosks in Charlotte, N.C., and Minneapolis. These machines, called the Ink-O-Dem, cost about $40,000 and can refill a cartridge in about 2.5 minutes. "We cut out the middlemen," said Harry Nicodem, chief executive of TonerHead, the maker of the kiosk. The automation gives Walgreens a price advantage: its HP 26A is $14.50. (You can also refill one yourself at home and, after you scrub the ink from your hands, save even more, 65 percent.) End of story, right? You would go for the cheaper alternatives. But saving money is not just a matter of finding the lowest price. Two recent studies suggest that the more important consideration is the price per page printed, a number that is affected by the quality of a refilled cartridge. Hewlett-Packard executives argue that you are wasting your money with refills, which is what you might expect the company to say. Manufacturers have a lot riding on a business model in which they sell ink cartridges that can cost a third of what the printer did. The company has a point. QualityLogic, a Moorpark, Calif., test laboratory found that while new Hewlett-Packard cartridges had a 2 percent failure rate, 70 percent of remanufactured units did not last as long as promised. Hewlett commissioned the study, but Consumer Reports magazine came to a similar conclusion last May. Testers there found that in almost all cases, the refilled cartridges cost as much or more when evaluated on their per-page output. Hewlett executives said that was because the company optimized each printer head  the strip of silicon containing the microscopic ink nozzles  for its printer, ink and paper. In its San Diego lab, "print head architects" use high-powered microscopes and cameras to watch the firing of those nozzles with various ink formulations made in three company labs to find the designs that work best. Lexmark International and Brother use similar printer-head technology on their cartridges. (Canon and Epson put their printer heads in the printer itself. Those companies did not respond to requests for interviews.) Hewlett makes printer heads for some of its commercial printers that can last five years in continuous use. But the company said that its consumer printer cartridges were designed to be disposable. A printer head lasts just long enough to jettison that last drop of ink, a company official said. Cartridge refillers have a differing opinion. They say those cartridges can be used three to seven times. And they have built a $6.5 billion industry to prove it. "It creates an opportunity for us," said Burt Yarkin, the chief executive for the United States operations of Cartridge World, which has 1,100 stores worldwide, 350 of them in the United States. He says a refilled cartridge drives down the cost of making a color print at home to about 13 cents a print, less than most retail photofinishers charge. The refillers have put a dent in the printer makers' business. Market analysts at Lyra Research in Newton, Mass., which specializes in this industry, said the manufacturers were hanging onto about 79 percent of the $30.1 billon printer supplies business. The high-volume "remanufacturers," which supply stores with refilled cartridges, have about 18 percent of the market. The refillers at retail do about $1 billion in business, but that is growing at the rate of 18 percent a year. The impact is being felt. The migration to alternatives is a major reason net income dropped 47 percent in the fourth quarter at Lexmark International. "Consumers are becoming more aware of refilling and Walgreens effort will make even more people aware of it," said Charlie Brewer, managing editor of Hard Copy Supplies Journal, published by Lyra. Dave Shaw, the vice president for franchise development at Rapid Refill, a Springfield, Ore., refiller with 40 outlets, said, "It's not a bunch of guys in the back with syringes punching holes in the cartridges." Franchisees buy about $200,000 worth of machines that suck out the old ink, centrifuge out any remaining ink that could contaminate the new ink, rinse the cartridge with cleaning fluid and then refill it. (A Cartridge World franchisee's equipment costs about $150,000.) "They absolutely have to worry about quality," Mr. Brewer said. 1 2Next Page &gt; E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com More Articles in Technology &gt;Bill Powell, a sports photographer in Tulsa, Okla., shoots high school and college games and sells his work to the players and their parents.

John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times Brenda Byrd demonstrating a new inkjet cartridge refiller at a Walgreens store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. He prints on a Canon Pixma photo printer, but he does not use Canon ink. For the last eight months he has been buying refilled cartridges from Cartridge World. "I couldn't tell the difference, and my customers couldn't tell the difference," Mr. Powell said. "It saves me about 50 percent." On the face of it, the logic of buying refilled ink cartridges seems pretty obvious. A new HP 26A cartridge, for use in about two dozen Hewlett-Packard printers, costs $29 at Staples. Buy a $21 Staples-brand remanufactured unit and you save 28 percent. Go to Cartridge World and you pay $18.39, a 37 percent discount. Walgreens is installing cartridge refilling machines in the photo department of 1,500 of its 5,120 drugstores. Office Depot is testing the same kiosks in Charlotte, N.C., and Minneapolis. These machines, called the Ink-O-Dem, cost about $40,000 and can refill a cartridge in about 2.5 minutes. "We cut out the middlemen," said Harry Nicodem, chief executive of TonerHead, the maker of the kiosk. The automation gives Walgreens a price advantage: its HP 26A is $14.50. (You can also refill one yourself at home and, after you scrub the ink from your hands, save even more, 65 percent.) End of story, right? You would go for the cheaper alternatives. But saving money is not just a matter of finding the lowest price. Two recent studies suggest that the more important consideration is the price per page printed, a number that is affected by the quality of a refilled cartridge. Hewlett-Packard executives argue that you are wasting your money with refills, which is what you might expect the company to say. Manufacturers have a lot riding on a business model in which they sell ink cartridges that can cost a third of what the printer did. The company has a point. QualityLogic, a Moorpark, Calif., test laboratory found that while new Hewlett-Packard cartridges had a 2 percent failure rate, 70 percent of remanufactured units did not last as long as promised. Hewlett commissioned the study, but Consumer Reports magazine came to a similar conclusion last May. Testers there found that in almost all cases, the refilled cartridges cost as much or more when evaluated on their per-page output. Hewlett executives said that was because the company optimized each printer head  the strip of silicon containing the microscopic ink nozzles  for its printer, ink and paper. In its San Diego lab, "print head architects" use high-powered microscopes and cameras to watch the firing of those nozzles with various ink formulations made in three company labs to find the designs that work best. Lexmark International and Brother use similar printer-head technology on their cartridges. (Canon and Epson put their printer heads in the printer itself. Those companies did not respond to requests for interviews.) Hewlett makes printer heads for some of its commercial printers that can last five years in continuous use. But the company said that its consumer printer cartridges were designed to be disposable. A printer head lasts just long enough to jettison that last drop of ink, a company official said. Cartridge refillers have a differing opinion. They say those cartridges can be used three to seven times. And they have built a $6.5 billion industry to prove it. "It creates an opportunity for us," said Burt Yarkin, the chief executive for the United States operations of Cartridge World, which has 1,100 stores worldwide, 350 of them in the United States. He says a refilled cartridge drives down the cost of making a color print at home to about 13 cents a print, less than most retail photofinishers charge. The refillers have put a dent in the printer makers' business.

The company said it earned $345.6 million, or 34 cents a share, in the three months ended Nov. 30, up from $328.6 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the expensing of stock options, Walgreen said it would have earned 36 cents a share. Revenue at the company, which is the nation's largest drugstore chain in terms of sales, grew 10 percent, to $10.9 billion, from $9.89 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 7.2 percent for the period. Profit was better than the 33 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial, but sales were just short of the $11.02 billion expected. Walgreen's stock, which gained 15 percent in 2005, rose $1.16, to $45.42 a share. Walgreen said prescription revenue, which accounts for about 65 percent of its sales, rose 10 percent over all and almost 8 percent at stores open at least a year. The company said its profit margin increased slightly to about 27.5 percent of sales because of growth in generic drug sales, though that was partly offset by a shift to products with lower profit margins outside its pharmacy operations. Walgreen said the lower-priced generic drugs also "slowed the company's sales line." Expenses for selling, occupancy and administration increased slightly. The company, which is based in Deerfield, attributed that to expensing of stock options, higher store salaries and the absence of a gain from litigation settlements that occurred in the previous year.

To keep morale up, leaders showered shoplifters with perks, from free transportation to bail money, as needed. Well-organized groups like the Ghali gang have operated for years, and, according to an estimate from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, losses from organized retail theft have reached as much as $30 billion. But retailers have just begun to recognize that the teenager who shoplifts a candy bar or a pair of jeans is no longer their biggest nemesis, and they are now coordinating efforts to combat organized gangs. Major retailers ranging from the Gap and Sears to Walgreens and Wal-Mart are quietly developing national crime databases to compile evidence from shoplifting incidents; one such database will begin operating this month. The industry is hoping that the information will help federal investigators build legal cases against suspected theft rings. Retailers said the databases, an unusual collaboration in a fiercely competitive industry, should eliminate the biggest hole in their security systems: a failure to share information. Secrecy surrounding a chain's losses from theft, even how it protects against shoplifting, is a powerful tradition in retailing. But it has also proved to be a boon to organized shoplifting teams, which can strike dozens of retailers in a given area without fear that the stores will realize they are the victims of an organized attack. "We feel like we're sharing the same criminals, but we don't know about it," said Daniel J. Doyle, vice president of loss prevention at Beall's, a department store chain based in Florida that has helped develop one of the databases. Three retailing industry trade groups are building the databases. One is the National Retail Federation in Washington, which represents thousands of chains from Federated Department Stores to Crate &amp; Barrel, whose database goes on line this month; another is the Retail Industry Leaders Association in Arlington, Va., which focuses on discount retailers like Wal-Mart and Target. Its database is scheduled to begin operating early next year. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores, in Alexandria, Va., which represents pharmacies, started its database last year. Joseph J. LaRocca, vice president of loss prevention at the National Retail Federation, said the rush to develop the databases suggested that the problem of organized retail crime had "been pushed up to the front burner across the industry." Unlike conventional shoplifters, who take merchandise for personal use, organized rings sell the products at flea markets, online and, in some cases, right back to the same national retailers from which they originally stole. The groups focus on a shopping list of products, and aim at retailers that have traditionally had less security than jewelry and electronics stores. Among the most sought-after items are Enfamil infant formula, Oil of Olay skin products, Pepcid heartburn medicine and Gillette shaving products. The Ghali organization operated much like the retailers it preyed on, court papers suggest. It had a chief executive (Mr. Ghali), a chief financial officer (his wife), a business manager (his ex-wife) and an executive officer (his brother). Using word of mouth, the group recruited more than 100 shoplifters in the Dallas area, investigators said, and members stole an estimated $5 million in merchandise from Target, Wal-Mart and Walgreens before the ring was broken up in 2003. The group rented vans to take shoplifters to stores, developed a system to remove security devices from products and shipped stolen products across the country using Federal Express, according to court records and interviews with investigators. Federal investigators say the gang was broken up only when several shoplifters agreed to become informers, allowing the authorities to infiltrate the group and record its activities. Mr. Ghali was convicted and sentenced in 2005 to 14 years in federal prison. Seven other members of the organization pleaded guilty. But the retailing executives who are building the databases complain that, in general, law enforcement agencies have been slow to recognize the shift to a professional class of thieves.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/business/15health.html?ref=walgreencompany">In Switch, Insurer Lets Stores Fill 90-Day Prescriptions<date>Published: April 15, 2005</date><text>lue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota said yesterday that it was encouraging its members to buy their 90-day prescriptions for chronic problems at retail stores, bucking a national trend among health plans of forcing workers to order drugs from mail-order pharmacies to cut costs. Some consumers have complained that mail ordering is not as safe or convenient as shopping at a local pharmacy, while local drugstores have been struggling to cope with the loss of business. Under the Minnesota Blue Cross plan, a quiet experiment until now that some industry specialists say could become a national model, participating employers will get the same discounted prices for three-month prescriptions that are filled in stores as they would by mail. That is a significant change for employers, which pay most of the drug costs for their insured employees. Patients may end up paying for the convenience, though. The in-store co-payments on some long-term prescriptions may be slightly higher than through the mail, Blue Cross officials said. A return to in-store prescriptions "is the beginning of a trend," said Al Heaton, director of pharmacy for Minnesota Blue Cross. Insurers have typically continued to permit short-term prescriptions to be filled at neighborhood pharmacies. For financial reasons, there has been pressure in recent years to force patients with chronic conditions who require repeated refills to seek the discounts that 90-day prescriptions and high-volume mail-order pharmacies can offer. But Mr. Heaton said that demand was growing for 90-day prescriptions that can be filled at stores and that it was certain to accelerate next year, when a new Medicare drug benefit takes effect. Under that new benefit, participants will be assured of in-store access to 90-day batches of drugs for chronic conditions, like Lipitor to lower cholesterol and insulin to treat diabetes. Industry executives expect many insurers to follow Medicare's lead. "People really prefer retail pharmacy over mail," said Mary Ann Wagner, president of Pharmacy Care Alliance, a pharmacy chains' group that sponsors one of the Medicare drug discount cards already available as a prelude to next year's Medicare coverage. "People using the card can fill prescriptions by mail or in stores, with no financial incentive either way," she said. "Only two-tenths of a percent choose mail. The rest have gone to community pharmacists." Drugstores may be required to lower their own prices to participate in the Minnesota Blue Cross program and compete with the mail-order discounts. But many are willing to do that, rather than lose the long-term business altogether. Target, which is based in Minnesota, has made the Blue Cross program available in its pharmacies since February. "We are providing extra convenience," said Paula Thornton-Greear, a spokeswoman for Target. "It has proven very popular," she said, in part because customers can obtain advice from pharmacists. About one-third of the 900 pharmacies in Minnesota are participating, and a spokesman for Walgreen said it expected to add the 90-day Blue Cross program next month at its 97 Minnesota stores. Walgreen also has its own in-store program, with 140 employers as customers. National Blue Cross officials said that Blue Cross plans in Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee, Kansas and Wyoming were also experimenting with 90-day retail programs. Illinois Blue Cross and Blue Shield offers a 90-day store program to 850,000 people in health maintenance organizations. Michigan Blue Cross, which covers 4.8 million people, is testing a store program and expects to offer it statewide by the end of the year, said Helen Stojic, a spokeswoman for the Michigan plan. Spokesmen for the mail-order pharmacy industry said mail still offered the largest savings in drug costs. "This is a test in the marketplace, and we will see if it works," said Mark Merritt, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a trade group of pharmacy benefit companies. "We're confident of our model," he said. Mail-order drug purchases have grown to 17 percent of prescriptions, said Jon Schommer, a researcher in the Prime Institute in the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy. Pharmacy benefit managers like Medco Health Solutions, Caremark Rx and Express Scripts, which handle employers' drug plans, say mail sales are among their most profitable units. "The cost difference between retail and mail is 8 or 9 percent," said Tom Dickman, president and chief executive of Prime Therapeutics, a nonprofit drug benefits company owned by nine Blue Cross plans. "We assume that retail stores are willing to take lower profit margins as a competitive response to mandatory mail programs," he said. Robert Passavanti, pharmacy director of Coborn's, a Minnesota grocery chain based in St. Cloud, said the store's reimbursement from Blue Cross was "pretty down low." He added: "We signed it simply so we wouldn't lose customers for groceries. I'm selling my drugs at cost or below."</text></article>

The cost of converting photo-processing labs to a digital format partly offset continued strength in pharmacy sales and a solid holiday shopping season at the company, one of the nation's largest drugstore chains. Profit for the December-February period, the company's second quarter, was $490.9 million, or 48 cents a share, up from $431.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Advertisement Excluding a gain of $4.7 million from litigation settlements, earnings were $487.9 million, or 47 cents a share - a penny below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Walgreen's shares fell $1.12, or 2.4 percent, to $45.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock price remains near its 52-week high of $46.75. "Our conversion to more efficient digital photo labs doesn't come cheap," Walgreen's director of finance and assistant treasurer, Rick J. Hans, said in a recorded statement on the company's Web site. He said higher costs included those for retiring leases on old analog labs and higher payroll expenses from bringing nearly all photo-finishing work into the store. Walgreen also said brisker sales of lower-priced generic drugs damped sales growth, although that helped increase profit margins because the company receives a bigger percentage of each generic prescription sale. Increased sales of higher-priced digital photo finishing and improved purchasing also helped margins, Mr. Hans said. Sales increased 12.3 percent, to $11 billion, which was in line with analysts' estimates. Comparable sales, or revenue from stores open at least a year, grew 7.7 percent. Pharmacy sales, which total 61.2 percent of overall revenue, grew 13.8 percent. Comparable prescription sales were up 10 percent. Eric Bosshard, an analyst at FTN Midwest Research, said Walgreen had a "very solid quarter" despite increased expenses. The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., opened 178 stores in the first six months of its fiscal 2005, which was 38 more than in the year-earlier period. It expects to open 450 stores during the year, for a net gain of 365 stores after closings.</text></article>

The better-than-expected results from the fiscal first quarter sent Walgreen's stock price surging to its highest level since 2002. Shares rose $2.01, or 5.2 percent, to close at $40.38 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, nearly matching its 5 percent increase for all of 2004. Net earnings for the quarter, which ended in November, were $332.7 million, or 32 cents a share, up from $254.9 million, or 25 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Excluding a pretax gain of $15 million from legal settlements, earnings were 31 cents a share, or 2 cents higher than the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Revenues increased 13.4 percent, to $9.9 billion from $8.7 billion. Prescription sales, which accounted for 65 percent of company sales, climbed 14.4 percent while prescription sales in comparable stores rose 11.3 percent. "Earnings this quarter were powered by solid prescription and general merchandise sales, as well as our second straight quarter of significantly higher gross profit margins," said the chief executive, Dave Bernauer. The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., also attributed increased profits to better purchasing terms as well as the digital photofinishing services. Mitchell P. Corwin, an analyst at Morningstar, said in a note to investors that while Walgreen's growth continued to be "relatively unabated" by competitive threats, the results appeared to show growth in prescription drug sales slowing as a result of more use of mandatory mail order and the rising costs of health care and prescription drugs.</text></article>

American Express cards account for ''a small fraction of Walgreen total credit card transactions,'' Walgreen said. The company, based in Deerfield, Ill., operates 4,681 stores. American Express has not raised its rates since Walgreen began accepting the card in 1996, but purchases on American Express are not ''significantly larger than the average customer'' and do not offset the fees, a Walgreen spokesman, Michael Polzin, said. ''We hope Walgreen will reconsider,'' said Nancy Muller, a spokeswoman for American Express.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/28/business/28walgreen.html?ref=walgreencompany">Pharmacy Sales Bolster Walgreen Profits<date>Published: September 28, 2004</date><text>y Bloomberg News The Walgreen Company said yesterday that fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent, helped by prescription drug sales and digital-photo processing. Net income climbed to $327.2 million, or 32 cents a share, from $277.1 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier, its biggest gain in almost two years. Sales in the period, which ended Aug. 31, rose 14 percent, to $9.43 billion, Walgreen said. Sales of generic drugs, which are more profitable than name-brand prescriptions, increased as Walgreen started selling a generic version of the thyroid medication Synthroid, one of the most-prescribed drugs in the United States. About half of all prescriptions filled at Walgreen are for generic drugs, the company said. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 9.7 percent, including a 13 percent increase in pharmacy sales. Sales of nonpharmacy goods rose 5.1 percent. Prescriptions accounted for 63 percent of sales in fiscal 2004. Walgreen's gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold, widened to 27.7 percent of sales. Digital-photo finishing contributed significantly to the gross-margin increase for general merchandise. The company added more than 600 digital labs in the fourth quarter and 2,900 during the year, a spokesman, Michael Polzin, said.</text></article>

That was a penny higher than the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.Revenue was $9.6 billion, up 15 percent from $8.3 billion.''Strong sales, improved overall margins and good expense control combined for an excellent quarter,'' the chief executive, David W. Bernauer, said.Sales at stores open more than a year increased 10.4 percent over the year-earlier quarter, including 13.4 percent for prescription sales, which rose 17 percent overall.</text></article>

Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but Albertson's said that second-quarter profit would be reduced by 6 cents a share. The Walgreen Company will buy the prescription files of nine Osco drugstores in Omaha that are closing. No Frills Supermarkets and Bag 'n Save will buy a total of 11 Albertson's grocery stores in Bellevue and Grand Island, Neb., as well as in Omaha. Hy-Vee agreed to buy one Osco drugstore in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Billings were estimated at $125 million.Carol Hively, a spokeswoman at Walgreen in Deerfield, Ill., confirmed a report of the move on AdAge.com. Euro RSCG Chicago had handled the account since acquiring the previous Walgreen agency, McConnaughy Stein Schmidt Brown, in 2000. Although Walgreen parted ways with Euro RSCG Chicago in April, the company had not until now discussed a replacement.Euro RSCG Chicago, formerly Euro RSCG Tatham Partners, recently brought in two executives to help recover from the loss of most of its major clients, like Alberto-Culver, Red Lobster and Sara Lee.</text></article>

But Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said last week that he believed that passage of legislation to allow imports of lower-cost medicines was inevitable.Representative Gil Gutknecht, Republican of Minnesota, a supporter of drug imports, said on Monday: ''There's a lot of momentum in our direction. We are at the two-yard line.''He added: ''More and more governors are joining the team. Tommy Thompson has all but conceded that something will happen. It's time to open our markets and let Americans have access to world-class drugs at world market prices.''Two of the nation's largest pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, gave a qualified endorsement to the idea, saying commercial drug imports would be much safer than unregulated imports by individuals. And the attorneys general of 19 states pleaded with federal officials to permit imports of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration.''Either allow the states to be appointed as licensed wholesalers or allow the states to contract with licensed wholesalers for the importation of F.D.A.-approved prescription drugs from Canada,'' they said in a letter to Mr. Thompson.Under their proposal, states or their designated wholesalers would sign contracts with licensed Canadian pharmacies that met safety standards set by state health officials, and drugs would be shipped directly to the states.Insurers are also expressing interest. Dr. Alan M. Muney, executive vice president and chief medical officer of Oxford Health Plans, which insures 1.5 million people, said on Monday, ''We would strongly support importation of drugs,'' with safeguards of the type proposed in Congress.The new Medicare law bars the federal government from negotiating prices directly with drug makers on behalf of beneficiaries. But Dr. Muney said that ''importation would be an effective way for Medicare recipients, private health plans and employers to get lower drug costs,'' despite the statutory ban.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/23/business/higher-prescription-sales-lift-walgreen.html?ref=walgreencompany">Higher Prescription Sales Lift Walgreen<date>Published: March 23, 2004</date><text>Another quarter of soaring prescription drug sales lifted the Walgreen Company to a 17 percent increase in profit in the second quarter, the company said Monday.Walgreen's earnings came in slightly below Wall Street's high expectations and its stock fell. But the company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., continued to report strong pharmacy results in particular, with prescription sales rising 19 percent over the previous year's total to account for 60 percent of all sales.In a sign that not just new stores are fueling the growth, Walgreen said sales from stores open more than a year rose 15.5 percent for prescriptions and 11.5 percent over all. The company said increased investment in customer service drove up customer totals in established stores.Earnings for the three months that ended Feb. 29 were $433.5 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $370.9 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding drug antitrust litigation settlements, earnings were 41 cents a share, 1 cent lower than the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson First Call.Revenue was $9.78 billion, up 16 percent from $8.45 billion a year earlier.The company cited the prescription growth as justifying its heavy spending on new drugstores and 24-hour stores, most in prime but expensive locations. Walgreen has added 338 stores in the last year for a total of 4,336 in 44 states and Puerto Rico as of Feb. 29.Shares in the company fell 75 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $32.76.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/13/business/6-companies-are-planning-dual-listings.html?ref=walgreencompany">6 Companies Are Planning Dual Listings<date>Published: January 13, 2004</date><text>Six companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, including Hewlett-Packard and Charles Schwab, confirmed yesterday that they had decided to list their stocks on the Nasdaq market as well, increasing the competition between the two equity markets.Taking advantage of the dual-listing program, described by Nasdaq officials yesterday, Hewlett-Packard and Schwab were joined by the petroleum company Apache; the electronic design company Cadence Design Systems; the financial services company Countrywide Financial; and Walgreen, the drugstore retailer.Steve Thel, professor of securities law at Fordham Law School, said the move gave investors the opportunity to find the best price on the two different markets and gave the dual-listed companies a chance to increase their liquidity, or have more trades executed, because of Nasdaq's faster systems.''However, there's also a downside, in that if you don't have a critical mass of volume on one exchange, dual-listing with another could dilute your liquidity and make your stock difficult to move in either market,'' Professor Thel said. ''That said, I think a number of companies will look very closely at this option. If the liquidity adds up, you'll see more companies do this.''Nasdaq's dual-listing option is the latest round in the battle between the all-electronic market and the New York Stock Exchange, which has been criticized for both its governance and its older trading systems. Robert Greifeld, the chief executive of Nasdaq, said dual-listing could be a tool to entice companies to abandon the stock exchange entirely.''The recent issues with the New York Stock Exchange certainly are important, but that hasn't been central to our discussions with these companies,'' Mr. Greifeld said. ''Our discussions with them have been based on the performance of the market and on speed of execution, depth of liquidity and price discovery.'' Dismissing the threat of Nasdaq competition for its business, a spokesman for the Big Board, Robert Zito, said the exchange was always planning and constantly improving its market systems. He noted that while 80 percent of Big Board stocks trade on the exchange itself, 20 percent are already traded on other markets as well, including Nasdaq.</text></article>

''If the patient chooses to refill it at a retail pharmacy,'' Walgreen said, ''the insurance company won't provide coverage.''Sales of mail-order drugs grew 22 percent last year, twice as fast as overall medicine sales, according to the National Association of Drug Stores. Prescription sales in the United States increased 11.3 percent, to $183 billion in 2002. Mail order's $33.5 billion was about 18 percent of total sales.Walgreen said that existing agreements with health plans would be honored. It offers mail-order service through Walgreens Health Initiatives, its pharmacy benefits management service.</text></article>

But Ritz Camera has begun to sell (and in Wisconsin, Walgreens is test-marketing) a single-use digital camera that costs about as much as, and works like, a disposable film camera. The Ritz Dakota Digital and the Studio 35 Digital from Walgreens hold 25 pictures with a two-megapixel resolution, enough for enlargements of up to 8 by 10 inches. That capacity need not be wasted on bad shots; users can delete a picture if they suspect it is flawed, creating room for retakes.The economy comes at a price: there is no liquid crystal display on the camera to show what the pictures look like.Automatic exposure and flash controls eliminate some potential picture errors, though. A self-timer enables the photographer to run around in front of the camera to get into the picture.The camera costs $10.99, which includes a set of 4-by-6-inch prints, an index print showing thumbnails of all 25 shots, and a photo CD, allowing for further home or commercial printing. The CD also contains Mac and PC software for viewing, saving, printing or e-mailing photos, which need not be installed in the user's computer.Ritz (www.ritzcamera.com) has 1,200 locations around the country under the Ritz, Wolf, Kits, Inkleys, and Camera Shop names. Ivan BergerCorrection: August 2, 2003, Saturday A brief report in Circuits on Thursday about single-use digital cameras misstated their price at Walgreens stores in Wisconsin, where they are being test-marketed, and referred incorrectly to what the price includes. The Walgreens price is $9.99; $10.99 is the price of a comparable model at stores owned by Ritz Camera. The price includes only the camera; Ritz charges $10.99 more and Walgreens $9.99 more for a set of 4-by-6-inch prints, an index print of all 25 images, and a photo CD.</text></article>

''Please,'' whispered Clementine, my 4-year-old.''Show me your bug bites,'' I said suspiciously. Obediently, Clementine and her friend Alison held out their arms. Two tiny red bumps.''O.K., but don't go crazy with it,'' I said, handing them the calamine lotion through a crack in the door.''I won't,'' Clementine promised. An hour later, they were spotted down by the main lodge, two chalky-pink waifs who looked as if they had fallen into a mixing vat while touring a Pepto-Bismol factory. I found an empty lotion bottle floating in the lake, abandoned near the paddle boats.In our family, calamine lotion is a controlled substance. Certain people can't control themselves. Once I found ''C-L-e-M'' written on a wall in pink, like a scene from ''The Shining.'' Ever since the infamous Polka-Dot Fur incident, in which Clem menaced the cat with a soggy cotton swab, I have been forced to crack down.Last week, if I guarded all my drugstore supplies -- from rubbing alcohol to prescription drugs -- more closely than usual while we were on vacation in the Adirondacks, it was for good reason. We were about to embark on a cross-country move (all our household possessions, including the back-up cotton swabs, had already been loaded into a truck that was at that moment hurtling through Ohio) and I was in no mood to run out of anything I had deemed important enough to earn a spot in my precious carry-on cache.If pressed, I would admit that it wouldn't have been a big deal to replace items like calamine lotion at any old brick-and-mortar drugstore after I got to my new town. But transferring the refills on prescription drugs might be another story. That task loomed as one of the zillions of tedious move-related chores that had me tossing and turning in bed at 2 a.m.So before going on vacation, I decided to test three online pharmacies -- at Walgreens.com, CVS.com and Drugstore.com -- to see if they would remove the stress from the process. All three Internet sites offered a range of services; they all accept insurance and charge the customer the appropriate co-payment. All three will send, through the mail, new prescriptions and refills. And atWalgreens.com and CVS.com, customers may also choose to pick up prescriptions ordered online at any of the companies' stores.</text></article>

A spokesman for Lilly, Austin Blair, said the company was unaware of the new incident.''We are investigating the Florida matter vigorously and are taking appropriate action,'' Mr. Blair said. ''We continue to believe that this is a very, very isolated incident.''The hand-addressed envelope to Michael bore the return address of a Walgreens drugstore in West Palm Beach. It contained a one-month supply of Prozac Weekly and a ''Dear Patient'' form letter ostensibly from a doctor who practiced in a medical group that treated Michael, but was not known to the Grinsteds.''I'm sending you a new one-month prescription of Prozac Weekly, which is the new and only antidepressant indicated for the maintenance phase of depression,'' the form letter said. The name on the letter was Dr. Jeff Bishop.The Grinsteds say Michael has never suffered from depression or taken any drug like Prozac. Dr. Bishop did not return a call for comment.The Grinsteds said they might join a class-action lawsuit that a 59-year-old woman filed this month in state court in Fort Lauderdale against Lilly, the Walgreen Company and several doctors.The suit says the defendants misused patients' medical records and invaded their privacy. It also contends that the drugstore chain and Lilly engaged in the unauthorized practice of medicine.Michael Polzin, a spokesman for the Walgreen Company, said it apologized to people who received unsolicited drugs. In this case, Mr. Polzin said, the pharmacy simply carried out the doctor's instructions, after confirming with him that every patient was taking antidepressants.</text></article>

It came from a Walgreens drugstore not far from here, and there was a ''Dear Patient'' form letter inside.''Enclosed you will find a free one month trial of Prozac Weekly,'' it said. ''Congratulations on being one step to full recovery.''The mailing infuriated one recipient, a 59-year-old home caregiver who filed a class-action lawsuit this week in state court here.''They're going after me because I have a problem,'' said the caregiver, who agreed to an interview in her lawyer's office here on the condition that her name be withheld. ''It bothers me to think that somebody could get into my medical records and start sending me dangerous medications.''The suit says Walgreens, a local hospital, three doctors and Eli Lilly, which makes Prozac, misused patients' medical records and invaded their privacy. It also accused the drugstore and Lilly of engaging in the unauthorized practice of medicine.The plaintiffs' lawyers said they did not know how many people received the mailings. ''It could be anywhere from several dozen to several thousand,'' said Gary M. Farmer Jr., one of the lawyers.The suit seeks an unspecified amount of money and an injunction to prohibit further mailings.Legal experts said that sending drugs through the mail could be criminal if the recipient does not have a prescription. How privacy law applies to medical records used in marketing is an open question.A Lilly spokeswoman said that sending unsolicited drugs through the mail was against company policy and inappropriate. ''While Lilly supports informing people about new treatment options and encouraging them to discuss these options with their doctor, what occurred in Florida appears to go beyond this,'' the spokeswoman, Debbie Davis, said.Experts in medical privacy have been critical of mailings of targeted marketing materials based on information in patients' pharmaceutical and medical records. They say the mailing of drugs is an unwelcome innovation.''This is appalling in every possible way,'' said David L. Pearle, a professor of medicine at Georgetown University. ''It's an escalation of a deplorable practice.''Joy Pritts, senior counsel at the Health Privacy Project in Washington, said that ''this is one step beyond what we normally see.''

''We're not a religion. We're not here for charity purposes. We've got to make a profit or we can't stay open.''When pharmacists fill prescriptions for Medicaid patients, states pay them the cost of the drug plus a flat fee. But health care costs are soaring even as the recession forces states to cut their budgets. Medicaid consumes 20 percent of the average state budget.Gov. Gary Locke of Washington has proposed the sharpest cut so far, a $71 million reduction to the $361 million budgeted for the current two-year fiscal cycle.Other states that have made reductions or are considering them include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Virginia.The inspector general for the federal Health and Human Services Department nudged states toward the idea last August with a report warning that they were overestimating wholesale drug prices and overpaying pharmacists by more than $1 billion a year. The report recommended cutting pharmacy payments by about 10 percent. Pharmacy groups attacked the study as flawed.Representatives of CVS and Walgreens, the nation's largest drugstore chains, with a combined 7,700 stores, said they might reduce hours, close stores and stop expansion in states that deeply cut Medicaid pharmacy payments. Rite Aid and Albertsons said they might drop Medicaid completely in those states.''We're going to have to re-evaluate our participation in Medicaid,'' said Karen Rugen, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, which has 3,600 stores in 29 states. ''We believe everyone should have access to medical care. It's just hard to do it below your costs.''Independent drugstore owners are even more alarmed. State health administrators, including Doug Porter, the Medicaid director of Washington, say they do not believe that cuts will devastate pharmacists.Acknowledging that the intent was to cut the druggists' margins ''to the bone,'' Mr. Porter added: ''At least in theory, we should not be putting them below cost. I would be shocked to see any serious number of pharmacies not participating.''State officials said pharmacies should instead drive harder bargains with health plans, wholesalers and manufacturers.Pharmacists want states to find other cost-cutting options. Many states are encouraging doctors to prescribe less expensive generics. States are also trying to negotiate better deals from drug makers.Consumers and pharmacists have beaten back some proposals to cut Medicaid pharmacy payments. In Illinois, the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a successful campaign to scale back cuts after Walgreens threatened to reduce store hours in poor Chicago neighborhoods. Proposals in New York and Oregon were also defeated. Indiana pharmacists are challenging a fee reduction in court.</text></article>

Prescriptions accounted for 60 percent of Walgreen's sales in the quarter, up 22 percent from a year earlier.In an indication that growth has continued into this quarter, the company, based in Deerfield, Ill., announced separately that December sales totaled $2.8 billion, up 14 percent from the previous December.''The nature of our business -- selling basic goods that everyone needs -- gives us the chance to perform well despite the current recession and tough retail environment,'' said the chairman, Dan Jorndt. ''It also means we will continue as planned with our expansion program.''Walgreen said its 475 new stores in fiscal 2002 would entail 14,000 new jobs, $1.3 billion in capital spending and two new distribution centers.An analyst, Derek Leckow of Barrington Research Associates, based in Chicago, said the results showed that Walgreen's continuing expansion was paying off in higher sales and increased market share.''We think that's a good strategy,'' Mr. Leckow said, ''given that some of their competitors -- primarily CVS and Rite Aid -- are facing capital constraints and issues related to the pharmacist shortage. It seems to me that Walgreen is doing a better job recruiting and getting its pharmacies better staffed.''</text></article>

Sales in stores open at least a year rose 9 percent. Pharmacy sales, which account for nearly 60 percent of Walgreen's revenues, increased 19 percent. Same-store pharmacy sales climbed 16 percent. Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said last month that sales of items other than prescription drugs slowed somewhat this spring. Sales for the first half of 2001 were $12.3 billion, up 17 percent from a year ago, the company said. Walgreen shares rose 10 cents, to $34.10.</text></article>

There are two known instances of the device overheating and melting, but no reports of injuries.The 9,000 trees, three feet tall with fiberoptic lights, candles and a star topper, come from the Walgreen Company of Deerfield, Ill.The 50,000 sets of miniature Christmas lights and icicle-style lights were sold in New York by GEM Stores from November to December.The lights have undersize wires that can pull out of the plugs and light sockets, posing the danger of electric shock and fires. No injuries were reported.About 12,000 sets of miniature Christmas lights by Sun Sun Industries Inc. of Carlstadt, N.J., and 2,600 sets of lights by Pioneer Paper Company of New York are also being recalled because of potential electric shocks and fires.</text></article>

Currently, Walgreen's Internet presence is limited to refilling prescriptions.The chain, based in Deerfield, Ill., said its new Internet pharmacy would be tightly integrated with its retail stores and would allow patients to view their prescription history on line at a password-protected area. Patients will be able to receive their prescriptions by mail or pick them up at drugstores. Walgreen said the company currently received about 1,400 requests daily for refills via the Internet.Also today, Walgreen said third-quarter profit surged 25 percent, to $159.3 million, or 16 cents a shares, from $125.9 million, or 13 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts polled by the First Call Corporation had predicted 15 cents a share. Revenue climbed to $4.6 billion in the latest period, up from $3.9 billion a year ago.Walgreen's shares were up $1.4375, to $29, on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/18/business/cvs-makes-an-internet-move-purchasing-an-on-line-drugstore.html?ref=walgreencompany">CVS Makes an Internet Move, Purchasing an On-Line Drugstore<date>Published: May 18, 1999</date><text>In a move that could signal tough competition for on-line pharmacies, the CVS Corporation said yesterday that it had purchased Soma.com, the first Internet drugstore, for $30 million in CVS stock.The deal, expected to close next month, gives CVS a head start over other established drugstore chains like the Walgreen Company and Rite Aid that have yet to bring their offerings fully on line, analysts said. Still, they added, the low price is an indication of the slow progress on-line pharmacies have made.''It is a major victory for brick-and-mortar retailing, that a dot.com company doesn't believe its business model is viable enough,'' said Mark Husson, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''Either CVS has gotten the biggest bargain in history, or these on-line drugstores aren't worth very much as stand-alone pharmacies.''Larry Zigerelli, executive vice president of corporate development for CVS, said the company bought Soma for the same price it would have paid to build its own site.Tom Pigott, chief executive of Soma, said the deal represented ''a winning combination, out of necessity.'' For one thing, he said, Internet pharmacies have been unable to join many insurance networks that cover prescription medications. As a result, no on-line pharmacy can guarantee that all customers will have their prescriptions covered.Many insurers hire outside companies to handle mail-order subscription refills, which account for roughly 15 percent of the estimated $100 billion prescription market. Since on-line pharmacies basically perform the same type of service, some insurers have balked at the competition. Mr. Pigott said that some insurers ''have told us they have their own plans for going on line, and that has made things very difficult.''Just as with traditional pharmacies, prescriptions are the linchpin of successful on-line drugstore, since they attract customers who then buy other items. Indeed, Soma and rivals like Drugstore.com and Planetrx have projected that a large chunk of total revenues will come from nonprescription items.With or without the insurers, on-line pharmacies face fierce competition in CVS, which says it has more than 55 million prescription customers and more than 9,000 insurance providers. That means nearly all insured customers who visit the Soma site will have their prescriptions covered. CVS's marketing and buying power will also insure that it can survive price competitions with Internet rivals.</text></article>

Daniel Jorndt, the chief executive of the Walgreen Company, wanted to know how big the parking lot was at a rival Wal-Mart store, he had a look for himself.''The store is 440 yards away, a quarter of a mile'' from where he parked his car, he exclaimed in a recent interview at the Walgreen headquarters in this Chicago suburb. ''I've paced it myself.''Mr. Jorndt, who is 57, is far from intimidated by the vastness of Wal-Mart stores and their parking lots. On the contrary, he aims to turn their size to his advantage by emphasizing the convenience of ducking into the corner Walgreens for small purchases. Indeed, convenience is why his company is pushing to install drive-through pharmacies at its 2,600 outlets.But as his inspection of the Wal-Mart lot shows, he believes that attention to detail is the key to making that strategy work. Never mind that Walgreen is the nation's largest drugstore chain, with more than 90,000 employees and $15 billion in revenue. Name any major city, and Mr. Jorndt can tell you exactly where the Walgreens are found, or not found, and why. One possible location in Rye, N.Y., didn't make the cut because of concerns over a nearby traffic signal. ''That light was just too slow,'' he said. ''By the time it turned, people would have decided to go elsewhere.'' (The light stayed red for 90 seconds; he wanted 30.)A pharmacist who rose through the ranks at the company, Mr. Jorndt does not favor blurry vision or blurry language. He is crisp, clear and direct. Occasionally, he pounds his fist on the desk to emphasize a point. He says things like: ''The groceries can't fight Wal-Mart,'' ''We want to be on the right side of the street'' and ''The strip center is dead.''He is dead serious about that last point; his company is pulling out of such malls, creating free-standing stores that are part drugstore, part food mart. The new format will let it better compete with CVS and Rite Aid drugstores.Mr. Jorndt's office reflects his penchant for precision. His desk looks as though it is polished hourly. Gracing the bookshelves are photographs of his wife, Patricia, and their three children -- as well as one of Michael Jordan.</text></article>

Analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation had predicted profits of 18 cents a share for the quarter, compared with 15 cents a share in the period a year earlier.

Those duties had been handled by the company's in-house agency, CRK Advertising.The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Zenith; Ammirati Puris Lintas, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Bozell Worldwide, part of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt. Media services for the Americas, and worldwide creative, stay at CRK.The Walgreen Company in Deerfield, Ill., divided television and radio buying duties on its account, with billings estimated at $60 million, between the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, for national television, and Advanswers in St. Louis, owned by the Wells Rich Greene BDDP unit of GGT Group, for spot television and radio. Those duties had been divided between Advanswers and CPM in Chicago, which did not participate in a review.Adidas America in Portland, Ore., named the San Francisco office of Leagas Delaney to handle the media part of its account, with billings estimated at $20 million. Those duties had been handled by Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., a unit of Cordiant that had also handled the creative duties before they, too, were shifted to Leagas Delaney.And Chef America Inc. in Englewood, Colo., selected RPM in Santa Monica, Calif., the broadcast media buying division of Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates, to handle national network, cable and syndicated television buying on its account, with estimated billings of $10 million to $12 million.

The results matched analysts' expectations.Revenue rose 12 percent, to $2.81 billion, from $2.50 billion a year earlier, led by a 20 percent increase in pharmacy sales. Pharmacy sales in stores open at least a year rose 14 percent.Walgreen said improved cost controls contributed to the better earnings. Store salaries fell in proportion to sales, and the company said it cut its newspaper circulars to one a week from two in many markets, with no loss of sales.It did not disclose its gross profit margin, but a spokesman, Thomas Mammoser, said drugstores had generally faced pressure on their margins from third-party customers, like companies and health maintenance organizations, which use their buying power to demand lower prices.He added, "What we're doing with third parties is we're drawing a line in the sand, saying we're not going to do business and lose money, and essentially that program is working for us."Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., said it planned to open 200 drugstores this fiscal year, with a goal of 3,000 by the end of the decade.</text></article>

Walgreen's expense ratio declined, with selling, general and administrative costs falling to 24 percent of net sales from 24.5 percent a year ago.Revenue increased 14 percent, to $2.41 billion, from $2.12 billion a year earlier. About half the increase came from a 7.8 percent rise in sales at stores open at least a year. Such sales are considered a good measure of a retailer's performance.The rest of the revenue rise came from expansion, as Walgreen stores increased to 2,018 as of Dec. 31 from 1,892 stores a year earlier. The company picked up the pace of expansion in the latest quarter, opening 54 stores.</text></article>

The company, based in Deerfield, Ill., said net income rose to $69.1 million, or 56 cents a share, from $58.3 million, or 47 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier.The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was that the company would earn 53 cents a share.Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 31 rose 12 percent, to $2.28 billion from $2.04 billion. Pharmacy sales increased by 20 percent.Pharmacy revenue now accounts for 41 percent of the company's total. That will increase to 50 percent by the end of the decade, the company said. To handle the growth, Walgreen said it was upgrading its systems in its pharmacies, beginning in April.Walgreen opened a record 196 stores in the fiscal year, and it plans to open 200 stores in fiscal 1995. The company said it planned to "continue this aggressive expansion rate for the rest of the decade.".Big new markets include the Cleveland-Akron-Canton area of Ohio, with 15 stores by November; Buffalo, with 4 to 5 stores by Christmas, and Philadelphia, with 25 to 30 stores, the first of which will open in the fall of 1995.Over the last five years, Walgreen has invested more than $1 billion in new and remodeled stores, advanced systems and distribution centers.
