Hansen examined the role of good and bad fortune in business giants’ success: I like to compare tennis to real life. When you first see a good tennis player beat another champion, you begin to think he was lucky. An inch here, an inch there, and that’s it. When the same player beats another champion, you may still call it luck. But when he beats almost everybody and becomes No. 1 in the world, you have to conclude that it’s tremendous skill. And so it is with people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs — as well as many others who aren’t necessarily as successful but who are still achieving very remarkable things. Humanity’s progress has not been a succession of lucky events. It is attributable to some enlightened leaders who ultimately led the world in the right direction. George Naniche Moraga, Calif., Oct. 31 • To the Editor: The article argued that luck did not cause Bill Gates’s success. But it did not note this “luck event”: I.B.M.’s decision, back in Microsoft’s early days, to license DOS for running royalties, rather than buying it outright. I.B.M. had the resources to buy it, but underestimated the PC’s eventual importance. If I.B.M. had bought DOS, I.B.M. would have earned the recurring profits that instead flowed to Microsoft. Rob Kunstadt Manhattan, Oct. 30 The writer is an intellectual-property lawyer. • To the Editor: The analysis of luck’s role in highly successful businesses reminded me of the wisdom of Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers general manager who signed Jackie Robinson and thus integrated Major League Baseball. In “Branch Rickey’s Little Blue Book,” these memorable words are noted: “Things worthwhile generally just don’t happen. Luck is a fact, but should not be a factor. Good luck is what is left over after intelligence and effort have combined at their best.” “Luck,” he added, “is the residue of design.” Amy S.

Opel, Who Made I.B.M. a Colossus, Dies at 86<date>Published: November 4, 2011</date><text>John R. Opel, who presided over I.B.M. in its final period of dominance in the information-processing industry and oversaw the company’s move into personal computers, died on Thursday in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 86.His death was confirmed by Jeff Wickham, a son-in-law, who declined to disclose the cause. Mr. Opel (pronounced OH-pel) joined I.B.M. as a salesman in 1949, as the computer age was just dawning, and served as the company’s chief executive from January 1981 until January 1985. A year after he took the top post, the Department of Justice dropped its 13-year-old antitrust lawsuit against I.B.M., freeing the company to compete more aggressively. Compete it did. Revenue nearly doubled during Mr. Opel’s tenure, to the point that by the end of it, competitors were publicly complaining that I.B.M. was too powerful. In 1983, Time magazine featured Mr. Opel on its cover with the headline “The Colossus That Works.” But things changed soon after Mr. Opel left office. In the late 1980s and early ’90s, I.B.M. went through a painful period of cutbacks as the computer business underwent huge changes. Small computers based on microprocessors and using standardized software increasingly took over from centralized machines using proprietary hardware and software, I.B.M.’s stock in trade. I.B.M. itself helped spur the shift when it introduced its first personal computer in 1981, a project started under the previous chief executive, Frank T. Cary, but completed by Mr. Opel. I.B.M. did not design everything itself. In an effort to make an inexpensive machine that could get to market quickly, it used a microprocessor from Intel and operating system software from Microsoft. The machine was a hit, making desktop computing acceptable to corporate America and becoming the industry standard. But competitors realized they could essentially make copies of the machine using Intel chips and Microsoft software. The power in the computer industry shifted to Intel and Microsoft, and hardware became a low-price commodity. I.B.M. eventually sold its PC business and some other hardware operations, and now focuses on software and services. John Roberts Opel was born on Jan 5, 1925, in Kansas City, Mo., and grew up in Jefferson City, Mo., where his father ran a hardware store. He majored in English at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., fought in the Philippines and in Okinawa in World War II and earned a master’s of business administration degree from the University of Chicago in 1949. Mr. Opel then weighed two job offers — one to rewrite economics textbooks and the other to take over his father’s hardware business, according to an appreciation of Mr. Opel that I.B.M. posted on its Web site. To mull things over, he took a fishing trip with his father and a family friend. The friend happened to work for I.B.M., and he offered Mr. Opel a job as a salesman in central Missouri. At the time, in 1949, I.B.M. was selling electric typewriters and accounting equipment and just starting to introduce electronic calculating machines. In 1959, Mr. Opel became an executive assistant to Thomas J. Watson Jr., the company’s chief executive. He rose rapidly, taking positions in manufacturing and public relations, among other departments. He managed the introduction of the seminal System 360 mainframe computer in 1964. Mr. Opel was often viewed as the quintessential I.B.M. man, adhering to the company’s deep traditions with his emphasis on the customer and impeccable dress and a certain reticence with outsiders. “He was a very client-centric, client-focused person,” said Nicholas M. Donofrio, a former executive vice president at the company. “He would constantly remind us of that.” But I.B.M. also began departing from tradition under Mr. Opel. In addition to introducing a personal computer, the company moved into telecommunications, in part through the acquisition of the equipment maker Rolm. It acquired a stake in Intel, mainly to shore up Intel against Japanese competition. And it revamped its own manufacturing to allow it to compete better against the Japanese. Time magazine’s article in 1983 quoted an I.B.M. board member as describing Mr. Opel as “plain vanilla, but good plain vanilla.” He rarely granted interviews or spoke about his private life. But insiders said he was thoughtful and well read. “He was as much at home in bird watching and poetry as he was in managing the boardroom,” said Patrick A. Toole, a former senior vice president. After stepping down as I.B.M.’s chief executive, Mr. Opel remained chairman until May 1986 and a board member until 1993. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Carole; five children, Robert, Julie Conlee, John E., Nancy Wickham and Mary Porteus; and 15 grandchildren.John R. Opel, who presided over I.B.M. in its final period of dominance in the information-processing industry and oversaw the company’s move into personal computers, died on Thursday in Fort Myers, Fla.

Palmisano spoke Wednesday at Columbia Business School. I.B.M. finished off its string of 100th anniversary events on Wednesday evening, with a lecture by the company’s chairman and chief executive, Samuel J. Palmisano. He spoke at Columbia University, an apt location. Thomas J. Watson Jr. gave a talk at Columbia to observe the company’s 50th anniversary, Thomas Watson Sr. was a Columbia trustee, and I.B.M.’s storied research labs had their origins at Columbia with the Thomas J. Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau in 1937. Mr. Palmisano’s talk, before a few hundred people in a lecture hall at the Columbia Business School, echoed and cited Mr. Watson’s speech from the early 1960s, noting how few of the largest companies are still leaders decades later and often are not even around. Mr. Watson said that “corporations are expendable, and that success — at best — is an achievement that can always slip out of hand.” The I.B.M. lesson, Mr. Palmisano said, is never become wedded to what you make, but to the values the corporation stands for. After all, I.B.M. started out making clocks, scales, punched card tabulators, and cheese slicers (“the world’s fastest at the time,” he noted). “The history of business is a bone pile of companies that had an extraordinary initial success,” Mr. Palmisano said, “but were unable to achieve a second act.” Mostly, he added, the bone pile companies “could not get beyond an emotional attachment to the past.” The enduring corporate values Mr. Palmisano had in mind were not ethics or corporate responsibility, though those are certainly values, but a company’s lasting goals — in I.B.M.’s case, satisfying customer needs, building long-term relationships and pursuing breakthrough innovations. That mentality, and not a commitment to products, made it easier for I.B.M. to sell off its hard disk drive and personal computer businesses — even though, Mr. Palmisano said, I.B.M.’s Thinkpad notebook was “by any measure the most recognizable brand for us,” used by millions of people. But I.B.M., which spends $6 billion a year on research and development, is ill-suited for low-margin businesses. “We knew that the emerging computing model was commoditizing the PC industry,” Mr. Palmisano said. “And that’s not where we wanted to be.” IBMThomas J. Watson Jr. reminded an audience at Columbia that success can quickly slip away. In the question-and-answer session after the lecture, Mr. Palmisano was asked about the essential characteristics for a leader. First and foremost, he replied, “You need a clear point of view as to what the future holds.” When he became chief executive in 2002, Mr. Palmisano and his senior staff members identified three key trends: the end of the PC era of computing, globalization of technology production and adoption, and a shift in value away from making hardware and software to using technology to help corporations solve business problems. The clear view of the future sounds a lot like vision. Recall that Mr. Palmisano’s predecessor, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., said shortly after he arrived in 1993: “The last thing I.B.M. needs now is a vision.” But times changed, and Mr. Palmisano had the luxury of taking the long view because I.B.M., under Mr. Gerstner, had been restored to financial health. As he was finishing, Mr. Palmisano introduced his recently named successor, Virginia Rometty, who will be the ninth chief executive in the company’s 100-year history and was in the audience. He always saw himself, Mr. Palmisano said, as the “temporary steward of great enterprise,” coming to work every day to try to make it better, stronger and more influential. That, he said, will be the mandate for Ms. Rometty. “That’s the role of a C.E.O. today,” he said. But it wasn’t all humility from Mr. Palmisano. He laid out the case for I.B.M.’s improvement during his tenure — its growth, shift to higher-profit businesses, and financial performance. “And I could have said that for the first time in 27 years we’ve passed Microsoft in market capitalization, but I didn’t say that,” he joked. “I restrained myself.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/us/02iht-letter02.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Progress for Women, but a Long Way to Go<date>Published: November 1, 2011</date><text>NEW YORK — In a year of some major successes for women — the Nobel Peace Prize, the commanding performances of Angela Merkel and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the end of men-first in the line of succession to the British throne — a new worldwide study concludes that women remain well behind men in two crucial areas: economic equality and political power.Women hold fewer than 20 percent of all decision-making national positions, says the World Economic Forum’s sixth annual Global Gender Gap Report 2011, released on Tuesday at the organization’s office in New York. And while 85 percent of the 135 countries in the survey, representing more than 93 percent of the world’s population, made some progress in women’s health and education levels, relatively few showed marked advances for women in economic and political parity since the first survey came out in 2006. Tuesday’s conference focused on the need for governments and the private sector to implement and enforce laws and policies that promote women’s economic and political roles. “A world where women make up less than 20 percent of the global decision-makers is a world that is missing a huge opportunity for growth and ignoring an untapped reservoir of potential,” said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, echoing a view that is gaining ground at least among big multinationals. I.B.M., for example, just added walk to its talk on women, appointing Virginia M. Rometty as its first female chief executive. The World Economic Forum is not the only body doing comparative gender studies. In September, the World Bank released its annual report, noting unprecedented gains by women in education, health and access to jobs and livelihoods but gaps in female death rates, pay and decision-making in households and society. Caroline Anstey, managing director of the World Bank, stressed that women were still only “a subgroup of a subgroup” for the Group of 20, yet it is at such lofty summits that the need to invest in women — and the rewards of doing so — should be emphasized. “These reports help us look over time at changes in countries and show us where the gaps are and where to look to improve business practices,” Laura Liswood, secretary general of the Council of Women World Leaders and a senior adviser on diversity at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview. “We are seeing progress in education and health, but we’re not seeing much progress on the economic and political side, which is a big concern.” The World Economic Forum’s study ranks 135 nations according to progress made in women’s education, health, economic clout and political empowerment. Last year’s top 10 — Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Ireland, New Zealand, Denmark, the Philippines, Lesotho and Switzerland — continue to hold their spots, but there was movement below them, notably Cuba climbing back to No. 20. Among others in the top 20 are several European countries, South Africa, Britain and the United States, which landed at 17, hardly anything to boast about in a country that prides itself on being a leader in women’s rights. France poses even more questions. Although it is at the top in education and health, it ranks only middling on women’s economic and political influence. Saadia Zahidi of the World Economic Forum, a co-author of the report, explained in an interview that France scored 3.48 on a scale of 1 to 7 in the ability of Frenchwomen to rise to positions of enterprise leadership. That, she said, suggested that France had a “corporate culture that does not encourage the rise of women” and was an indicator that helping women to move up the ladder “is not a major part of corporate policies.” The report establishes an overall correlation between the size of a nation’s economy and its gender gap, but there are anomalies. For instance, the Philippines, among the poorest countries in Asia, scored high in all survey categories, outdoing some of the world’s hottest economies. 1 2 Next Page »NEW YORK — In a year of some major successes for women — the Nobel Peace Prize, the commanding performances of Angela Merkel and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the end of men-first in the line of succession to the British throne — a new worldwide study concludes that women remain well behind men in two crucial areas: economic equality and political power.</text></article>

A news release Wednesday from H.P. Labs discussed a project where data from social media is merged with corporate information, like sales transactions and customer demographics, to predict customer behavior. The study claimed 90 percent accuracy. “The system used can correlate social media conversations about specific product features to actual customer transactions in real time,’ the release said. “HP is expanding the scope of the project internally as the underlying technology is being piloted by HP customers in the media and entertainment industries.” What is interesting about that gobbledygook is that the project made use of so-called unstructured data, like Amazon.com reviews or customer surveys, that convey information through normal language, along with structured data, like spending information that fits neatly into the rows and columns of traditional corporate databases. This merger of the structured and the unstructured, in a systemic way, would be a suitable product inside an H.P. appliance. Earlier this year, H.P. bought one software company, called Vertica, which specializes in the analysis of structured data, and in August it announced the purchase of Autonomy, maker of software to analyze unstructured data. Vertica’s price was not disclosed, but was believed to be something above $200 million. The Autonomy deal, at about $11.7 billion, contributed to Leo Apotheker’s ouster as chief executive in September. Ms. Whitman put integrating Autonomy among her chief priorities when she took over. She closed the Autonomy deal in early October, leaving H.P. free to start integrating the approaches two software companies into a single service. Given her “hardware first” approach, that likely means a special-purpose data analysis computer server, with the software ready loaded. This report from Labs indicates that H.P. was already thinking about how to do that. The vice president of customer intelligence at H.P. is quoted as saying that “the results are significant enough to act on” and that “his methodology can improve both the customer experience and the bottom line,” particularly in customer service, defect spotting and online marketing campaigns. When we spoke on Thursday, I asked Ms. Whitman if H.P. was still trying to get into the high-value consulting and services businesses that I.B.M. dominates. “We’re a very different company than I.B.M.,” she said. “They have got very real strengths, but we got strengths too.” In particular she mentioned H.P.’s huge global supply chain and its capability to manufacture so many products. For a long time, however, I.B.M. has sold hardware, even giant mainframe computers, as the wrapping that makes its software work best. Ms. Whitman may be angling for an opposite play to the same end, selling hardware with so many software extras that it comes with a premium price. If so, look for a structured/unstructured analysis server from H.P. sometime soon. (By the way, Ms. Whitman also went out of her way to compliment the job Mark Hurd did in making areas like human resources, information technology and real estate inside H.P. more efficient. Considering where those functions stand in the world of chief executive esteem, that was not exactly high praise, but it was still the warmest anyone at H.P. has been about Mr. Hurd, the former H.P. chief executive who is now co-president of Oracle.)</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/big-data-speed-and-the-future-of-computing/?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Big Data, Speed and the Future of Computing<date>October 31, 2011, 11:24 am</date><text>Big data is, yes, about more data — the rising flood from corporate databases, Web browsing trails, sensors and social network communications. But it is just as much about speed. If “big data” is more than a marketing term, it has to be the raw material for making smarter decisions, faster. And that means, as the big-data industry evolves, the need for groundbreaking new approaches to computing, both in hardware and software. A simple example: the Watson question-answering computer that beat two human “Jeopardy!” champions earlier this year had to pore through vast quantities of data and come back with an answer in less than three seconds. The speed requirement meant I.B.M.’s Watson had to do its near-instant data digging in memory instead of finding data on hard disks. Traditionally, memory chips surrounding the computer processor held the small amounts of data that had to be on hand for immediate tasks. But getting answers quickly in the world of big data necessitates this new approach, called in-memory processing. “It’s a model for the future,” John E. Kelly, the head of I.B.M. research, said during an interview at Watson Labs. Early signs of the move toward this new architecture can be seen in recent announcements of new computer appliances designed for high-speed data applications. Earlier this month, Oracle introduced its Exalytics “business intelligence machine,” an in-memory hardware and software system for faster data analysis. In late September, both EMC’s Greenplum division and Teradata brought out computer appliances tailored for big data applications. Last year, I.B.M. paid $1.7 billion for Netezza, maker of an appliance for high-speed data analysis. SAS Institute, the big-data software pioneer, announced last week that its software has been fine-tuned to work on the EMC Greenplum and Teradata high-speed appliances. The big private company had been working with Netezza as well, until I.B.M. bought the company. “We can’t share all our secrets with them,” Jim Goodnight, founder and chief executive of SAS, said in an interview. Mr. Goodnight, 68, has been doing some of the research himself on software designed for in-memory processing and is a co-inventor on a few patents in that field. Not today or tomorrow perhaps, but big data portends striking changes for the computer industry, predicted Mr. Kelly of I.B.M. “It’s going to break all of the technology we have and it’s where the next big arena of value is going to be in this industry,” he said. In discussing the path over the next decade, Mr. Kelly talks of seeking inspiration, if not a blueprint, from biology, and a coming switch in chip-making from silicon to other materials, most likely carbon-based devices Just what the computing framework may be is uncertain, but Mr. Kelly said, “It won’t be a Von Neumann architecture.” The Von Neumann model, named after the mathematican John von Neumman has been the template for computing for six decades. It has a processor at the center, surrounded by memory and storage, and it is the basis of computing today. But the “Von Neumann bottleneck” describes the slowdown in performance that comes from that approach, with the processor tightly managing data input and output. “We’re going to have to move from processor-centric computing to data and memory-centric computing with processors sprinkled in it,” Mr. Kelly said.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/business/for-incoming-ibm-chief-self-confidence-rewarded.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">For Incoming I.B.M. Chief, Self-Confidence Rewarded<date>Published: October 27, 2011</date><text>Early in her career, Virginia M. Rometty, I.B.M.’s next chief executive, was offered a big job, but she felt she did not have enough experience. So she told the recruiter she needed time to think about it.That night, her husband asked her, “Do you think a man would have ever answered that question that way?” “What it taught me was you have to be very confident, even though you’re so self-critical inside about what it is you may or may not know,” she said at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit this month. “And that, to me, leads to taking risks.” Her 30-year ascent through the ranks at I.B.M. happened during an era in which women entered corporate America in droves — with some of them, including Ms. Rometty, climbing their way to the top. “The age group of women becoming C.E.O.’s started their careers in the early ’80s, when the huge tsunami of women were really building professional lives,” said Ilene H. Lang, chief executive of Catalyst, a research firm on women and business. Yet the fact that Ms. Rometty’s gender remains newsworthy also exposes the lengths that businesses still need to go to before women who invest their careers in companies have a shot at the corner office, or even equal representation. “So we should be seeing more of this,” Ms. Lang said. Ms. Rometty’s promotion also reveals something about I.B.M. and how it has developed a corporate culture that values diversity. The notable companies with women chief executives — like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, PepsiCo, Kraft Foods, DuPont and Xerox — are also some of the country’s oldest. Surprisingly, newer companies lag, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, founder of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute at the Yale School of Management. “The really longstanding, traditional companies are the ones who’ve been able to unblock the once-clogged pipelines that used to atrophy the meritocracy because of bias,” he said. “These are traditional major pillars of the U.S. economy, as opposed to upstarts or professional services or finance firms with a highly fluid work force.” The promotion of Ms. Rometty is all the more significant because she spent her career at I.B.M., in technical, strategy and sales roles, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies women in business. When she began studying these issues three decades ago, senior women were in “the three Ps,” she said — personnel, purchasing and public relations. Even recently, Anne M. Mulcahy, former chief executive of Xerox, had been vice president of human resources. Ms. Rometty started at I.B.M. as a systems engineer in 1981 with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering from Northwestern University and is currently senior vice president for sales, marketing and strategy. “The way she’s become C.E.O. is emblematic of a change that means women can have access to every opportunity, coming up the standard route instead of being hired from unusual places,” Ms. Kanter said. A Catalyst research report this month found that women who build their careers inside a single company are more successful because they can prove themselves and develop sponsors to give them critical assignments. “Earning this within the company, with your colleagues, is a little different from parachuting in Carly Fiorina or Meg Whitman from outside, where maybe they only look good because no one knows them,” Ms. Kanter said, referring to a former chief executive at Hewlett-Packard and its current chief executive. It also gives Ms. Rometty added legitimacy, Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “There’s no cynic who can say there’s some demographic window-dressing here.” Her career trajectory mirrors the successes of modern-day I.B.M.. An early producer of personal computers, I.B.M. has since sold off much of its hardware business to focus on higher-value software and services. Ms. Rometty’s career has been largely on the fast-growing services side, selling I.B.M. expertise to insurance and finance companies and overseeing the $3.5 billion acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting in 2002. But for most companies, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, particularly finance, consulting and law firms, the biggest barrier for women remains the leaky pipeline — companies lose women before they ever near the top. I.B.M., however, has a reputation for promoting diversity, said analysts who study the field. I.B.M., 100 years old, hired its first professional women, 25 college seniors working in systems service, in 1935. In 1943, it named its first woman vice president. It instituted a three-month family leave policy in 1956, 37 years before the federal government made it law. And it runs the I.B.M. Women Inventors Community for filing patents. “They see their ability to compete in today’s marketplace, to approach new markets and to make money as being tied to diversity,” said Caroline Simard, vice president of research at the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, which this year named I.B.M. the top company for technical women. “It really is a business imperative and not just a responsibility of H.R.” Analysts said that perhaps the most important strategy at I.B.M., which also had early inclusion programs for minorities, disabled and gay employees, is its formal mentorship program. “I really never felt there was a constraint about being a woman,” Ms. Rometty said at the Fortune conference. “I was always surrounded by people that wanted to mentor you.” Ms. Kanter at Harvard said that Samuel J. Palmisano, whom Ms. Rometty will replace as chief executive, should be named “mentor of the century.” Still, women are not equally represented at I.B.M., accounting for 28 percent of the work force and just 21 percent of executives. I.B.M. does not break out engineers by gender, but tech companies have traditionally lagged in recruiting women. Girls are discouraged from pursuing technical education and companies have trouble retaining technical women because they are often isolated from influential social networks inside companies, Ms. Simard said. “Research shows that the majority of people have an implicit bias that associates science and technology with gender, so from a very young age, girls are not encouraged to pursue these careers,” she said. “Women like Ginni Rometty are a powerful antidote against the stereotype.” Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Early in her career, Virginia M.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/technology/ibm-names-a-new-chief.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Names Virginia Rometty as New Chief Executive<date>Published: October 25, 2011</date><text>Virginia M. Rometty, a senior vice president at I.B.M., will be the company’s next chief executive, the directors announced on Tuesday. She will succeed Samuel J. Palmisano, 60, who will remain as chairman, at the start of next year.Ms. Rometty, 54, is well known within the technology industry, but not widely beyond. She has led strategically important divisions of the company as it has shifted to services and products with high profit margins, like software that mines vast troves of corporate and online data for sales and cost-saving opportunities. The directors’ choice of Ms. Rometty, who managed a crucial merger as well as sales in fast-growing new markets, ends a competition that has been under way for years. The leading candidates were always from within the company’s executive ranks. A leading rival to succeed Mr. Palmisano, analysts say, was Steven A. Mills, the senior vice president who led I.B.M.’s highly profitable and growing software division. But his age, analysts note, was probably an obstacle. Mr. Mills has just turned 60, the traditional retirement age for I.B.M. chief executives.  Mr. Palmisano, in an interview Tuesday, singled out Mr. Mills for praise, saying “he’s done a phenomenal job.” The selection of Ms. Rometty for the top job at I.B.M. will make her one of the most prominent women executives in corporate America, joining a small group of chiefs that includes Ursula Burns of Xerox, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, Ellen J. Kullman of DuPont and Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard. Gender, according to Mr. Palmisano, did not figure into Ms. Rometty’s selection. “Ginni got it because she deserved it,” Mr. Palmisano said, using the informal first name by which she is known to friends and colleagues. “It’s got zero to do with progressive social policies,” Mr. Palmisano added. Ms. Rometty has led the growth and development of I.B.M.’s huge services business for more than a decade. The services strategy, analysts say, is partly a marketing tactic. But, they add, it also represents a different approach to the technology business, with less emphasis on selling hardware and software products. Instead, I.B.M. puts together bundles of technology to help business streamline operations, find customers and develop new products. “I.B.M. is selling business solutions, not just products,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst for the technology market research firm IDC. “Rometty has been at the forefront of that effort.” Ms. Rometty, who graduated from Northwestern University with an undergraduate degree in computer science, joined I.B.M. in 1981 as a systems engineer. She quickly moved up to a series of management jobs, working with clients in industries including banking, insurance, telecommunications, manufacturing and health care. In 2002, Ms. Rometty championed the purchase of the big business consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, for $3.5 billion. The deal was made shortly after Mr. Palmisano became chief executive and it was seen as a big risk. The PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants were used to operating fairly independently, in a very different culture from the more regimented I.B.M. style of the time. The danger, analysts say, was that the business consultants would flee in droves, leaving the business a shell. Ms. Rometty was put in charge of coordinating the work of the acquired firm’s consultants with I.B.M.’s technologists, to tailor services and software offering for specific industries. Ms. Rometty, analysts say, worked tirelessly and effectively to win over the consultants. “She did the deal, and she made it work,” Mr. Palmisano said. “Ginni Rometty combines performance and charisma,” said George F. Colony, chairman of Forrester Research. “She orchestrated a massive charm campaign to bring the PricewaterhouseCoopers people into the fold. That was the trial by fire for her.” In 2009, Ms. Rometty became senior vice president and group executive for sales, marketing and strategy. Part of the job is leading the I.B.M. drive to sharply increase its business in overseas growth markets, like China, India, Brazil and dozens of emerging markets, including several African nations. Such markets now account for 23 percent of I.B.M.’s revenue, up from 20 percent when she took over. It should reach 30 percent by 2015, the company projects. 1 2 Next Page »Virginia M. Rometty, a senior vice president at I.B.M., will be the company’s next chief executive, the directors announced on Tuesday. She will succeed Samuel J. Palmisano, 60, who will remain as chairman, at the start of next year.</text></article>

Beats Forecasts and Raises Profit Estimate for Year<date>Published: October 17, 2011</date><text>I.B.M. reported solid quarterly profits on Monday, showing that despite the shaky economy, corporations continued to spend on information technology. But the company’s stock dropped as sales fell short of expectations.The giant company provides a gauge of business investment trends because it is the largest supplier of computing technology — hardware, software and services — to corporations. I.B.M.’s performance echoes the reassuring results in recent weeks from a handful of corporate technology companies, like Oracle and Salesforce.com, whose quarters end in July or August instead of September. Corporations, analysts note, are holding ample cash reserves and continue to spend on technology to cut costs and lift productivity, despite uncertain economic prospects in many countries. Still, the profit outlook for technology companies — and most other companies — is dimming somewhat as growth slows, especially in Europe and the United States. I.B.M. reported net earnings of $3.84 billion, a 7 percent increase from the year-earlier quarter. Its earnings per share from continuing operations — the number most closely watched on Wall Street — rose 15 percent, to $3.28. The average estimate of analysts was $3.22 a share, according to FactSet. In a conference call with analysts, Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.’s chief financial officer, singled out major sources of strength. First, he said, was the continuing rapid growth of markets abroad, including China, India, Brazil and a few dozen other emerging nations, which grew 19 percent and now account for 23 percent of I.B.M.’s revenue. Mr. Loughridge also pointed to newer products and services like business analytics, which helps companies sift through data to spot sales opportunities and streamline operations. “We’re on track for a great year,” Mr. Loughridge said. Based on the third quarter and outlook, I.B.M. raised its estimate slightly for full-year profits to “at least $13.35 a share,” up from the previous guidance of “at least $13.25 a share.” But investors were apparently looking for more. In after-hours trading, the stock fell 4 percent. In regular trading, it dropped 2 percent, or $3.94, to $186.59, in a down day for the market. I.B.M.’s sales, analysts noted, were a little less than estimates, and the company’s earnings benefited from a lower tax rate than in the first half of the year. That contributed to the pullback in after-hours trading, they said, as did profit-taking; I.B.M.’s shares had run up 27 percent so far this year. “It was still very solid,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, “but it didn’t have the breathing room that I.B.M. quarters have typically had recently.” Revenue for the quarter increased 8 percent, to $26.2 billion, slightly less than analysts’ estimates. Excluding gains from currency translation, revenue rose 3 percent. With the dollar strengthening recently against the euro, currency-related gains will most likely decline in the current quarter, analysts say. I.B.M. is more stable than most technology companies regardless of the economic conditions. Analysts point to its global reach, skilled management and the fact that so much of its business comes from steady revenue from software licenses and services contracts instead of sales of new hardware products. I.B.M. said it had seen a slowdown in government business in developed nations amid a budget squeeze. The other notable weak market, Mr. Loughridge said, was Japan, which continues to struggle to recover after the tsunami and earthquake disaster earlier this year. In the United States, I.B.M.’s business grew by 4 percent, and it grew 7 percent in Canada. I.B.M.’s software business worldwide grew 13 percent in the quarter, to $5.8 billion, with the biggest growth coming from its Internet-based commerce software and its data management and analysis software. The company’s big services business grew 8 percent, to $15.2 billion. Hardware sales rose 4 percent, to $4.5 billion. Mainframe sales fell 5 percent from a year ago, though I.B.M. attributed that mainly to the comparison with the strong 2010 third quarter, when new mainframe lines were introduced.I.B.M. reported solid quarterly profits on Monday, showing that despite the shaky economy, corporations continued to spend on information technology.

After all, there is so much of data, from the traditional stuff inside corporate databases to e-mail, Web-browsing patterns, social-network messages and sensor data. Information drives decisions, so more of it ought to open the door to better decisions. The World Economic Forum has declared that data is a new asset class. All that is the intellectual and marketing tailwind behind the concept known as big data. A Forrester Research report, published Friday, provides some leavening perspective on the big data phenomenon. The report is based on a survey of 60 Forrester clients who are using or experimenting with big data computing. It tries to define big data, assess its current applications and offer tips for corporate managers. The takeaway points, from reading the report and an interview with a co-author, include: big data is an applied science project in most companies, and a major potential constraint is not the cost of the computing technology but the skilled people needed to carry out these projects — the data scientists. The report concludes that big data is a real and significant trend. “Big data technology, while early-stage, is not vapor-ware,” the authors write. The science-project nature of big data to date is highlighted, I thought, by six examples of innovators described at the start of the report. There is Google, of course. And IBM‘s Watson, which defeated two human “Jeopardy” champions earlier this year, is cited. But two of the other examples — remote sensors collecting data on premature babies in a hospital ward at the University of Ontario, and a smart-grid project at the Tennessee Valley Authority — are also collaborations with IBM Research (which is not mentioned). So yes, there are cutting-edge innovators with big data, but not a lot, it seems. Boris Evelson, a Forrester analyst and coauthor of the report, with Brian Hopkins, explained that big-data computing differs fundamentally from using other data-analysis tools, like business intelligence and data warehousing software. “With the other technology, you need to model something first,” Mr. Evelson said. “But what if you don’t know the questions? Big data is all about exploration without preconceived notions.” Indeed, big data is about finding patterns in the proverbial noise of vast, unstructured data sets. The big data tools, Mr. Evelson noted, are not themselves costly. Much of the software is based on open-source Hadoop, a framework for handling diverse data and probing it with distributed, parallel-processing computing clusters. There are commercial versions from companies including Cloudera, I.B.M., EMC and Hortonworks. And business intelligence software makers, like Microstrategy, are integrating their offerings with big data tools. And there are cloud-based services emerging for big data applications. Yet if the tools are comparatively low-cost, the skills needed are specialized and technical. Exploring for patterns in the data is not yet for the corporate rank and file. “In big data today,” Mr. Evelson said, “it’s all about programming. You need Java programmers, computational statisticians and mathematicians.”</text></article>

Andrew M. Cuomo spoke at an economic development conference in Albany on Tuesday. ALBANY — I.B.M., Intel and three other technology companies agreed Tuesday to pour $4 billion into computer-chip research in New York, promising to hire thousands of workers and giving a major boost to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as he campaigns for companies to invest in the state and create jobs. Mr. Cuomo, sounding downright giddy as he kicked off an economic development conference here, heralded the investment as a “really, really big deal” that proved that New York, especially upstate, could lure new investment from major corporations flush with potential suitors. His announcement came as former President Bill Clinton, whom Mr. Cuomo served as housing secretary, made an appearance at the conference and urged business leaders and local officials to embrace environmentally friendly technology and new industries as they try to create jobs. The computer-chip investment deal will also include Samsung, GlobalFoundries and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The governor’s office said it would create 2,500 high-technology jobs and 1,900 construction jobs, and would also preserve 2,500 existing jobs. “I think it’s important to remember, as we start this conference — a better affirmation of our potential you could not have,” Mr. Cuomo said. “These companies could have gone anywhere on the globe.” Over the past two decades, New York State has invested heavily in the burgeoning nanotechnology industry, primarily in the capital region. Mr. Cuomo and others have highlighted the effort as a model for regional economic development in the economically depressed upstate region. The state will spend $400 million over five years as part of the new research deal. The money will go toward expanding the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the University at Albany, and the investment by the technology companies will go toward creating jobs in Albany, Yorktown Heights, East Fishkill, Utica and Canandaigua. Mr. Cuomo and other lawmakers said they hoped that the new research and development activities would lead to the construction of chip plants in several years, creating many more jobs, and would also serve as an example to other companies that New York was increasingly attractive to major corporations seeking to invest in research and high-technology manufacturing facilities. “It’s huge for the message, and it’s huge for the jobs that go with it,” the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has been a booster of the nanotechnology sector in the capital region, said in an interview. The semiconductor deal was promptly overshadowed on Tuesday by the news that the second-largest union of state workers had rejected their labor agreement with Mr. Cuomo. But before that, its announcement created a mood of triumph at the capital, where the governor had summoned members of 10 regional councils that he appointed to compete for state economic-development funding. Mr. Clinton’s visit only added to the festive mood, as Mr. Cuomo joked about picking up a southern accent from working under Mr. Clinton, and his staff cued a brief slideshow of old photos showing the governor, with noticeably darker hair, working alongside Mr. Clinton when he was president. In his speech, Mr. Clinton, citing San Diego’s success with biotechnology and the computer simulation business in Orlando, Fla., suggested that the capital region could similarly exploit its nanotechnology industry to turn around its economic fortunes. Mr. Clinton focused mostly on giving economic-development tips: he particularly encouraged pursuing jobs related to clean energy sources and retrofitting buildings to be more energy-efficient. But he also offered a dollop of praise for the governor and lawmakers for their handling of the state’s budget gap last winter, suggesting that Mr. Cuomo’s fiscal stewardship would help encourage businesses to invest here. “I travel all over America and all over the world, and the confidence people have in New York outside this state has exploded just because the government did its job,” Mr. Clinton said. “They showed up, passed the budget on time, didn’t raise taxes — it’s an amazing, amazing thing for you.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/arts/design/think-at-lincoln-center-review.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">‘Think’ at Lincoln Center - Review<date>Published: September 23, 2011</date><text>Anyone walking past Lincoln Center during the last few days, and glancing downward at its new access road, Jaffe Drive, would have seen what seemed to be a slightly eccentric art installation. A long band of animated colored lights would snake across a 123-foot-long wall of LEDs as a digital clock counted backward. Then that band might suddenly twist and wind around itself, erupt into curves, contort into waves, and, just as unexpectedly, subside again into temporary linear calm.Or else, if you watched long enough, the wall might go blank, and when lighted again, would resemble a kind of elongated container. Bluish lights would pour inside it, mounting and sloshing about like some kind of luminous liquid, until the entire wall’s array would be filled to overflowing. And then the “liquid” would seem to spill from the sides, dripping down in cascades as the container emptied. Now, with the opening of I.B.M.’s “Think” exhibition to the public, visitors can walk down the drive, consult text panels with explanations of these patterns and others, and obtain free timed tickets to a subterranean space where 40 seven-foot-high media panels stand like miniature pillars, showing a 12-minute film about “making the world work better.” The screens then turn interactive, offering additional information and sensation, before visitors exit along an illuminated wall that offers a chronicle of 100 milestones in I.B.M.’s history, for this show is being mounted in honor of that corporation’s centennial. The exhibition is visually striking, and its information is often compelling. But it also requires some deciphering and examination. It turns out that the initial “data wall,” as it is called, offers a series of displays culled from “live data streaming,” some from sensors around Lincoln Center. The snaking line of light that streams across the wall, for example, is a representation of the movement of traffic along Broadway and Columbus Avenue as it is tracked by a specially mounted camera. When the flow is thwarted by red lights or traffic, the line leaps out of its straightforward progress and curves and twists into visual knots. The other display showing seepage and spillage is the result of robotic monitoring, not near Lincoln Center, but along the Delaware Aqueduct that carries water into New York City from upstate reservoirs; sensors have revealed continual leaks that lose a substantial amount of water every day. So we are watching representations of complex phenomena: the flow of traffic and of water. And there are other displays that follow: a grid of accumulating vectors represents credit card transactions, the fraudulent ones exploding in red; a vast map of Manhattan with varying colors shows how many rooftops are capable of harnessing solar energy. Inside the exhibition the interactive screens also show a wide range of images and information. You read about the invention of a fluid microchip in 2009 and see a 19th-century London map charting a cholera epidemic. A jar ornamented with dragons is described as a second-century Chinese seismograph. (Stones drop from the dragons’ mouths in response to vibrations.) Brief interviews can be sampled with such disparate subjects as Glenn D. Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art, and William J. Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner. But what is this show meant to be? Partly, it is corporate public relations. We learn about I.B.M.’s astonishing accomplishments over a century, its researchers creating what is now commonplace: UPC bar codes, magnetic strips holding data on cards, computer hard drives. I.B.M. scientists have received Nobel Prizes, performed molecular prestidigitation and won chess and “Jeopardy!” games with pioneering examples of artificial intelligence. The exhibition is also meant to demonstrate I.B.M.’s vision of the world while defining its mission to the public, for it is no longer an office machine company or the maker of the world’s best electric typewriter (the Selectric), or the designer of mainframe computers, or even the manufacturer of the once-ubiquitous IBM PC. The corporation is now, we learn, concerned with matters far more difficult to define. Its ambition is not just determined by its founder’s blunt motto, “Think,” but by the bland slogan used to name the company’s centennial history book, which appears throughout the show: “Making the World Work Better.” Along the data wall, some of those achievements are heralded: reduced crime, improved energy usage, healthier rivers, better air quality, safer food. I.B.M. also sees this exhibition as a kind of milestone, meant to reveal to visitors something about the cutting edge of computer applications. The company’s material points out that this is the first show it has created since its pavilion at the 1964 World’s Fair, where the exhibitions were designed by Charles Eames (who a few years earlier had created, with his wife, Ray, a landmark exhibition, “Mathematica,” for I.B.M. that after a half-century is still impressive and readily sampled at major science museums). In fact, you get the basic idea: the advances celebrated here involve the development of sensors that can track and trace the most complex phenomena, and of software systems that can analyze and map them. 1 2 Next Page » âThinkâ will be on display through Oct. 23 at Lincoln Center; lincolncenter.org.Anyone walking past Lincoln Center during the last few days, and glancing downward at its new access road, Jaffe Drive, would have seen what seemed to be a slightly eccentric art installation.

Study Quantifies the Pain of the Commuting Motorist<date>September 9, 2011, 6:00 am</date><text>I.B.M.A speedometer graphic represents “the emotional and economic toll” of commuting in 20 international cities. Mexico City, with a score of 108, ranked as the most onerous. I.B.M. knows your pain. Not the pain of the frustrated desktop user or the stymied motherboard programmer, but of the commuting motorist. And there is plenty of pain to go around in cities from New York to Nairobi, according to I.B.M.’s fourth annual Global Commuter Pain survey, which looks at the connection between traffic congestion and commuters’ emotional response to it in some of the world’s largest cities on six continents. The survey, which began in 2008 and surveyed only residents of cities in the United States, has been expanded worldwide. This year’s survey is based on responses from 8,042 commuters in 20 cities. IBM compiled the results of that survey into an index of commuter pain to score and rank the emotional and economic toll of commuting in each city, with the highest-ranking number representing the worst. The index suggests a big disparity in the pain of the daily commute, with Mexico City, at a score of 108, outranking all other cities surveyed and Montreal, at 21, reporting the lowest level. Cities near the top included Beijing with 95, Nairobi with 88 and Moscow with a score of 65. New York came in relatively low, with a score of 28. The pain index accounts for 10 issues that lend themselves to easy quantification, like commuting time and the amount of time a commuter is stuck in traffic. There were slipperier parameters, too, such as whether the respondent agreed that the price of gas was too high; that traffic was worse than it was last year; and that driving caused stress and anger. The study’s authors also observed an important disconnect: Despite big increases in the percentages of commuters who said traffic had improved either “somewhat” or “substantially” in the past three years, drivers in 12 of the 15 cities surveyed in both 2010 and 2011 complained substantially more than they did in previous years about the stress and frustration that accompanied their daily commute. In New York, 45 percent of drivers this year said that traffic increased their stress, compared with 13 percent in 2010. In Los Angeles, it was 44 percent in 2011 versus 21 percent in 2010; in London, it was 33 percent in 2011 versus 19 percent in 2010; and in Johannesburg, it was 52 percent in 2011 versus 30 percent in 2010. “Substantial” increases in anger over traffic were tallied in several cities, including New York (35 percent in 2011 versus 14 percent in 2010), Los Angeles (29 percent in 2011 versus 14 percent in 2010) and Toronto (29 percent in 2011 versus 14 percent in 2010). Among other findings, 41 percent of commuters globally said that improved public transportation would reduce stress. If traffic did not occupy so much time, 56 percent of respondents said they would spend more time with family and friends, 48 percent would exercise more and 29 percent would sleep more.

    <article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/hewlett-packards-look-east-strategy/?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Hewlett-Packard's Look-East Strategy<date>August 25, 2011, 10:53 am</date><text>No one is giving Hewlett-Packard‘s chief executive, Léo Apotheker, high marks for the new strategy he presented last week. It seemed a flip from the corporate game plan Mr. Apotheker had championed only a few months earlier. H.P. is paying a high price for a business software company. And it may have undermined the value of its personal computer business by saying it was considering selling it off. But it’s not hard to see the trends behind the revised thinking at the Silicon Valley headquarters of H.P., as the company retreats from PCs to focus more on selling more profitable data-serving computers and specialized software to corporations and governments — the so-called enterprise business. Yet H.P.’s strategy also has a familiar look. It’s I.B.M.‘s strategy, but embarked upon years later. A fresh piece of evidence for the logic of an enterprise-first strategy came Tuesday evening. IDC reported that server computer shipments in the second quarter of 2011 increased 8.5 percent and revenue rose 17.9 percent from the year-earlier quarter. By contrast, PC shipments for the quarter inched up 2.6 percent in the quarter, while revenue rose 6 percent. Companies are investing in servers and data-analysis software to help them handle and make sense of the rising tide of data, generated inside the company and outside — customers, Web traffic, social network communications, and other sources. I.B.M., headquartered in Armonk, N.Y., sold off its PC business in 2005 to a Chinese company, Lenovo. But I.B.M. did not tip its hand well in advance of the sale, as H.P. felt compelled to do. For months, Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief, was negotiating with Lenovo and visiting senior government officials in Beijing to get their assent. Word of the deal leaked out just days before I.B.M. announced the sale to Lenovo in December 2004. The sell-off carried a lot of symbolic freight, for I.B.M. and the PC industry. When it entered the market in 1981, I.B.M. brought the personal computer into the mainstream, endorsing what many still viewed as a plaything for hobbyists. For years, I.B.M. executives had said — as H.P. executives have — that even if not a big money maker, the PC business was “strategic,” pulling along sales of other hardware, software and services. But Mr. Palmisano made the unsentimental decision to shed the business and invest money and management energy elsewhere. H.P.’s purchase of Autonomy for $10 billion looks pricey, but the British company is a leading maker of sophisticated data-analysis software. Once again, H.P. is following I.B.M.’s lead. Most of the major software companies have bought specialist makers of software that helps corporations manage information — known as “business intelligence” or “data-analytics” software. But I.B.M. has been the most aggressive over several years, spending $14 billion on 25 companies that focus on data analytics. I.B.M. has added industry experts in services and researchers to the business, which now employs 8,000 consultants and 200 mathematicians. I.B.M. said recently it expects its analytics business to grow to $16 billion by 2015. Before I.B.M. sold its PC business and invested heavily in software and services, Big Blue and H.P. were much more comparable companies than they are today. The difference can be seen in the numbers — the data, if you will. Today, I.B.M.’s profit margins are about double H.P.’s margins. And the stock market value of I.B.M., at $198 billion, is nearly four times H.P.’s $52 billion. In the last few days, there have been market speculation that H.P. is sufficiently weakened to be a takeover target itself. Oracle has been mentioned as the most likely bidder. In a research note on Wednesday, Dave Novosel, an analyst at Gimme Credit, said that the only H.P. business that would really interest Oracle would be H.P.’s server computer division. His research note was titled, “Oracle Has Better Options.” I.B.M. stands on the sidelines, enjoying its competitive advantage. Years ago, it made the difficult strategic choices H.P. is grappling with today.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/ibm-announces-brainy-computer-chip/?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Announces Brainy Computer Chip<date>August 18, 2011, 1:00 am</date><text>Since the early days in the 1940s, computers have routinely been described as “brains” — giant brains or mathematical brains or electronic brains. Scientists and engineers often cringed at the distorting simplification, but the popular label stuck. IBMDharmendra Modha, an I.B.M. researcher, is the leader of the project to create cognitive computer chips. Wait long enough, it seems, and science catches up with the metaphor. The field of “cognitive computing” is making enough progress that the brain analogy is becoming more apt. I.B.M. researchers are announcing on Thursday two working prototype cognitive computer chips. The chip designs are the result of a three-year project involving I.B.M. and university researchers, supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The academic collaborators are at Columbia University, Cornell University, the University of California, Merced and the University of Wisconsin. The results to date have been sufficiently encouraging that Darpa is announcing on Thursday that it will commit an additional $21 million to the project, the third round of government funding, which brings the total to $41 million. The cognitive chips are massively parallel microprocessors that consume very little power. But they also have a fundamentally different design. The two prototype semiconductor cores each has 256 neuronlike nodes. One core is linked to 262,144 synapselike memory modules, while the other is linked to 65,536 such memory synapses. The researchers call the design a “neurosynaptic core.” “This is a critical shift away from today’s Von Neumann computing,” said Dharmendra Modha, an I.B.M. researcher who is the project leader. He is referring to the design and step-by-step sequential methods used in current computers, named after the mathematician John Von Neumann. The new design, Mr. Modha said, should lead to chips suited for tasks that are difficult for computers like pattern recognition. They can learn on their own. “We aren’t there yet, but before long these chips will be able to rewire themselves on the fly,” he said. Such cognitive chips, Mr. Modha added, will be adept at absorbing and interpreting huge amounts of data from increasingly low-cost digital sensors. For example, cognitive computers — using sensor measurements of air and water temperature, ocean tides, wind patterns and atmospheric pressure — could make more timely and accurate predictions of tsunamis and hurricanes, he said. Working cognitive-computer chips, analysts say, are an impressive step. “These are building blocks for a new kind of computing,” said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering, a technology research firm. Still, cognitive computing is still years away from the marketplace, and it will more likely complement than replace conventional computers. Even its champions who freely use the brain analogy do so with a sense of humility. “We’re not trying to build a brain,” Mr. Modha said. “We’re trying draw inspiration from the brain.”</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/business/shared-value-gains-in-corporate-responsibility-efforts.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">‘Shared Value’ Gains in Corporate Responsibility Efforts<date>Published: August 13, 2011</date><text>CORPORATE social responsibility efforts have always struck me as the modern equivalent of John D. Rockefeller handing out dimes to the common folk. They may be well-intentioned, but they often seem like small gestures at the margins of what companies are really trying to do: make money.As well they should, an argument most famously made by the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman decades ago. He called social responsibility programs “hypocritical window-dressing” in an article he wrote for The New York Times Magazine in 1970, titled “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.” But Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, may have an answer to the Friedman principle. Mr. Porter is best-known for his original ideas about corporate strategy and the economic competition among nations and regions. Recently, however, he has been promoting a concept he calls “shared value.” Earlier this year, Mr. Porter and Mark R. Kramer, a consultant and a senior fellow in the corporate social responsibility program at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, laid out their case in a lengthy article in the Harvard Business Review, “Creating Shared Value: How to Reinvent Capitalism — and Unleash a Wave of Innovation and Growth.” Since then, Mr. Porter and Mr. Kramer have been championing the shared-value thesis in conferences, meetings with corporate leaders, and even a conversation with White House advisers. Shared value is an elaboration of the notion of corporate self-interest — greed, if you will. The idea that companies can do well by doing good is certainly not new. It is an appealing proposition that over the years has been called “triple bottom line” (people, planet, profit), “impact investing” and “sustainability” — all describing corporate initiatives that address social concerns including environmental pollution, natural-resource depletion, public health and the needs of the poor. The shared-value concept builds on those ideas, but it emphasizes profit-making not just as a possibility but as a priority. Shared value, Mr. Porter says, points toward “a more sophisticated form of capitalism,” in which “the ability to address societal issues is integral to profit maximization instead of treated as outside the profit model.” Social problems are looming market opportunities, according to Mr. Porter and Mr. Kramer. They note that while government programs and philanthropy have a place — beyond dimes, Mr. Rockefeller created a path-breaking foundation — so, increasingly, does capitalism. The shared-value concept is not a moral stance, they add, and companies will still behave in their self-interest in ways that draw criticism, like aggressive tax avoidance and lobbying for less regulation. “This is not about companies being good or bad,” Mr. Kramer says. “It’s about galvanizing companies to exploit the market in addressing social problems.” The pair point to promising signs that more and more companies are pursuing market strategies that fit the shared-value model. Several years ago, executives at General Electric began looking across its portfolio of industrial and consumer businesses, eyeing ways to apply new technology to reduce energy consumption. They were prompted by corporate customers voicing concerns about rising electrical and fuel costs, and by governments pushing for curbs on carbon emissions. The result was G.E.’s “ecomagination” program, a business plan as well as a marketing campaign. In recent years, the company has invested heavily in technology to lower its products’ energy consumption, and the use of water and other resources in manufacturing. To count in the program, a product must deliver a significant energy savings or environmental benefit over previous designs. G.E. hired an outside environmental consulting firm, GreenOrder, to help in measuring performance. To date, more than 100 G.E. products have qualified, from jet engines to water filtration equipment to light bulbs. In 2010, such products generated sales of $18 billion, up from $10 billion in 2005, when the program began. “We did it from a business standpoint from Day 1,” says Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive. “It was never about corporate social responsibility.” 1 2 Next Page »CORPORATE social responsibility efforts have always struck me as the modern equivalent of John D. Rockefeller handing out dimes to the common folk. They may be well-intentioned, but they often seem like small gestures at the margins of what companies are really trying to do: make money.</text></article>

Nor was it the most powerful one of the time, nor the most stylish. Its development was rushed and broke so many of its manufacturer’s cherished design rules that a lot of senior executives in the company were convinced it would be a flop — quite a big one.The odds seemed to be stacked against the IBM 5150 Personal Computer when it was unveiled at a press conference in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York on Aug. 12, 1981. Yet it proved so successful that 30 years later the 5150 is regarded as a landmark product, not only for IBM, but the rest of the industry. Described by Tilly Blyth, a computing curator at the Science Museum in London, as “a very significant machine,” the 5150 and its software, the Microsoft Disk Operating System or MS-DOS, established industry standards, which have dominated personal computer design ever since. The 5150 became the most popular choice for early 1980s businesses, which were interested in trying out newfangled personal computers. The IBM brand name helped. There was a saying in American corporate circles: “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” Many of the executives who ordered the 5150 might not have been adventurous enough to risk buying a snazzier model from a brattish upstart like Apple. It is always tempting to think of design history being defined by examples of truly great design, but products like the IBM 5150, whose design was simply good enough to persuade lots of people to buy it, often turn out to be equally influential. Judged by today’s standards, the 5150 seems prehistoric. The system unit, keyboard and monitor for the basic model, which cost $1,565, weighed 44 pounds, or 20 kilograms. The keyboard alone weighed six pounds, twice as much as Apple’s largest MacBook Air laptop does today. The monitor could only squeeze in 25 lines of text, and the basic model had 40 kilobytes of built-in read-only memory, barely enough to store the words in this column, and 16 kilobytes of user memory — or 256 kilobytes if you added two diskette drives. Even so, the 5150 was powerful enough for basic business computing in the early 1980s, and must have looked stunningly futuristic compared to its predecessors. Twenty years before, IBM was producing enormous mainframe computers, like the IBM 360 and other systems, which cost up to $9 million each and needed to be housed in huge air-conditioned rooms and to be serviced by 60 people. By the early 1970s, mainframes had shrunk but were still gigantic, still stratospherically expensive and still kept in refrigerated rooms. Even the people who needed to use computers to process information were banned from entry, and had to ask technicians to operate the machines for them. Smaller computers that could be used by one person had existed since the 1950s. The American technology writer Mark Frauenfelder gives a lively account of their history in his book “The Computer.” He describes how the first one was developed by Berkeley Associates, a Massachusetts-based company founded by an insurance analyst, Edmund C. Berkeley, in 1950, and sold under the name Simon as a $500 kit of parts. Simon could do simple calculations, but its successor, the $17.95 Geniac Electric Brain Construction Kit, introduced by Berkeley in 1955, played games and solved puzzles too. Developments continued to be dominated by electronics hobbyists into the 1970s. Most of them were young engineers, who built machines and wrote programs in their spare time. They followed the latest developments in American magazines such as Popular Electronics and Creative Computing, and exchanged ideas with fellow geeks at clubs like the Homebrew Computing Club, which held its first meeting in 1975 in the garage of a hobbyist’s home in Menlo Park, northern California. A year later, it had over 750 members. 1 2 Next Page »LONDON — It was not the first personal computer to go on sale. Nor was it the most powerful one of the time, nor the most stylish.

Beats Analysts’ Forecasts<date>Published: July 18, 2011</date><text>I.B.M., which turned 100 last month, delivered better-than-expected quarterly results Monday that showed the old company had a lot of life in it. The company got a lift from robust sales of new models of mainframes — I.B.M.’s heritage — while its biggest current businesses, software and services, generated healthy growth as well. The company reported an 8 percent increase in net income, to $3.7 billion. Its operating profits per share rose 18 percent, to $3.09 a share, reflecting fewer shares outstanding because of I.B.M. stock buyback programs. Bolstered by the strong performance, I.B.M. raised its guidance for earnings for the full year, to “at least $13.25 a share” from the previous level of “at least $13.15 a share.” Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief executive, said in a statement that the results were evidence that the company’s long-term investments to generate growth were paying off. Those growth initiatives include large investments to build up business in fast-developing markets outside the United States and Western Europe, and acquiring companies that specialize in analyzing vast amounts of corporate and online data for insights that can increase sales and trim costs. The financial results, on a per-share basis, compared with analysts’ consensus estimate of $3.03 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. In the year-earlier quarter, I.B.M. reported earnings of $2.61 a share. Revenue grew 12 percent to $26.7 billion, up from $23.7 billion in the comparable quarter last year. The sales gain was helped by currency gains, as a weaker dollar translated to higher revenue from business overseas. Excluding the currency gains, revenue rose 5 percent. The average revenue estimate of Wall Street analysts was $25.3 billion. I.B.M.’s stock price rose $3.20 a share at one point, or nearly 2 percent, in after-hours trading. During regular trading hours, the company’s shares slipped 26 cents a share, to close at $175.28 a share. In the last year, I.B.M. shares have gained more than 35 percent in value. In his statement, Mr. Palmisano noted the company’s 100-year milestone. “As I.B.M. begins its second century,” he said, “we continue a process of transformation, positioning the company to lead in the future.” In recent years, I.B.M. has pursued a business model intended to achieve revenue growth of roughly 4 to 6 percent, while reaching earnings growth per share in the low double digits. Share buybacks and constant efficiency improvements, the company says, make the higher earnings possible. “It’s a very good quarter for I.B.M., with strong revenue growth by its standard and impressive profits,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “The company continues to deliver on its model.” I.B.M. is the largest supplier to businesses of information technology — computer hardware, software and services. So its performance tends to reflect broader trends in corporate spending, and I.B.M.’s performance in the second quarter is a reassuring sign of business investment. In the wider economy, consumer spending is soft and hiring weak, but private corporate investment has been robust — and spending on information technology represents more than half of all business capital investment. IDC, a research firm, estimated last month that business and government investment in information technology in the United States would grow at 5.6 percent this year, well ahead of the growth of the overall economy. Gartner, a research firm, recently raised its forecast for the growth in global information technology spending in 2011 to 7.1 percent, up from 5.6 percent, a projection made a few months earlier. Analysts say companies are investing in technology to automate business operations, like ordering supplies and tracking customers. Such investments, they say, typically have a quick payoff and are less risky in uncertain economic times than hiring new workers. Company financial reports for the second quarter are just getting under way, but the quarter should be a strong one for the technology industry, based on analysts’ estimates. The 74 technology companies among the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index are expected to report profit growth of 12 percent, notes John Butters, an analyst for FactSet Research. That is the third-highest growth rate among the 10 industry sectors in the index, trailing only the more cyclical industries like basic materials, which includes commodities like aluminum, steel and chemicals, and energy, which is dominated by the big oil companies. For all of 2011, technology companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 are forecast to deliver total profits of $182 billion, more than any other sector, Mr. Butters said. I.B.M.’s big services business grew 10 percent to $15.1 billion, though that was only 2 percent after excluding currency gains. Still, new signings at $14.3 billion were higher than most analysts’ estimates. New contracts, which can stretch over years, are a gauge of future business. In the previous few quarters, the pace of new contracts signed had been sluggish, raising some concerns among analysts.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/business/some-companies-want-gays-to-wed-to-get-health-benefits.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">As Same-Sex Marriage Becomes Legal, Some Choices May Be Lost<date>Published: July 8, 2011</date><text>Now that same-sex marriage has been legalized in New York, at least a few large companies are requiring their employees to tie the knot if they want their partners to qualify for health insurance.Corning, I.B.M. and Raytheon all provide domestic partner benefits to employees with same-sex partners in states where they cannot marry. But now that they can legally wed in New York, five other states and the District of Columbia, they will be required to do so if they want their partner to be covered for a routine checkup or a root canal. On the surface, this appears to put the couples on an even footing with heterosexual married couples. After all, this is precisely what they have been fighting for: being treated as a spouse. But some gay and lesbian advocates are arguing that the change may have come too soon: some couples may face complications, since their unions are not recognized by the federal government. “Even with the complications, many people will want to get married for the reasons people want to get married,” said Ross D. Levi, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda. “But from our perspective, to hinge something as important as insurance for your family to what is still a complicated legal matter for same-sex couples doesn’t seem to be a fair thing to do.” He said that there were a variety of reasons — legal, financial and personal — that companies should keep the domestic partnership option at least until gay marriage was recognized at the federal level. Legally speaking, getting married could create immigration issues or it could potentially muddy the process of adopting a child. In some instances, he added, an employee may work in a gay marriage state but live in a neighboring state that does not recognize the marriage. The couple may want to wait to marry until they can be legally wed in their home state. “There are certainly reasons why a couple may not wish to marry,” added Camilla Taylor, marriage project director at Lambda Legal. “People with certain immigration statuses might want to think very carefully before getting married. There are some types of visas that are meant to be temporary, and if you get married to someone who is a citizen, it could flag your renewal application and reflect your more permanent decision to stay.” When it comes to adopting a child, couples may run into trouble if they are trying to adopt from a place that restricts same-sex married couples from adopting. Having one parent adopt while still single may be easier. “If you want to be able to answer honestly in paperwork, multiple interviews and background checks, then you won’t want to get married,” Ms. Taylor said, adding that many foreign countries ban adoptions to same-sex couples. Marrying could also have serious implications for couples who relocate to a nonmarriage state, and ultimately decide to split up. Getting a divorce can be complicated, since one member of a couple may have to return to the gay marriage state and live there before their split can be completed. The employers making the changes said they spoke regularly with their gay and lesbian employee groups and planned to phase in the requirement. Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., said it would offer a reasonable grace period, though it had not completed the details. “After waiting so much time for that right, we want them to have the opportunity to enjoy that,” said Christy Pambianchi, a senior vice president for human resources at Corning, which put the policy into effect in New Hampshire and Massachusetts when gay marriage became legal there. She said employees did not raise concerns about the requirement. “They are delighted,” she said. Raytheon, based in Waltham, Mass. — another state where gay marriage is legal — said it would give employees several months to comply with its marriage requirement. Like Corning and I.B.M., the company said domestic partner benefits would remain in states where couples cannot marry (Raytheon also has an exemption for active members of the military, so they are covered for benefits without having to marry. Getting married violates the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which is being phased out). I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., said its workers would have up to a year to get married to maintain their current benefits. At least for now, these companies seem to be in the minority, though it is unclear whether more employers will follow their lead. Eastman Kodak, based in Rochester, said it would continue to offer domestic partner coverage to both same-sex and opposite-sex partners. “My impression is that there has been lots of discussion about dropping domestic partner coverage when marriage is first opened up to same-sex couples, but very few employers actually end up taking this step,” said Jennifer C. Pizer, legal director at the Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation law and policy issues. “Some employers initially believe that it is fairer of them to impose the same marriage requirements on all employees, regardless of sexual orientation. But then employees and others explain that employees with a same-sex life partner remain in difficult circumstances due to the continuing federal discrimination.” Whether same-sex couples marry, they will still be responsible for paying federal income taxes on the value of their partner or spouse’s benefits since they are not recognized by the federal government as an economic unit, unless the person covered is considered a dependent. Couples will not owe those taxes at the state level in places like New York that recognize gay marriage. But it should become easier for gay employees who marry and live in New York to obtain insurance for their spouses. (There are an estimated 42,000 same-sex couples in New York, according to the Williams Institute.) Not only are the same-sex spouses of state workers eligible for spousal coverage, but the same goes for many people who work for private employers. There could be some exceptions, however. Employers who do not contract with an insurance company but instead pay for health benefits out of their own assets — so-called self-insured plans — are not subject to the state’s insurance laws but are governed by federal law. Most large employers have self-insured plans, said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a membership organization that focuses on health policies for large employers. That means they can choose to cover same-sex employees, but they do not have to. While virtually all large company plans cover legal spouses, she added, some companies offer domestic partner benefits only to gay employees who do not have the option to marry. (Some companies also extend the benefits to heterosexual unmarried couples.) “I am getting a lot of questions about what other employers are doing,” Ms. Darling said. “I see a movement coming where marriage will be a factor where marriage is possible.”Now that same-sex marriage has been legalized in New York, at least a few large companies are requiring their employees to tie the knot if they want their partners to qualify for health insurance.</text></article>

Mobile phones allow people to maintain relationships with friends, family and colleagues across long distances.If you analyze aggregated cellphone traffic — as researchers at M.I.T., AT&amp;T and I.B.M. did with United States data from July of last year — interesting patterns emerge. Cities become connective hubs as people move to them from nearby counties and from far across the country. As a result, many calls originate and end in cities, connecting urban citizens to their families back home. At the same time, communities emerge that have little to do with geographic boundaries. While some follow state lines, others split states in half or combine them. There are sister states like Georgia and Alabama, and Mississippi and Louisiana. New Jersey and California, on the other hand, split in half because of the influences of large cities. Chattanooga, Tenn., communicates more with the Georgia-Alabama community than with the rest of Tennessee, and Pittsburgh splits from Pennsylvania to align with West Virginia. Texas remains whole, because the communication among Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin is strong enough to hold it together. These patterns show that proximity is only one of many factors — both cultural and economic — that bring people together. Carlo Ratti is the director of the M.I.T.

I.B.M. turned 100 last week, and among the things the company had done to mark its centenary was to sponsor a book. The project was a couple of years in the making, and it’s not the usual corporate anniversary coffee-table valentine, filled with pictures and self-serving testimonials from executives. The book, “Making the World Work Better: The Ideas That Shaped a Century and a Company,” is a hefty trade paperback that runs 352 pages, including 351 footnotes. It chronicles the last century from three perspectives — the development of computer science, the evolution of the modern corporation and the ever-expanding uses of information technology in science, government and industry. The concept, explained Jon Iwata, I.B.M.’s senior vice president for marketing and communications, was to get three writers to tackle those three subjects and tell the story of “the larger evolution and I.B.M.’s place in it.” The project got an inadvertent assist from the current travails in the field of journalism, with magazines folding, cutting back and retooling. That meant three accomplished technology journalists were available and signed up: Kevin Maney, a former columnist for USA Today and contributing editor to Condé Nast Portfolio; Steve Hamm, a former senior writer for Business Week; and Jeffrey M. O’Brien, a former senior editor at Fortune and Wired. “I.B.M. commissioned the book and then kind of stayed out of the way,” Mr. Maney said. The initial audience for the book, according to Mr. Iwata, is I.B.M. employees, partners and customers — and the 524,000 copies in the first print run were mainly for them. Even for that crowd, he added, “the book had a higher chance of being absorbed and credible if it was done by people of authority. But that means you can’t rein them in.” I.B.M. plays a more central role in some portions of the book than others. The company is most prominent in the section on computer science, where I.B.M. has an unrivaled record of breakthroughs in hardware and software over the years. In the section on the applications of technology, I.B.M. examples are often featured, but the main focus is on what Mr. O’Brien identifies as “the steps that constitute a model for how to instigate progress: seeing, mapping, understanding, believing and acting.” The authors seemed to appreciate the corporate-sponsored opportunity for in-depth research and writing. “This project was much more intellectually stimulating than anything I did at Business Week,” Mr. Hamm said. (Mr. Hamm is now employed by I.B.M.; Mr. Maney and Mr. O’Brien are not.) There is evidence that the book, published last Thursday, may find a market outside the I.B.M. orbit. Pearson printed an initial 13,000 copies for the retail market, and based mainly on preorders on Amazon ($18 in paperback; $10 Kindle), there have been two additional printings of 11,000 copies.</text></article>

Consumer technologies get all the attention these days, but the company has quietly thrived by selling to corporations and governments. Profits are strong, its portfolio of products and services looks robust, and its shares are near a record high. I.B.M.’s stock-market value passed Google’s earlier this year. Not bad for a corporate centenarian.Yet, not so long ago, I.B.M.’s corporate survival was at stake. In the early 1990s, it nearly ran out of money. Its mainframe business was reeling under pressure from the lower-cost technology of personal computing. New leadership was brought in, and thousands of workers were laid off. It was part of the company’s painful journey to what might be called “post-monopoly prosperity” — that is, a new path to corporate success once a dominant product is no longer the turbocharged engine of growth and profit it once was. “I.B.M. faced the challenge that all great companies do sooner or later — they dominate, they lose it, and then they re-create themselves or not,” observes George F. Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research. I.B.M. met the challenge, moved beyond the mainframe and built a business increasingly based on software and services. So as it celebrates a milestone, the company holds lessons for others. Evolving beyond past success is a daunting task for companies in all industries. But that problem is magnified in the technology arena, where companies can quickly rise to rule a market, seemingly invincible, until a shift in the technological landscape opens the door to a new generation of corporate dynamos. That is certainly the test that Microsoft is struggling with today, as it seeks growth beyond its lucrative stronghold in personal computer software. If they are to prosper for the long haul, Google and Apple, too, must reach beyond their dominant businesses. Each of these companies, in its way, is trying. So, then, what broader insights are to be drawn from the I.B.M. experience? One central message, according to industry experts, is this: Don’t walk away from your past. Build on it. The crucial building blocks, they say, are skills, technology and marketing assets that can be transferred or modified to pursue new opportunities. Those are a company’s core assets, they say, far more so than any particular product or service. In I.B.M.’s case, the prime assets included strong, long-term customer relationships, deep scientific and research capabilities and an unmatched breadth of technical skills in hardware, software and services. Though once a mainframe company, I.B.M. has recast itself as the supplier that can best manage and stitch together diverse technologies in modern data centers. Mainframes still have a role, and I.B.M. has invested heavily in them — $5 billion in mainframe research in the last decade — so that different kinds of software can run on them and new kinds of processors can plug into them. But it is the technology surrounding the mainframe that really pays off for I.B.M. today. Mainframe hardware alone accounts for less than 4 percent of its revenue. But when the software, storage and services contracts linked to mainframe computers are included, the figure rises to 25 percent — and as much as 45 percent of operating profit, estimates A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. I.B.M. has redirected its research labs and sales force to focus on services and software, retraining thousands of people, and supplementing in-house programs with acquisitions. In big, complex services contracts, from running smart-grid projects for utilities to traffic-management systems for cities, I.B.M. acts as a high-tech general contractor whose expertise spans research, software, hardware and services. These so-called Smarter Planet projects build on its legacy of broad technical skills and deep knowledge in fields like energy, transportation and health care. AT the moment, Microsoft is the tech company that most squarely confronts the post-monopoly predicament, as I.B.M. once did. Some of the similarities are striking, right down to the long-running federal antitrust suits that both companies endured. But unlike I.B.M. in the early 1990s, Microsoft is not a company in crisis. It is growing steadily and remains immensely profitable. It has nurtured new businesses beyond its lucrative stronghold in personal computer software: the Windows operating system and its Office programs for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations. Microsoft has invested for nearly two decades to build up business database software and server operating systems that run larger data-serving computers in data centers. An I.B.M. executive once declared that Microsoft’s attempt to move into data center computing would be its “Vietnam,” a humbling setback. And many analysts predicted that Microsoft would be thwarted in data centers by competition from Linux, the free operating system. 1 2 Next Page »AS it turned 100 last week, I.B.M. was looking remarkably spry. Consumer technologies get all the attention these days, but the company has quietly thrived by selling to corporations and governments. Profits are strong, its portfolio of products and services looks robust, and its shares are near a record high. I.B.M.’s stock-market value passed Google’s earlier this year. Not bad for a corporate centenarian.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/technology/10chip.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Researchers Create High-Speed Graphene Circuits<date>Published: June 9, 2011</date><text>I.B.M. researchers said Thursday that they had designed high-speed circuits from graphene, an ultra-thin material that has a host of promising applications, from high-bandwidth communication to a new generation of low-cost smartphone and television displays.The I.B.M. advance, which the researchers reported in the journal Science, is a circuit known as a broadband frequency mixer that was built on a wafer of silicon. Widely used in all kinds of communications products, the circuits shift signals from one frequency to another. In the Science paper, the I.B.M. researchers describe a demonstration in which they deposited several layers of graphene on a silicon wafer, then created circuits based on graphene transistors and components known as inductors. They demonstrated frequency mixing up to speeds of 10 gigahertz. In the past I.B.M. has created stand-alone graphene transistors, but not complete electronic circuits. Scientists began making flakes of graphene, an atomic-scale lattice of carbon atoms, in the 1970s. They have gradually refined the process so they can now produce films of the material that are just a single atom thick. The film arranges itself in a hexagon-shaped array of carbon atoms and has the advantages of being flexible, transparent and inexpensive to manufacture. But it is not yet a candidate to replace today’s CMOS transistors, the basis for the microprocessors and computer memories in consumer electronics systems. Graphene does not have the same physical properties as semiconducting materials and cannot be used to completely switch on and off in the way that logic transistors are meant to do. That has not tempered the industry’s excitement over potential applications for the material. In Europe and Asia, government and corporate investments are running far in advance of those in the United States, said Phaedon Avouris, an I.B.M. chemical physicist who is a leader of the company’s research effort. “Outside the U.S. there is a lot of interest,” he said. Both the European Union and South Korea have recently started $1.5 billion efforts to build industrial-scale efforts using graphene as a next-generation display material, he said. Singapore has also recently started a major investment in the material. I.B.M.’s research has been supported by a more modest effort financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon office that supports futuristic science and technology. (Graphene is being explored as a substitute for materials like gallium arsenide, used in high-frequency military communications equipment.) One promising application for graphene is in making new parts of the radio-frequency spectrum available for consumer electronics applications, said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering Inc., an industry consulting firm. “It allows you to tame a spectrum that before was the wild, wild West,” he said. For example, it might make possible a new class of Wi-Fi-style communications gear for wireless applications, or allow set-top cable boxes to be redesigned to send and receive ever-larger amounts of high-resolution video and data. Mr. Doherty added that display manufacturers were especially interested in graphene because the current wave of displays based on OLEDs, or organic light-emitting diodes, have limited lifespans. Last year, researchers at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea announced that they had scaled up a technique to make full-screen displays based on an approach to making graphene film pioneered at the University of Texas, Austin. The promise of the low cost of the material could also push graphene into today’s conventional consumer electronics systems. “In principle it can be made very cheap and it can be light-transparent,” Dr. Avouris said, “and so even if we don’t go for high frequency, I think it can revolutionize the price” of radio-frequency electronics. He acknowledged that while I.B.M. was now able to build circuits from the material, it was still learning reliable ways to make large quantities of graphene film. It is now possible to heat a silicon carbide wafer to about 1,300 degrees Celsius (nearly 2,400 Fahrenheit), causing the silicon atoms on the surface to evaporate and the remaining carbon atoms to rearrange themselves into the hexagonal graphene shape. But because of the cost of silicon carbide wafers, Dr. Avouris said, I.B.M. is looking for other ways to create graphene. Dr. Avouris said that as an I.B.M. researcher, he was not certain what the giant computer maker might do to commercialize the technology. Currently I.B.M. is not a major supplier of military electronics products.I.B.M. researchers said Thursday that they had designed high-speed circuits from graphene, an ultra-thin material that has a host of promising applications, from high-bandwidth communication to a new generation of low-cost smartphone and television displays.</text></article>

The fancy name for that bent is “systems thinking.” In the late 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Iacobucci was a software project leader at I.B.M., becoming the design chief on OS/2, a personal computer operating system developed jointly by I.B.M. and Microsoft. He was offered a senior technology post at Microsoft, but turned it down and left I.B.M. to found Citrix Systems in 1989. (The I.B.M.-Microsoft collaboration collapsed the next year, with Microsoft going its own way, with Windows.) Edward Iacobucci. founder of Virtual Works. Citrix embodied Mr. Iacobucci’s belief in server-based computing, and that it was often a better way to efficiently and securely deliver computing, even to PCs. That bet eventually proved correct, and Citrix is best known today for its server software that presents and controls the PC experience of many corporate users — an approach called “desktop virtualization.” In a way, Citrix offers a tightly managed, corporate version of cloud computing. Mr. Iacobucci left Citrix in 2000 to pursue another systems problem that fascinated him, aviation. And in 2002, he founded DayJet, an air taxi service, to bring on-demand jet travel to the masses. There was a lot of enthusiasm for the notion of more personalized jet travel, more like automobile travel. Books were written about the impending revolution of air travel, and DayJet was at the forefront. It never really did scale, though. DayJet shut down in 2008. Mr. Iacobucci’s current target is helping corporate workers and companies deal with “data sprawl,” the explosion of data and in so many forms that workers cannot find things. Documents, spreadsheets, presentations, e-mail messages, Web pages, video files, code files for developers — the list goes on and on. Mr. Iacobucci cites research showing that workers spend about 10 percent of their time just trying to find things, often without success. “The world for the information worker has gotten worse,” he said. “Today’s information environment is like huge library without a Dewey decimal system.” Mr. Iacobucci’s new company, Virtual Works, intends to provide a digital find-it tool for workers and companies. A key step was the purchase in 2009 of InfoFinder, maker of a corporate search technology. It was located in Trondheim, Norway, a Nordic hub of search know-how, the home of the core engineering team behind Fast Search and Transfer, which Microsoft bought for $1.2 billion in 2008. Google has recruited search engineers from the town, and more than half of Virtual Works’ staff of 40 live in Trondheim. The InfoFinder skills are being used to build a kind of meta-index that gives the user a view of disparate data in many places, making it searchable and findable. Mr. Iacobucci calls this “content virtualization.” The handful of experts that Mr. Iacobucci has briefed say he is trying to go well beyond the current field of document management software, by finding and presenting all kinds of data, wherever it resides. “Technically, I see where he’s going and it’s a worthy goal,” said Robin Bloor, president of the Bloor Group, a research firm. “But it doesn’t mean he’s going to be successful.” Virtual Works is starting to show off its “virtual index” technology to potential partners and customers. And products that will plug into popular workplace software like Microsoft’s Exchange and I.B.M.’s Lotus suite will be announced at the end of July, Mr. Iacobucci said. “The problem first and foremost is do I have a robust index or not,” he said.</text></article>

The manager asked a colleague if this was proper, according to a report by the office of the special investigator for city schools. The colleague said others at I.B.M. were also concerned, with one saying he “did not trust Lanham.” But Mr. Lanham, known as Ross, assured I.B.M. that he had spoken with a supervisor at the Education Department, who “was O.K. with it,” and the matter was taken no further. The supervisor would later tell investigators he did not recall such a conversation. It was the first of several warning signs about Mr. Lanham, whom investigators have accused of stealing $3.6 million from the city through marked-up billings using a complex scheme of contractors and subcontractors, including I.B.M. and Verizon. But because of Mr. Lanham’s unchecked power over the project, which the city was paying him $200,000 a year to oversee, virtually all of the suspicions came to naught. The companies assumed that if Mr. Lanham said it was fine, the city had approved it. The case, which comes on the heels of an $80 million fraud prosecution involving consultants on another city project, the CityTime automated payroll system, illustrates again the vast amounts of money the city is spending on technology, and the trust it was putting in independent consultants. The Education Department said that once Mr. Lanham’s activities came to light, it added controls to prevent a recurrence. On his weekly radio show on Friday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the alleged theft “unconscionable.” “Whenever there’s fraud, you can look back and say, ‘We should have looked there,’ ” he said. “But keep in mind the city has a budget of $65 billion a year, with lots and lots of contracts and lots of opportunities.” The Department of Education has vowed to recover the money, Verizon and I.B.M. have pledged to cooperate with the investigation and Mr. Lanham, through his lawyer, professed his innocence after he surrendered to federal authorities on Thursday on charges of theft and fraud. Mr. Lanham’s lawyer, Joseph W. Ryan Jr., said Friday that the time it took the city to fire him “should be interpreted as a sign that he acted in good faith and within the law.” During the six-year period when the authorities say he stole the money, Mr. Lanham was apparently left to operate on his own. “It is difficult to understand how the D.O.E. could allow so much power to reside in a consultant, even an honest one, which Mr. Lanham was not,” the city’s investigative report said. The authorities said Mr. Lanham eventually hired five workers, including his brother Robert, to do data entry and billing analysis on the project, paying them $30 to $70 as consultants through Lanham Enterprises. Lanham Enterprises would then submit highly marked-up bills to another company, which in turn submitted marked-up bills to Verizon or I.B.M. Those companies then marked the bills up further when they submitted them to the department at rates as high as $290 an hour, according to investigators. The city’s report suggests that the companies marked up the bills with Mr. Lanham’s approval. None of the companies have been accused of any crime. As the invoices traveled from one company to the next, the actual work performed by the five employees became more muddled and harder to discern. Lanham Enterprises described them as “telecommunications consultants” on its bills. The companies that paid Lanham often billed Verizon or I.B.M for “consulting services,” but Verizon’s bills to the department did not refer consultants. According to the report, the bills mentioned things like “installations-integration services” and referred to the consultants as “multiple” or “various” on the spreadsheets that were supposed to have detailed the nature of the work. Still, the city paid the bills. A Verizon manager acknowledged to investigators that Mr. Lanham had threatened to steer its work to I.B.M. if Verizon did not agree to use one of the intermediary companies, Custom Computer Specialists of Hauppauge, that Mr. Lanham wanted them to use. In 2006, the president of a company that had managed the project before Mr. Lanham called the Education Department and accused him of receiving kickbacks from the companies with which he worked. Mr. Lanham was dismissed in 2008, but it took more than two years to build a criminal case against him.Sometime in 2002, a manager at I.B.M., which was working on a large project to wire New York City schools for the Internet, noticed something unusual about payments the company was making for some workers.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/nyregion/consultant-to-schools-stole-millions-officials-say.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Consultant to Schools Stole Millions, Officials Say<date>Published: April 28, 2011</date><text>Aided by lax oversight and by corporations that profited from his scheme, a former technology consultant stole $3.6 million over six years from the Department of Education to finance flashy cars and real estate speculation, federal authorities said on Thursday.The investigation revealed another embarrassing lack of supervision in one of the city’s technology projects, just four months after federal authorities charged seven people in what they called an $80 million scheme to steal from CityTime, an automated payroll system that ballooned in cost to more than $700 million, nearly 10 times over budget. It also comes as the Education Department plans to invest more than half a billion dollars next year to upgrade Internet access in every school. As in the CityTime case, the charges revealed on Thursday revealed the enormous responsibilities and power given to technology consultants working on city projects. The former consultant, Willard Lanham, 58, surrendered to federal authorities on Thursday on charges of mail fraud and theft from a billion-dollar school-wiring and Internet-access project financed partly by the federal government. Mr. Lanham, who was being paid $200,000 a year by the city, used layers of contractors and subcontractors to hide his scheme, and each of them profited a little from it, according to the federal complaint. He hired several people, including a brother, to work on the city contract, then billed another company for those hires, marking up the invoices. The company, for its part, charged Verizon or I.B.M., the two major vendors, more than what it had paid Mr. Lanham. According to a report by Richard J. Condon, a special investigator for the city schools, Verizon and I.B.M., in turn, billed the Education Department, also marking up the amounts. Verizon marked up the bills by $800,000, and I.B.M. by $400,000, said Mr. Condon’s report, which he had forwarded to the federal authorities. “I.B.M. and Verizon, by their silence, facilitated this fraud,” the report said. The companies have not been implicated in the criminal case, and none of their employees have been charged. In statements, both Verizon and I.B.M. said they had been cooperating with the authorities. Verizon went a step further, saying it was “prepared to return any inappropriate profits” to the Education Department. A lawyer for Mr. Lanham, Joseph W. Ryan, said in a statement that his client “denies that he is guilty of any wrongdoing,” calling him a “problem-solver extraordinaire” for the projects he managed for the department. Mr. Lanham, known as Ross, was hired as a consultant for the Education Department in 2000, part of a team charged with handling the installation of Internet cables and connections in city schools, as well as a cost-savings system to centralize the department’s telephone bill payments. By 2002, he had become the projects’ manager, in charge of a costly contract and many people, with seemingly no oversight. Just around that time, leadership of the schools’ technology team was shifting and, according to Mr. Condon, Mr. Lanham set out to operate freely, putting in motion a scheme that would go undetected for years, though some people began having suspicions about him. He often met vendors alone and e-mailed them without giving copies to anyone at the Education Department. In all, he hired five consultants, including his brother, who worked from home and made $60 to $70 an hour. Mr. Lanham billed a cabling subcontractor, Custom Design Communications, an hourly rate of $225, pocketing the difference. That company billed Verizon roughly $250 an hour, then Verizon billed the Education Department $290, all for the same work, Mr. Condon’s report says. The scheme developed in much the same way with every consultant Mr. Lanham hired and every subcontractor and vendor he coaxed into playing along, including I.B.M., the report said. The federal complaint says that with the money he made, Mr. Lanham and his wife bought a Corvette, a Porsche and other equally expensive cars, and he tried his hand at real estate, building luxurious homes on a piece of land he owned on eastern Long Island. Mr. Condon’s report said that Verizon officials questioned Mr. Lanham’s demand to bring in Custom Design Communications as a subcontractor, but acquiesced after he threatened to give their work to I.B.M. (Two phone numbers are listed for Custom Design Communications, but neither line was in service Thursday, and the company’s Web site was disabled.) Mr. Lanham was fired in 2008, roughly two years after Mr. Condon’s office received anonymous complaints that he was getting kickbacks from vendors. The investigators could not find evidence of kickbacks, but while checking the accusations, they discovered that I.B.M. had been billing the Education Department for work performed by consultants hired by Mr. Lanham without authorization. The case broadened in 2008, after a senior director at the department’s Division of Instructional and Information Technology accused Mr. Lanham of hiring consultants and having their work billed by Verizon. The schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, said in a statement, “We are entrusted with the public’s money, and should have been more vigilant in our oversight of this project.” After Mr. Lanham was fired, the department said, it rolled out new safeguards against rogue consultants, including an in-house contract manager responsible for approving and monitoring purchases and payments and a unit charged with carrying out price and cost analyses for contracted services. Mr. Lanham surrendered at 10 a.m. Thursday and appeared in court for a few minutes later in the day. United States Magistrate Judge Theodore H. Katz set bond at $250,000 and ordered Mr. Lanham to surrender his passport, get a job and not incur any new lines of credit. Noah Rosenberg contributed reporting.Aided by lax oversight and by corporations that profited from his scheme, a former technology consultant stole $3.6 million over six years from the Department of Education to finance flashy cars and real estate speculation, federal authorities said on Thursday.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/business/20ibm.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Tops Estimates and Raises Its Profit Forecast<date>Published: April 19, 2011</date><text>I.B.M. has become a model of predictably solid financial performance, reporting a modest increase in revenue but a greater increase in profit.The giant supplier of corporate technology delivered first-quarter results on Tuesday that fit the pattern — with a bit extra as profit and revenue exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. I.B.M. also raised its forecast for operating profit for the year, to “at least $13.15” a share. The earlier guidance was for “at least $13” a share. In a statement, Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief executive, said the company saw “excellent momentum” in areas it had pegged for higher growth, including business intelligence software and emerging markets abroad. I.B.M. reported that net income rose 10 percent in the quarter to $2.9 billion. Its earnings rose more, by 17 percent, to $2.31 a share, reflecting fewer shares outstanding as a result of the company’s stock repurchase program. And its operating earnings, the figure tracked most closely by Wall Street analysts, rose 21 percent to $2.41 a share. The earnings performance easily surpassed the average estimate by analysts of $2.30 a share, as compiled by FactSet Research. The company reported revenue of $24.6 billion, an increase of 5 percent, after adjusting for currency gains. The sales figure was above Wall Street’s average estimate of $24 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, I.B.M. had revenue of $22.9 billion. I.B.M. had strong results in most of its businesses, including hardware, as a new generation of mainframes sold strongly. Revenue from the big computers was up 41 percent from a year ago. The one question mark, analysts said, was lower than expected new contract signings in the company’s big services business, a possible indication of weakness ahead. “It was a classic I.B.M. quarter, showing the company’s ability to produce solid earnings,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “The only concern is the soft services signings.” I.B.M.’s quarterly performance, analysts said, was another nod to the success of a strategy begun long ago. That strategy emphasizes profits ahead of revenue growth, aggressively pursuing high-growth markets overseas, and offering customers a tightly integrated bundle of hardware, software and services. And I.B.M. has an unwavering focus on the corporate and government markets. For more than a decade, I.B.M. has delivered gains in earnings per share of more than 10 percent, while revenue has increased about 3 percent a year. Cost cutting and share buybacks are part of the answer, analysts say, but so is the steady move into higher-margin businesses and new markets. These include applying research and computing to help governments tackle challenges like traffic management, water conservation and energy use. Last week, for example, I.B.M. announced a deal with the California Department of Transportation to build systems for predicting and managing traffic. Technology markets are known for rapid, unpredictable turns. Yet I.B.M. issues five-year plans and pretty much sticks to them. The current plan, running to 2015, singles out a few market niches for high growth. One sector earmarked for growth is cloud computing, the technology industry’s buzz term for tapping into computing resources and information in big data centers remotely over the Internet from anywhere, as if the services were in a cloud. I.B.M forecasts that its cloud business will reach $7 billion by 2015. Another market singled out for rapid expansion is the business of helping companies mine data for useful information such as using Web traffic and social-network postings to guide marketing, sales, manufacturing and purchasing decisions. The software for mining vast data troves is called business intelligence or analytics software. In the last five years, I.B.M. has spent $14 billion acquiring 25 specialist companies in analytics. The company’s analytics unit now employs 8,000 consultants and 200 mathematicians. “The biggest change facing corporations is the explosion of data,” said David Grossman, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “The best business is in helping customers analyze and manage all that data, and I.B.M. is making a big push there.” In a conference call, Mark Loughridge, the chief financial officer, described Watson, I.B.M.’s Jeopardy-playing supercomputer, as a triumph of the company’s skills in analytics. In February, Watson beat two human Jeopardy champions. “We didn’t invest just to play Jeopardy,” he said. “We invested to provide leadership applications for our clients.” I.B.M. said its analytics business grew 20 percent in the quarter. The 2015 goal for that business is $16 billion. I.B.M. has a large business in Japan, about 11 percent of its total revenue, or more than $10 billion a year. Yet despite the exposure to Japan, I.B.M. had little impact in the first quarter from the tsunami and earthquake on March 11. Three-quarters of I.B.M.’s business in Japan is in services, which are typically sold under contracts lasting a year or more. “Services tend to be more stable in turbulent times,” Mr. Loughridge said.I.B.M. has become a model of predictably solid financial performance, reporting a modest increase in revenue but a greater increase in profit.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/business/15cloud.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Business Wakes Up to Cloud Computing<date>Published: April 14, 2011</date><text>The big spenders on technology are businesses and government agencies. They buy about 75 percent of the computing goods and services sold worldwide. Yet it is increasingly evident they are not driving the new ideas, excitement and powerhouse technology companies in ascent these days.“The cutting edge of innovation is on the consumer side — digital technologies for consumption activity, play, entertainment and social-networked communication — and not in corporations anymore,” observed Timothy F. Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford. Nowhere is that more apparent than in cloud computing, the technology industry’s buzz term for customers’ accessing information held in big data centers remotely over the Internet from anywhere, as if the services were in a cloud. In the early days of computers, technology advanced because of government-financed research projects and work in corporate laboratories. Hobbyists developed the first personal computers, but it was only when I.B.M. entered the field in 1981, lending its seal of approval, that the PC industry really took off. Selling to businesses paved the way for the leading PC software and chip suppliers, Microsoft and Intel, to become giant corporations. But marquee companies of the Internet era have made their names and fortunes mainly in the consumer market — both the first-generation Web winners like Amazon and Google, and the second-generation successes like Facebook and Twitter. And they have grown big and grown fast by offering search, shopping and social-networking services in the cloud. Cloud computing, though, is more than a hyper-efficient means of distributing digital services. The cloud model is animated by a set of Internet technologies for juggling computing workloads in data centers far more efficiently than in the past — potentially reducing costs by about half, analysts say. Yet to date, the large, established technology companies — and their businesses and government customers — have trailed in cloud computing. The marketing of the cloud, analysts say, is way ahead of real offerings by suppliers and its adoption by business customers. But there are some recent signs of change. Last week, I.B.M. introduced a range of cloud services, including paying for computing resources like processing and storage on a metered pay-for-use formula, almost as if modeled on an electric utility. I.B.M. will offer customers an à la carte menu, in which they pay for different levels of guaranteed security, support and availability. I.B.M., a bellwether in the corporate technology market, forecasts that it will have $7 billion in cloud revenue by 2015. Of the total, $4 billion will be customers shifting to cloud delivery from the company’s traditional software and services, and $3 billion is expected to be entirely new business. “We’re moving to where the puck is going in this industry,” said Steven A. Mills, I.B.M.’s senior vice president for software and hardware. “And we’re more than willing to make this transition.” In another industry move announced last week, Dell said that it would invest $1 billion over the next two years to build 10 new data centers and expand customer support, largely for cloud offerings. The largest single customer for computing goods and services, the United States government, endorsed the cloud model this year. Vivek Kundra, the White House chief information officer, wrote a “Federal Cloud Computing Strategy” report, and identified $20 billion, or one quarter of the government’s total spending on information technology, as “a potential target” for migration to the cloud. That document has certainly caught the attention of the government’s technology suppliers, like Lockheed Martin, the largest. “We’re keenly focused on cloud computing,” said Melvin Greer, a senior fellow at Lockheed Martin. Still, the outlook is for an evolutionary shift toward the new technology spanning several years, even a decade or more, analysts say. People set the pace of technology adoption, and corporate data centers are filled with people whose skills and livelihoods are based on older technology and ways of doing things. But technology managers, surveys show, are also genuinely concerned about security, reliability and liability if confidential corporate data resides on another company’s computers — and getting locked into proprietary clouds, controlled by one company. Standards groups are moving to set technical rules for sharing data across different clouds, including a working group established last week by the IEEE, a professional electronic and computer engineering organization. 1 2 Next Page »The big spenders on technology are businesses and government agencies.

But if he does, the controversies of his governorship will follow him. He took some heat for aggressive plans to privatize parts of state government but urged lawmakers to delay passing controversial right-to-work legislation. Now, there’s a contentious legal battle with I.B.M., which is being sued by the governor over a canceled $1.3 billion contract to modernize the state’s welfare system. In blunt language, a company lawyer charges Mr. Daniels with hypocrisy for claiming to run a “transparent” government but refusing to release documents or be deposed in the case. A lawyer for the state says there are many others who can testify besides the governor. A spokeswoman for Mr. Daniels declined to comment for an article in The Indianapolis Star. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: March 23, 2011 An earlier version of this post said Mr. Daniels pushed right-to-work legislation.

The S.E.C. said that the bribes, which included travel and entertainment, occurred from 1998 through 2009 in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. “Deficient internal controls allowed employees of I.B.M.’s subsidiaries and joint venture to use local business partners and travel agencies as conduits for bribes or other improper payments to South Korean and Chinese government officials over long periods of time,” the S.E.C. said in the complaint. The payments were made by employees at three subsidiaries of I.B.M., as well as the LG IBM PC Company, a joint venture with LG Electronics, according to the lawsuit. The S.E.C. said cash payments to South Korean officials from 1998 to 2003 totaled $207,000 and were connected to contracts worth almost $54 million. Some of the money paid to Korean officials was delivered in shopping bags at specific drop-off locations, like restaurant or apartment parking lots. In China, the I.B.M. employees created “slush funds” at travel agencies that were used to pay for overseas excursions by government officials. I.B.M. employees also gave gifts, like cameras and laptop computers, to Chinese officials, the S.E.C. claimed. The S.E.C. lawsuit did not say what I.B.M. received from China. “I.B.M. insists on the highest ethical standards in the conduct of its business and requires all employees to follow its policies and procedures for conducting business,” Doug Shelton, an I.B.M. spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.The International Business Machines Corporation, the computer services provider, agreed on Friday to pay $10 million to settle claims that it gave cash and gifts to Chinese and South Korean officials in connection with about $54 million in government contracts.</text></article>

They can be so remarkably smart at times, yet so bafflingly dumb at others.This riddle of digital deduction has been center stage recently. Just over a week ago, for instance, the Internet search giant Google announced that it was making a major overhaul of its formula for ranking Web sites. The company said it was demoting “low quality” Web sites, designed mainly to lure traffic from Google’s search engine and attract advertising revenue. It was a move to improve the quality of search, but also an admission that Google, the trusted curator of the Web, was being outwitted. The week before, I.B.M.’s question-answering computer Watson drubbed two of the best human players in the history of “Jeopardy!” Yet on the way to victory, Watson occasionally gave answers so seemingly absurd that audience members were left laughing and shaking their heads. Computers are only as smart as their algorithms — man-made software recipes for calculation, the basic building blocks of computerized thought. When running on powerful computers, a clever algorithm can perform amazing feats. Google’s algorithm handles one billion search queries a day. But algorithms are often brittle and simple-minded, doggedly following their step-by-step formulas as if with blinders. They can be amazingly good at set tasks — playing chess, scanning the Web, simulating weather patterns. But they are typically unable to process what humans effortlessly understand — nuance, background knowledge, common sense about things in the physical world. Expanding the horizons of computer intelligence — mimicking human understanding in more realms — is one of the grand challenges in science. I.B.M.’s Watson and Google’s algorithmic makeover highlight not only the accelerating pace of recent progress, but also how much remains to be accomplished. Researchers at those two companies, a handful of others, and at several universities are leading the way. Their work often focuses on language — programming computers to recognize words and also understand the meaning of words, in their way. Think of it as the Education of the Algorithm. The machines, lacking the background knowledge and life experience of humans, use statistical models to reach results similar to the ones people reach, if by different means. With an analogy to flying, Frederick Jelinek, a pioneer in speech recognition, once explained, “Airplanes don’t flap their wings.” The explosion of language on the Web, in text and audio, has given the statistical algorithms a rich training ground for improvement. Ever-faster computers help as well. But parsing and categorizing language, with its ambiguity and subtlety, remains a formidable hurdle for computers. So the challenge facing Watson was far greater than the one I.B.M. overcame in 1997 with its Deep Blue chess-playing computer, which beat the world champion Garry Kasparov. “It’s a lot more difficult for a computer to understand language at the level of an 8-year-old than to beat a grandmaster at chess,” observed Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. A computer, of course, cannot really understand words. Instead, its algorithms scan mountains of text seeking patterns and probabilities, like how often a certain word appears close to other words in documents. For example, Watson needed a “pun detector” because puns are regularly used in “Jeopardy!” clues. Using statistical pattern-matching, Watson, for example, recognized that the phrase “holy city” was more likely to be St. Paul than, say, South Bend. Algorithms are coded short cuts to certain ends, with assumptions, goals and perhaps even values built in. People tend to think of technology, like the algorithm, as impartial. But Helen Nissenbaum, a professor of media, culture and communication at New York University, calls the interplay between technology and its consequences “values by design.” In Internet search and commerce, the priorities are to quickly deliver information to a user, and to present a potential customer to an advertiser. Those are perfectly practical and reasonable goals, but also fairly narrow ones. Google is constantly refining its algorithm, though rarely as significantly as the recent overhaul, expected to alter the rankings on 12 percent of searches. Its algorithm is a tightly guarded trade secret, but it relies heavily on linking search terms to noun phrases in a Web page — as well as the popularity of a site and how often other sites link to it. 1 2 Next Page »To humans, computer intelligence is a puzzle, as if the machines have split personalities.

    <article index="2" href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/a-long-deep-view-of-the-u-s-budget/?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">A Long, Deep View of the U.S. Budget<date>February 22, 2011, 1:42 pm</date><text>I thought the Obama White House had brought something useful to the budget debate with its visual depiction of United States spending — which revealed the profound growth in politically untouchable programs and the almost invisible dimensions of programs on education, research, innovation, development assistance and the like. What’s revealed vividly, of course, is that political fights over cutting those programs are not only threatening many worthy — and modest — efforts, but distracting the public completely from what economists of many stripes say is one of the core challenges attending living within our means. But the post demonstrated, yet again, why I consider myself an unabashedly selfish blogger. It almost immediately elicited a better approach to displaying this information, which you can see below. The chart, which can be probed for more detail, examines spending sectors as fractions of gross domestic product. Better yet, this visualization of the budget was done with a tool that’s usable by anybody with data and a passion for communication — IBM’s Many Eyes tool kit. In this case, the creator was “Dennis,” a blogger from Huntsville, Ala., whose day job is long-term planning for NASA (he’s not super anonymous). Here’s the post he wrote on this and another view of the country’s spending preferences, and gaps. On a related front, Bryan Walsh of Time Magazine has posted an interesting look at another arena in which humans seem to be blissfully spending beyond their means — in our intensifying exploitation of the world’s natural capital. As he explains: What’s amazing to me, though, is that the very politicians who are so worried about the public debt — and who want deep spending cuts now to save our future, whatever the cost — utterly dismiss the idea that we could face an equal crisis of natural debt. You can read the rest here. Most of Walsh’s criticism is focused on the Republicans using the debt issue as an excuse to cut into programs that offend them, including American support for the budget of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and public broadcasting.</text></article>

Tags: Artificial Intelligence, computers, Philosophy Last week brought the story of a fourth grader who was suspended from school for having placed a “kick me please” post-it on the backside of a classmate. The punishment, The New York Post reported, was delivered by the school principal who said in a note to the boy’s parents, “This incident is in violation of the Discipline Code and is classified as infraction A37 — engaging in bullying behavior.” The code was part of a “zero tolerance” policy adopted by the New York City school system and its application in this case tells us what zero tolerance means. It means no deviation from a precisely and narrowly formulated rule. “Narrowly formulated” is  redundant because a rule is supposed to be narrow in a way that leaves very little if any latitude for interpretation.  A rule does not encourage one to ask if the fourth grader’s act was bullying or teasing; if it fits the physical description of bullying, then bullying or infraction A37 is what it is. A rule  is an “all or nothing” proposition; it lays down the law and admits of no exceptions that might be claimed on the basis of  all the considerations it purposely excludes. When strong First-Amendment types encounter  an argument for regulating speech in certain circumstances, they  respond by asking (rhetorically), “What part of ‘make no law’ don’t you understand ?” That’s what’s good about a rule; it stands as a bulwark against the instability and unpredictability that come along with making decisions case-by-case. The inability or unwillingness of human beings to follow rules or be content with their guidance is not a weakness but a strength. That’s also why people — human beings — have trouble keeping to the rules. Human beings are always  thinking, “Yes, I know the rule, but surely those who crafted it would agree that in the situation I now face, it should be relaxed” or “I know the rules of this game but if I obey them slavishly I’m likely to lose, so why don’t I bend them creatively and see if I can get away with it.” And then there are the familiar conundrums: The rule is no jaywalking, but only by jaywalking will I have a chance of saving the dog that is about to be hit by a car. Or I know the rule is don’t lie, but telling the truth now might endanger an innocent person. Or the rule is don’t travel at a speed above 25 miles per hour in the city limits, but my wife is about to give birth. The rule we find unhelpful (or inconvenient) was written with a particular set of circumstances in mind,  but circumstances  not contemplated by the rule-makers will always turn up. When they do, rule aficionados will say, “Well, we can emend it and make it more supple by adding to the circumstances it covers.  But you can never add enough; the proliferation of circumstances  always outruns the efforts to take account of them, and after a while you’ve reached the point when every situation will require a rewriting of the rule, which means that there will no longer be a rule at all. If you have followed the argument so far, you will have anticipated its next turn, which is to say that the inability or unwillingness of human beings to follow rules or be content with their guidance is not a weakness but a strength; it is the strength of being being able to adjust when the rules have nothing helpful to say or produce absurd results in a situation  the rule-makers did not  anticipate. Only a fool will persist in adhering to a rule or set of directives when its application is clearly counter-intuitive and even disastrous. Those who are not fools will think that this is a new game — a new situation — and it calls for new strategies, different calculations of what will and will not work. The computer I am writing this column on is a fool. It has a program that directs it to finish words before I do by “consulting” a data base of words I have used  that begin with the letters I have already typed.  “Consulting” is  in quotation marks  because the computer isn’t doing anything that requires intelligence as opposed to calculation; it is sorting through data and matching the data it has stored with the data of my initially chosen  letters. It is almost always wrong because its procedures do not track my practice. I am not self-consciously generating a pattern of statistical frequencies. I am producing words that have been chosen because they contribute to the realization of a governing idea or a compositional plan. In fact, to say that the computer is wrong  is to give it more credit than it deserves; for right and wrong are not what it does; what it does is count (faster than I or anyone else could) and match. What it doesn’t do is begin with an awareness of a situation and an overall purpose and look around for likely courses of action within that awareness. That is because, as the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus explained almost 40 years ago,  a “computer is not in a situation” (“What Computers Can’t Do”); it has no holistic sense of context and no ability to to survey  possibilities from a contextual perspective; it doesn’t begin with  what Wittgenstein terms a “form of life,”  but must build up a form of life, a world, from the only thing it has and is, “bits of context-free, completely determinate data.” And since the data, no matter how large in quantity, can never add up to a context  and will always remain discrete bits, the world can never be built. What computers can’t do, we don’t have to do because  the worlds we live in are already built; we  don’t walk around putting discrete items together until they add up to  a context; we walk around with a contextual sense — a sense of where we are and what’s at stake and what our resources are — already in place;  we  inhabit worldly spaces already organized by purposes, projects and expectations. The computer inhabits nothing and has no purposes and because it has no purposes it cannot alter its present (wholly predetermined) “behavior” when it  fails to advance the purposes it doesn’t have. When as human beings we determine that  “the data coming in make no sense”  relative to what we want to do, we can, Dreyfus explains “try a new total hypothesis,” begin afresh. A computer, in contrast, “could at best be programmed to try out a series of hypotheses to see which best fit the fixed data.” That’s what Watson — the I.B.M.-built computer that won a game of  “Jeopardy” last week over two human opponents — does. It’s just a bigger and fancier version of my laptop’s totally annoying program. It decomposes the question put to it into discrete bits of data and then searches its vast data base for statistically frequent combinations of the bits it is working with.  The achievement is impressive but it is a wholly formal achievement that involves no knowledge (the computer doesn’t know anything in the relevant sense of “know”); and it does not come within a million miles of replicating  the achievements of everyday human thought. Watson’s builders know this; when they are interviewed they are careful to stay away from claims that their creation simulates human mental processes (although they also murmur something about future hopes). But those in charge of the artificial intelligence hype are not so careful and they delight in exciting us and frightening us with the fiction of a machine that can think. It’s great theater, or in Watson’s case, great television, but that’s all it is.</text></article>

If you're like us here at Bucks, you probably found this sentence most enticing in our article on Thursday about I.B.M.'s Watson supercomputer beating two humans on ''Jeopardy'': ''I.B.M. executives also said they are in discussions with a major consumer electronics retailer to develop a version of Watson, named after I.B.M.'s founder, Thomas J. Watson, that would be able to interact with consumers on a variety of subjects like buying decisions and technical support.'' As I imagined all of the time this could save at, say, Best Buy, my mind wandered to this question: What other areas of consumer life could Watson make easier? Here are a few ideas: BIG-BOX STORES At stores like Wal-Mart and Target, Watson could tell you the location of every item and even draw you a map of the exact place in the aisle where it lives. THE POST OFFICE Watson could offer fact-based tax advice on April 15 and other dates when people are rushing to fill out their forms and get them into the mail. TRANSIT CENTERS Watson could relieve some of the lines that tend to form at train station information booths where humans sit and give directions. STADIUMS Watson could tell you where your seats are and get you to the food concession that has the Polish sausage. That last one came from my colleague Steve Lohr, who also offered a different list: some places where he wouldn't want a smart butler to turn up. Watson would probably not make a good sommelier, for instance. RON LIEBER COMMENTSRather than these trivial pursuits you'd be better off hoping Watson is your next doctor. Doctors do not deal in ''creativity,'' or shouldn't. They should always know all the right questions to ask regarding any patient and know how to correctly interpret them and calculate very accurately the odds of the accuracy of any diagnosis. Watson can be trained to do those all flawlessly. Few, if any, doctors can. -- AH2, New York I hope (s)he never appears beside my hospital bed. -- David S., New York Online, helping me pick out last-minute gifts. -- Jeff, Atlanta I worked for I.B.M. for eight years, and I can tell you Watson would never replace humans to do the things you mentioned above. Watson won on ''Jeopardy,'' and that's all it will be able to do. -- Joe, San Jose, Calif. On ''Jeopardy,'' Watson's success/ came largely 'cause humans can't press/ the buzzer with speed,/although we concede/ we know that it's no GPS. -- JD, Connecticut Car Shopping: New Strategy If you're in the market for a new car and don't want to buy it online, here's a helpful car shopping tip from Edmunds.com: When you walk into the dealer, ask to work with an Internet sales specialist rather than the traditional staff. According to Edmunds.com, this strategy can lead to savings of ''hundreds or even thousands of dollars on your next new car.'' The tip is based off the experience of Philip Reed, senior consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com. Mr. Reed got a quote on a 2011 Sienna SE that was $500 over invoice, well below the average price other buyers pay for the vehicle. Mr. Reed, who detailed his experience on Edmunds.com, wrote that the Internet salesman told him he had saved so much because the deal ''didn't go through the finance and insurance office,'' as is usually the case, and the dealership didn't get a chance to push additional services. So how do you make sure you get to see the Internet sales staff? Mr. Reed recommended scheduling a test drive with the dealership's Internet manager and requesting that the document preparation be handled by the Internet manager, among other tips. JENNIFER SARANOW SCHULTZ COMMENTSOf course you can deal with the Internet sales manager. His name is Watson. -- Technic Ally, Toronto After you have decided exactly what car you want and what, if any, additional features you want, spend a half day going to three (no more and no less) dealers. Tell them you are shopping today at three dealers. Tell them you will be buying the car in one week. If they say they'll give you a good price now if you commit now, tell them you'll take the price but you still are not buying for one week, until you know, for sure, which of the three is giving you the best price. The following week, get on the phone again to each, remind them who you are, and tell them you are buying the car today and will buy from whichever sweetens the deal the most. -- NR9, U.S.A. The Internet salesperson is also useful if you live in an area with only one dealer of the car you want to buy. Twice, I've taken to my local dealer detailed Internet exchanges with an Internet salesperson 400 miles away, and the local dealer matched the deal. I owe the Internet salesperson my next purchase, though. -- Maqroll, North Florida The best way to save money at the dealership is to buy a car that meets 95 percent of your needs -- and then rent vehicles that meet the other 5 percent. -- Lonely Pedant, Dallas A Fee Break For Travelers There is more good news for international travelers tired of fees that credit card companies tack on when merchants process a transaction outside the United States. Chase announced this week that it would no longer levy such currency conversion fees on its high-end United Mileage Plus Club Visa and Continental Presidential Plus cards. If you have a Chase United or Continental card with a different name, you will probably continue to pay the fee for transactions outside the United States, though you could call the company to clarify this. While plenty of card companies continue to levy these fees, the momentum is clearly swinging toward getting rid of them. Chase had already dropped the fees on British Airways, Priority Club and Hyatt co-branded credit cards. Citigroup has done so on select cards, and American Express has announced plans for a similar move. RON LIEBER COMMENTSYou (and many others) are missing a critical element. It's not a cause for celebration until we've made sure that Chase is not simply giving less favorable foreign exchange rates to its customers now. -- Jim, Philadelphia Very disappointed this does not extend to the Mileage Plus Select Visa. -- Petemoss14, Munich PHOTO: This week, Ken Jennings, who won a record 74 consecutive ''Jeopardy'' games, lost to Watson, a computer made by I.B.M.

Facing certain defeat at the hands of a room-size I.B.M. computer on Wednesday evening, Ken Jennings, famous for winning 74 games in a row on the TV quiz show, acknowledged the obvious. ''I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords,'' he wrote on his video screen, borrowing a line from a ''Simpsons'' episode. From now on, if the answer is ''the computer champion on ''Jeopardy!,'' the question will be, ''What is Watson?'' For I.B.M., the showdown was not merely a well-publicized stunt and a $1 million prize, but proof that the company has taken a big step toward a world in which intelligent machines will understand and respond to humans, and perhaps inevitably, replace some of them. Watson, specifically, is a ''question answering machine'' of a type that artificial intelligence researchers have struggled with for decades -- a computer akin to the one on ''Star Trek'' that can understand questions posed in natural language and answer them. Watson showed itself to be imperfect, but researchers at I.B.M. and other companies are already developing uses for Watson's technologies that could have a significant impact on the way doctors practice and consumers buy products. ''Cast your mind back 20 years and who would have thought this was possible?'' said Edward Feigenbaum, a Stanford University computer scientist and a pioneer in the field. In its ''Jeopardy!'' project, I.B.M. researchers were tackling a game that requires not only encyclopedic recall, but also the ability to untangle convoluted and often opaque statements, a modicum of luck, and quick, strategic button pressing. The contest, which was taped in January here at the company's T. J. Watson Research Laboratory before an audience of I.B.M. executives and company clients, played out in three televised episodes concluding Wednesday. At the end of the first day, Watson was in a tie with Brad Rutter, another ace human player, at $5,000 each, with Mr. Jennings trailing with $2,000. But on the second day, Watson went on a tear. By night's end, Watson had a commanding lead with a total of $35,734, compared with Mr. Rutter's $10,400 and Mr. Jennings's $4,800. Victory was not cemented until late in the third match, when Watson was in Nonfiction. ''Same category for $1,200,'' it said in a manufactured tenor, and lucked into a Daily Double. Mr. Jennings grimaced. Even later in the match, however, had Mr. Jennings won another key Daily Double it might have come down to Final Jeopardy, I.B.M. researchers acknowledged. The final tally was $77,147 to Mr. Jennings's $24,000 and Mr. Rutter's $21,600. More than anything, the contest was a vindication for the academic field of artificial intelligence, which began with great promise in the 1960s with the vision of creating a thinking machine and which became the laughingstock of Silicon Valley in the 1980s, when a series of heavily financed start-up companies went bankrupt. Despite its intellectual prowess, Watson was by no means omniscient. On Tuesday evening during Final Jeopardy, the category was U.S. Cities and the clue was: ''Its largest airport is named for a World War II hero; its second largest for a World War II battle.'' Watson drew guffaws from many in the television audience when it responded ''What is Toronto?????'' The string of question marks indicated that the system had very low confidence in its response, I.B.M. researchers said, but because it was Final Jeopardy, it was forced to give a response. The machine did not suffer much damage. It had wagered just $947 on its result. (The correct answer is, ''What is Chicago?'') ''We failed to deeply understand what was going on there,'' said David Ferrucci, an I.B.M. researcher who led the development of Watson. ''The reality is that there's lots of data where the title is U.S. cities and the answers are countries, European cities, people, mayors. Even though it says U.S. cities, we had very little confidence that that's the distinguishing feature.'' The researchers also acknowledged that the machine had benefited from the ''buzzer factor.''</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/us/17deepblue.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">First Came Deep Blue, Which Defeated a Chess Champion<date>Published: February 16, 2011</date><text>Before there was Watson, there was Deep Blue.In 1997, Deep Blue, another computer built by I.B.M., defeated the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. At the time, it was considered a stunning achievement and a significant step forward in the field of artificial intelligence. Some people said that a new era would be ushered in, one in which computers would perform many tasks — like air traffic control — that it once seemed only humans could do. That era has not quite materialized. But almost 14 years later, chess programs running on an average desktop computer can play better than Deep Blue, making its victory no longer seem as implausible. And while the research that went into making Deep Blue has not itself transformed society, the lessons from designing and building it have had practical applications, said Murray S. Campbell, one of Deep Blue’s developers, who still works at I.B.M. Playing chess was a “deep computing” problem, Dr. Campbell said, the kind that involves processing and analyzing large amounts of data. Based on what it learned from Deep Blue, I.B.M. created a Deep Computing Institute to analyze and solve complex computing problems, like those posed by credit card transactions, telephone call centers and weather analysis. What the researchers who created Deep Blue did not even try to do was to develop a system that could really identify, parse and mimic human behavior. “We didn’t know what to do with language and speech and vision and so on,” Dr. Campbell said. “It was so hard. Where Deep Blue left off is where Watson picks up. “Watson is finally tackling these real world issues,” Dr. Campbell said. “It is tackling it head-on and not trying to avoid it.” Part of what makes that possible is that Watson is much more powerful than Deep Blue. It has 2,800 microprocessors; Deep Blue had 30 general-purpose processors and 480 custom ones. Watson can calculate up to 80 teraflops, or 80 trillion operations, a second, which is about 100 times faster than Deep Blue. Still, what Watson does is not all that dissimilar from what Deep Blue did, Dr. Campbell said. “We don’t claim that Watson is thinking in the way people think. It is working on a computational problem at its core.” Deep Blue never played again. Part of it is now in the Smithsonian. “We’d accomplished what we set out to do,” Dr. Campbell said.Before there was Watson, there was Deep Blue.</text></article>

Watson, that would be able to interact with consumers on a variety of subjects like buying decisions and technical support.” As I imagined all of the time this could save at, say, Best Buy, my mind wandered to this question: What other areas of consumer life could Watson make easier? Here are a few ideas for starters: 1) Wal-Mart, Target and other big box stores. Watson could tell you the location of every item and even draw you a map of the exact place in the aisle that it lives. (This has to be happening somewhere already, right?) 2) Grocery stores. Watson could stand next to the sale items, ready to offer ideas for recipes that incorporate the sale ingredients. A smartphone can do this too, but not everyone has one. 3) The post office. Watson could offer fact-based tax advice on April 15 and other dates when people are rushing to fill out their forms and get them into the mail. 4) Train stations and other transit centers. Watson could relieve some of the lines that tend to form at information booths where humans sit and give directions. 5) Stadiums. Watson could tell you where your seats are and get you to the food concession that has the Polish sausage. That last one came from my colleague Steve Lohr, who also offered a different list: Some places where he wouldn’t want a smart butler to turn up. Watson would probably not make a good sommelier, for instance. Where would you love to see Watson, and where do you hope that it (he? she?) never appears?</text></article>

In the run-up to the “Jeopardy!” showdown between computer and humans, there was one thing that I worried might turn the contest into a farce. After watching for two days, I think I was right. Heading into Wednesday night’s final round, IBM’s Watson computer has $35,734, far ahead of the two most successful humans to play the game, Brad Rutter, who has $10,400, and Ken Jennings, at $4,800. As the show has explained, the main challenge for Watson’s designers was to make it understand language, with all the subordinate clauses, puns and oblique references that we take for granted. They did an amazing job of it, and the computer usually “understood” what each clue meant. But humans still have an advantage: a few times, Watson misinterpreted fairly straightforward questions. So why are the people getting trounced? It’s all about timing, and the inherent advantage that chips and wires have over flesh. Let me back up a bit, and explain a little about what the game looks like from the inside. I played on “Jeopardy!” years ago, winning five games when that was the maximum number allowed. I went to the annual Tournament of Champions, where I got crushed in the second round. Knowing more stuff than your opponents can matter, but it has less to do with winning than people think. Everyone who gets on “Jeopardy!” knows a lot of trivia. (And of course a megacomputer can hold more information than the human brain. I can’t memorize the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but my laptop can, in seconds.) In a game with good players, all three know most of the answers. You might sense this watching from home, when you can see that all of them are pushing their signaling buttons, but only one can be first. In the current man-versus-machine spectacle, I’m confident that Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter each knew more than 90 percent of the answers. So if knowing more does not necessarily win games, what does? Steady nerves, luck, fast retrieval of the information lodged in your brain. Obviously, Watson does not have to worry about nerves or speed. A more elusive skill is the ability, when you do not actually know the answer, to make quick associations between distantly related bits of trivia, narrow down the possibilities, and make a good guess. I can’t easily gauge how well Watson does this. Which leaves timing. In human games, whoever handles the signaling button best usually wins. The trick to “Jeopardy!” is that you cannot press the button until Alex Trebek finishes reading the question out loud. Wait a fraction of a second too long, and someone beats you to it. Ring in too soon, and the system locks you out just long enough to give your opponents time to push their buttons. Well, it should be obvious that a computer is faster and more precise than a person in sending that electronic impulse. As soon as I heard that this John Henry moment was coming, I wondered if the computer’s timing edge would make a mockery of the contest. There on my TV the last two nights was the proof — the hapless humans obviously knew the answers, but Watson rang in first. Even if Watson had “known” only half the answers, I think it would still be ahead of the people who knew far more. I’m a “Jeopardy!” geek, so I’ll watch the last round tonight. But I’ll be complaining about it the entire way.</text></article>

In its battle against two human champions on the Tuesday episode of “Jeopardy!,” Watson, the latest machine to take on mankind in a mental showdown, seemed at first to prove its worthiness. The computer mostly dominated its human opponents, beating them to the buzzer in 24 out of 30 Double Jeopardy questions and answering every question it fielded correctly — until it got to the final round. The category was “U.S. Cities,” and the clue provided: “Its largest airport is named for a WWII hero. Its second largest for a WWII battle.” Watson’s response? Toronto. The audience gasped. Viewers, particularly those in Chicago — the correct city — may well have gasped too. Going 24 for 25 is far from shabby, especially considering that Watson finished the second day of the three-day challenge with more than $35,000 in winnings, far ahead of Brad Rutter, with $10,400, and Ken Jennings, who had $4,800. Both men are former champions who set records on the show. But Toronto an American city? Watson, named after Thomas Watson, IBM’s founder, may have been thrown by the clues. Toronto’s busiest airport, Lester B. Pearson International, was named after a former prime minister, not a World War II hero. But the city’s next busiest airport, Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, was named after a famous World War I fighter pilot.

Related Article | Video Nonetheless, Watson seems well on its way to trouncing its human opponents, following in the keystrokes of Deep Blue, the supercomputer that bested world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. IBM Research labs began developing Watson in 2006, and programmed it to receive clues electronically at the same time its opponents hear them. The computer is not connected to the Internet, and arrives at its answers by rapidly working through algorithms and coming up with what it believes is the most likely answer. While Watson may have stumbled at the end of Tuesday’s show, the computer still showed some strategic intelligence. Watson wagered only $947, so its blunder cost it very little. Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter both wagered nearly all of their winnings and answered correctly, yet finished far behind. The show was taped last month at the IBM research center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. The next segment will be shown on Wednesday.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/science/15essay.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M.’s Watson - Computers Close In on the ‘Paris Hilton’ Problem<date>Published: February 14, 2011</date><text>STANFORD, Calif. — At the dawn of the modern computer era, two Pentagon-financed laboratories bracketed Stanford University. At one laboratory, a small group of scientists and engineers worked to replace the human mind, while at the other, a similar group worked to augment it.In 1963 the mathematician-turned-computer scientist John McCarthy started the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The researchers believed that it would take only a decade to create a thinking machine. Also that year the computer scientist Douglas Engelbart formed what would become the Augmentation Research Center to pursue a radically different goal — designing a computing system that would instead “bootstrap” the human intelligence of small groups of scientists and engineers. For the past four decades that basic tension between artificial intelligence and intelligence augmentation — A.I. versus I.A. — has been at the heart of progress in computing science as the field has produced a series of ever more powerful technologies that are transforming the world. Now, as the pace of technological change continues to accelerate, it has become increasingly possible to design computing systems that enhance the human experience, or now — in a growing number of cases — completely dispense with it. The implications of progress in A.I. are being brought into sharp relief now by the broadcasting of a recorded competition pitting the I.B.M. computing system named Watson against the two best human Jeopardy players, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Watson is an effort by I.B.M. researchers to advance a set of techniques used to process human language. It provides striking evidence that computing systems will no longer be limited to responding to simple commands. Machines will increasingly be able to pick apart jargon, nuance and even riddles. In attacking the problem of the ambiguity of human language, computer science is now closing in on what researchers refer to as the “Paris Hilton problem” — the ability, for example, to determine whether a query is being made by someone who is trying to reserve a hotel in France, or simply to pass time surfing the Internet. If, as many predict, Watson defeats its human opponents on Wednesday, much will be made of the philosophical consequences of the machine’s achievement. Moreover, the I.B.M. demonstration also foretells profound sociological and economic changes. Traditionally, economists have argued that while new forms of automation may displace jobs in the short run, over longer periods of time economic growth and job creation have continued to outpace any job-killing technologies. For example, over the past century and a half the shift from being a largely agrarian society to one in which less than 1 percent of the United States labor force is in agriculture is frequently cited as evidence of the economy’s ability to reinvent itself. That, however, was before machines began to “understand” human language. Rapid progress in natural language processing is beginning to lead to a new wave of automation that promises to transform areas of the economy that have until now been untouched by technological change. “As designers of tools and products and technologies we should think more about these issues,” said Pattie Maes, a computer scientist at the M.I.T. Media Lab. Not only do designers face ethical issues, she argues, but increasingly as skills that were once exclusively human are simulated by machines, their designers are faced with the challenge of rethinking what it means to be human. I.B.M.’s executives have said they intend to commercialize Watson to provide a new class of question-answering systems in business, education and medicine. The repercussions of such technology are unknown, but it is possible, for example, to envision systems that replace not only human experts, but hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs throughout the economy and around the globe. Virtually any job that now involves answering questions and conducting commercial transactions by telephone will soon be at risk. It is only necessary to consider how quickly A.T.M.’s displaced human bank tellers to have an idea of what could happen. To be sure, anyone who has spent time waiting on hold for technical support, or trying to change an airline reservation, may welcome that day. However, there is also a growing unease about the advances in natural language understanding that are being heralded in systems like Watson. As rapidly as A.I.-based systems are proliferating, there are equally compelling examples of the power of I.A. — systems that extend the capability of the human mind. Google itself is perhaps the most significant example of using software to mine the collective intelligence of humans and then making it freely available in the form of a digital library. The search engine was originally based on a software algorithm called PageRank that mined human choices in picking Web pages that contained answers to a particular typed query and then quickly ranked the matches by relevance. The Internet is widely used for applications that employ a range of human capabilities. For example, experiments in Web-based games designed to harness the human ability to recognize patterns — which still greatly exceeds what is possible by computer — are generating a new set of scientific tools. Games like FoldIt, EteRNA and Galaxy Zoo make it possible for individuals to compete and collaborate in fields like astronomy to biology, medicine and possibly even material science. 1 2 Next Page »STANFORD, Calif. — At the dawn of the modern computer era, two Pentagon-financed laboratories bracketed Stanford University.

The “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek and competitors Ken Jennings, Watson, and Brad Rutter. It’s not the match of the century, it’s more like the letdown of a lifetime. The first round on Monday in this week’s “Jeopardy!” competition between two former champions and Watson, the I.B.M. computer, was supposed to be a man vs. machine, guys against gadget, brain vs. Braun showdown. It was closer to “Bambi vs Godzilla.” For one thing, the avatar standing between Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter that suggests that Watson is a trim, 6-foot iPod, is totally misleading: the real thing isn’t one computer, it is a conglomerate of 10 I.B.M. servers – 13 trillion bytes – that are the equivalent of 2,800 computers and take up an entire room off stage, like the data processor in the Spencer/Hepburn movie “Desk Set.” That can’t be fair. Why shouldn’t Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter be allowed to consult a backstage ensemble of 2,800 experts from M.I.T., Stanford and Bard? (some of the questions are artsy). Interactive Feature The Watson Trivia Challenge Play against I.B.M.’s question-answering supercomputer. Related Article | Video Instead, the show’s host, Alex Trebek, treated Watson like a Hollywood celebrity guest who requires deference and special treatment. Mr. Trebek and the beaming I.B.M. scientists who so proudly presented Watson as a breakthrough in artificial intelligence seemed to forget their audience: this is a generation raised on malevolent, even grandiose computers in “The Terminator” saga, “War Games” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.” When Gary Kasparov was finally beaten by I.B.M.’s ersatz grand master, “Deep Blue,” in 1997, Mr. Kasparov came close to accusing I.B.M. of cheating — and who could blame him? I.B.M. refused a rematch and unplugged Deep Blue for keeps. So it wasn’t what Watson got right on Monday that was fascinating, it was the few times it was wrong, including a simple question in the category “Final Frontiers.” The $400 question was, “From the Latin for ‘end,’ this is where trains can also originate.” Watson rang in first (it’s a computer, so viewers can’t see it fumble with the buzzer) and replied, not illogically but wrongly, “finis.” (Mr. Jennings got it right: terminal.) Watson buzzes in only when it has a high degree of confidence of being right; its answers to each question are displayed in a graphic at the bottom of the screen that shows the computer’s probability calculation. Before answering, Watson had figured that the word “finis” had a 97 percent chance of being correct. More weirdly, the word “Constantinople” came in second with 13 percent and “Pig Latin” with 10 percent. Watson also didn’t know the answer to a question about the “Harry Potter” series, which if nothing else suggests his programmers should get out more. The first round ended with Watson and Mr. Rutter tied for the lead with $5,000, followed by Mr. Jennings with $2,000. But it is early yet in the three-day tournament. So far Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter have humored Watson and showed exquisite restraint even with its flat, robotic know-it-all voice (“Olympic Oddities for 600”). They could get tougher as the game progresses. If Watson wins, it’s a victory for 2,800 computers, and no disgrace to the two flesh-and-blood champions who took it on. If Watson loses, then I.B.M. should be ashamed: the company should have gone all out and sprung for a full 3,000.</text></article>

It had $3,000, then $3,600 and then $4,000 while the humans lingered down in the hundreds. Mr. Trebek cooed out a question: “’Bang bang’ his ‘silver hammer came down upon her head.’” “What is Maxwell’s silver hammer,” Watson’s computerized voice replied. Watson reeled off one correct answer after another. But then the computer started to slip, and Mr. Rutter — who holds the shows record for the most winnings at $3.25 million—came roaring back. Watson even made a few mistakes. “Stylish elegance, or students who all graduated in the same year,” the question read. “What is chic?” Watson replied. Wrong. “What is class?” Mr. Rutter said. Right. At the end of Monday’s round, Mr. Rutter and Watson were tied at $5,000 each. Mr. Jennings, who holds Jeopardy’s longest winning streak of 74 games, slunk off into the Wheel of Fortune time slot with only $2,000. The winner of this three-day competition will be awarded $1 million. (Watson fans should nevertheless take heart: as Times technology reporter John Markoff writes, as computers get more agile in mimicking what humans do, the impact could be significant.)</text></article>

Computer That Plays ‘Jeopardy!’<date>Published: February 8, 2011</date><text>Does the idea of a machine that’s as smart as you are inspire fascination? Or fear? From “2001” to “The Terminator,” science fiction has conditioned us to dread the metal tap on the shoulder. But “Smartest Machine on Earth,” a gee-whiz episode of the PBS series “Nova” on Wednesday night, puts a friendly face on artificial intelligence.In fact, we’re supposed to feel sorry for the machine in question, an I.B.M. computer called Watson, a name that pays tribute to Thomas J. Watson, the company’s founder, while also evoking Sherlock Holmes’s stolid sidekick. Watson, as followers of computing or television game shows already know, was developed over the course of four years (and at the cost of tens of millions of dollars) specifically to play “Jeopardy!” against human competition. “Smartest Machine on Earth,” in addition to being a quick, jokey history of the development of A.I. and a profile of the team that built Watson, is an hourlong teaser for the three episodes of “Jeopardy!,” Monday through next Wednesday, that will pit the computer against the flesh-and-blood champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. David Ferrucci, the Watson team leader, spends much of the hour looking hangdog as the computer goes down in its first matches against humans and as “Jeopardy!” producers initially decline to put the machine on the program. When a comedian hired to host practice matches ridicules Watson’s more obtuse answers (Rembrandt rather than Pollock for a “late ’40s artist”), Mr. Ferrucci lashes out: “He’s making fun of a defenseless computer.” Those who would like to see the machines kept in their place will be heartened by these scenes, but they shouldn’t make assumptions about next week’s matches (which were actually filmed, under a media blackout, in January). In a short public exhibition, Watson has defeated Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter, the best humanity has to offer. And a moment late in the program that sends the I.B.M. engineers into ecstasy may send a chill up those same viewers’ spines: after a programming tweak, Watson demonstrates that it can learn the trick of a “Jeopardy!” category — in this case, that the answers must be the names of months — and adjust its responses accordingly, within the space of the category’s five clues. “Smartest Machine on Earth” is part of an all-“Nova” night on PBS dedicated to the theme of intelligence. It begins with “How Smart Are Animals?,” an episode of “Nova ScienceNow.” Here, in the fast-moving, populist (or pandering) “Mr. Wizard”-meets-“Monty Python” style of “ScienceNow,” we see dogs, dolphins, octopuses and a parrot whose impressive feats of communication all involve doing elaborate tricks in return for food or affection. The evening also includes an installment of the “Nova” mini-series “Making Stuff,” hosted by David Pogue, technology columnist for The New York Times. That Watson has the affection of its I.B.M. creators, not to mention the “Nova” producers, can be seen in the fact that it’s routinely referred to as “he” and “him,” just like the cute border collies and performing dolphins. The mind-set we’re exposed to throughout the program is reflected in one engineer’s poetic framing of this man-and-machine high noon: “It’s a human standing there with their carbon and water versus the computer with all of its silicon and its main memory and its disc.” The program gives an interesting summary of how Watson has been armed for its single function: loaded with a numbing amount of data (10 million documents, including encyclopedias, the Bible, the Internet Movie Database and the archive of The New York Times) and thousands of old “Jeopardy” clues, then programmed to compute the likelihoods of possible answers in microseconds. This may seem, to the average viewer, like nothing more than a specialized, high-powered keyword search, but when the machine is rattling off correct answers in its anodyne voice and racking up tens of thousands of dollars in practice matches, it’s impressive. And, yes, unsettling. “Jeopardy!” fans will have at least one significant question that “Nova” doesn’t answer: Does the lack of thumbs give Watson an advantage? Because everyone knows that you can have a head full of encyclopedias, but it’s still all about the buzzer. NOVA SCIENCENOW How Smart Are Animals?

The question: What is Watson? I.B.M.’s groundbreaking question-answering system, running on roughly 2,500 parallel processor cores, each able to perform up to 33 billion operations a second, is playing a pair of “Jeopardy!” matches against the show’s top two living players, to be aired on Feb. 14, 15 and 16. Watson is I.B.M.’s latest self-styled Grand Challenge, a follow-up to the 1997 defeat by its computer Deep Blue of Garry Kasparov, the world’s reigning chess champion. (It’s remarkable how much of the digital revolution has been driven by games and entertainment.) Yes, the match is a grandstanding stunt, baldly calculated to capture the public’s imagination. But barring any humiliating stumble by the machine on national television, it should. Consider the challenge: Watson will have to be ready to identify anything under the sun, answering all manner of coy, sly, slant, esoteric, ambiguous questions ranging from the “Rh factor” of Scarlett’s favorite Butler or the 19th-century painter whose name means “police officer” to the rhyme-time place where Pelé stores his ball or what you get when you cross a typical day in the life of the Beatles with a crazed zombie classic. And he (forgive me) will have to buzz in fast enough and with sufficient confidence to beat Ken Jennings, the holder of the longest unbroken “Jeopardy!” winning streak, and Brad Rutter, an undefeated champion and the game’s biggest money winner. The machine’s one great edge: Watson has no idea that he should be panicking. Open-domain question answering has long been one of the great holy grails of artificial intelligence. It is considerably harder to formalize than chess. It goes well beyond what search engines like Google do when they comb data for keywords. Google can give you 300,000 page matches for a search of the terms “greyhound,” “origin” and “African country,” which you can then comb through at your leisure to find what you need. Asked in what African country the greyhound originated, Watson can tell you in a couple of seconds that the authoritative consensus favors Egypt. But to stand a chance of defeating Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter, Watson will have to be able to beat them to the buzzer at least half the time and answer with something like 90 percent accuracy. When I.B.M.’s David Ferrucci and his team of about 20 core researchers began their “Jeopardy!” quest in 2006, their state-of-the-art question-answering system could solve no more than 15 percent of questions from earlier shows. They fed their machine libraries full of documents — books, encyclopedias, dictionaries, thesauri, databases, taxonomies, and even Bibles, movie scripts, novels and plays. But the real breakthrough came with the extravagant addition of many multiple “expert” analyzers — more than 100 different techniques running concurrently to analyze natural language, appraise sources, propose hypotheses, merge the results and rank the top guesses. Answers, for Watson, are a statistical thing, a matter of frequency and likelihood. If, after a couple of seconds, the countless possibilities produced by the 100-some algorithms converge on a solution whose chances pass Watson’s threshold of confidence, it buzzes in. This raises the question of whether Watson is really answering questions at all or is just noticing statistical correlations in vast amounts of data. But the mere act of building the machine has been a powerful exploration of just what we mean when we talk about knowing. Who knows how Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter do it — puns cracked, ambiguities resolved, obscurities retrieved, links formed across every domain in creation, all in a few heartbeats. The feats of engineering involved in answering the smallest query about the world are beyond belief. But I.B.M. is betting a fair chunk of its reputation that 2011 will be the year that machines can play along at the game. Does Watson stand a chance of winning? I would not stake my “Final Jeopardy!” nest egg on it. Not yet. Words are very rascals, and language may still be too slippery for it. But watching films of the machine in sparring matches against lesser human champions, I felt myself choking up at its heroic effort, the size of the undertaking, the centuries of accumulating groundwork, hope and ingenuity that have gone into this next step in the long human drama. I was most moved when the 100-plus parallel algorithms wiped out and the machine came up with some ridiculous answer, calling it out as if it might just be true, its cheerful synthesized voice sounding as vulnerable as that of any bewildered contestant. 1 2 Next Page » Richard Powers is the author of the novel âGenerosity: An Enhancement.âUrbana, Ill.</text></article>

Next up is the administration’s courtship of the nation’s start-up economy, with a public-private sector initiative it calls “Startup America,” announced on Monday at the White House. Senior administration officials were there in force, including Gary Locke, the commerce secretary; Steven  Chu, the energy secretary; Karen Mills, director of the Small Business Administration; Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council; and Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Orchestrating private-sector efforts will be Steve Case, founder of AOL and head of the Case Foundation, and Carl Schramm, chief executive of the Kauffman Foundation. In his remarks, Mr. Case nodded toward the skepticism that will understandably greet the efforts to champion job-creating small businesses — a singularly uncontroversial initiative. “There is a mom and apple pie aspect to this,” Mr. Case noted. So strip away the political packaging and what remains? The money itself is meaningful, but not large in the context of the economy. The government funding is pulled from agency budgets and aimed at start-ups. The Small Business Administration, for example, will use $1 billion from an “impact investment fund” to provide up to $2 for every dollar of private capital for start-ups. There was a lot of talk about sweeping aside or lowering “barriers to innovation.” For example, Mr. Locke, the commerce secretary, mentioned the need to “dramatically lower” the three years, on average, that it now takes to process a patent. The United States patent office, he noted, is adapting a fast-track approach that will allow some patent applications to be processed within 12 months. Companies, including Intel, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Facebook and Google, have pledged funds and assistance for American start-ups as part of the initiative. The private-sector money comes to more than $400 million. Nonprofits like the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship will receive support to expand programs. Recent economic studies have concluded that nearly all the net new job creation in the American economy comes not really so much from small companies but from young ones. And the field of entrepreneurial economics has grown and is becoming increasingly mainstream, a trend accelerated by the Kauffman Foundation, the leading philanthropic sponsor of research on entrepreneurial activity, innovation and growth. The administration initiative, said Robert E. Litan, an economist and director of research at Kauffman, “validates this shift in emphasis from small business to new business. That’s significant. The administration is saying yes, we understand, and we’re going to try to do something about it.”</text></article>

Owens, a former chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, has joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company as a senior adviser to the firm’s portfolio management committee. “I am honored to offer my knowledge and counsel to the firm,” Mr. Owens said in a statement. Mr. Owens retired from Caterpillar last year after a 38-year career at the construction equipment manufacturer. He started as an in-house economist, and become chief executive in 2004. “During Jim’s exceptional tenure as C.E.O. of Caterpillar, he led the company in achieving rapid growth and successfully navigated Caterpillar through the recent economic recession,” Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, who co-founded K.K.R. and serve as its chairmen and chief executives, said in a joint statement. “We will benefit greatly from both his depth of experience in the industrial sector and his recognized leadership on global economic issues as we pursue new investments and support our existing portfolio companies.” Mr. Owens serves on the boards of Alcoa, IBM and Morgan Stanley. He was also a member of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, an external panel that advised the White House during the financial crisis. K.K.R., which focuses on alternative assets, has $55.5 billion in assets under management.</text></article>

Beat Estimates<date>Published: January 19, 2011</date><text>I.B.M.’s quarterly profit was much higher than Wall Street estimates, and a long-sought recovery in its services business raised optimism that global companies were confident enough to spend more on technology. I.B.M. shares rose 2.8 percent in extended trading after the company reported that fourth-quarter net income rose 9 percent, to $5.3 billion. Its earnings of $4.18 a share easily exceeded its $3.59 of the year-earlier quarter and the Wall Street average forecast of $4.08, according to Thomson Reuters. Investors were particularly relieved with the increase in services contracts, an early indicator of future revenue from outsourcing and other technology projects. I.B.M., which has been shifting its focus from commoditized hardware to higher-margin services and software over the last decade, said it signed services contracts worth $22.1 billion during the quarter, up 18 percent. Analysts also noted $142 billion worth of backlog in the services business, up $5 billion from a year earlier — a sign of strong revenue growth ahead. I.B.M. forecast 2011 earnings of “at least $12.56” a share, up from $11.52 in 2010. It said that it was on track to hit its operating earnings goal of $20 a share by 2015. Its gross profit margin rose to 49 percent, from 48.3 percent a year earlier. “We think that the risk-reward here is pretty attractive and we see fairly limited downside to I.B.M.,” said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager at Capital Advisors. He said he saw room for the shares to rise, but not too much more than the overall market. I.B.M.’s price-to-earnings ratio of 12 lags behind multiples of about 14 for Oracle and Accenture, but is higher than those of Dell and Hewlett-Packard. The company’s quarterly revenue rose to $29.0 billion from $27.2 billion, higher than the market’s forecast for $28.3 billion. Sales rose throughout the business, with systems and technology revenue up 21 percent and its software revenue excluding its divested operations up 11 percent.

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/business/media/20link.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Social Networking Can Bring in New Views, Not Just Echoes<date>Published: December 19, 2010</date><text>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.I.B.M. researchers in this laboratory nestled next to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been forced lately to confront a limit on computing power: the human brain just isn’t processing data any faster. It’s a shame, too, because the brain has never had more material to make sense of: more friendships, that come with more frequent updates, more bosses to report to, more news, more entertainment choices. And who knows when the next million-page WikiLeaks release may come along? Overwhelmed by all the noise, some have simply chosen to block it out — to opt out, say, of social networks and microblog platforms like Twitter. Alternatively, others have hewn close to these social networks, counting on them to sort through all the information coming at us. But to be informed in the distributed world we live in, opting out isn’t really an option. For better or worse, we are watching a C-Span version of our lives trying to fast-forward to the good parts. That is the task being squarely addressed last week at I.B.M.’s Center for Social Software — a roughly 30-member lab that addresses “the modern-day challenges of collaborating across distributed, global enterprises.” The lab tries to use increasingly sophisticated computers to act as information advisers. “I do think of computers as augmenting people, not replacing them,” said Irene Greif, the director of the research center. “We need help with the limits of the brain, but there are some things that our brains can do that computers can’t do.” The researchers essentially create programs that find patterns (and outliers) in the “fire hose” of information. Once patterns are revealed, it becomes easier to decide who or what is worth our undivided attention. A literal example of fast-forwarding through the clutter of government is a public Web site created by I.B.M. researchers, Many Bills. Relying on sites that collect and format federal legislation, the I.B.M. project uses textual analysis to summarize and display Congressional bills as they move through the legislative process. This often reveals material that would seem to be unrelated to the business at hand (and probably was inserted as part of the bargaining process), like a provision on guns in a financial regulatory bill.  The added material isn’t necessarily a secret — someone had to insert it, and often the deal making is quite public — but a computer trained to see patterns and to highlight in bright colors can often spot it instantaneously. The creators of the program stress that all of its features are intended to allow people to dig deeper — the entire text is there to be read. In an academic paper on the project, its creators, Yannick Assogba, Irene Ros and Joan DiMicco, described other “open government” visualization techniques that seem to allow “only a few number of interpretations.” By contrast, they wrote: “Our belief is that for citizens to become meaningfully engaged with government data, they need to be able to draw their own conclusions about it.” Then there is the problem of searching for expertise, not necessarily Web page results. One tool for I.B.M. employees, SaNDVis, does this by showing a web of relationships around a search term to reveal who within I.B.M. has expertise on a topic. It uses writings, meetings attended, personal profile information and previous work experience to map these connections with lines showing who is closest to whom. Like many of the center’s other projects, SaNDVis takes advantage of 400,000 I.B.M. employees who write reports, contribute to internal wikis, share bookmarks and blogs, or communicate via internal versions of Twitter or Facebook. The implication is that in such a huge global company, there will not be a single center of expertise. And true to form, when Adam Perer, the creator of SaNDVis, typed in “visualization” — the expertise of many of his colleagues at the Cambridge lab — he saw familiar faces, including his own, but also people from around the world whom he didn’t necessarily know. Ido Guy, a manager at the I.B.M. office in Haifa, Israel, where the data for SaNDVis is compiled, described the mission. “This is about unlocking — or unleashing — the value of information,” he said. “You cannot tie together the connections as well as a computer program can do it — that these two people are commenting on the same blog that they have a lot of similarities and maybe should know each other.” And as for Mr. Perer’s way of displaying search results through people, Mr. Guy said: “When the Web and intranet become more social, people become more central. It is more than a document search.”  With its huge employee base, I.B.M. also performs the kind of data mining on its own employees that Google or Facebook still can’t dream of applying to the public — with access to the entire range of internal social networking tools linked to an employee ID number. Projects like SaNDVis, which builds off a collection of information called Social Networking and Discovery, work as well as they do because employees’ professional lives are all on the record and are fodder for analysis. In many ways, the I.B.M. lab can seem like the anti-Google. Its research frequently stays in house, and its goals are very different. Google projects can seem like confections put before the public to keep them participating in the all-seeing Google data-collection project: that participation helps Google learn more about you and give better search results. The ads can be directed to you more effectively, as well. I.B.M. doesn’t serve ads, and thus collects information for its sake and for the sake of the businesses it is working with. “People who come here know that the end goal is to help our company help our clients,” Dr. Greif said. “We think we have also educated the company that some playful, consumer-oriented ideas” can end up “helping this corporation.” The goal is to tame the wondrous flow of information that has become part of normal life, while remaining engaged in the broader world, as you would expect from a multinational corporation. (The WikiLeaks material is an exception; Dr. Greif said she had been told that her researchers shouldn’t mine that particular trove of data.) For simple business reasons, I.B.M. is trying to break out of the standard way people use social networks to navigate the flood information. Typically, people interact with generally like-minded friends and thus create an “echo chamber” where prejudices are reinforced. Such a posture also helps flatten the culture — reduces the culture to memes, if you will; we float from one “trending topic” to another. Pass along the same YouTube clip everyone else is passing along. Treat serious news as gossip, and vice versa. Of course, life is not the same as working at a conglomerate. Many people are perfectly happy seeing the same faces, learning the news from the same sources, seeing the most popular movie that week. Thinking beyond those safe parameters can make your head hurt.</text></article>

Traveling as much as I do is always an adventure. I have to admit that a lot of the time, I’m wondering how we actually make it from Point A to Point B since everything is so inefficient.I went to Chennai, India, to meet with Indian business partners and also to meet with women executives at I.B.M. India. It was a great trip, and we got a lot accomplished. But I started to come down with a bad case of laryngitis. At the end of the trip, I headed back to the airport with a colleague who was traveling with me. In India, you have to have your travel papers printed out to get into the airport, which is really a very antiquated procedure. My colleague had our papers with her since we had changed flights on the way to India at the last minute, and she just had one copy of the paperwork for the both of us. We hit horrible traffic on the way to the airport, so we were running late. When we finally arrived, she sprinted ahead of me, to make sure we wouldn’t lose more time. As I tried to enter the airport, I got stopped by airport security and military personnel. My voice was so raw that I could barely speak to them and explain what was going on. I tried pantomiming the fact that my colleague had the papers. That sure didn’t work. My colleague finally realized that I wasn’t with her. She came back to look for me, and found me waving my arms around at the officials. She showed them the paperwork, and I was allowed to make my way to my flight. Throughout this ordeal, I kept thinking, I’ve got this information in my BlackBerry, why can’t I just show it to the airport personnel? Or why don’t they just have a system that checks my passport number to see whether I’m approved for the flight? Delays are inevitable. But at Heathrow, a delayed flight forced me to go through three different security checkpoints, re-scanning the same baggage again and again. There were bottlenecks of people everywhere, including the terminals, the tunnels between terminals and at every security checkpoint. The passengers, with their baggage and take-along animals, couldn’t even form a queue. I have no idea why things were organized like this, but it made absolutely no sense. Because I do like to work when I’m waiting for a flight, wireless hot spots come in handy. I was waiting hours for a delayed flight at Kennedy Airport. I found a wireless hot spot that was advertised throughout the terminal. But you couldn’t connect to the network. Terminal and airline personnel were clueless about how to help and that was really frustrating. But sometimes a kind stranger can help. I was passing through Hong Kong on the way to Singapore at the beginning of a seven-country tour of “smarter buildings” in Asia. The problem was I had a dislocated foot. But this young airport aide, who couldn’t have weighed more than 35 pounds, came to my rescue. I had tennis shoes on, and I tried to explain about my foot. But she was completely oblivious. She literally rushed me through the airport and through security checkpoints, pushing and shoving me, as I’m lurching alongside her. I figure we clocked about two miles. By the time we made it to the gate, I thought I was going to die. But on a positive note, I think I lost a few pounds, which was a nice bonus.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/13/nyregion/13black.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Cathleen Black Will Leave Coca-Cola and I.B.M. Posts<date>Published: November 12, 2010</date><text>Cathleen P. Black will have to give up more than the sweeping Midtown views from her office if she becomes New York City’s next schools chancellor: She will have to walk away from three lucrative sources of income that have made her a multimillion-dollar fortune over the last decade.City officials said on Friday that Ms. Black, a publishing executive, would not only step down from her job as chairwoman of Hearst Magazines, as many had expected, but she would also resign from the boards of Coca-Cola and I.B.M. Aides had indicated earlier on Friday that Ms. Black might remain on those boards, despite city rules that forbid employees from having a position or an ownership interest in a company that does business with the city. I.B.M., with contracts totaling more than $300 million, is one of the city’s largest vendors. As for Coke, most of its sales to the city come through third-party vendors, which is normally not considered a conflict, though it could create the appearance of one. The city’s Conflicts of Interest Board can grant permission to employees to serve on boards, typically on the condition that they recuse themselves from any city dealings with the companies. “She met with city lawyers prior to her announcement and will follow their advice and that of the Conflicts of Interest Board to address any potential issues before she starts,” said Natalie Ravitz, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education. But later on Friday, a City Hall spokeswoman, Jessica Scaperotti, said, “She will not be serving on any corporate boards at the time she becomes chancellor.” Her board seats might have complicated her attempt to win a state waiver to take the job, which is necessary because she does not have the educational background that state law requires. Some parents, teachers and local officials have already been urging the state commissioner of education to deny the waiver request, saying Ms. Black’s career record, which is almost exclusively in the corporate world, makes her unqualified for the job. Ms. Black, named on Tuesday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to succeed Joel I. Klein, is a top executive at Hearst, one of the world’s largest publishers. Her compensation there is not a matter of public record but it is likely to be several times the $250,000 the city would pay her as chancellor. She also now earns $500,000 a year for serving on the boards of I.B.M. and Coca-Cola. Board memberships have long been a way for top corporate executives to supplement incomes and enhance résumés. Serving on boards generally requires a small commitment of time and offers handsome perks, like stock options, all-expense-paid travel and free merchandise. Ms. Black, who is the chairwoman of the compensation committee and a member of the public issues and diversity review committee of Coca-Cola, attended 10 meetings in 2009, for which she earned $195,000 in cash and stock. She has been a director there since 1993. At I.B.M., where she has been a director since 1995, she earns $300,723 a year in cash and compensation. Aside from Ms. Black’s background, Mr. Bloomberg’s selection of her was also surprising for the secrecy surrounding it. Many of the mayor’s senior aides did not know about it until just before he announced it. The mayor’s office has declined to reveal any details of the search process, but one respected educator has said he was consulted: Geoffrey Canada, the chief executive officer of the Harlem Children’s Zone. Mr. Canada, in an interview on Friday, said Mr. Bloomberg had met with him about three months ago, around the time Mr. Kleintold the mayor he was planning to resign. Mr. Bloomberg “asked for my advice on what would make a great chancellor, and I gave it,” Mr. Canada said. He would not elaborate on what his advice was and did not say whether Ms. Black’s name came up. But he said he was “thrilled” with the choice, citing her extensive management experience. Mr. Canada declined to comment on whether he was offered the job. Mr. Bloomberg had called him the “most important living New Yorker” in a recent New York Magazine survey. Also on Friday, Mr. Bloomberg announced that the chairman of the Panel for Educational Policy, David C. Chang, had resigned on Nov. 5. Mr. Chang, the chancellor of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, was one of the original members of the panel, the successor to the city’s Board of Education. The panel is controlled by the mayor and has no significant power. In Mr. Chang’s place, Mr. Bloomberg named Robert Reffkin, an executive at Goldman Sachs. Members of the panel said that Mr. Chang’s resignation was not a reaction to the appointment of Ms. Black but a long-planned retirement. Mr. Chang did not return calls seeking comment. The training of Ms. Black continues, Ms. Ravitz of the Department of Education said. While she has not yet visited the department’s headquarters, she is in daily contact with officials there. She has also called Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the Board of Regents; Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker; Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker; Catherine Nolan, the chairwoman of the Assembly’s education committee; Michael Mulgrew, the teachers’ union president; and Ernest Logan, the principals’ union president. The Rev. Al Sharpton and Ms. Black have been trying to meet; he has concerns about her selection, a spokeswoman said, but he wants to meet with Ms. Black before reaching a conclusion.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/science/09compute.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Moving Toward Quantum Computing - Science in 2011<date>Published: November 8, 2010</date><text>In 1981 the physicist Richard Feynman speculated about the possibility of “tiny computers obeying quantum mechanical laws.” He suggested that such a quantum computer might be the best way to simulate real-world quantum systems, a challenge that today is largely beyond the calculating power of even the fastest supercomputers.Since then there has been sporadic progress in building this kind of computer. The experiments to date, however, have largely yielded only systems that seek to demonstrate that the principle is sound. They offer a tantalizing peek at the possibility of future supercomputing power, but only the slimmest results. Recent progress, however, has renewed enthusiasm for finding avenues to build significantly more powerful quantum computers. Laboratory efforts in the United States and in Europe are under way using a number of technologies. Significantly, I.B.M. has reconstituted what had recently been a relatively low-level research effort in quantum computing. I.B.M. is responding to advances made in the past year at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, that suggest the possibility of quantum computing based on standard microelectronics manufacturing technologies. Both groups layer a superconducting material, either rhenium or niobium, on a semiconductor surface, which when cooled to near absolute zero exhibits quantum behavior. The company has assembled a large research group at its Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., that includes alumni from the Santa Barbara and Yale laboratories and has now begun a five-year research project. “I.B.M. is quite interested in taking up the physics which these other groups have been pioneering,” said David DiVincenzo, an I.B.M physicist and research manager. Researchers at Santa Barbara and Yale also said that they expect to make further incremental progress in 2011 and in the next several years. At the most basic level, quantum computers are composed of quantum bits, or qubits, rather than the traditional bits that are the basic unit of digital computers. Classic computers are built with transistors that can be in either an “on” or an “off” state, representing either a 1 or a 0. A qubit, which can be constructed in different ways, can represent 1 and 0 states simultaneously. This quality is called superposition. The potential power of quantum computing comes from the possibility of performing a mathematical operation on both states simultaneously. In a two-qubit system it would be possible to compute on four values at once, in a three-qubit system on eight at once, in a four-qubit system on 16, and so on. As the number of qubits increases, potential processing power increases exponentially. There is, of course, a catch. The mere act of measuring or observing a qubit can strip it of its computing potential. So researchers have used quantum entanglement — in which particles are linked so that measuring a property of one instantly reveals information about the other, no matter how far apart the two particles are — to extract information. But creating and maintaining qubits in entangled states has been tremendously challenging. “We’re at the stage of trying to develop these qubits in a way that would be like the integrated circuit that would allow you to make many of them at once,” said Rob Schoelkopf, a physicist who is leader of the Yale group. “In the next few years you’ll see operations on more qubits, but only a handful.” The good news, he said, is that while the number of qubits is increasing only slowly, the precision with which the researchers are able to control quantum interactions has increased a thousandfold. The Santa Barbara researchers said they believe they will essentially double the computational power of their quantum computers next year. John Martinis, a physicist who is a member of the team, said, “We are currently designing a device with four qubits, and five resonators,” the standard microelectronic components that are used to force quantum entanglement. “If all goes well, we hope to increase this to eight qubits and nine resonators in a year or so.” Two competing technological approaches are also being pursued. One approach involves building qubits from ions, or charged atomic particles, trapped in electromagnetic fields. Lasers are used to entangle the ions. To date, systems as large as eight qubits have been created using this method, and researchers believe that they have design ideas that will make much larger systems possible. Currently more than 20 university and corporate research laboratories are pursuing this design. In June, researchers at Toshiba Research Europe and Cambridge University reported in Nature that they had fabricated light-emitting diodes coupled with a custom-formed quantum dot, which functioned as a light source for entangled photons. The researchers are now building more complex systems and say they can see a path to useful quantum computers. A fourth technology has been developed by D-Wave Systems, a Canadian computer maker. D-Wave has built a system with more than 50 quantum bits, but it has been greeted skeptically by many researchers who believe that it has not proved true entanglement. Nevertheless, Hartmut Neven, an artificial-intelligence researcher at Google, said the company had received a proposal from D-Wave and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop a quantum computing facility for Google next year based on the D-Wave technology.</text></article>

Aren’t All That Different<date>Published: November 6, 2010</date><text>EVERY once in while, there are symbolically intriguing historical moments in the corporate world, and one of them occurred last month. On Oct. 18, Apple and I.B.M. reported their quarterly results, and Apple’s total profit surged past I.B.M.’s.The two companies have long been cast as polar opposites, even before Apple’s commercial during the 1984 Super Bowl that depicted a female rebel (Apple) striking a blow against a corporate Big Brother (I.B.M.). Today, Big Blue is seen as a machine — a company that caters to big corporate and government customers and is known for steady improvement and five-year profit plans. Indeed, I.B.M.’s profit rose 12 percent for the third quarter, the 31st consecutive quarter that the company delivered higher earnings. Apple, by contrast, is seen as a consumer-product hit factory that is on a roll. Yet I.B.M. and Apple can be viewed as the yin and the yang of high-tech innovation, as two companies with more in common than is generally understood. There is a lot of eureka invention and deep science in I.B.M.’s varied businesses, industry experts say. And Apple’s continuing success, they add, is explained in good part by its ability to make innovation a managed system, more machinelike. I.B.M. and Apple pursue different markets, but there is a similarity in their strategies, according to David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. The big shift at I.B.M., he notes, came about 15 years ago, when the company tilted increasingly toward technology services and software and relied less on hardware. (The change began under the former chief executive Louis V. Gerstner Jr. and accelerated under the current chief, Samuel J. Palmisano.) The goal, Mr. Yoffie adds, was to build a profitable business with a lot of recurring revenue, based on service contracts and software licenses, and to attract industry partners and software developers to use its technology. Over the last 10 years, Apple has embraced much of the same strategy — in broad strokes. The company’s partners and developers build on its iPhone and iTunes software and share with Apple their revenue for music and software applications sold on the iStore. These complementary offerings encourage more sales of Apple’s hardware, and have become money makers on their own. “Each company has created an ecosystem of partners and developers around its core products,” Mr. Yoffie says. “And both depend on ongoing innovation.” When Steven P. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company was saddled with inefficient manufacturing, loose cost controls and bulging inventories. It lost more than $1 billion in fiscal 1997. In early 1998, Mr. Jobs recruited Timothy D. Cook, an operations expert, from Compaq, who had previously spent 12 years with I.B.M. Under Mr. Cook, now Apple’s chief operating officer, the company is a model of lean efficiency. It holds seven days’ worth of inventory, compared with an average of more than 30 for most technology companies, analysts say. Companies typically try to manage payments so they collect cash from customers slightly before they have to pay suppliers, thus making money by investing the cash before payments are due. Apple collects its cash in 25 days, on average, and pays its suppliers in 85 days — an extraordinary, 60-day spread that generates an extra $1 billion in cash flow a year, estimates A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst at Bernstein Research. That achievement is made easier, Mr. Sacconaghi notes, because Apple makes its billions in profit from just a handful of products. But the scale at which it buys components for its hit products, like iPhones and iPods, gives the company some Wal-Mart-style muscle with its suppliers. Fostering consistent innovation, experts say, requires a balance of management systems and inspirational leadership. At Apple, the inspiration wellspring is the megawatt personality of its leader, Mr. Jobs, and its ability to make consumer products that delight millions of people. At I.B.M., the inspiration engine is more subtle and conceptual. In late 2008, Mr. Palmisano and his team settled on a theme: the deployment of scientific research and technology to tackle big challenges for business and society in fields like energy, pollution, transportation and health care. And the company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on its “Smarter Planet” advertising campaign. “Sure, it’s marketing, but it’s also a big idea that explains the company’s mission to the world and to its employees,” says John Kao, an innovation consultant to governments and business. A striking difference between the companies, experts say, is in their approach to research. I.B.M. has laboratories around the world, spends $6 billion a year on research and development, and generates more patents a year than any other company. Five I.B.M. scientists have won Nobel prizes; the company’s researchers attend scientific conferences, publish papers and have made fundamental advances in computing, materials science and mathematics. Apple, by contrast, focuses only on product innovation, not scientific invention. “Apple does research insofar as it advances their laser-focused product aspirations,” observes Michael Hawley, a computer scientist who worked for Mr. Jobs at NeXT, a pioneering but commercially unsuccessful computer company. At Apple, the emphasis is not on the basic science of traditional research but on the “behavioral science” of the user experience, explained a former Apple manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he still had ties to the company. APPLE has technical experts who constantly scout new commercial technologies, he said; they work with suppliers, often co-inventing down to the chip level. Then prototypes and initial products are produced, with constant refinements. They are shown not to focus groups or to other outsiders, but only to Mr. Jobs and his lieutenants. For example, three iPhone prototypes were completed over the course of a year. The first two were tossed out, the third passed muster, and the product shipped in June 2007, the former manager said. “That is the rocket science — the product,” he said.</text></article>

Dell did not disclose terms of the deal for Boomi, which counts Salesforce.com among its clients and helps integrate so-called cloud-based applications and smooth data transfers between programs, The Associated Press said. Boomi raised $4 million in 2008 in an initial round of institutional funding led by the venture capital firm FirstMark Capital. The company is based in Berwyn, Pa., and was founded in 2000. Privately held Boomi was mentioned as a potential buyout target after I.B.M. bought Cast Iron Systems earlier this year. Dell has been on the acquisition trail, but lost out recently in a bidding battle with its larger rival Hewlett-Packard for the high-end data-storage maker 3PAR. Michael Dell, the chief executive, had said at an industry event in Hong Kong that the company would announce a cloud-computing acquisition on Tuesday, spurring a round of market speculation about potential targets.

United States Steel tumbled 3.4 percent after a surprise quarterly loss because of repair costs. I.B.M. rose 0.6 percent after its board authorized buying back as much as $10 billion in shares. About eight stocks retreated for every seven that rose. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index was virtually unchanged, ending at 1,185.64. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.41 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 11,169.46, and the Nasdaq was up 6.44 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,497.29. “We’ve had some modestly disappointing earnings reports from a couple of bellwether companies such as U.S. Steel,” said Dean Gulis, a money manager for Loomis Sayles &amp; Company. “The earnings environment is a little less buoyant than it has been, and people are using the opportunity to consolidate their positions after a strong run.” Wall Street strategists have reduced their recommended investment allocations of stock amid the recent rally that has driven the market up from lows it hit in July. Strategists currently advise an average 57.7 percent of assets be put in stocks, down from 60 percent in September and 61 percent in August and July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. United States Steel dropped $1.42 to $40.85 after it posted a third-quarter loss because of $86 million in repair costs. Excluding a one-time currency gain and an asset sale, the loss was $1.21 a share, which compared with an average estimate for profit of 23 cents from 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased 60 percent, to $4.5 billion from $2.82 billion. Kimberly-Clark fell $3.86 to $62.61 after reporting a 19 percent decline in third-quarter profit as commodity costs increased. Shares of companies that make consumer staples slumped 0.4 percent. “Although market conditions have improved in recent weeks, an air of uncertainty persists, with the future direction of the economy remaining cloudy,” Bob Doll, vice chairman of BlackRock, said in his weekly market commentary. “Equity markets continue to price in modest economic recovery. One key issue for stocks in the year ahead will be whether corporate earnings are able to hold up in the face of slow nominal growth.” Texas Instruments, the chip maker, dropped 10 cents to $28.88. On Monday after the markets closed, the company forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $3.36 billion to $3.64 billion and cited a slowdown in consumer-electronics spending. Indexes had gained ground early in the day after the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index increased to 50.2 from a revised 48.6 in September. The proportion of people who said jobs were plentiful fell to the lowest level this year and income expectations were the weakest since April 2009. Meanwhile, home prices continued to weaken around the country, even in metro areas that were showing strength earlier in the year. The Standard &amp; Poor’s Case-Shiller 20-city home price index fell 0.2 percent in August from July. Fifteen of the cities showed monthly price declines. “It’s coming down to company earnings and individual stock selection now,” said Don Wordell, a fund manager for Atlanta-based RidgeWorth Capital Management. “The market has clearly priced in the macro variables.” Shares of retailers, hotel operators, restaurant companies and others companies that rely on discretionary consumer spending climbed 1.1 percent collectively for the biggest advance among 10 groups in the S.&amp; P. 500. The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 21/32, to 99 28/32. The yield rose to 2.64 percent, from 2.56 percent late Monday.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/technology/19webblue.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Profit Climbs 12% on Increased Technology Spending<date>Published: October 18, 2010</date><text>I.B.M. said Monday its third-quarter profit rose by 12 percent as its revenue increased modestly, adding to the evidence that corporate customers are beginning to spend again on computer technology. Net profit rose to $3.6 billion, or $2.82 a share, surpassing the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts of $2.75 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. In the year-earlier quarter, I.B.M. reported earnings of $2.40 a share. Revenue for the quarter was $24.3 billion, a 3 percent rise, and slightly above analysts’ forecast of $24.1 billion. Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company achieved growth and improved profit margins in its hardware, software and services businesses. He expressed confidence that I.B.M.’s solid performance would continue for the remainder of the year, and raised the full-year earnings forecast. I.B.M.’s earnings, he said, should be “at least $11.40” a share. The previous guidance to Wall Street was that earnings for this year would be “at least $11.25” a share. But new contract signings in its big services business appeared weak, with $11 billion in new contracts signed during the quarter. Analysts had been expecting signings of more than $12 billion. In the services business, contract signings are a signal of future revenue. I.B.M. said one large services contract, which was completed just beyond the end of the third quarter, would have lifted signings to $12.7 billion. Yet investors seemed skeptical. In after-hours trading, I.B.M. shares fell nearly 4 percent to $137.16, down $5.67. During regular hours, I.B.M. shares rose $1.77, to $142.83. Still, the I.B.M. results suggest that corporate spending on computer technology is picking up. Spending on information technology — hardware, software and services — represents more than half of all private sector capital spending. I.B.M.’s performance follows strong results last week by Intel, the big chip maker, which cited “solid demand from corporate customers” as an engine of higher sales and profits. Intel’s sales rose 18 percent and its profits jumped 59 percent. I.B.M.’s financial results are far less cyclical than those of hardware makers, both in good times and bad. An estimated two-thirds of revenue is accounted for by recurring software licenses and services contracts, which do not change from one quarter to the next. Two-thirds of I.B.M.’s business is now outside the United States. Growth was particularly strong in the fast-growing markets of India, China, Brazil and Russia, which rose 29 percent during the quarter. Its mainframe business benefited from the introduction of a new line of machines, with revenue increasing 15 percent.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/technology/19blue.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Rides Global Focus on Services to Deliver a 12% Increase in Profit<date>Published: October 18, 2010</date><text>The leading high-technology industrial companies like Intel, General Electric and I.B.M., which have reported quarterly results in the last several days, are seen by analysts and economists as bellwethers of the economy, because their chips, equipment and services are used in so many industries.But the quarterly scorecards from such giants of corporate America increasingly point to trends in the global economy rather than at home. Large technology companies typically have most of their sales overseas, and they are tilting more abroad to pursue the fast-growing markets in China, India and elsewhere. The current wave of globalization, analysts say, is different from in the past. Now companies are also spreading work and production worldwide to improve productivity and profits. The migration abroad of sales and operations, analysts say, also helps explain why American corporations are in good health, while the economy sputters and unemployment remains high. “The success of large corporations that are headquartered in the United States has less and less to do with the success of the American economy,” said Robert B. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. The global stance of many big corporations is contributing to a projected 35 percent jump in profits this year among companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500. For the last six quarters, Wall Street has underestimated the profits of S.&amp;.P. 500 companies by an average of 10 percent, and Edward Yardeni, an independent economist, says analysts are struggling to keep up. “It’s really hard for them to model into their spreadsheets the full impact of globalization,” Mr. Yardeni said. I.B.M. is at the forefront of the recent wave of globalization. In reporting its third-quarter results on Monday, I.B.M. said it received a lift from strong growth in big emerging markets, led by China, India, Brazil and Russia, where revenue jumped 29 percent. A broader category earmarked by I.B.M. as growth markets, which include South Africa, Vietnam and the Czech Republic, experienced a 16 percent increase in revenue. “The real slugger in the quarter was the growth markets,” Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.’s chief financial officer, said. Last month, I.B.M. announced that it had cinched a large deal in Africa to provide the technology behind new cellphone services. The deal, a 10-year agreement with India’s largest cellphone operator, Bharti Airtel, will be worth up to $1.5 billion, analysts estimate. I.B.M. reported a 12 percent increase in net income to $3.6 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Its earnings of $2.82 a share were above the $2.75 estimate of Wall Street analysts. Revenue was $24.3 billion, a 3 percent rise, and slightly above analysts’ forecast of $24.1 billion. I.B.M. raised its full-year earnings forecast to “at least $11.40” a share from “at least $11.25.” Still, part of the improvement in profits came from lower taxes. And the total of services contracts signed — an indicator of future revenue — was weaker than expected. I.B.M. said one big contract signed in early October, if signed a few days earlier, would have put total signings for the quarter at $12.7 billion, slightly above analysts’ estimates. After reaching a 52-week high during the day, I.B.M.’s stock price dropped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. The most far-reaching change at I.B.M. has been the global overhaul of its services and software businesses, which now account for 80 percent of revenue. The transformation was partly of necessity — to address the competitive threat posed by low-cost Indian outsourcing companies including Infosys, Wipro and Tata. In services, I.B.M viewed the Indian outsourcers as a challenge unnervingly similar to the one faced by its mainframe business in the early 1990s. In hardware, the new low-cost technology of microprocessors, used in personal computers, disrupted the mainframe business, sending its profits plummeting. In the mainframe case, I.B.M.’s researchers saw the new technology and gave a warning in the 1980s. But shifting then would have required retooling plants and cutting workers, when I.B.M. was still comfortably profitable. “Management waited until the tsunami was hitting before the action was taken,” recalled Irving Wladawsky-Berger, a former I.B.M. executive. Under Samuel J. Palmisano, who became chief executive in 2002, I.B.M. was determined to move earlier in services. Indian programmers worked for a fraction of the wages of their counterparts in America and Europe. So the company expanded in India. In 2003, it had 9,000 workers in India. Today, it has more than 75,000, analysts estimate. Cutting costs was a crucial step, but I.B.M. also shifted the focus of its research labs to services. Applying science and software automation to services has increased productivity and let I.B.M. do more sophisticated work with higher profit margins. “In services, we got way ahead of the game,” said Mr. Wladawsky-Berger, who retired from I.B.M. in 2007. The transition has not come easily. I.B.M. sets aside about $400 million a year for severance costs and other payments to cut about 8,000 employees annually, analysts estimate. Since 2003, I.B.M. has cut its payroll in the United States by roughly 30,000 workers, to about 105,000. I.B.M. has also hired thousands of workers in the United States, to tap new skills like data scientists and analysts, even as it cuts elsewhere. The trimming these days is a steady, evolutionary process by a company that is prospering — not the drastic surgery of a company in deep trouble, as I.B.M. was in the 1990s.</text></article>

Agree to Java Pact<date>October 11, 2010, 7:34 pm</date><text>Millions of software developers uneasily held their collective breath when Oracle bought Sun Microsystems earlier this year. The deal handed Oracle the role as the corporate steward of Java software technology, initially developed by Sun in 1995. The early steps were not encouraging. In August, Oracle sued Google, claiming its Android operating system for smartphones illegally used ideas and code from Java. Oracle, it seemed, was going to take a hard line on its property rights in Java, litigating and seeking to line its pockets with settlement payments. But I.B.M. announced on Monday that after Oracle extended an olive branch, Big Blue decided to set aside past hostilities from the Sun days. I.B.M. said it would shift its Java development efforts from the initiative it sponsored, called Apache Harmony, to the one begun in 2006 by Sun, called OpenJDK. “This should remove some of the uncertainty about the future of Java,” said Rod Smith, vice president for emerging technologies at I.B.M. Java matters because it is so widely used. Java, the programming language, is the teaching language used in high schools and colleges. The Java tools that accompany the language are deployed in software applications that run on everything from mainframes to smartphones. Sun turned Java over to the open source community in 2006, but retained certain controls. Oracle inherited Sun’s influence over Java when it bought the company. Oracle executives reached out to their I.B.M. counterparts a little more than a week ago, and agreement was reached fairly quickly, both sides said. Java innovation, they said, must proceed rapidly to keep pace with hardware developments, like microchips with increasing numbers of processing cores. “The agreement is a reflection of the strategic reality we both face,” said Adam Messinger, a software vice president at Oracle. “We’re cooperating and combining resources to accelerate innovation on the Java platform.” The accord covers the Java software typically used in everything from data centers to Web programs. But it does not extend to the set of smaller Java tools used in cellphones and other mobile devices. Douglas Lea, a computer scientist at the State University of New York at Oswego, and a veteran of Java standards and development groups, called the pact “a positive step.” Still, Oracle’s dispute with Google casts shadows over Java’s future in general. For example, Google, Mr. Lea said, has more people working on OpenJDK projects than Oracle, and the lawsuit restricts communications between the litigating parties. “By far the most eyes are still on the Android issue,” Mr. Lea said. “Oracle and Google have to start communicating with each other.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/technology/11cloudasia.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Regulations and Security Concerns Hinder Asia’s Move to Cloud Computing<date>Published: October 10, 2010</date><text>SINGAPORE — The Youth Olympic Games here in August presented organizers with a formidable, but temporary, computing hurdle: Manage 3,600 athletes, 20,000 volunteers and 370,000 spectators for two weeks. Rather than buy or lease the equipment necessary to run the event, organizers rented the required computer capacity from a data center run by Singapore Telecommunications. The Games were a showcase for cloud computing in Asia: software, data storage, networking and even computing equipment on tap — as much as a customer desired for only as long as needed. “In past Olympic games, they had to buy these servers,” said Bill Chang, an executive vice president at Singapore Telecommunications, “and then after the Games all this equipment would be fire-sold away or given away.” Mr. Chang said that by using cloud services, customers like the organizers of the Youth Olympic Games could save 60 percent to 80 percent of the cost of purchasing the equipment themselves. The research firm IDC estimates that the market for cloud computing in Asia outside Japan will grow to about $1.3 billion this year and will continue expanding at a rate of about 40 percent a year until 2014. That figure is just a splash in the estimated $68.3 billion that cloud computing will bring in globally in 2010, according to the research firm Gartner. And for every case of avid adoption, as in Singapore, there are other countries where acceptance is hindered by regulations, concerns about data security and poor Internet connections. “What will drive adoption is broadband penetration,” said Emilio Umeoka, president of Microsoft’s Asian operations in Singapore. “If you don’t have the pipe, you can’t get onto the cloud.” For potential customers, the savings from cloud computing are enticing. Like equipment leasing before it, cloud computing turns what once was a big-ticket capital expenditure into an operating expense for companies — one that can be tuned up or down, depending on business conditions. “The savings comes in infrastructure,” Mr. Umeoka said. “Your company would have less services, less people to manage the servers, less people to manage bugs or patches.” What is giving Asian customers pause, though, is the same concern being voiced elsewhere: that a company’s precious financial and customer data could be lost, stolen or even rendered temporarily inaccessible through no fault of its own. To many, the threat posed by hackers, possible government interference and even power failures justifies keeping their data housed on their own premises, in their own countries. As a result, cloud computing in Asia is taking off faster among small, more cost-sensitive start-ups than among larger companies. China’s big state-owned businesses, for example, tend not to trust third-party providers with their data. “The propensity to outsource in China is the lowest in the region,” said Philip Carter, a research director at IDC in Singapore. “It comes back time and time again in surveys to control and risk mitigation. They want to keep control of I.T. assets.” Adoption of cloud computing in China is also held back by regulation. Beijing, which also blocks Facebook, prohibits companies from storing their data offshore, meaning they can use data centers only inside China. As a result, IDC estimated, only about 4 percent of companies in China were using cloud-based services last year, compared with 16 percent in Singapore. But with about 40 million small and medium-size companies, the Chinese market holds enormous appeal for the providers of cloud computing services. NEC of Japan estimates the nascent Chinese market will grow 30 percent a year to reach around $2.3 billion by 2012. “The Chinese customers are more receptive to the whole way of doing business online,” said Enwei Xie, Microsoft’s general manager for software development business in China. “They’re sort of familiar with this whole host model.” As is typical in China, local companies like Kingdee and Ufida so far have dominated the market, crowding out international firms like NEC, SAP of Germany or Oracle of the United States. Poor bandwidth access, however, is keeping China from becoming a cloud hub. That limitation also applies to India, and followers of the industry say it is unlikely such services will be outsourced to either country anytime soon. And cloud computing providers are flocking to Hong Kong and Singapore. Even India’s Tata Communications is opening a data center in Singapore to offer cross-border cloud services. IDC estimates that 24 percent of all companies in Asia will use some form of cloud computing this year, up from 11 percent in 2009. Technically, Singapore is not the ideal location for data centers. Land is expensive and temperatures are high, meaning it costs more to keep servers cool. But cutting-edge telecommunications infrastructure, a pool of technology experts and generous government incentives more than compensate, executives said. Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have also picked Singapore as the center of their own regional cloud computing initiatives. “We didn’t set up a lab in Singapore because we wanted to do cloud computing,” said Christopher Whitney, managing director of a new lab Hewlett-Packard opened in the city-state in February, “but because we wanted to access its infrastructure and talent.”</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/science/28atom.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Microscope Gives High-Speed Look at Atoms<date>Published: September 27, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — I.B.M. scientists have modified a scanning-tunneling microscope, making it possible to observe dynamic processes inside individual atoms on a time scale one million times faster than has previously been possible.The researchers have perfected a measurement technique in which they use an extremely short voltage pulse to excite an individual atom and then follow with a lower voltage to read the atom’s magnetic state, or spin, shortly afterward. The resulting data produces the equivalent of a high-resolution, high-speed movie of the atom’s behavior. The advance, reported Thursday in the journal Science, has potential applications in fields including solar energy technology, computer data storage and quantum computing. The scanning-tunneling microscope was invented by I.B.M. researchers in 1981 in Switzerland. The systems are now in wide use, and make it possible to make images of individual atoms. While they have attained astounding spatial resolutions, however, they have been less precise in detailing physical processes that occur so quickly that their duration is measured in nanoseconds. A nanosecond — a billionth of a second — is to a second as one second is to 30 years, roughly. “This technique is really nice because it allows us to measure how things change in time,” said Michael Crommie, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Obviously people have been doing this with other techniques for many years, but it has proven hard to do at very small time scales.” The researchers said that the actual rate of change in the magnetic orientation of the atoms they were able to measure is several orders of magnitude faster than even the new technique. But they are able to slow down aspects of the process, which is described as “spin,” so that they are able to observe it at the nanosecond scale. Spin can be likened to the constantly changing orientation of an atomic-scale bar magnet, said Andreas J. Heinrich, a physicist at the I.B.M. Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif. “Before we had the scanning-tunneling microscope that allowed us to follow things down to the atomic scale,” he said, “but we did not have the ability to follow these fast processes. Now we can offer a combination of high time and spatial resolution; we’re trying to speed up nanoscience.” He said that one of the questions the researchers are trying to answer is how many atoms are required to store a single bit of magnetic information. The new technique will allow scientists to peer into a Lilliputian world where magnetic ones and zeros are read and written by modern digital computers. That ability should lead to a better understanding of the remarkably small structures that are at the heart of both magnetic and digital memory systems. It will also give them a tool for building a generation of computers based on quantum mechanical effects. While the basic unit of today’s digital computers is a bit — a one or a zero — researchers are now designing systems in which a quantum bit, or qubit, will be able to represent one and zero simultaneously. “With quantum computing the idea is to break out of the paradigm of normal computing, which uses ones and zeros to compute,” said Sebastian Loth, an I.B.M. scientist. “Quantum computing is interesting because it offers the ability to perform calculations that are not possible with any supercomputer that is around right now.”</text></article>

Increasingly, business want real-time answers and smart predictions about everything from buying trends to weather patterns to medical therapies. In the last few years, the major companies have all made sizable purchases of business-intelligence software companies. A few: Oracle grabbed Hyperion, $3.3 billion; SAP took Business Objects, $6.8 billion; IBM scooped up Cognos, $4.9 billion; Microsoft pulled in Fast Search and Transfer, $1.2 billion. And they have made a series of smaller purchases to add to their business-intelligence arsenal. I.B.M., for example, says it has spent $12 billion on 23 purchases in the analytics market in the last four years. The real-time model of business intelligence, though, requires not just software, but a tight integration with hardware. I.B.M. has been working on this for years with tools tailored for high-speed processing of real-time data, like its System S technology for what is called ''stream processing'' -- parsing data in streams in rather than after it is stored in data bases. Most of the business intelligence companies are working on so-called in-memory processing systems. Again, the goal is to decipher data on the fly, not after it has been stored in a data base. ''Massive amounts of data that can be analyzed instantly has tremendous value,'' said John Schwarz, chief executive of Business Objects, in an interview months ago. Even SAS Institute, the private company and a long-time leader in business intelligence software, is taking the the integrated path. A few months ago, it began offering in-memory analytics systems in a partnership with the hardware maker, Hewlett-Packard. Oracle's recent purchase of Sun Microsystems plays right into the hardware-software integration trend -- in business intelligence as well as other markets. In Netezza, I.B.M. saw a company that had made ''a breakthrough'' in comparatively easy-to-use, hardware-and-software computing appliances for business analytics, according to Steven A.

In the chess match between Garry Kasparov, the world’s best living player, and I.B.M.’s Deep Blue, an otherwise undistinguished supercomputer, humanity’s collective self-esteem was once more on the line. In the first round of the six-game match, Deep Blue bested our best after only 36 moves. Although Mr. Kasparov rallied to avoid humiliation in the series, the early result shocked not only the chess world, it shattered the pride of those of us who would never dream of pitting our own worth against a $15 home computer program. Suddenly, we once again needed to explain ourselves to ourselves. Mr. Kasparov’s explanation was swift and emphatic: “We are now seeing for the first time what happens when quantity becomes quality.” In effect, we have reached the age when brute force can outperform creativity.</text></article>

He was 77.The cause was a heart attack, his son, William, said. Mr. Jelinek was stricken while he was in his office at Johns Hopkins University, where he was a professor. He lived in Baltimore and New York. Today, computerized speech recognition is becoming a mainstream technology. A few words spoken into a smartphone can summon an Internet search; doctors use voice-transcription software for patient records; drivers talk to speech-recognition systems in cars that reply with driving directions; and customer questions to call centers are increasingly being answered by automated speech systems. But in the early 1970s, when Mr. Jelinek (pronounced JEL-eh-nek) joined I.B.M.’s Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., it was by no means clear how computers might succeed at the daunting task of interpreting the vagaries of human speech. In early speech research, there were two camps. One was the linguists. They argued that humans were best at recognizing speech and that therefore computer models should be based mainly on human language concepts — rules about syntax, grammar and meaning. Mr. Jelinek, an electrical engineer, took a different tack, advocating the use of statistical tools. In this approach, spoken words are converted to digital form, and the computer is then trained to recognize words and appropriate word order in sentences, based on repeated patterns and statistical probability. “Fred Jelinek’s underlying insight was that you don’t have to do it like humans,” said Alfred Spector, vice president for research at Google. “It was almost a 180-degree turn in the established approaches to speech recognition, and it led to most of the success in the field in the last two decades.” In an interview in May, Mr. Jelinek recalled his debates with the linguists in his research group at I.B.M. The human analogy, he would argue, was misguided because machines do things differently than biological beings. “Airplanes don’t flap their wings,” he observed. Other computer scientists championed statistics as the preferred path. “But Fred Jelinek was the giant in applying statistical techniques in speech recognition,” said David Nahamoo, an I.B.M. research fellow. Frederick Jelinek was born on Nov. 18, 1932, in Kladno, Czechoslovakia. His father, Vilem, was Jewish and his mother, Trudy, had converted to Judaism. Because of his Jewish heritage Frederick was barred from attending school during the occupation and was instead taught in small groups organized by members of the Jewish community. As Mr. Jelinek recalled in a speech in Prague in 2001, when he received an honorary degree, “My classmates as well as my teachers were being progressively sent to various concentration camps.” His father was sent to the Terezin concentration camp outside Prague and died there. But the rest of the family were spared under the Nazi racial calculus: his mother, because she was not born Jewish, and the children, including a daughter, Susan, because they were deemed only half-Jewish, a lower priority. In 1949, seeing limited opportunity under the Communist regime that took power after the war, the mother and two children emigrated to the United States and settled in New York, where Frederick completed high school and took night courses at City College in electrical engineering. He did well enough to earn admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with tuition help from the National Committee for a Free Europe, an anti-Communist organization. At M.I.T., he thrived and earned bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees. Mr. Jelinek taught at M.I.T., Harvard and Cornell before joining I.B.M., where he worked for 21 years, leaving in 1993 for Johns Hopkins, where he was a professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the Center for Language and Speech Processing. After the end of Communist rule in 1989, Mr. Jelinek, who often visited the former Czechoslovakia, helped persuade I.B.M. to set up a computing center at Charles University in Prague. His first trip back to his native country was in 1957. One evening he met with a boyhood friend, Milos Forman, then an aspiring film director and later an Academy Award winner. Mr. Forman invited Mr. Jelinek to a screening and there introduced him to one of the film’s screenwriters, Milena Tobolová. “My father loved the movie, and he fell in love with my mother,” William Jelinek said. They spent about a week together before he had to return to America. At a stopover in Munich, Mr. Jelinek called and proposed to Ms. Tobolová. “It was just fine with me,” Milena Jelinek said in an interview. But her leaving the country was not fine with the Communist regime. The movie she had helped write, “An Easy Life,” was deemed decadent for its portrayal of student life in Czechoslovakia, complete with rock ’n’ roll, and she had attended anti-government rallies. She remained in Prague for more than three years while Mr. Jelinek tried to get her out. Shortly after John F. Kennedy was elected president, Ms. Jelinek and a handful of other blacklisted Czechs were allowed to emigrate, presumably as a good-will gesture to the new American president, Ms. Jelinek said. Ms. Jelinek left Czechoslovakia in January 1961, and the couple married in February. She is a retired associate professor of film studies at Columbia University and still lectures there. In addition to his wife and his son, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., Mr. Jelinek is survived by a daughter, Hannah Sarbin of Larchmont, N.Y.; a sister, Susan Abramowitz of Montreal; and three grandchildren.</text></article>

Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief executive, doesn’t jet around the world to make an appearance every time the technology giant wins a services contract. But the announcement Friday morning in Nairobi is different, says I.B.M. Bharti Airtel Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief executive, left, with Sunil Bharti Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Airtel. I.B.M. will supply the computing technology and services for an upgraded cellphone network across 16 nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Its customer is India’s largest cellphone operator, Bharti Airtel, which paid $9 billion a few months ago for most of the African assets of Kuwait’s Mobile Telecommunications Company, or Zain. Under the 10-year agreement, I.B.M. will handle customer service for Bharti and provide the hardware, software and services to run everything from billing and call-traffic management to delivering new services like music and video. The deal takes the broad partnership between Bharti and I.B.M., begun in 2004, beyond India. I.B.M. is not disclosing the dollar size of the deal, but analysts estimate it at more than $1.5 billion over the decade-long span. The Bharti contract also punctuates I.B.M.’s Africa strategy. The company’s presence in Africa dates back 50 years, but in the last five years I.B.M. has invested $300 million in the region to build data centers, add country offices and foster technology training programs — and it plans to expand aggressively in the region. “This is a huge step forward for I.B.M. in what we think is the next major emerging growth market — Africa,” said Bruno Di Leo, general manager for growth markets for I.B.M. Though it looms small in the global technology market today, Africa is primed for growth, according to Frank Gens, an analyst at IDC. “And I.B.M. is, as it’s done before, getting in on the ground floor,” Mr. Gens said. The company’s strategy calls for the growth markets — not only the well-known BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, but also dozens of others — to increase as a share of I.B.M.’s revenue from 19 percent to 25 percent by 2015. That is the equivalent of $1 billion in new sales a year. In these nations, I.B.M. is targeting the linchpin industries of economies including telecommunications, banking, transportation, health care and energy. Mr. Di Leo, speaking on Thursday from his office in Shanghai, noted that mobile phones in developing regions like Africa were used not only for talking and texting, but for many other day-to-day activities like banking. He said only 23 percent of Africans have access to banking services, but already 8 million Africans use their cellphones for payments. So that technology application alone, Mr. Di Leo said, was “a huge opportunity.”</text></article>

The high-stakes sumo match between Hewlett-Packard and Dell ended on Thursday, with H.P. paying about $2.3 billion for 3Par. I.B.M. has said it looked at 3Par and other companies more than two years ago, when it was building up in the field of clustered storage, an important technology in handling data remotely for so-called cloud computing systems. Instead of 3Par, it bought an Israeli clustered-storage specialist, XIV. I.B.M. did not report the price tag on XIV. But analysts estimate it probably paid less than $200 million for a business that now generates more sales than 3Par's revenue of $194 million last year. I.B.M. will not comment on those estimates, but it does point to the XIV deal as an example of how its research labs are used to inform the company's merger, acquisition and divestiture strategy. In fact, Big Blue's storage business has been bolstered by a series of early-stage purchases in the sector over the last couple of years, including Arsenal Digital, Storwize and Diligent. I.B.M. has not gotten in the middle of pricey bidding wars like the one over 3Par or over Data Domain, which EMC bought last year for $2.4 billion, after beating out NetApp. The labs, explains Robert Morris, a vice president of I.B.M. Research, provide strategic ''headlights'' for the company as a whole. At the end of each year, the lab researchers prepare a global technology outlook, which presents senior management with an assessment and predictions about key technologies over the coming several years. As a senior research manager, Mr. Morris also meets with members of I.B.M.'s M.&amp;A. teams four times a year. ''It's not enough to see in the future, you have to act,'' he said. ''If you're ahead of the game, you can go in and get companies at a good price, before others recognize the value.'' The researchers, Mr. Morris adds, learn things from the I.B.M. acquisition teams as well. ''They'll say, 'Have you seen this little company?' '' he said. ''They're like sensors in the marketplace. We develop a lot inside I.B.M., but most innovation is going on outside any single company.'' An earlier version of this post misstated the name of the company that EMC bought last year. It is Data Domain, not Digital Domain. This is a more complete version of the story than the one appeared in print. PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY TONY AVELAR/BLOOMBERG NEWS)</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/science/31compute.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Computer Chips Seem Poised to Shrink Again<date>Published: August 30, 2010</date><text>Scientists at Rice University and Hewlett-Packard are reporting this week that they can overcome a fundamental barrier to the continued rapid miniaturization of computer memory that has been the basis for the consumer electronics revolution.In recent years the limits of physics and finance faced by chip makers had loomed so large that experts feared a slowdown in the pace of miniaturization that would act like a brake on the ability to pack ever more power into ever smaller devices like laptops, smartphones and digital cameras. But the new announcements, along with competing technologies being pursued by companies like IBM and Intel, offer hope that the brake will not be applied any time soon. In one of the two new developments, Rice researchers are reporting in Nano Letters, a journal of the American Chemical Society, that they have succeeded in building reliable small digital switches — an essential part of computer memory — that could shrink to a significantly smaller scale than is possible using conventional methods. More important, the advance is based on silicon oxide, one of the basic building blocks of today’s chip industry, thus easing a move toward commercialization. The scientists said that PrivaTran, a Texas startup company, has made experimental chips using the technique that can store and retrieve information. These chips store only 1,000 bits of data, but if the new technology fulfills the promise its inventors see, single chips that store as much as today’s highest capacity disk drives could be possible in five years. The new method involves filaments as thin as five nanometers in width — thinner than what the industry hopes to achieve by the end of the decade using standard techniques. The initial discovery was made by Jun Yao, a graduate researcher at Rice. Mr. Yao said he stumbled on the switch by accident. Separately, H.P. is to announce on Tuesday that it will enter into a commercial partnership with a major semiconductor company to produce a related technology that also has the potential of pushing computer data storage to astronomical densities in the next decade. H.P. and the Rice scientists are making what are called memristors, or memory resistors, switches that retain information without a source of power. “There are a lot of new technologies pawing for attention,” said Richard Doherty, president of the Envisioneering Group, a consumer electronics market research company in Seaford, N.Y. “When you get down to these scales, you’re talking about the ability to store hundreds of movies on a single chip.” The announcements are significant in part because they indicate that the chip industry may find a way to preserve the validity of Moore’s Law. Formulated in 1965 by Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, the law is an observation that the industry has the ability to roughly double the number of transistors that can be printed on a wafer of silicon every 18 months. That has been the basis for vast improvements in technological and economic capacities in the past four and a half decades. But industry consensus had shifted in recent years to a widespread belief that the end of physical progress in shrinking the size modern semiconductors was imminent. Chip makers are now confronted by such severe physical and financial challenges that they are spending $4 billion or more for each new advanced chip-making factory. I.B.M., Intel and other companies are already pursuing a competing technology called phase-change memory, which uses heat to transform a glassy material from an amorphous state to a crystalline one and back. Phase-change memory has been the most promising technology for so-called flash chips, which retain information after power is switched off. The flash memory industry has used a number of approaches to keep up with Moore’s law without having a new technology. But it is as if the industry has been speeding toward a wall, without a way to get over it. To keep up speed on the way to the wall, the industry has begun building three-dimensional chips by stacking circuits on top of one another to increase densities. It has also found ways to get single transistors to store more information. But these methods would not be enough in the long run. The new technology being pursued by H.P. and Rice is thought to be a dark horse by industry powerhouses like Intel, I.B.M., Numonyx and Samsung. Researchers at those competing companies said that the phenomenon exploited by the Rice scientists had been seen in the literature as early as the 1960s. “This is something that I.B.M. studied before and which is still in the research stage,” said Charles Lam, an I.B.M. specialist in semiconductor memories. H.P. has for several years been making claims that its memristor technology can compete with traditional transistors, but the company will report this week that it is now more confident that its technology can compete commercially in the future. In contrast, the Rice advance must still be proved. Acknowledging that researchers must overcome skepticism because silicon oxide has been known as an insulator by the industry until now, Jim Tour, a nanomaterials specialist at Rice said he believed the industry would have to look seriously at the research team’s new approach. “It’s a hard sell, because at first it’s obvious it won’t work,” he said. “But my hope is that this is so simple they will have to put it in their portfolio to explore.”</text></article>

The second inquiry, opened on the European Commission’s own initiative, concerns claims of discriminatory behavior toward competing suppliers of mainframe maintenance services. “The commission has concerns that I.B.M. may have engaged in anti-competitive practices with a view to foreclosing the market for maintenance services..., in particular by restricting or delaying access to spare parts for which I.B.M. is the only source,” the European Union’s executive arm said in a statement. Mainframes are powerful computers which are used by many large companies and government institutions worldwide to store and process critical business information, with the vast majority of corporate data worldwide residing on mainframes. In 2009 about 8.5 billion euros ($10.97 billion) worldwide and 3 billion euros in the European Economic Area were spent on new mainframe hardware and operating systems. The commission said that T3 and Turbo Hercules had claimed that I.B.M. had been illegally tying its mainframe hardware products to its dominant mainframe operating system. According to the complaints, linking that products shuts out providers of emulation technology which enable the users to run applications on non-I.B.M. hardware.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/27blue.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Europe Starts Antitrust Inquiries Against I.B.M.<date>Published: July 26, 2010</date><text>BERLIN — The European Commission opened investigations Monday into whether I.B.M. had abused its dominant position in mainframe computers, signaling that the era of aggressive prosecution of American technology leaders in Europe did not end with the Microsoft antitrust case.The commission said that it would examine whether I.B.M. had shut out rival mainframe software vendors and service providers. The investigation could lead to charges and potential fines against the company. Joaquín Almunia, who took over in February as the European competition commissioner, “is making it clear that the Internet and the information technology sector will be an enforcement priority for him and for the commission,” said Alec Burnside, a competition lawyer in Brussels at the law firm, Linklaters. “It is clear that he is building on the precedent left him by his predecessor.” Mr. Almunia’s predecessor, Neelie Kroes, oversaw the conclusion of a 10-year investigation against Microsoft, which eventually required the world’s largest software maker to pay 1.2 billion euros, or nearly $1.8 billion, in fines and to change its business practices in Europe. In a statement Monday, the commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said it would investigate whether I.B.M. had illegally tied sales of its mainframe operating system to its mainframe hardware, responding to complaints by third-party sellers of hardware. The commission also said it was opening a second, separate investigation on “its own initiative into I.B.M.’s alleged discriminatory behavior towards competing suppliers of mainframe maintenance services.” The second investigation focuses on whether I.B.M. delays the sale of spare parts to third parties, potentially blocking competitors from performing maintenance on its mainframes. By opening its own inquiry, the commission has indicated that there might be substance to the antitrust claims. The I.B.M. investigation comes on the heels of a European Union investigation into Intel, the world’s largest chip maker. The commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros in May 2009 for abusing its dominance of the chip market. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is appealing the commission’s fine and judgment. The two investigations into I.B.M.’s practices have the potential to redefine the market for mainframes, the expensive, complex computing devices that still run most of the critical operations of big businesses and governments. I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., invented the first mainframe computer in 1964 and still dominates much of the business. Sales of mainframe computers account for less than 10 percent of the worldwide market for data center computers, estimated to be $49 billion this year, according to the International Data Corporation, a research firm in Framingham, Mass. I.B.M.’s mainframe sales, however, are projected to be $3.3 billion in 2010 and represent about three-quarters of the overall mainframe market of $4.5 billion. The commission’s investigations involved complaints from two rival companies that make and distribute competing software for I.B.M.’s proprietary mainframe operating system. Those companies are TurboHercules, a French maker of open-source software for mainframe computers, and t3 Technologies, an American distributor of Flex software that runs mainframes. The software made by the companies works on less expensive computer servers, mimicking the functions of I.B.M.’s entry-level mainframes. I.B.M. said Monday that it would cooperate with the European investigation. But the company said the claims were without merit and called the companies that filed the complaints “proxies of Microsoft.” Microsoft competes with I.B.M., and I.B.M. accused Microsoft of orchestrating the complaints to promote sales of its Wintel servers. “Let there be no confusion whatsoever: there is no merit to the claims being made by Microsoft and its satellite proxies,” I.B.M. said. “Certain I.B.M. competitors, which have been unable to win in the marketplace through investments in fundamental innovations, now want regulators to create for them a market position that they have not earned.” Other mainframe makers, like Unisys, Bull, Fujitsu and Hitachi, are selling small numbers of their proprietary mainframes to existing corporate and government customers as replacements for older machines, an I.D.C. analyst, Matthew Eastwood, said. They do not compete directly with I.B.M. Companies that did make mainframes that could work with I.B.M. software dropped out of the market about a decade ago. For years, I.B.M. steadily cut mainframe prices as it faced competition from smaller, less expensive machines that used standard chips made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Mr. Eastwood said. Those machines account for 60 percent of server computer sales. But the decline in mainframe prices has slowed since the makers of I.B.M.-compatible servers exited the market. From 1995 to 2001, I.B.M. reduced the price of computing tasks handled by mainframes by 31 percent a year. Those price declines averaged 13 percent after the makers of compatible mainframes exited the market, said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. I.B.M. said its market position in mainframe computers was not significant because mainframes accounted for only a small percentage of the overall computing market. The European investigation comes amid a resurgence in the use of mainframe computing, which little more than a decade ago was widely dismissed as expensive and increasingly irrelevant in a market dominated by personal computers. Over the last decade, demand for mainframes has increased almost fourfold, according to data released by I.B.M. Companies like TurboHercules have asked I.B.M. to sell its mainframe operating system to clients of TurboHercules, decoupling the software from the purchase of I.B.M.’s hardware. I.B.M. has refused to allow that. Up until 2000, I.B.M was required by the Justice Department to sell the parts separately. The department dropped that obligation in 2000, saying that mainframes had become a niche market in the broader computing world. “I think this case could in the end have a significant effect on the lower end of the mainframe market,” said Jeff Gould, the chief executive and research director of Peerstone Research, an industry consultant in San Francisco. “And ironically, I don’t think it will hurt I.B.M. in the end. They will still get paid by companies like TurboHercules, and they will be freed up to focus on the really large customers.” Roger Bowler, the president of TurboHercules, said the French company welcomed the commission’s investigation. “Hopefully, it will lead to remedies that will allow companies like TurboHercules to compete in the mainframe market,” Mr. Bowler said. “We simply ask that customers be allowed to have a choice of platform for running their mainframe applications.”</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/technology/22compute.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M. Unveils Z Series, a New Generation of Mainframes<date>Published: July 21, 2010</date><text>The mainframe business is to I.B.M. what manufacturing is to the American economy, a shrinking but strategically vital part of the franchise. With the introduction of a new generation of mainframes on Thursday, I.B.M. is trying to tighten its grip on corporate and government data centers. The new machines are faster, more powerful and more energy efficient. But the most significant change, analysts say, is that other kinds of computers can now be plugged into the mainframe to manage a data center almost as if it were a single computer. The new machines, some customers say, are the most significant change in mainframe design in a decade or more. The mainframe move by I.B.M. is part of the intensifying battle in the market for large computers, including ones running the Unix operating system. In the market for Unix-based machines, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard are trying to grab business from Oracle, which completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems this year. Sun had been losing share in the last few years, and rivals are trying to exploit the uncertainty surrounding Oracle’s plans for Sun, said Matthew Eastwood, an analyst at IDC, a firm that researches technology. As the economy gradually recovers, companies have renewed spending on smaller data center computers, so-called industry standard machines, powered by personal computer-style microprocessors made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Intel reported a sharp rebound last week in sales of chips for server computers, and I.B.M. this week said its sales of industry standard servers rose 30 percent in the second quarter. To date, corporate customers have not yet revived spending on bigger machines, mainframes and Unix-based servers. But analysts expect that to change in the second half of this year, helped by new products, like the I.B.M. mainframe models. I.B.M. stands alone in the mainframe market, after competitors dropped out years ago, including Amdahl, Fujitsu and Hitachi. So to some degree, new models compete against the previous I.B.M. models. The company says the new Z series mainframe runs more than 40 percent faster than its predecessor and is up to 90 percent more energy efficient. Conserving space and energy is important to many corporations, as they try to increase their computing capabilities without having to add to their real estate or their electricity bills. Martin Kennedy, a managing director at Citigroup, is adopting the compact new mainframe and estimates that it will consume 60 percent less energy than its predecessor. Citigroup also plans to opt for a water-cooled model, which should trim power consumption by a further 12 percent. “That was compelling to us,” Mr. Kennedy said. The ability to plug other computers into the mainframe and manage hardware and software applications, customers say, is appealing. In theory, they say, that should make it possible to extend mainframe strengths in security and always-on availability to other systems. In addition, customers say, the new design is intended to make it possible to blend tasks, parceling out various parts of a complex application to different computer systems, more efficiently than in the past. For example, a bank might want to track A.T.M. transactions for fraud in real-time. The A.T.M. customer data is held on the mainframe, which also handles banking transactions. But the pattern analysis for fraud is best done on a Unix machine. Being able to plug a Unix machine into the new mainframe should make doing such complex applications easier and less expensive, said Niels Simanis, a senior technology manager at Danske Bank, a large bank based in Denmark. The new mainframe design, said Rodney C. Adkins, an I.B.M. senior vice president, is mainly “about data center integration, being able to treat the data center as a single system.” Having the mainframe act as the brainy control point for data centers, analysts note, would also tend to lock customers further into I.B.M.’s technology. And a healthy mainframe business is important to the company’s strategy. The machines alone generate yearly sales estimated at $3 billion, about 3 percent of the company’s revenue. But all mainframe-related business, including storage, software, financing and services, accounts for more than 20 percent of I.B.M.’s revenue and more than 40 percent of its profits, according to A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research.</text></article>

Shuffles Top Management<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>I.B.M. is reshuffling its top management one level below the chief executive, Samuel J. Palmisano, giving greater responsibility to four senior executives.The move announced Monday, analysts said, creates a short list for succession. But it could also signal that Mr. Palmisano would be staying on beyond the traditional retirement age of 60 for I.B.M. chief executives. Mr. Palmisano turns 59 later this month. The reorganization came as I.B.M. reported a solid profit gain in the quarter and raised its forecast slightly for 2010. But the company’s stock fell in after-hours trading amid concern about future revenue and how quickly corporate spending on technology was picking up. The management changes, announced in an e-mail message to I.B.M. employees, were intended to improve the company’s products and services, Mr. Palmisano wrote. For example, computer hardware and software are for the first time being placed under the oversight of one executive. Increasingly, Mr. Palmisano wrote, computer systems must be “designed and brought to market as tightly integrated” packages of hardware and software. “The marketplace has changed,” said Bob Djurdjevic, an independent analyst, “and putting hardware and software under a single executive makes a lot of sense.” Steven A. Mills, a senior vice president, will be in charge of the hardware and software divisions. But Mr. Mills is 58, and not a likely successor, analysts say. Mark Loughridge, 57, the chief financial officer, is being given a larger role overseeing finance, the company’s financing unit, and internal information technology. But his experience at I.B.M., analysts suggest, has been too limited to make him a likely successor. Michael E. Daniels, 56, a senior vice president, will be in charge of the entire services business, which had been split until now. Virginia M. Rometty, 52, a senior vice president, will oversee marketing and strategy, as well as sales, which she handles now. Mr. Daniels and Ms. Rometty, analysts suggest, would be the most likely internal candidates to succeed Mr. Palmisano. Still, they say, the closeness in age to Mr. Palmisano of the four executives could well mean that he is planning to remain beyond 60, while giving his top lieutenants large roles. Investors have been pleased with the tenure of Mr. Palmisano who, since 2002, has aggressively expanded I.B.M.’s operations abroad, shifted it sharply into higher-margin businesses and increased earnings per share fourfold. In its earnings report, I.B.M. reported a profit of $2.61 a share, up about 13 percent from the year-earlier quarter. The profit performance surpassed the $2.58 a share consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. But I.B.M. reported a sluggish revenue increase of 2 percent, to $23.7 billion, below Wall Street’s forecast of just under $24.2 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, I.B.M. reported revenue of slightly less than $23.3 billion. New contract signings, the seed corn of future revenue in I.B.M.’s huge services business, also came in well below analysts’ expectations, at $12.3 billion. A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research, had forecast signings of $14 billion. The revenue shortfall and softness in services signings, Mr. Sacconaghi said, raised doubts about the strength of the recovery in corporate technology spending and how much I.B.M. would benefit. “Investors were expecting more,” he said. In after-hours trading, shares of I.B.M. fell as much as $5.58, or 4.3 percent. In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Loughridge, the chief financial officer, expressed confidence for the second half of the year, predicting continued strong earnings gains and an “improving revenue picture.” I.B.M. raised its earnings forecast for the year to “at least $11.25 a share,” up from $11.20 a share. Analysts are watching whether companies might trim their earnings forecasts, especially given weakness in Europe and an uncertain American economy. Mr. Loughridge noted that the strong American dollar shaved revenue in the quarter by $500 million. Services signings, especially on long-term contracts, he said, were often uneven quarter by quarter. And an increase in signings by new customers during the quarter, Mr. Loughridge added, should lead to more new business in the future. Services revenue rose 2 percent, to $13.7 billion. In the software business, where sales rose 2 percent to $5.3 billion, sales of the company’s Websphere Internet-based software rose 17 percent. In the hardware division, mainframe revenue declined 24 percent, and sales of large computers running the Unix operating system fell 10 percent. But new mainframe and Unix models are being introduced soon, opening the door to a possible rebound in hardware sales. I.B.M. is a partial barometer of business investment trends, as the largest supplier of information technology to corporations worldwide. Information technology — computer hardware, software and services — accounts for more than half of all private capital investment. The technology sector has been leading the recovery, and investors were encouraged last week when Intel, the big chip maker, reported that its revenue rose 34 percent in the second quarter. I.B.M. is less tied to the cyclical swings of the hardware business than many technology companies. The more stable services and software businesses now account for 80 percent of I.B.M.’s revenue, as the company reduced its dependence on hardware in recent years. As a result, I.B.M. suffered less than many high-technology companies in the recession. I.B.M., analysts note, focuses mainly on double-digit earnings growth and less on rapid revenue growth. “I.B.M. has had an unrelenting focus on expanding its higher-margin businesses in software and services in recent years, and caring less about revenue growth,” said Carl Claunch, an analyst at Gartner Research.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/technology/19iht-eusoftwar19.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Technology Rivals Lobby to Break Microsoft’s Hold<date>Published: July 18, 2010</date><text>BERLIN — A European plan to advise governments on software purchases has set off a lobbying battle this summer between the U.S. software giant Microsoft and its rivals Google, I.B.M., Red Hat and Oracle over a set of guidelines that could redefine the competitive landscape for proprietary and open-source software. The focus is a document called the European Interoperability Framework, a recommendation by the European Commission that national, provincial and local governments in the 27-nation European Union will consult when buying software. Open-source software advocates including Google, International Business Machine, Oracle and Red Hat, through a lobbying group, are pushing for a strong endorsement of open-source platforms in the document. The outcome of the debate has the potential to erode Microsoft’s significant public-sector market lead in Europe by encouraging governments to buy open-source software, which currently runs a tiny fraction of government systems. More broadly, the guidelines may influence whether more software in Europe and elsewhere becomes interoperable through the promotion of open standards, or whether it remains a patchwork of private, competing systems that requires a large organization to choose a supplier and stick with it. The commission is planning to release its recommendation by the end of this year. European governments will spend $15.7 billion on software this year, 19 percent of all software that is purchased on the Continent, according to International Data Corp. “Europe has the opportunity to become a world leader on this issue,” said Tom Rabon, an executive vice president for corporate affairs at Red Hat, which is based in North Carolina. The company sells open-source software to businesses and governments, including the city of Rotterdam, the Italian Justice Ministry and the French Education Ministry. “If they don’t take this opportunity, then Europe will become a follower,” he said. Microsoft, which was required to license the confidential interoperability codes for its server software to competitors after losing a 10-year European antitrust suit, is opposing a blanket endorsement of open-source software in the E.U. document, saying it would limit choice because it could discourage public-sector clients from buying proprietary software. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, still makes at least half of its revenue from its proprietary Windows operating system for computers and servers and from its Office desktop application suite, according to its most recent financial report. “Interoperability is a big issue. It is something that could potentially unseat the status quo,” said Jan Duffy, a research director at International Data in London. “It is fair to say that a majority of the countries in Europe are beginning to explore open-source alternatives in the public sector as they look to potential cost savings.” John Vassallo, a Microsoft vice president for E.U. legal and corporate affairs in Brussels, said Microsoft had taken significant steps after its European antitrust settlement to incorporate open-source products in its lineup. It has licensed thousands of pages of protocols for its server software, set up joint interoperability labs with two competitors, Sun and Novell, and started projects like Simple Cloud API, a joint effort with I.B.M. to develop common ways of storing documents and files in cloud computing. “We are clearly in favor of a mix and having the choice of any software, open or mixed, whatever suits governments,” Mr. Vassallo said. “It’s not putting a particular preference in front of the buyers that will solve the issue of working across borders. It is the opposite, having more choice — then more technical solutions and innovation will be available.” Google, I.B.M. and Oracle, which in January bought the open-source software pioneer Sun Microsystems, are the main supporters of Open Forum Europe, a group based in Brussels that has been lobbying for an explicit endorsement of open-source software. Graham Taylor, the Open Forum Europe chief executive, says more than 90 percent of European governments end up buying proprietary software products because of inertia, lack of knowledge about open-source alternatives or the fear of switching to a new supplier. Lobbying by Microsoft and other European companies that make proprietary software, like Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent, has also been formidable, Mr. Taylor said. Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent sell proprietary software to governments to, among other things, help run their internal agency telecommunication systems. About 50 companies, groups and individuals submitted comments to the commission on both sides of the issue. “We are up against a very big, powerful lobby,” Mr. Taylor said. “The makers of proprietary software are protecting the standards that are already in existence. They are also, of course, trying to preserve their market positions.”</text></article>

But when mathematicians, scientists and other experts at problem-solving are studied and asked to elucidate their problem-solving processes, they regularly report that they work first in intuitive images, irreducible to logic and often visionary or dreamlike. It is only after they have “seen around the corner” that logical reasoning is engaged, to systematize the findings and make them coherent.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Computer-t.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">I.B.M.'s Supercomputer to Challenge 'Jeopardy!' Champions<date>Published: June 16, 2010</date><text>“Toured the Burj in this U.A.E. city. They say it’s the tallest tower in the world; looked over the ledge and lost my lunch.”This is the quintessential sort of clue you hear on the TV game show “Jeopardy!” It’s witty (the clue’s category is “Postcards From the Edge”), demands a large store of trivia and requires contestants to make confident, split-second decisions. This particular clue appeared in a mock version of the game in December, held in Hawthorne, N.Y. at one of I.B.M.’s research labs. Two contestants — Dorothy Gilmartin, a health teacher with her hair tied back in a ponytail, and Alison Kolani, a copy editor — furrowed their brows in concentration. Who would be the first to answer? Neither, as it turned out. Both were beaten to the buzzer by the third combatant: Watson, a supercomputer. For the last three years, I.B.M. scientists have been developing what they expect will be the world’s most advanced “question answering” machine, able to understand a question posed in everyday human elocution — “natural language,” as computer scientists call it — and respond with a precise, factual answer. In other words, it must do more than what search engines like Google and Bing do, which is merely point to a document where you might find the answer. It has to pluck out the correct answer itself. Technologists have long regarded this sort of artificial intelligence as a holy grail, because it would allow machines to converse more naturally with people, letting us ask questions instead of typing keywords. Software firms and university scientists have produced question-answering systems for years, but these have mostly been limited to simply phrased questions. Nobody ever tackled “Jeopardy!” because experts assumed that even for the latest artificial intelligence, the game was simply too hard: the clues are too puzzling and allusive, and the breadth of trivia is too wide. With Watson, I.B.M. claims it has cracked the problem — and aims to prove as much on national TV. The producers of “Jeopardy!” have agreed to pit Watson against some of the game’s best former players as early as this fall. To test Watson’s capabilities against actual humans, I.B.M.’s scientists began holding live matches last winter. They mocked up a conference room to resemble the actual “Jeopardy!” set, including buzzers and stations for the human contestants, brought in former contestants from the show and even hired a host for the occasion: Todd Alan Crain, who plays a newscaster on the satirical Onion News Network. Technically speaking, Watson wasn’t in the room. It was one floor up and consisted of a roomful of servers working at speeds thousands of times faster than most ordinary desktops. Over its three-year life, Watson stored the content of tens of millions of documents, which it now accessed to answer questions about almost anything. (Watson is not connected to the Internet; like all “Jeopardy!” competitors, it knows only what is already in its “brain.”) During the sparring matches, Watson received the questions as electronic texts at the same moment they were made visible to the human players; to answer a question, Watson spoke in a machine-synthesized voice through a small black speaker on the game-show set. When it answered the Burj clue — “What is Dubai?” (“Jeopardy!” answers must be phrased as questions) — it sounded like a perkier cousin of the computer in the movie “WarGames” that nearly destroyed the world by trying to start a nuclear war. This time, though, the computer was doing the right thing. Watson won $1,000 (in pretend money, anyway), pulled ahead and eventually defeated Gilmartin and Kolani soundly, winning $18,400 to their $12,000 each. “Watson,” Crain shouted, “is our new champion!” It was just the beginning. Over the rest of the day, Watson went on a tear, winning four of six games. It displayed remarkable facility with cultural trivia (“This action flick starring Roy Scheider in a high-tech police helicopter was also briefly a TV series” — “What is ‘Blue Thunder’?”), science (“The greyhound originated more than 5,000 years ago in this African country, where it was used to hunt gazelles” — “What is Egypt?”) and sophisticated wordplay (“Classic candy bar that’s a female Supreme Court justice” — “What is Baby Ruth Ginsburg?”). By the end of the day, the seven human contestants were impressed, and even slightly unnerved, by Watson. Several made references to Skynet, the computer system in the “Terminator” movies that achieves consciousness and decides humanity should be destroyed. “My husband and I talked about what my role in this was,” Samantha Boardman, a graduate student, told me jokingly. “Was I the thing that was going to help the A.I. become aware of itself?” She had distinguished herself with her swift responses to the “Rhyme Time” puzzles in one of her games, winning nearly all of them before Watson could figure out the clues, but it didn’t help. The computer still beat her three times. In one game, she finished with no money. “He plays to win,” Boardman said, shaking her head. “He’s really not messing around!” Like most of the contestants, she had started calling Watson “he.”</text></article>

The company made its first move on Monday, saying it had agreed to purchase Sterling Commerce, a unit of AT&amp;T, for $1.4 billion in cash. Sterling Commerce makes specialized software that handles the automated exchange of documents and transactions among companies. In the Internet bubble days of 2000, Sterling was seen as a hot business-to-business property, when it was expected that B2B dealings would shift to online commercial marketplaces, much like stock exchanges. (SBC, which acquired AT&amp;T’s name as well as the company in 2005, paid $3.9 billion for Sterling in 2000.) The vision today is different, but I.B.M. is betting that online transactions among businesses will be a big deal. Such transactions with suppliers and partners are projected to triple by 2013, Craig Hayman, general manager of I.B.M.’s Websphere software business, said in an interview. Sterling essentially makes smart plumbing technology for businesses. And I.B.M.’s acquisition strategy seems to be focused mainly around software companies that add to that capability. I.B.M.’s larger software purchases over the last couple of years — like Cognos, Ilog and SPSS — have been focused on business intelligence and analytics. Sterling Commerce adds back-end ballast to that portfolio of clever software. “We want to deliver business insight to the interactions flowing over a company’s network of business partners,” Mr. Hayman said. There is no indication that I.B.M.’s buying spree will take it up the software stack toward business applications — standardized software for finance, procurement, manufacturing and other tasks — to compete head-on with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft in that market. I.B.M. pulled back from the business applications market in the 1990s, when many of its offerings were tailored for its mainframe technology. Instead, I.B.M. greatly expanded its services business. I.B.M., Mr. Hayman said, focuses not on applications, but “software frameworks.” That software foundation is also a platform for I.B.M.’s services business. The line between software and services is increasingly blurred, and I.B.M. has many thousands of software developers these days in its big services group. I.B.M.’s consulting and services business supplies expertise and technology tailored for specific industries. And expertise that is made repeatable and reusable is embodied in code — software, that is.</text></article>

I.B.M. confidently predicted that it would deliver earnings per share of ''at least $20'' in 2015, or double last year's performance. The company said it intends to generate $100 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, leaving plenty of money for investment. That includes $20 billion in acquisitions, or double the pace of the last five years. The company's shares rose more than 4 percent by midafternoon, up $5.31, to $132.20 a share. But didn't five-year plans go out with the collapse of the Eastern bloc economies? And isn't a certain amount of risk and unpredictability in a technology company's financial performance actually a sign that it is betting on innovation? Win some, lose some, after all. Not for I.B.M., at least as a whole, analysts say. It has transformed itself so that steady revenues from services contracts and business software licenses make it far less susceptible to the up-and-down swings of the technology industry. And the company, they add, has successfully shifted toward higher-margin software and improved the productivity in its services business, lifting profits further. ''With I.B.M., you are investing in stability,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, an independent technology analyst. In his remarks to an investor audience in New York, Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.'s chief executive, said the company would be investing for future growth in areas like emerging markets abroad and business analytics technology, which helps companies and governments sift through the ever-growing sources of digital data to make better decisions. Cloud computing and I.B.M.'s so-called smarter planet initiative, which applies computing to complex physical systems like traffic management and energy use, are also earmarked for extra investment. The $20 billion budget for acquisitions, Mr. Palmisano said, will be focused and measured bets. ''We're not trying to be I.T.T. or G.E. in the information technology space,'' he told his audience. ''So don't think of us that way. All things to all people, all segments. No, no, we have a much more focused play.'' Later, Mr. Palmisano summed up, ''We transformed I.B.M., and as we go forward it's an extension.'' The company plans to no big new forays. I.B.M., he said, will not ''spend $40 billion buying somebody,'' even though its pockets are deep enough to do so. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

The three suspects, two Italians and a Swiss national who had been living in Italy, were arrested on April 15 at a roadside checkpoint near Zurich after the police found explosives “and other objects that can be used in an attack” in their car, prosecutors said. A statement from the Federal Prosecutor’s Office said that the police had also found a letter referring to a planned attack on a branch of an international company. Prosecutors did not describe any motive behind the suspected plot or identify the suspects by name. A prosecution spokeswoman, Jeannette Balmer, would not give additional details of the case. An. I.B.M. spokeswoman, Constance Bordes, said the company had been informed of the case by the Swiss police and was cooperating with the investigation. I.B.M. has a laboratory near Zurich that conducts research into developing atomic and molecular-scale structures for enhancing electronic technologies, she said.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/technology/20blue.html?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Global Strategy Stabilized I.B.M. During Downturn<date>Published: April 19, 2010</date><text>I.B.M. wanted to sell its wares around the world since its early days, adopting the aspirational name International Business Machines Corporation, in 1924. And for decades, I.B.M. was the emblematic multinational with deep roots in foreign markets, mainly in the developed nations of Europe and Japan.Today, analysts say, I.B.M. is the leading example of a new breed of business enterprise: the postmultinational global corporation. The American postmultinational’s center of gravity has shifted outside the United States, not only in terms of sales, but also its strategy and major operations. I.B.M., for example, now makes two-thirds of its revenue abroad. Its revenue in new growth markets like China and India, but also smaller ones like Vietnam, the Czech Republic and the Philippines, jumped 20 percent in the first quarter, the company reported on Monday. I.B.M.’s nimble global strategy shielded the company’s profits throughout the economic downturn. The company’s heavy dependence on services and software — and shift away from hardware — makes its results less cyclical than for many technology companies. Yet that also means I.B.M.’s results will not surge as much as some others, like Intel, in the recovery. I.B.M. reported Monday that first-quarter net income rose 13 percent, to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a share, on $22.86 billion in revenue. The tilt toward international markets is evident at all of America’s major technology companies in the last several years, including Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Cisco, Oracle, Apple and Microsoft. Even Google, a young company and a hybrid, which runs on technology yet makes its money on advertising, reported last week that its surging overseas business now accounted for 53 percent of revenue. Technology companies held up better in the recession because they produce the tools that make it easier to operate globally — high-speed networking, clever software and powerful, inexpensive computers — and are in businesses tailored to exploit globalization. Internet communications mean skilled workers anywhere in the world are potential employees, which often drives down costs. Software, by its nature, is a product that is easy to distribute worldwide. Computer hardware is lightweight compared to its value, so chips and computers can be sent by air quickly to any location to meet demand. (Intel’s chips are frequent fliers; 65 percent of the company’s manufacturing is still in America, yet 82 percent of its sales are overseas.) Where I.B.M. is at the forefront of the postmultinational model, analysts say, is in globalizing its operations. The multinational approach combined firm controls from headquarters over a collection of separate companies overseas, each in a different market. Each country business typically had its own staff for finance, accounting, human relations, procurement and other functions. In the last few years, I.B.M.’s chief executive, Samuel J. Palmisano, has instead set up global centers of expertise with responsibility across the company. For example, the global purchasing and procurement unit is in China; human relations tasks like expense report processing are done in the Philippines; and back-office financial processing is done in Brazil. Global manufacturing is well-established. But most of what I.B.M. has done has been in the trickier arenas of software and services, which together represent 80 percent of revenue and involve organizing the work of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers. Today, I.B.M. says, 9 of every 10 employees in its country organizations are focused on working with customers. I.B.M.’s expansion in India is a good example of the trend. The buildup has been partly to cater to the local market there, but also to tap India’s large pool of lower-cost engineers, who handle software development and maintenance work on projects around the globe. Still, India is only one source of software expertise. Today, I.B.M. has 86 software development centers worldwide, up from 25 in 2001. In the last year, the company has opened special hubs of expertise for business intelligence and analytics software in fields like finance, energy, transportation, water management and health care in locations including New York, Berlin, Beijing, Dublin, Melbourne and Taipei. Technology, analysts say, allows scattering of pieces of work around the world, seeking skills and lower costs. “And I.B.M. has been particularly aggressive in moving to this globally distributed model,” observed David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. But the new-style globalization embraced by I.B.M., analysts say, is a daunting management task and a wrenching shift in corporate culture that means turmoil for thousands of workers. “In breaking down old models, I.B.M. faces a whole set of new challenges,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst for IDC. To keep pace with changes in demand for skills and to cut costs, I.B.M. is continually hiring for some jobs and trimming others. In recent years, it has set aside about $400 million annually for severance costs and other payments to cut about 8,000 workers a year, analysts estimate. Much of the cutting has come in developed, high-income economies, like the United States. I.B.M. still employs 105,000 workers in America, of a global payroll of more than 399,000 at the end of 2009, up 21 percent from five years ago. But its American work force is down 10,000 people from the end of 2008.</text></article>

Executive<date>March 24, 2010, 4:40 am</date><text>A former high level executive at I.B.M. is likely to enter a plea to end the case against him after agreeing to waive indictment in what prosecutors call the largest insider trading case in hedge fund history, The Associated Press reported. Robert Moffat, 53, of Ridgefield, Conn., was a former senior vice president and group executive at I.B.M.’s Systems and Technology Group before he was arrested in October in a case that linked hedge fund operators with corporate executives. Mr. Moffat, once considered a candidate for chief executive post at I.B.M., has been free on $2 million bail. His lawyer, Kerry Andrew Lawrence, confirmed Tuesday that his client would waive indictment, The Associated Press said. The lawyer spoke after prosecutors filed a one-page note in the case saying they intend to file a document outlining charges against Mr. Moffat once he formally waives indictment. That is a process that others in the case have followed before pleading guilty. A hearing was set for Monday. Mr. Moffat would become the 11th person to plead guilty in a case that has resulted in charges against 21 defendants. Authorities say profits from illegal trades topped $50 million.

Ms. Kamali is at the forefront of a technological transformation coming to many of the nation’s retailers. They are determined to strengthen the link between their physical stores and the Web, and to use technology to make shopping easier for consumers and more lucrative for themselves. The main way they plan to do it is by turning people’s mobile phones into information displays and ordering devices. Can’t find the flour at the grocery store? Grocers will offer phone applications that tell shoppers exactly where to go. Is the department store out of size 8 jeans? Retailers want to make it simple to punch a couple of buttons and have the desired size shipped home. Some supermarkets intend to offer real-time coupons while people shop. For example, a promotion for milk may be sent to a shopper’s mobile phone the moment her cart rolls into the dairy aisle. Drugstores will offer loyalty programs on cellphones, not on plastic cards. And specialty chains will allow shoppers to breeze through the aisles compiling a wedding registry, just by pointing at merchandise. It remains to be seen how readily shoppers will embrace such aggressive merchandising, which will generally require them to download free applications onto their phones and consent to being tracked electronically while in a store. But many stores are betting they will go along. After all, people already wander city streets guided by maps on their mobile phones. Why shouldn’t the same technology lead them to the toilet paper in Aisle 3? Hoping to use the technology as a competitive advantage, some big chains are reluctant to discuss their plans. The Sam’s Club division of Wal-Mart, Crate &amp; Barrel, Kerr Drug of North Carolina and Disney stores are among the retailers that confirmed they were testing various mobile technology or planned to do so soon. Technology companies behind the products say retailers are sniffing around, with some planning limited introductions this year and wider deployments in 2011 or 2012. Appropriately enough for a revered designer, Ms. Kamali is in the vanguard. A technology called ScanLife was installed at her boutique in recent weeks, and it already allows people to scan bar codes on merchandise and obtain details about the clothes through videos. The part about buying items day or night will come in another week or two. “To say that I’m excited is putting it mildly,” Ms. Kamali said. “I’ve been in this business since the ’60s and I have to just tell you, nothing  nothing at all  has been as powerful a change in the psyche of the way we do everything as this technology.” Other retailers have begun testing a product from I.B.M. called Presence. Shoppers who sign up can be detected as soon as they set foot in a store. That enables Presence to offer real-time mobile coupons. And tracking shoppers’ spending habits and browsing time in various departments can help the system figure out who might be moved to suddenly buy a discounted item. Presence can also make product recommendations. If a shopper was buying cake mix, Presence might suggest buying the store’s private-label frosting and sprinkles, too. “We’re also able to do predictive analytics  predict what we think you might want based on what we already know about you,” said Craig W. Stevenson, an I.B.M. executive who oversees Presence. Cisco Systems, the supplier of networking equipment and services for the Internet, is also a leader in the field. The company’s Mobile Concierge system is capable of connecting customers’ smartphones to retailers’ wireless networks  so a shopper could type “Cheez Whiz” into a cellphone, then pinpoint its location in the store. “We see the smartphone being used more and more in the shopping experience,” said Dick Cantwell, Cisco’s vice president for retail at Cisco’s Internet business solutions group. Beyond privacy worries, retailers recognize other potential pitfalls. If the phone applications freeze or give bad information, they will most likely frustrate consumers. So reliability will be a priority, a reason retailers are starting with limited tests. And as some executives said, many stores cannot yet afford such technology. As the more daring retailers see it, the potential benefits outweigh the risks. More aggressive profiling of shoppers  along with a novel, entertaining shopping experience  could help increase sales. And the technology may help retailers save money by cutting workers, essentially substituting electronic guidance for store clerks. Motorola, for example, has stores testing kiosk systems that enable consumers to summon a clerk to a particular department or fitting room when needed. A new Motorola product promises to eliminate loyalty cards, instead putting the program, as well as coupons, onto shoppers’ cellphones. “Probably by the end of 2010 we’ll have 10 to 20 retailers up and running,” said Frank Riso, a senior director at Motorola, adding that most of the activity will begin in 2011. Many big retailers have already created cellphone applications that do more than just dole out coupons. Target, for one, has an application that can identify which store aisle sells nightgowns. So far, many stores have focused on improving their mobile shopping sites, which some consumers use when browsing the aisles to see product reviews and specifications. Retailers like Sears and American Eagle Outfitters work with a company called Usablenet to optimize their mobile sites. Jason Taylor, Usablenet’s vice president for mobile products, said retailers began clamoring for improvements around Thanksgiving. The company is also working with a retailer, which it said it could not name, to enable shoppers to use smartphones to scan items in its stores, then add them to gift registries. “Extending the phone to use as a scanner in the retail world  especially gift registry, wish lists  you’re going to see a lot more of this year,” Mr. Taylor said. In the end, though, stores may not have much control over the way consumers use mobile technology. Some shoppers are already outwitting retailers, using mobile applications like RedLaser to compare prices in a physical store to those on the Web. (Such applications scan product bar codes through a cellphone’s camera.) Ben Aldern, 20, of Berkeley, Calif., went to Target recently to shop for headphones. “I was ready to spend whatever I needed,” he said, but on a hunch, he fired up RedLaser  and found the same model for less at Amazon, the online merchant. “Once I saw I could save 20 bucks,” he said, “Target lost me.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 27, 2010, on page A1 of the New York edition.Shoppers will soon be able to stand outside the designer Norma Kamali’s boutique in Manhattan, point a phone at merchandise in the window and buy it  even late at night when the store is closed.

Skip to next paragraph Related Google Asks Spy Agency for Help With Inquiry Into Cyberattacks (February 5, 2010) 2 China Schools Said to Be Tied to Online Attacks (February 19, 2010) The university has alliances with elite American ones like Duke and the University of Michigan. And it is so rich in science and engineering talent that Microsoft and Intel have moved into a research park directly adjacent to the school. But Jiaotong, whose sprawling campus here has more than 33,000 students, is facing an unpleasant question: is it a base for sophisticated computer hackers? Investigators looking into Web attacks on Google and dozens of other American companies last year have traced the intrusions to computers at Jiaotong as well as an obscure vocational school in eastern China, according to people briefed on the case. Security experts caution that it is hard to trace online attacks and that the digital footprints may be a “false flag,” a kind of decoy intended to throw investigators off track. But those with knowledge of the investigation say there are reliable clues that suggest the highly sophisticated attacks may have originated at Jiaotong and the more obscure campus, Lanxiang Vocational School in Shandong Province, an institution with ties to the Chinese military. Last weekend, the two schools strongly denied any knowledge of the attacks, which singled out corporate files and the e-mail accounts of human rights activists. A spokesman for Jiaotong told local news outlets that school officials were “shocked and indignant” to learn of the allegations. And a Lanxiang spokesman called the reports preposterous. But analysts say Jiaotong and Lanxiang are certain to come under close scrutiny. Jiaotong is one of China’s top universities, and one charged with helping transform this country into a science and technology powerhouse. The school has exchange programs with some of the world’s leading universities. Early this year, Duke said that with the help of Jiaotong, it would build its own campus near Shanghai. Michael J. Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke, said on Friday that the university was troubled by the allegations. “We’re going to have to explore that with Shanghai Jiaotong and understand the situation,” he said. “It’s a very complex situation.” One of Jiaotong’s strongest departments is computer science, which has garnered support from some of America’s biggest technology companies, including Cisco Systems. Microsoft has collaborated with Jiaotong on a laboratory for intelligent computing and intelligent systems at the university. Two weeks ago, Jiaotong students won an international computer programming competition sponsored by I.B.M., known as the Battle of the Brains, beating out Stanford and other elite institutions. It was the third time in the last decade that Jiaotong students had taken the top prize. Jiaotong is also home to the School of Information Security Engineering, which specializes in Internet security. The school’s dean and chief professor have both worked on technology matters for the People’s Liberation Army, according to the school’s Web site. The school, which has received financing from a high-level government science and technology project, code-named 863, has also regularly invited world-famous hackers and Web security experts to lecture there. The latest clues do not answer the question of who was behind the attacks. But it is likely to put added pressure on Beijing to investigate a case that has prompted Google to threaten to pull out of China. Beijing has not announced an investigation, but Web security experts emphasize that the Chinese government would need to be involved to find the ultimate perpetrators of the attacks. “The U.S. would not be able to trace this” back to the source, said O. Sami Saydjari, the founder of the Cyber Defense Agency, a private Web security firm based in Wisconsin. “We cannot trace it beyond borders. We’d need the cooperation of the Chinese.” Xiao Qiang, an expert on Chinese Internet censorship and control, says Jiaotong is studying not just Web security but also how to filter content that the government may deem unhealthy. “Computer security may sound neutral, but in China, it also includes content, including content the government doesn’t like and wants to get rid of,” he says. Scott J. Henderson, the author of “The Dark Visitor: Inside the World of Chinese Hackers,” said that in 2007, a prominent Chinese hacker with ties to China’s Ministry of Security also lectured at Jiaotong. “He gave a lecture called ‘Hacking in a Nutshell,’ ” said Mr. Henderson, whose research was partly financed by the American military. In a statement on Sunday, Microsoft said it could not comment on reports that some hacking had been traced to Jiaotong. But the statement also said: “We condemn cyberattacks and industrial espionage no matter who is ultimately responsible. We hope officials will conduct a full investigation and cooperate fully with international authorities to get to the bottom of this situation.” Google and other companies that were victims of the attacks have declined to comment. Investigators are also looking into whether some of the intrusions originated at Lanxiang Vocational School, in the city of Jinan. Lanxiang, which has 30,000 students studying trades like cosmetology and welding, was founded in 1984 by a former military officer on land donated by the military, according to Jinan’s propaganda department. On its Web site, the school records visits to the campus by military officers and boasts of sending “a large batch of graduates to the army” and says “those graduates become the backbone of the army.” Graduates of the school’s computer science department are recruited by the local military garrison each year, according to the school’s dean, Mr. Shao, who would give only his last name. School officials also insist that Lanxiang students are not capable of sophisticated hacking. “It’s impossible for our students to hack Google and other U.S. companies,” Mr. Shao said in a telephone interview. “They are just high school graduates and not at an advanced level.” Little information is publicly available about the school’s computer science department.

Skip to next paragraph Related Google Asks Spy Agency for Help With Inquiry Into Cyberattacks (February 5, 2010) 2 China Schools Said to Be Tied to Online Attacks (February 19, 2010) The university has alliances with elite American ones like Duke and the University of Michigan. And it is so rich in science and engineering talent that Microsoft and Intel have moved into a research park directly adjacent to the school. But Jiaotong, whose sprawling campus here has more than 33,000 students, is facing an unpleasant question: is it a base for sophisticated computer hackers? Investigators looking into Web attacks on Google and dozens of other American companies last year have traced the intrusions to computers at Jiaotong as well as an obscure vocational school in eastern China, according to people briefed on the case. Security experts caution that it is hard to trace online attacks and that the digital footprints may be a “false flag,” a kind of decoy intended to throw investigators off track. But those with knowledge of the investigation say there are reliable clues that suggest the highly sophisticated attacks may have originated at Jiaotong and the more obscure campus, Lanxiang Vocational School in Shandong Province, an institution with ties to the Chinese military. Last weekend, the two schools strongly denied any knowledge of the attacks, which singled out corporate files and the e-mail accounts of human rights activists. A spokesman for Jiaotong told local news outlets that school officials were “shocked and indignant” to learn of the allegations. And a Lanxiang spokesman called the reports preposterous. But analysts say Jiaotong and Lanxiang are certain to come under close scrutiny. Jiaotong is one of China’s top universities, and one charged with helping transform this country into a science and technology powerhouse. The school has exchange programs with some of the world’s leading universities. Early this year, Duke said that with the help of Jiaotong, it would build its own campus near Shanghai. Michael J. Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke, said on Friday that the university was troubled by the allegations. “We’re going to have to explore that with Shanghai Jiaotong and understand the situation,” he said. “It’s a very complex situation.” One of Jiaotong’s strongest departments is computer science, which has garnered support from some of America’s biggest technology companies, including Cisco Systems. Microsoft has collaborated with Jiaotong on a laboratory for intelligent computing and intelligent systems at the university. Two weeks ago, Jiaotong students won an international computer programming competition sponsored by I.B.M., known as the Battle of the Brains, beating out Stanford and other elite institutions. It was the third time in the last decade that Jiaotong students had taken the top prize. Jiaotong is also home to the School of Information Security Engineering, which specializes in Internet security. The school’s dean and chief professor have both worked on technology matters for the People’s Liberation Army, according to the school’s Web site. The school, which has received financing from a high-level government science and technology project, code-named 863, has also regularly invited world-famous hackers and Web security experts to lecture there. The latest clues do not answer the question of who was behind the attacks. But it is likely to put added pressure on Beijing to investigate a case that has prompted Google to threaten to pull out of China. Beijing has not announced an investigation, but Web security experts emphasize that the Chinese government would need to be involved to find the ultimate perpetrators of the attacks. “The U.S. would not be able to trace this” back to the source, said O. Sami Saydjari, the founder of the Cyber Defense Agency, a private Web security firm based in Wisconsin. “We cannot trace it beyond borders. We’d need the cooperation of the Chinese.” Xiao Qiang, an expert on Chinese Internet censorship and control, says Jiaotong is studying not just Web security but also how to filter content that the government may deem unhealthy. “Computer security may sound neutral, but in China, it also includes content, including content the government doesn’t like and wants to get rid of,” he says. Scott J. Henderson, the author of “The Dark Visitor: Inside the World of Chinese Hackers,” said that in 2007, a prominent Chinese hacker with ties to China’s Ministry of Security also lectured at Jiaotong. “He gave a lecture called ‘Hacking in a Nutshell,’ ” said Mr. Henderson, whose research was partly financed by the American military. In a statement on Sunday, Microsoft said it could not comment on reports that some hacking had been traced to Jiaotong. But the statement also said: “We condemn cyberattacks and industrial espionage no matter who is ultimately responsible. We hope officials will conduct a full investigation and cooperate fully with international authorities to get to the bottom of this situation.” Google and other companies that were victims of the attacks have declined to comment. Investigators are also looking into whether some of the intrusions originated at Lanxiang Vocational School, in the city of Jinan. Lanxiang, which has 30,000 students studying trades like cosmetology and welding, was founded in 1984 by a former military officer on land donated by the military, according to Jinan’s propaganda department.

His mission and the activities of the company he heads, Intellectual Ventures, a secretive $5 billion investment firm that has scooped up 30,000 patents, inspire admiration and angst. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Stuart Isett for The New York Times Nathan Myhrvold with a machine that freeze-dries food. Intellectual Ventures so far has paid $315 million to individual inventors. Admirers of Mr. Myhrvold, the scientist who led Microsoft’s technology development in the 1990s, see an innovator seeking to elevate the economic role and financial rewards for inventors whose patented ideas are often used without compensation by big technology companies. His detractors see a cynical operator deploying his bulging patent trove as a powerful bargaining chip, along with the implied threat of costly litigation, to prod high-tech companies to pay him lucrative fees. They call his company “Intellectual Vultures.” White hat or black hat, Intellectual Ventures is growing rapidly and becoming a major force in the marketplace for intellectual capital. Its rise comes as Congress is considering legislation, championed by large technology companies, that would make it more difficult for patent holders to win large damage awards in court  changes that Mr. Myhrvold has opposed in Congressional testimony and that his company has lobbied against. Intellectual Ventures spent more than $1 million on lobbying last year, according to public filings compiled by OpenSecrets.org. In the three most recent election cycles  2006, 2008 and 2010  Intellectual Ventures executives, led by Mr. Myhrvold, have contributed more than $1 million to Democratic and Republican candidates and committees. Mr. Myhrvold makes no apology for playing hard under the current patent system. If his company is going to help change things, it must be a force to be reckoned with. “We have to be successful,” he said. The issues surrounding Intellectual Ventures, viewed broadly, are the ground rules and incentives for innovation. “How this plays out will be crucial to the American economy,” said Josh Lerner, an economist and patent expert at the Harvard Business School. Mr. Myhrvold certainly thinks so. He says he is trying to build a robust, efficient market for “invention capital,” much as private equity and venture capital developed in recent decades. “They started from nothing, were deeply misunderstood and were trashed by people threatened by new business models,” he said in his offices here. Mr. Myhrvold presents his case at length in a 7,000-word article published on Thursday in the Harvard Business Review. “If we and firms like us succeed,” he writes, “the invention capital system will turbocharge technological progress, create many more new businesses, and change the world for the better.” In the article and in conversation, Mr. Myhrvold describes the patent world as a vastly underdeveloped market, starved for private capital and too dependent on federal financing for universities and government agencies, which is mainly aimed at scientific discovery anyway. Eventually, he foresees patents being valued as a separate asset class, like real estate or securities. His antagonists, he says, are the “cozy oligarchy” of big technology companies like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and others that typically reach cross-licensing agreements with each other, and then refuse to deal with or acknowledge the work of inventors or smaller companies. Ignoring the patents of others is “deeply ingrained in parts of certain industries,” he writes in the article, “most notably software, computing and other Internet-related sectors.” Large technology companies complain about patent suits but, Mr. Myhrvold says, their actions often invite litigation. “The attitude of the big guys has been that unless you sue me or threaten to sue me, get lost,” he said in the interview. “I know, I was one of those guys.” Indeed, Mr. Myhrvold, 50, supplied his considerable brain power to Microsoft for 13 years, serving as chief technology officer until 2000. Mr. Myhrvold personifies the term polymath. He is a prolific patent producer himself, with more than 100 held or applied for. He earned his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton and did postdoctorate research on quantum field theory under Stephen Hawking, before founding a start-up that Microsoft acquired. He is an accomplished French chef, who has also won a national barbecue contest in Tennessee. He is an avid wildlife photographer, and he has dabbled in paleontology, working on research projects digging for dinosaur remains in the Rockies. His Intellectual Ventures is not simply a patent hedge fund. Its 650 employees include scientists and engineers, and it has an in-house invention effort and lab that last year applied for 450 patents. To date, the company has paid $315 million to individual inventors. He calls patents “the next software,” noting that software did not become a market on its own until the 1980s, spurred by innovators and the enforcement of intellectual property laws. “I’m trying to get inventions that kind of respect as an economic entity,” he said. Yet while Mr. Myhrvold is saying one thing, his company’s main activity is quite another, according to Mark Bohannon, general counsel and senior vice president for public policy for the Software and Information Industry Association. Intellectual Ventures, Mr. Bohannon says, is the largest of the category of firms that hold patents, but do not make products. Lawyers call such firms nonpracticing entities, NPEs, though they are often labeled as patent trolls. “Our concern is that it games the patent litigation system so it can extract licensing fees and investments from technology companies that create jobs, innovate and make products,” said Mr. Bohannon, whose trade association includes I.B.M., Google, Oracle, SAP and Adobe. Several analysts say that Intellectual Ventures has been primarily a master practitioner of exploiting the current rules of the game to its advantage. Many companies in the patent field use shell companies to mask their activities, and Intellectual Ventures seems to employ them with uncommon frequency. A report last month by Avancept, an intellectual property consulting firm, said that up to 1,110 shell companies and affiliated entities appear to be linked to Intellectual Ventures. The secrecy, said Thomas Ewing, principal consultant for Avancept, makes it “far more difficult to confidently negotiate with Intellectual Ventures.” Intellectual Ventures, founded in 2000, began operating in 2003. It says it has returned $1 billion to investors and collected more than $1 billion in license fees to date. Most of the revenue has apparently come from 16 so-called strategic investors  big companies that pay to license patent rights and get a stake in an Intellectual Ventures fund. The companies must sign strict nondisclosure agreements to even talk with Intellectual Ventures. Only Microsoft has publicly stated that it is one of the group. In 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon Communications had agreed to pay Intellectual Ventures $350 million. Other companies that have agreed to sizable payments to Intellectual Ventures include Intel, Nokia and Sony, according to people told of deals. And Intellectual Ventures has sought deals with others, including I.B.M. and Amazon, so far without success, say people informed of the talks. Intellectual Ventures’ penchant for secrecy, Mr. Myhrvold says, is partly a legacy from its early days as an upstart when it did not want to tip its hand. Personally, he says he advocates not only the public disclosure of patents but also license agreements, but he will not give up the competitive edge of secrecy unilaterally. “If everybody in the industry does it, I’ll be right there,” Mr. Myhrvold said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times Rodney Adkins, senior vice president for systems and technology at I.B.M., which is ahead in developing customized systems. Suppliers are offering customers assembled bundles of hardware and software to make it easier and less expensive for customers to cope with the Internet-era surge in data  an information flood coming from internal databases, but also from Web-based collaboration and smartphone applications, sensors that monitor electrical use, environmental contamination and food shipments, even biological and genetic research. The shift to packaging hardware and software together is behind the recent big deals and partnerships in the technology industry: Oracle’s purchase of Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion, an alliance between Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft announced last month, and a similar partnership between Cisco Systems and EMC. But computer scientists at universities and technology companies say that simply putting the hardware and software building blocks together more efficiently for customers is not enough. “The huge challenge is to take all this data and generate useful knowledge from it,” said Kunle Olukotun, a computer scientist at Stanford. “It’s an enormous opportunity in science and business, but it also presents a massive computing problem.” The path to intelligently mining the explosion of data, Mr. Olukotun said, involves new approaches to breaking down computing tasks into subtasks that can be processed simultaneously  a concept known as parallel computing  and new system designs optimized for specific kinds of work. Designing computer systems around the work to be done is a departure from the dominant approach of general-purpose design, in which machines are built to be capable of handling all kinds of chores and are then programmed to do specific tasks. Several companies are beginning to bring workload-optimized systems design into the mainstream of corporate and government computing. The promise, analysts say, is to not only open the door to exploiting the data flood for competitive advantage, but also to reduce energy costs and help automate the management and administration of computer systems  a labor-intensive expense that is rising four times faster than the cost of hardware. I.B.M., according to industry analysts, is at the forefront of the effort to develop more customized systems. And on Monday, the company is making the first of a series of announcements this year that embody the new approach. I.B.M. is introducing a line of big computer servers using its Power 7 32-core microprocessors. They are priced at $190,000, typically run Unix or Linux, and are aimed at industries like finance and utilities, as well as scientific researchers. Next month, I.B.M. plans to unveil far less costly server systems based on industry-standard microprocessors made by Intel. Those machines, which typically run Unix or Microsoft Windows, will be used for Web collaboration, e-mail and other applications. “These are not simply hardware products, but the result of years of work and investment at every level from the silicon up through the software,” said Rodney C. Adkins, I.B.M.’s senior vice president for systems and technology. “And the real challenge is to optimize it all, not just the hardware.” The early deployment of so-called smart utility grids points to the challenges of handling ever-vaster amounts of data. Smart electric meters can measure room temperatures and energy use hourly or at 15-minute intervals instead of the old pattern of utility service workers reading electro-mechanical meters every month or two. The goal of smart grids, which governments are starting to heavily subsidize, is to give households and businesses timely information so they can change their electricity consumption habits to reduce energy use and pollution, and save money. That involves not only collecting the data, but also analyzing and presenting it to consumers in ways that are easily understood  typically a personalized Web site graphically showing household electricity consumption and pricing. EMeter, a maker of smart-grid software in San Mateo, Calif., said that using I.B.M.’s workload-tuned P-7 systems should more than double its capacity to manage smart meters, bringing it up to 50 million. In one eMeter project, the utilities in Ontario are going to install 4.5 million smart meters by 2011. Before, meters were read once every month or two. Under the digital system, readings will be made hourly, a hundredfold increase in the data generated. “If you can’t continually measure energy use down to the granular level in homes and businesses, the smart grid doesn’t work,” said Scott Smith, director of technical solutions at eMeter. “You need a tremendous amount of computing power to do that at scale.” Computer scientists, biologists and researchers from Rice University and the Texas Medical Center have been working with I.B.M. scientists to fine-tune P-7 systems for cancer research. Genetic and protein-folding simulations require vast amounts of specialized high-speed processing and computer memory, said Kamran Khan, vice provost for information technology at Rice. I.B.M., he said, dispatched three Ph.D. biologists to work with the cancer researchers. “They really understand computational biology,” Mr. Khan said. The more bespoke approach to computer-systems design does increase the risk that customers are locked into one or two powerful companies. Indeed, the reason data-center customers long preferred the building-block approach to hardware and software was that it guaranteed competition among suppliers. But the tradeoff has been that customers had to put the hardware and software together themselves, even as computing complexity and data-handling demands surged. Many companies, it seems, are willing to accept less competition among suppliers for the convenience and cost savings from prepackaged systems. “It’s a balancing act,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst at IDC. “It does take away some choice, but also makes things a lot simpler. And that, after all, is the model that Apple used so successfully in consumer technology.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on February 8, 2010, on page B4 of the New York edition.In data-center computing, the big trend today is to move from building blocks to bundles.

Security software is a critical component of the “stack” of applications used by companies to store and manage networks and data, making software makers from McAfee to the upstart Sourcefire attractive targets. “There is a clear trend toward convergence of technologies in the data center, and security is front and center,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, told the news service.

The $7.4 billion deal, which gives Oracle a vast hardware business for the first time, pits it against Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Dell and Cisco Systems, all of which have made a flurry of acquisitions and alliances. Many of these moves broadened the companies' products and services from their traditional specialties, like databases, computers or networking equipment. Each company wants to be able to claim to prospective customers that it, and it alone, has more of the parts to be an end-to-end service provider. ''The cost isn't in buying the pieces,'' Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ''The cost is in the labor of assembling them and making them work.'' On Wednesday, Oracle will hold an event at its Silicon Valley headquarters where executives from the company will talk in detail about the plans for Sun Microsystems. Mr. Ellison said that in the next few months, Oracle planned to lay off fewer than 2,000 people, while hiring more than 2,000 people in engineering, sales and other roles. He did not rule out that additional layoffs might occur later. Mr. Ellison added that he expected Sun's chief executive, Jonathan I. Schwartz, to resign and that he hoped that Scott G. McNealy, Sun's co-founder and chairman, would stay on at Oracle, although his title and duties were not clear. ''We need to have more conversations about his role,'' Mr. Ellison said. Oracle's purchase of Sun, which European regulators approved last week after months of scrutiny, stands out as the most game-changing corporate technology play made during the economic downturn, according to industry analysts. ''It's the most significant deal of the decade,'' said Dan Olds, an analyst with Gabriel Consulting. ''Oracle has a shot here to change the rules of the industry and usher in a new era.'' As analysts like Mr. Olds point out, the era is new only in relative terms. The corporate computing market began decades ago with I.B.M. selling customers systems that included most of the hardware and software they would need in a single package. As time went on, a host of minicomputer makers rose to prominence with a similar strategy, in which they would build all of the crucial pieces of a large system, including its chips, main software and networking technology. The older model of selling corporate systems was then disrupted by the rise of powerful, more standardized computers based on readily available chips from Intel and an innovative software market. Customers could suddenly choose the technology they preferred from a variety of suppliers and assemble those products in their own data centers. Prices of hardware and software declined under this competitive pressure. Oracle, for one, wants to revert to the more traditional model. The company plans to offer customers databases, business software, servers, storage systems and networking equipment from one place. In addition, Oracle will do the hard engineering work to make sure all this technology works well together, Mr. Ellison said. ''It is odd that the computer industry ships all these separate parts and expects customers to assemble them,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''You will now be buying this complete system, and don't have to hire I.B.M. or someone else to assemble it for you.'' While Oracle has long battled I.B.M. in the database market, its push into computer hardware places the company in direct competition with longtime partners like H.P. and Dell. Last year, Cisco Systems branched out from its roots as the world's largest networking company and began selling computer servers -- a move that pitted it against H.P., Dell and I.B.M. Cisco also formed a sales partnership with EMC and its software subsidiary VMware that further fanned competition. Traditionally, Cisco had teamed with H.P., Dell and I.B.M. in large data center deals.</text></article>

No financial information was disclosed, and the news release is laden with technical jargon like “predictive intelligence” and “enterprise architecture.” I.B.M. itself says that its purchase will enhance its consulting business to government agencies, and could yield technological applications for the private sector as well. But a closer look shows that the deal will give I.B.M. a fast-growing player in data-mining, with a specialty in providing advanced analysis to defense and intelligence agencies. For starters, N.I.S.C.’s current owner is DC Capital Partners, a private equity firm specializing in middle-market companies in the defense, aerospace and information services sectors. DC Capital was founded in April 2007 by Thomas J. Campbell after a dispute at his employer, the defense-minded buyout firm Veritas Capital (which once owned the private military contractor DynCorp International). DC Capital created N.I.S.C. two months later, after rolling up a series of smaller information-analysis companies. Since then, N.I.S.C. has grown to a 1,000-employee company with $200 million in revenue. Based in Fairfax, Va., N.I.S.C. offers consulting services, including exotic abilities like data-mining and retrieval and cybersecurity initiatives. “IBM’s analytic and innovation prowess, combined with N.I.S.C.’s industry knowledge and depth of experience in defense, health care, energy and infrastructure management services, will allow us to deliver an unprecedented level of service and support to our growing list of government clients,” Chuck Prow, a managing partner at IBM Global Business Services, said in a statement. Among the company’s directors are: Kara L. Bue, an aide-de-camp to Richard L. Armitage, former deputy secretary of state. Gen. Michael A. Hagee, a former commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Chuck Hagel, the former United States senator from Nebraska. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the former head of the Central Intelligence Agency. Gen. Anthony M. Zinni, a former head of the United States Central Command. All except Ms. Bue serve on DC Capital’s advisory board. DC Capital’s investment appears to have paid off handsomely. The private equity firm invested $19.6 million in N.I.S.C., and will realize $180 million from the IBM. deal, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook.

After a Shift<date>Published: January 19, 2010</date><text>The corporate technology industry is scrambling for higher ground, moving up from hardware into services and mixing in some business software. The goal is steady revenue, higher profit and tighter bonds with customers  and the model is I.B.M., which reported its quarterly results on Tuesday, finishing off a record year of profits for the company. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: International Business Machines Corporation The shift to services has generated some hefty deals. Last fall, Dell agreed to pay $3.9 billion for Perot Systems, a technology services company, and Xerox paid $6.4 billion for Affiliated Computer Services. A year earlier, Hewlett-Packard bought Electronic Data Systems for $13.9 billion. The headline deals are part of a broader evolution as other major technology suppliers, like Cisco Systems and EMC, also invest to build up their services businesses, and mix in software. They are all following the path pioneered by I.B.M., analysts say, one that the company began to pursue in the 1990s and has gathered pace in recent years. Services and software now account for more than 80 percent of I.B.M.’s business, up from half in 2000. In that time, the company sold hardware businesses including flat-panel displays, disk drives, personal computers and printers. Since Samuel J. Palmisano became chief executive in 2002, I.B.M. has spent more than $25 billion on dozens of acquisitions, nearly all of services and software companies. The company’s big research arm has been retooled to tilt toward services, and it worked with universities to develop services science courses at more than 400 schools in 50 nations. Big Blue, analysts say, has occasionally stumbled in recent years, reporting disappointing quarterly results, but the setbacks have been rare. “I.B.M. has made a remarkable transition,” said Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president of research at Gartner. “It’s clearly at the forefront of this migration to services and software.” I.B.M. reported its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday with a performance that once again validated its approach. The company delivered net income of $4.8 billion, or $3.59 a share, up 10 percent from the year-ago quarter. That easily surpassed the average Wall Street forecast of $3.47 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 1 percent, to $27.2 billion, about $200 million above the analysts’ consensus. I.B.M. is no longer the largest technology supplier, measured by sales; Hewlett-Packard now holds that distinction. “Revenue is not the goal at I.B.M.,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “Its model is about pursuing higher-margin recurring revenue and reducing volatility.” I.B.M.’s services business was born of necessity  a way to unbundle its pricing of big mainframe computers. In the early 1990s, I.B.M.’s business was threatened as it became increasingly possible to move some corporate workloads off expensive mainframes and onto computers powered by lower-cost microprocessor technology. So the company began charging separately for services and support that previously had been rolled into the price of a big mainframe. The services strategy at I.B.M. evolved steadily. A big step came in 2002, when I.B.M. bought the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion. That moved I.B.M. services up from the care and updating of customers’ data centers and specialized software to advising senior corporate executives on how to use technology to cut costs and generate new business. “That was a gigantic push into business solutions,” said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, a former senior technology strategist for I.B.M. “As the components of technology  especially hardware  become inexpensive and commoditized, you want to focus less on the components and more on how customers want to use technology.” Over the years, I.B.M. has helped redefine services, as more and more tasks that were once done by people can be automated with software. Its objective, the company says, is to “industrialize services” with standardized processes and software, so delivering the services is less costly and more profitable. Another important tool in that efficiency drive, analysts say, has been to shift technical work to lower-wage nations like India when possible. In recent years, I.B.M. has set aside about $400 million annually for the cost of severance and other payments to shed workers, about 8,000 a year, analysts estimate. Each year, I.B.M. adds employees as well as sheds some. At the end of 2008, the most recent available numbers, the company had 398,000 employees worldwide, up from 386,000 a year earlier. I.B.M. employed 115,000 in the United States, where its work force has declined in recent years. Two current trends, analysts say, provide attractive opportunities for I.B.M.’s services-and-software model. The first, they say, is the interest among corporations to use software as a service, often provided over the Internet from far-away data centers, delivered to workers on their personal computers or smartphones. This is the basis of so-called cloud computing. Another related trend, analysts say, is the Internet-era explosion of data, with companies increasingly trying to identify patterns and make better decisions using data not only from Web sites, but also from sensors; radio frequency identification tags; and ever-expanding corporate databases. Two of I.B.M.’s largest software purchases were in business intelligence and analytics technology: Cognos, for $5 billion in 2008, and SPSS, for $1.2 billion, which closed last fall.

    <article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/big-blues-smarter-marketing-playbook/?ref=internationalbusinessmachines">Big Blue's Smarter Marketing Playbook<date>January 12, 2010, 2:07 pm</date><text>I.B.M. trotted out its “smarter planet” campaign more than a year ago, starting with a speech by Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.’s chief executive, at the Council on Foreign Relations. At the time, the campaign seemed an ambitious, though potentially risky, move. The vision of transportation, health care, cities, retailing, finance and other fields made more intelligent with digital technology — and yes, supplied largely by I.B.M. — could have easily fizzled and been portrayed as big-think puffery, out of step with an economy in a tailspin. But I.B.M.’s gamble looks like a good one today. The smarter-planet campaign has covered Big Blue in the mantle of thought and technology leadership among its core customers of senior corporate executives and government officials. It has also delivered new business, helping I.B.M. hold up better than most of its industry peers; its stock price is up 50 percent in the last year. Mr. Palmisano delivered a speech on Wednesday Tuesday — “Welcome to the Decade of Smart” — at London’s Chatham House, home of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a policy think tank. Though not meant as a lessons-learned marketing tutorial, the talk is implicitly just that. A few observations and excerpts: – Play to your strengths. To pull off smarter planet-style projects is a big-systems challenge involving computer hardware, sensor networks, specialized software and hands-on work by industry experts. No technology company has all the pieces the way I.B.M. does, able to position itself as the digital general contractor for big projects, often financed with government stimulus money by governments around the world. – Present your vision as a historic shift. “What we at I.B.M. had come to believe,” Mr. Palmisano said, was that there was a “seminal change in the way the world literally works.” – It helps to have I.B.M.’s marketing muscle and relationships with corporate and government decision-makers. Besides its online, print and television advertising, I.B.M. did a lot of face-to-face evangelism. “We initiated outreach in more than 50 countries, both the established and emerging nations of the world,” Mr. Palmisano said. “We have held nearly 100 conferences on the subject of Smarter Cities alone, attended by more than 2,000 civic leaders.” – Deliver enough success to support your theme. I.B.M. isn’t about to talk about projects that may be falling short. Still, Mr. Palmisano pointed to winners in several fields. In cities like Stockholm, London and Singapore, the company has helped deploy congestion management systems. Mr. Palmisano pointed to the benefits: “Traffic volume during peak periods has been reduced by 18 percent, CO2 emissions from motor vehicles were reduced by up to 14 percent, and public transit use increased by up to 7 percent.” – Convert your customers to advocates. Speaking of corporate and government champions of smarter planet projects, Mr. Palmisano said, “These leaders didn’t wait for legislation to be passed, or an industry consortium to be formed. They reached across multiple constituencies, took the initiative and drove change.” – Be candid about challenges. The smarter planet systems rely on immense data collection and analysis, raising privacy and security issues. “Some citizens have expressed discomfort at living in … not a safer society,” Mr. Palmisano said, “but a surveillance society.” (One of his speech writers, presumably, found the delightful piece from The Daily Mail in London in 2007 that pointed out the apartment in which George Orwell wrote “1984″ now has 32 closed-circuit cameras within 200 yards.) But such challenges become brand and image-burnishing opportunities for I.B.M. Next month the company will stage a worldwide online collaboration, SecurityJam, inviting the participation of business and government security experts and leaders — all potential customers.</text></article>
