The four families had DNA evidence proving they were related to children who died during the trial. In all, 11 children died in the trial: five after taking Trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage. Although Pfizer said that only 200 children had been given Trovan or the older antibiotic, 547 families sued. Despite having settled the case, the company still contends that meningitis, not its drugs, was responsible for the deaths and injuries, a Pfizer spokesman said Thursday. Epidemics sweep Africa’s arid “meningitis belt” on dust-filled winds during the dry season every year, and more than 12,000 Africans died of meningitis in 1996; in addition, the drugs in the trial were given only to children who were already very sick. The company also said that Trovan had first been tested in 5,000 Americans and Europeans. Pfizer said Trovan saved lives in Nigeria, because 94 percent of the Nigerian children who received the drug survived — more than normally do if no medicine is administered. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 Washington Post article, the trial’s certificate of approval from a hospital ethics board was forged, and Pfizer said its own investigation had proved that the certificate was “incorrect.” Families of children who died or were injured while on the second antibiotic contended that Pfizer had prescribed low doses of the drug to make the results for Trovan look better. The deaths and injuries of children during the Trovan trial, along with the dispute over the cause, first gained broad attention in 2000, when The Post published a series of articles that raised major questions about drug testing overseas. The articles touched off demonstrations in Nigeria. The distrust of Western medicine that the dispute engendered was one of several factors that led many families in northern Nigeria to refuse to let their children be vaccinated against polio. (Other factors were rumors that the polio vaccine contained the AIDS virus or represented a Western plot to sterilize Muslim girls.) Northern Nigeria is still one of the world’s last remaining epicenters of polio. Trovan was introduced in 1998 and became a lucrative product for Pfizer, but it was later withdrawn in Europe and restricted in the United States after the drug was blamed for cases of fatal liver damage. Last year, a secret 2009 State Department cable exposed by WikiLeaks said that a Pfizer official in Nigeria told American diplomats that the company had hired private investigators to “uncover corruption links” to Nigeria’s former attorney general in order to pressure him to drop the Trovan lawsuits. A Pfizer official in New York denied the accusation.The first payments were made Thursday to Nigerian families who lost children during a 1996 trial of an experimental meningitis drug, and Pfizer, which had tested the drug, a new antibiotic, said it was “pleased” that payments were finally being made under a settlement reached two years ago.</text></article>

However, a nonprescription version would not be available immediately after the patent on Lipitor expires because Pfizer would first have to convince the Food and Drug Administration that consumers could take the drug without a doctor’s supervision. That will probably be difficult. Merck failed three times to win the agency’s approval for over-the-counter versions of Mevacor, which, like Lipitor, is a statin. Bristol-Myers Squibb also failed to obtain approval for an over-the-counter version of Pravachol, another statin. Pfizer declined to either confirm or deny its intention. “We can confirm that we have strategic plans in place for Lipitor’s loss of exclusivity and will comment no further at this time,” Raymond F. Kerins Jr., a spokesman for the company, said. The person close to the situation, who would speak only anonymously because the discussions were private, said a nonprescription version of the drug was not the only option pursued by Pfizer. Another would be a so-called branded generic version. The company might pursue both options. Pfizer announced last month that it was looking to sell or spin off animal health and baby formula businesses to streamline the company and help prepare for the loss of Lipitor sales to generic competitors. But the company decided to keep two businesses that Wall Street had speculated might be sold: the generic drug business and the consumer business, which now sells products like Advil and Robitussin. That has led to speculation that the company was planning to sell generic and over-the-counter versions of Lipitor and other drugs that face a loss of patent protection. Pfizer’s plans for the nonprescription Lipitor were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would no doubt be welcomed by insurers because it would cost less. In the past, the F.D.A. advisers have been concerned that over-the counter versions of statins could not be used safely, that some patients who did not need the drugs would take them. Others at significant risk of cardiovascular problems might take the over-the-counter drug and forgo seeing a doctor or getting other necessary care. Since high cholesterol is a symptomless condition, consumers would not know whether the drug was working without having their cholesterol checked periodically. But Steven Francesco of Francesco International, a consulting firm that specializes in converting brand name drugs to over-the-counter products, said technology such as prescription cards used at the drug store would better allow patients to be monitored without physician supervision. “There’s any number of ways to insure that the consumer can use the drug,” said Mr. Francesco. “Lipitor will be one of the first of many drugs that will attempt to switch between now and 2016.”Pfizer hopes to introduce an over-the-counter version of Lipitor, the world’s best-selling drug, after it loses patent protection in November, a person close to the situation said Wednesday.</text></article>

The study, which had included more than 2,700 subjects and was carried out by Parke-Davis (now part of Pfizer), was notable for how poorly it was conducted. The investigators were inexperienced and untrained, and the design of the study was so flawed it generated few if any useful conclusions. Even more alarming, 11 patients in the study died and 73 more experienced “serious adverse events.” Yet there have been few headlines, no demands for sanctions or apologies, no national bioethics commissions pledging to investigate. Why not? One reason is that the study was not quite what it seemed. It looked like a clinical trial, but as litigation documents have shown, it was actually a marketing device known as a “seeding trial.” The purpose of seeding trials is not to advance research but to make doctors familiar with a new drug. In a typical seeding trial, a pharmaceutical company will identify several hundred doctors and invite them to take part in a research study. Often the doctors are paid for each subject they recruit. As the trial proceeds, the doctors gradually get to know the drug, making them more likely to prescribe it later. In an age of for-profit clinical research, this is the new face of scandal. Pharmaceutical companies promote their drugs with pseudo-studies that have little if any scientific merit, and patients naïvely sign up, unaware of the ways in which they are being used. Nobody really knows how often companies conduct such trials, but they appear with alarming regularity in pharmaceutical marketing documents. In the marketing plan for the antidepressant Lexapro for the 2004 fiscal year, Forest Laboratories described 102 Phase IV trials — the classification under which seeding trials fall — in a section labeled “Marketing Tactics.” Oversight bodies like the Food and Drug Administration generally don’t view seeding trials as research scandals: seeding trials are not illegal, and the drugs in question have already received F.D.A. approval. But even after particularly egregious seeding trials have been exposed, the F.D.A. has not issued sanctions. Take the notorious Advantage study, a seeding trial of the pain reliever Vioxx conducted by Merck. According to a 2008 report in the Annals of Internal Medicine, litigation documents show that the Advantage study was conceived and managed by Merck’s marketing department. Three subjects died in the Advantage trial; five more subjects experienced heart attacks. Oversight bodies should treat the Advantage study as a violation of research ethics. How can studies that endanger human subjects attract so little scrutiny? Forty years ago, when most clinical research took place in academic settings, the main dangers to research subjects came in service to genuine scientific aims. A large regulatory apparatus was developed to protect human subjects from the ambitions of overweening academic researchers. In the early 1990s, however, pharmaceutical companies realized that it was faster and less expensive to conduct trials in the private sector, where the driving force is not knowledge, but profit. And the regulatory apparatus designed for the old era has proved woefully inadequate for the new one. The main source of protection for research subjects is a patchwork system of ethics committees known as institutional review boards, or I.R.B.’s. These are small, federally empowered bodies that review research proposals before they are carried out, to ensure that the studies are ethically sound. But they don’t typically pass judgment on whether a study is being carried out merely to market a drug. Nor do most I.R.B.’s have the requisite expertise to do so. Even worse, many I.R.B.’s are now themselves for-profit businesses, paid directly by the sponsors of the studies they evaluate. If one I.R.B. gets a reputation for being too strict, a pharmaceutical company can simply go elsewhere for its review. Last week, the federal government announced that it was overhauling its rules governing the protection of human subjects. But the new rules would not stop seeding trials. It is time to admit that I.R.B.’s are simply incapable of overseeing a global, multibillion-dollar corporate enterprise. They should be replaced with an oversight system that is financially and administratively independent of the research it oversees. The system must have the power to impose sanctions, and its responsibilities must extend to fraud, bribery and corruption.

The company announced on Thursday that it was “exploring strategic alternatives” for its animal health and nutrition businesses, including a potential sale or spin-off. Animal Health, which has developed and manufactured medical tools for livestock and other animals, generated revenue of $3.6 billion last year. Nutrition, which focuses on infant formula and other pediatric products, generated $1.9 billion. That is roughly 8 percent of the company’s total annual revenue. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release In a statement, Ian Read, Pfizer’s president and chief executive, described the two units as strong, but said that they were “distinct enough from our core businesses that their value may be best maximized outside the company.” A sale or spin-off of either unit would be the second time this year that Pfizer has unloaded a major holding. In April, the company sold one of its units, a capsule maker for drugs, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company for $2.375 billion. That move was said to be the a result of an internal review at Pfizer that led to a strategic emphasis on its core pharmaceutical businesses. Pfizer has engaged JPMorgan Chase to explore the sale of the animal health business, and Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners to handle the nutrition business. “Pfizer expects to complete any transactions that may result from these evaluations in 12 to up to 24 months,” the company said.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/business/05smoke.html?ref=pfizerinc">Chantix, Smoking Cessation Drug, Linked to Cardiovascular Problems<date>Published: July 4, 2011</date><text>Chantix, the best-selling prescription drug for smoking cessation, was linked to an increased risk of a heart attack, stroke or other serious cardiovascular event for smokers without a history of heart disease compared with smokers who did not use the drug, according to a Canadian medical journal report released on  Monday.The finding added to previous warnings about the pill’s connection to psychiatric problems and cardiovascular risks for people with a history of heart disease. It posed a new challenge to a product that has been prescribed to 13 million people and had $755 million in sales last year. Officials of Pfizer, the manufacturer of Chantix, and the Food and Drug Administration responded that they had been planning to conduct a joint analysis of clinical trials on whether Chantix posed heart risks, due next year. “This would have raised a red flag for us if the flag hadn’t already been flying,” Dr. Celia Winchell, a team leader with the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in an interview. Pfizer, in a statement, said the analysis in the Canadian Medical Association Journal was based on too few heart or cardiovascular events to draw conclusions about the risks. The company said Chantix brought “immediate and substantial” health benefits to smokers who quit. The senior author of the new report, Dr. Curt D. Furberg, a Wake Forest medical professor, said there were better ways to quit and called for removal of the drug from the market. “It piles up,” he said. “I don’t see how the F.D.A. can leave Chantix on the market.” The lead author, Dr. Sonal Singh, assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said the agency and Pfizer had failed to pursue signs of cardiovascular risk since Chantix was approved in 2006. “The F.D.A. should have already put it on their warning label,” Dr. Singh said. “The risk is substantial, the risk is present in smokers without heart disease, and Pfizer knew about this for five years.” Last month, the agency issued a safety notice about cardiovascular risk from Chantix use by people with a history of cardiovascular disease, based on a study of 700 people. The new report is broader, analyzing 14 randomized clinical trials involving 8,200 patients, excluding those with cardiovascular disease so that it gives a better picture of which heart problems the drug could cause in otherwise healthy people trying to quit smoking. The new study, known as a meta-analysis, compiled data from 14 random, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials that tracked cardiovascular outcomes. It found 52 out of 4,908 people taking Chantix had serious cardiovascular events, a rate of 1.06 percent, compared with 27 out of 3,308 people taking a placebo, a rate of 0.82 percent. While the absolute difference is only 0.24 percent, the weighted, relative difference is 72 percent. “We have known for many years that Chantix is one of the most harmful prescription drugs on the U.S. market, based on the number of serious adverse effects reported to the F.D.A.,” Dr. Furberg said in a statement. “It causes loss of consciousness, visual disturbances, suicides, violence, depression and worsening of diabetes. To this list we now can add serious cardiovascular events.” Dr. Furberg, who once directed clinical trials for the government and writes widely about drug safety, has been paid as an expert witness in cases against Pfizer. Dr. Singh and two other researchers said they had no conflicts of interest. When combining studies of smokers with and without pre-existing disease, the study found that doctors could expect to get one extra cardiac event associated with Chantix for every 28 smokers they treated with the drug. The researchers also estimated one additional person would quit for every 10 treated with Chantix. The benefit of Chantix was emphasized in a separate commentary in the journal by Dr. J. Taylor Hays of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He described the meta-analysis as “timely and important” but said it lacked overall size and standardization. Dr. Hays, who has been paid by Pfizer to study Chantix, said the benefits of quitting smoking outweighed the risks of the drug. Chantix is selling well overseas. In Japan, for instance, some pharmacies ran out for a while recently, even as the drug failed to meet expectations in the United States because of health warnings and bad publicity.Chantix, the best-selling prescription drug for smoking cessation, was linked to an increased risk of a heart attack, stroke or other serious cardiovascular event for smokers without a history of heart disease compared with smokers who did not use the drug, according to a Canadian medical journal report released on  Monday.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/health/24drugs.html?ref=pfizerinc">Eliquis, New Anticlotting Drug, Shows Promise, Makers Say<date>Published: June 23, 2011</date><text>A proposed new anticlotting drug for people with irregular heartbeats has been shown to prevent more strokes with less bleeding risk than the existing treatment, the drug makers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer said late Wednesday. The announcement sent their stocks soaring on Thursday. The news appeared to brighten the prospects for millions of people with a heart rhythm problem called atrial fibrillation, doctors and analysts said. Many have been taking a drug called warfarin or not treating their dangerous conditions at all for fear of excess bleeding. “This is great news for patients and doctors,” said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, a leading cardiologist who was not involved in the research. “It shows the new class of anticoagulants works better than the only thing we’ve had available for 50 years.” Dr. Cannon, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School whose hospital research group performs trials for other drug companies, said he was thinking of switching both his parents to the new drug from warfarin. The results, however, are tentative. The drug, known as apixaban, or the brand name Eliquis, has not yet been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval, nor have the full study results been released. The companies said they planned to release the study on Aug. 28 at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Paris and file for approval in the United States and Europe later in the year. Eliquis was approved in Europe last month to prevent clots in patients receiving hip or knee replacement surgery. C. Anthony Butler, a pharmaceuticals analyst for Barclays Capital, said Eliquis had vaulted to the front of a potential $8.5 billion market in treating atrial fibrillation. “I don’t know how doctors can say they’re not going to use this,” Mr. Butler said, noting that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, both based in new York, are “marketing powerhouses.” The pill has two major competitors emerging in the market to prevent strokes and clots. Pradaxa, from Boehringer Ingelheim, was approved by the F.D.A. last year, and Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, is under F.D.A. review. Eliquis, according to the companies’ statement, holds a significant safety advantage. “I feel very excited about it, but you know, we have to see all the data,” said Dr. Valentin Fuster, director of the heart center at Mount Sinai Medical Center and former president of the American Heart Association. Dr. Fuster is heading an expert group next week that is expected to call for studies comparing the latest anticlotting medicines head-to-head against each other. Catherine J. Arnold, pharmaceuticals analyst for Credit Suisse, wrote investors a note Thursday predicting that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer would sell more than $3 billion a year of the drug. Doctors have clamored for an anticlotting drug with less risk of bleeding, Ms. Arnold wrote. The companies released enough information to prove their research was truly a milestone, she said. The newer drugs are all expected to be much more expensive than warfarin, which costs pennies a day. Pradaxa costs about $6 a day. Bayer’s stock plummeted 6.3 percent on the news in European trading, a loss of nearly $3 billion in market value, its biggest decline in two years. Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 0.6 percent to $65.67. Boehringer Ingelheim is a private company. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb soared 5.7 percent to $29.33 on Thursday whiled Pfizer rose 1.8 percent, to $20.65. Bristol discovered the drug and Pfizer joined in a development deal in 2007. The companies’ study of Eliquis against warfarin included 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one other risk factor for stroke. It not only met the primary end-point of “noninferiority” in preventing strokes — a necessity for F.D.A. approval — but also showed it was actually superior in preventing strokes and avoiding major bleeding, the companies said. Warfarin has been the warhorse drug for anticlotting purposes for decades. But warfarin is inconvenient because it requires frequent monitoring to assure patients are not taking too much, which elevates bleeding risk, or too little, increasing the risk of a devastating stroke. Some foods and other drugs have a pronounced effect on warfarin levels, but not on the new drugs.A proposed new anticlotting drug for people with irregular heartbeats has been shown to prevent more strokes with less bleeding risk than the existing treatment, the drug makers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer said late Wednesday.

Cannon, a leading cardiologist who was not involved in the research. “It shows the new class of anticoagulants works better than the only thing we’ve had available for 50 years.” Dr. Cannon, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School whose hospital research group performs trials for other drug companies, said he was thinking of switching both his parents to the new drug from warfarin. The results, however, are tentative. The drug, known as apixaban, or the brand name Eliquis, has not yet been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval, nor have the full study results been released. The companies said they planned to release the study on Aug. 28 at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Paris and file for approval in the United States and Europe later in the year. Eliquis was approved in Europe last month to prevent clots in patients receiving hip or knee replacement surgery. C. Anthony Butler, a pharmaceuticals analyst for Barclays Capital, said Eliquis had vaulted to the front of a potential $8.5 billion market in treating atrial fibrillation. “I don’t know how doctors can say they’re not going to use this,” Mr. Butler said, noting that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, both based in new York, are “marketing powerhouses.” The pill has two major competitors emerging in the market to prevent strokes and clots. Pradaxa, from Boehringer Ingelheim, was approved by the F.D.A. last year, and Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, is under F.D.A. review. Eliquis, according to the companies’ statement, holds a significant safety advantage. “I feel very excited about it, but you know, we have to see all the data,” said Dr. Valentin Fuster, director of the heart center at Mount Sinai Medical Center and former president of the American Heart Association. Dr. Fuster is heading an expert group next week that is expected to call for studies comparing the latest anticlotting medicines head-to-head against each other. Catherine J. Arnold, pharmaceuticals analyst for Credit Suisse, wrote investors a note Thursday predicting that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer would sell more than $3 billion a year of the drug. Doctors have clamored for an anticlotting drug with less risk of bleeding, Ms. Arnold wrote. The companies released enough information to prove their research was truly a milestone, she said. The newer drugs are all expected to be much more expensive than warfarin, which costs pennies a day. Pradaxa costs about $6 a day. Bayer’s stock plummeted 6.3 percent on the news in European trading, a loss of nearly $3 billion in market value, its biggest decline in two years. Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 0.6 percent to $65.67. Boehringer Ingelheim is a private company. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb soared 5.7 percent to $29.33 on Thursday whiled Pfizer rose 1.8 percent, to $20.65. Bristol discovered the drug and Pfizer joined in a development deal in 2007. The companies’ study of Eliquis against warfarin included 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one other risk factor for stroke. It not only met the primary end-point of “noninferiority” in preventing strokes — a necessity for F.D.A. approval — but also showed it was actually superior in preventing strokes and avoiding major bleeding, the companies said. Warfarin has been the warhorse drug for anticlotting purposes for decades. But warfarin is inconvenient because it requires frequent monitoring to assure patients are not taking too much, which elevates bleeding risk, or too little, increasing the risk of a devastating stroke. Some foods and other drugs have a pronounced effect on warfarin levels, but not on the new drugs.</text></article>

Perdue and organic chicken producers do not use the drug. “The presence of that carcinogenic residue obviously raises concerns, and it’s completely avoidable,” said Michael R. Taylor, F.D.A.’s deputy commissioner for foods. “It needed to be acted on.” Pfizer, which makes 3-Nitro, also known as roxarsone, will suspend the drug’s sales in 30 days, giving producers time to find alternatives. The drug, first approved in 1944, kills intestinal parasites, promotes growth and makes meat look pinker. And since 3-Nitro contains organic arsenic, which is far less toxic than its inorganic counterpart, producers assumed that it would have no effect on people who ate the animals. But there has been growing evidence that organic arsenic can change into its more toxic cousin. So F.D.A. researchers developed a way to measure inorganic arsenic in meat. They got 100 chickens, fed roxarsone to about half of them and measured levels of inorganic arsenic in their livers. Chickens fed roxarsone had consistently higher levels of inorganic arsenic, a known carcinogen. Scott Brown, a veterinarian at Pfizer Animal Health, said that Pfizer’s own studies of 3-Nitro had all found it safe, but that the F.D.A.’s trial led the company to suspend sales of the drug while Pfizer did a “full scientific assessment” of the drug. That assessment will also include another smaller-selling arsenic-based feed medicine called Histostat, or nitarsone, that was not studied by the F.D.A. and whose sales have not been suspended. Consumer advocates cheered the move. “Inorganic arsenic is cancer-causing, and action on this drug is long overdue,” said Dr. Michael K. Hansen, a senior scientist with Consumers Union. Each year, the United States produces $45 billion worth of broiler chickens, the kind used for meat — about 37 billion pounds in 2010, according to the Agriculture Department. That equals about 80 pounds a year for each American, according to the National Chicken Council, which represents major companies like Perdue and Tyson. Georgia, Arkansas and Alabama are the biggest producers. Richard Lobb, a spokesman for the chicken council, said 3-Nitro was used widely “but certainly not universally” by the industry. Mr. Lobb said that questions about roxarsone’s safety had been raised in the past but “we’ve always been able to show that there’s really no reason to be concerned about human health.” Environmentalists have long been concerned that the waste from chickens treated with roxarsone, when used as fertilizer on crops, causes arsenic to leach into water supplies and estuaries. Even cattle are exposed, since chicken litter is sometimes included in feed. About 90 percent of roxarsone’s use is in chickens, although the product is also used to a more limited extent in turkeys and swine, said Dr. William Flynn of the F.D.A.’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. The F.D.A. once routinely conducted its own studies of animal and human drugs, but limited budgets led the agency to eliminate much of its scientific and laboratory capacity over the years. The roxarsone study is a triumph for agency scientists but one unlikely to be repeated very often. The agency asked for $183 million in additional funds for food safety efforts next year, but House Republicans have instead proposed cutting $87 million. “This is exactly the kind of thing we try to direct research efforts towards,” Dr. Flynn said. Roxarsone is still approved for use in chickens and swine in Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam and in poultry only in Chile, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Brazil, Australia, Pakistan and Jordan. Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, proposed legislation in 2009 banning roxarsone. “I’m relieved the decision was made to make our poultry safer and healthier and hope the F.D.A. will take the final step and ban roxarsone altogether,” Mr. Israel said. Pfizer has promised not to resume sales of the drug until it has resolved F.D.A. concerns about it.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/business/04pfizer.html?ref=pfizerinc">Sales Flat in First Quarter, but Pfizer’s Profit Rose 10 Percent<date>Published: May 3, 2011</date><text>Pfizer reported flat first-quarter sales on Tuesday as generic competition ate away at crucial drugs and pressure built for the company to sell or spin off parts of its operations.Net income rose 10 percent, to $2.22 billion, or 28 cents a share, compared with $2.03 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, income was $4.81 billion, or 60 cents a share. The company, which makes the cholesterol drug Lipitor and the impotence pill Viagra, said revenue was $16.5 billion, down from $16.58 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected earnings of 58 cents a share and revenue of $16.59 billion, excluding one-time items. Pfizer maintained its January forecast for 2011 adjusted earnings of $2.16 to $2.26 a share.  “Our performance during the first quarter firmly positions us for achieving our 2011 plan and meeting our financial targets,” the chief executive, Ian Read, told analysts in a conference call. Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug with nearly $11 billion in annual sales, loses patent protection in the United States on Nov. 30 and generic competition is expected to start decimating sales. Analysts pressed Mr. Rerad for any plans to sell or spin off parts of the business to increase shareholder value, particularly the unit that sells older drugs with generic rivals. But Mr. Read, who just took over in December, said he could not respond until he finished a detailed review of the business. “I think the market is anxious for us to lay out the results,” he said in an interview. He said plans would come piecemeal, during the last two quarters and maybe early next year. Pfizer did say last month that it would sell its Capsugel capsule-making business to a private equity firm for $2.38 billion. It has been ending research in some disease areas after years of spending billions and failing to produce new blockbusters. Shares of Pfizer fell 58 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $20.44.

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/health/14pills.html?ref=pfizerinc">Makers of Erectile Dysfunction Drugs Prepare New Varieties<date>Published: April 13, 2011</date><text>Facing generic competition for its “little blue pill,” Pfizer recently started selling a chewable form of Viagra in Mexico. It is called Viagra Jet, and Pfizer says it may also market it to other nations in the developing world, if not the United States.Levitra, another erectile dysfunction drug, is now sold as a dissolvable tablet in nine European countries and may come to American pharmacies as soon as this month under the name Staxyn. That new form of the drug, which fizzes and dissolves in seconds, is marketed in a pocket-size, midnight-black box for men who prefer to take it discreetly, without water. The third drug for erectile dysfunction to reach the market, Cialis, now eight years old, is racing ahead of the others because of two ideas that have proven extremely popular: an everyday pill and a 36-hour “weekender.” Cialis is projected to become the top-selling of the three drugs in the world this year, passing Viagra. The market for drugs to correct erectile dysfunction has passed $5 billion a year from sales to tens of millions of men. And it is increasingly being driven by novel applications to compete with the lower-priced generics on the horizon. “ ‘Gimmick’ is a strong word, but all of this is designed to create new brand identities,” Dr. Joseph P. Alukal, an assistant professor and director of reproductive health at the New York University School of Medicine, said. “A newer product, less expensive, and a new form of taking it — all that might convince more people to try it.” Research is also under way in Brazil on a faster-acting form of the drugs, which increase blood flow by relaxing smooth muscle cells. While the existing pills enter the bloodstream indirectly by way of the stomach, intestines and liver, this form would enter more directly, dissolving in a capillary-rich space under the tongue and increasing the blood flow within 10 or 15 minutes. The research in Brazil involves generic Viagra, but Pfizer says it is not sponsoring the work. The Mexican experiment with Viagra Jet will show whether the chewable form of the drug has promise in other countries, particularly developing markets, Susan O’Connor, Pfizer’s vice president of global commercial development, said in an interview. Studies showed most Mexican men who used Viagra ground it up to make it easier to swallow or in the belief it would start acting faster. In explaining why the drug is being test-marketed in Mexico, Ms. O’Connor cited “patient preference, found in market research.” Mexico is the biggest market for Viagra in the developing world, with about $55 million in sales last year. At this point, Pfizer does not have plans to bring Viagra Jet to the United States, she said. In America, Pfizer is battling to keep low-price generic competition off the shelves a year from now, when the drug’s patent expires. The generic pills would cost only a fraction of the $10 or more that each pill now costs. Bayer, meanwhile, has introduced the dissolvable form of its Levitra drug in Austria, France, Hungary, Germany, Spain, Poland, Sweden, Denmark and Britain, where it went on sale in late March. The drug is called Levitra ODT, for orodispersible tablets. It comes in a thin black package the size of a half-dozen stacked credit cards, with four pills on a card that slides out. “It’s pocket-friendly, discreet and gives the product a playful edge over its competitors,” Thomas Proske, global brand manager for Levitra at Bayer Healthcare, said in a statement. The same pill was approved in the United States last June under the brand name Staxyn. It will be available in pharmacies this month, according to Jess Macnaught, marketing executive with Burgopak Design and Packaging, the London company that designed the new black package. GlaxoSmithKline and Merck have licensed American rights from Bayer, but they declined to reveal when the drug would be introduced. Last year, they said Staxyn would reach the market in late 2010. Worldwide sales of erectile dysfunction drugs grew 6.9 percent in 2010, to about $5 billion, and 4.7 percent in 2009, according to the industry data firm IMS Health. Dr. Alukal of New York University said he thought Staxyn could be sold for a much lower price than what Levitra and other pills now cost, in part to compete with a generic Viagra. No price has been revealed. “I guess it could be easier to ingest, so it could expand its market somewhat, but in the end the bigger issue would be cost,” Dr. Alukal said. He said the companies, for whom he does not consult, had talked about lower pricing, perhaps to under $10 a pill. But for now, Pfizer, the company that started it all, is focusing its attention on protecting the pricing power and brand integrity of Viagra. Patrick Ford, a former F.B.I. agent who leads the company’s security operations in the Americas, says Viagra is the most counterfeited product in the world. His agents pose as buyers, collect evidence and bring fraud cases to prosecutors, and he says fake Viagra may be unsafe. Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies are working with Victoria Angelica Espinel, the government’s intellectual property enforcement coordinator, a position President Obama appointed her to in 2009. Pfizer is also using its legal firepower against would-be generic competitors. Pfizer has two patents for Viagra, one for its chemical, expiring in 2012, and the other for its use against impotence, expiring in 2019. Pfizer sued Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the biggest generic-drug company, in March 2010 under the “use” patent. The suit is pending in a Virginia federal court. MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company was confident it would keep the 2019 patent protection, but industry analysts disagree. “ ‘Use’ patents are not highly probable of being upheld in court,” said C. Anthony Butler, a Barclays Capital pharmaceuticals analyst. “Most if not all analysts assume the expiry of the drug upon expiry of the composition of matter patent.” The chemical patent expires on March 27, 2012. Pfizer may be able to extend it another six months, to September 2012, under a federal law called the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. The law is meant to encourage drug companies to study children’s uses, often a difficult and unprofitable area. In this case, what would be studied is not Viagra for children, but Revatio, a formulation of the same chemical, sildenafil, which is approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare and dangerous condition affecting hundreds of children in the United States. Mr. Jimeson said the company was working closely with the Food and Drug Administration to discuss the pediatric studies of Revatio and the potential for an extension on the chemical patent, which would also protect Viagra and its prices. Many men, though, have waited years for a lower-priced Viagra and their wish may come true next year. Other researchers are testing new uses for Viagra that Pfizer says it is not financing. Boston University is studying it with testosterone gel in men 40 to 70. Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro, in Brazil, where the patent expired last year, has filed a notice of intent to test it in a tablet that dissolves under the tongue and has an effect in 10 minutes or so. Pfizer owns 40 percent of the lab but says that it did not initiate the study. Eli Lilly, meanwhile, says it has no plans to try chewable or dissolvable or any other forms of its Cialis tablets, and why should it? Cialis sales have steadily increased since it was introduced in 2003, to $1.7 billion last year, close to Viagra’s $1.9 billion. The health care investment house Leerink Swann estimates that Cialis sales will edge past Viagra in 2011 and far surpass the iconic blue pill in 2012. Shawn Heffern, Lilly’s United States marketing director for Cialis, says, “I couldn’t be more happy.”Facing generic competition for its “little blue pill,” Pfizer recently started selling a chewable form of Viagra in Mexico. It is called Viagra Jet, and Pfizer says it may also market it to other nations in the developing world, if not the United States.</text></article>

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/business/07drug.html?ref=pfizerinc">Drug Firms Face Billions in Losses as Patents End<date>Published: March 6, 2011</date><text>At the end of November, Pfizer stands to lose a $10-billion-a-year revenue stream when the patent on its blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor expires and cheaper generics begin to cut into the company’s huge sales.The loss poses a daunting challenge for Pfizer, one shared by nearly every major pharmaceutical company. This year alone, because of patent expirations, the drug industry will lose control over more than 10 megamedicines whose combined annual sales have neared $50 billion. This is a sobering reversal for an industry that just a few years ago was the world’s most profitable business sector but is now under pressure to reinvent itself and shed its dependence on blockbuster drugs. And it casts a spotlight on the problems drug companies now face: a drought of big drug breakthroughs and research discoveries; pressure from insurers and the government to hold down prices; regulatory vigilance and government investigations; and thousands of layoffs in research and development. Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the entire group of multinational pharmaceutical companies based in Europe — AstraZeneca, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche — in a report titled “An Avalanche of Risk? Downgrading to Cautious.” The analysts wrote, “The operating environment for pharma is worsening rapidly.” The same concerns apply to drug giants in the United States. They are all struggling with research failures as they scramble to replace their cash cows, like Pfizer’s multimillion-dollar gamble on a replacement for the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which failed miserably in clinical trials. Drug companies cut 53,000 jobs last year and 61,000 in 2009, far more than most other sectors, according to the outplacement company Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. “This is panic time, this is truly panic time for the industry,” said Kenneth I. Kaitin, director of the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. “I don’t think there’s a company out there that doesn’t realize they don’t have enough products in the pipeline or the portfolio, don’t have enough revenue to sustain their research and development.” While industrywide research and development spending has nearly doubled to $45 billion a year over the last decade, the Food and Drug Administration has approved fewer and fewer new drugs. Pfizer and Eli Lilly had major setbacks last year in once-promising Alzheimer’s drug experiments. Merck discontinued one of two major clinical trials testing its top acquisition from its merger with Schering Plough, a blood thinner that caused dangerous amounts of bleeding in some patients. Drug company executives have begun addressing the calls for reinvention. “We have to fix our innovative core,” Pfizer’s new president, Ian C. Read, said in an interview recently. To do that, the company is refocusing on smaller niches in cancer, inflammation, neuroscience and branded generics — and slashing as much as 30 percent of its own research and development spending in the next two years as its scientists work on only the most potentially profitable prospects. Consumers should see a financial benefit as lower-cost generics replace the expensive elite drugs, but may suffer in the long term if companies reduce research and do not produce new drugs that meet the public’s needs. “You don’t lay off R&amp;D if it’s just a cycle,” says Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan business school who follows the pharmaceutical industry. “That kills progress.” The federal government is also concerned about the slowing pace of new drugs coming from the industry. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, recently proposed a billion-dollar drug development center at the agency. “We seem to have a systemic problem here,” Dr. Collins said, adding that government research efforts were intended to feed the private sector, not compete with it. Mr. Read of Pfizer says new products can replace some but not all of the patent losses. “The hurricane is making landfall,” said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, but he added that Pfizer is among several drug companies giving solace to shareholders by returning money through stock buybacks and dividends. Pfizer’s best asset, he said, is its $20 billion stockpile of cash. Yet since 2000, Pfizer’s and Merck’s share prices dropped about 60 percent, while the Dow rose 19 percent. Several of the drug titans have bought competitors with newer products to fill their own sales gaps, essentially paying cash for future revenue as their own research was flagging. In the last two years, Pfizer paid $68 billion for Wyeth, Merck paid $41 billion for Schering-Plough, Roche paid $46 billion for Genentech, and Sanofi-Aventis paid $20 billion for Genzyme. Henry G. Grabowski, a professor of economics and director of the Duke University program in pharmaceutical health economics, likened the recent pharmaceutical megamergers to those that occurred in the banking and telecommunications industries when they were hit by financial shocks in the 1990s. But he warned that this wave would not guarantee significant research developments in the long term. “It’s never been shown that these big horizontal mergers are good for R&amp;D productivity,” Dr. Grabowski said. “I’m in a show-me mode that they get you any real advances other than some short-term cost efficiencies that wear out.” 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: March 8, 2011 An article on Monday about the effect of patent expirations on profits at pharmaceutical companies misstated the status of clinical trials involving a blood thinner that was Merckâs top acquisition from its merger with Schering Plough.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/business/23bizcourt.html?ref=pfizerinc">Justices Rule Against Lawsuit Over Vaccine Side Effects<date>Published: February 22, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — People injured by vaccines that they say were improperly designed must rely solely on a compensation system created by a 1986 law and may not sue vaccine manufacturers, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday.The vote was 6 to 2. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself because of her work on the case as United States solicitor general. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, said Congress had meant to establish a societal bargain in the 1986 law. “The vaccine manufacturers fund from their sales an informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries,” he wrote. “In exchange they avoid costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.” In a vigorous dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the court majority of imposing “its own bare policy preference over the considered judgment of Congress” depriving “vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Congress intended them to have.” The issue in the case was whether the compensation system created by the 1986 law displaced, or pre-empted, ordinary injury suits brought under state law. The Roberts court has been hearing many pre-emption cases under other laws, and decisions on ones concerning immigration, arbitration and seat belts are expected this term. The case before the court, Bruesewitz v. Wyeth, No. 09-152, was brought by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz, who received a vaccine known as D.T.P. as an infant in 1992. The vaccine offers protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or whooping cough. She suffered seizures and has had developmental problems and seizure disorders since. Ms. Bruesewitz’s parents filed a petition under the compensation program created by the 1986 law. They lost, on the ground that they had not proved that the vaccine caused their daughter’s injuries. Then they sued in state court in Pennsylvania. The case was moved to the federal courts, which have ruled that their claims are pre-empted by the 1986 law. The case turned on the proper interpretation of a provision of the law that bars ordinary lawsuits “if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.” Justice Scalia acknowledged that “Congress could have more tersely and more clearly pre-empted design-defect claims.” But he said the meaning of the passage was not in doubt. “If a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design,” Justice Scalia wrote, “the word ‘unavoidable’ would do no work.” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined the majority opinion. Justice Breyer also wrote a separate concurrence. “The textual question considered alone is a close one,” he said. But other factors — the drafting history and purpose of the law, the views of a federal agency and “expert medical opinion” — supported the majority’s conclusion, Justice Breyer wrote. Allowing a jury to make decisions about vaccine design, he said, would “substitute less expert for more expert judgment.” Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the majority opinion “disturbs the careful balance Congress struck between compensating vaccine-injured children and stabilizing the childhood vaccine market.” Justice Sotomayor said she understood the word “unavoidable” differently in the context of the law than Justice Scalia did. She said it indicated that Congress must “have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate in each civil action that the particular side effects of a vaccine’s design were ‘unavoidable.’ ” The effect of Tuesday’s decision, Justice Sotomayor continued, was to leave “a regulatory vacuum in which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements when designing or distributing their products.” In a final footnote, Justice Sotomayor wrote that a concern about an asserted link “between certain vaccines and autism spectrum disorders” appeared to “underlie the majority and concurring opinions in this case.” Wyeth, the defendant in the case, had told the justices that some 5,000 pending petitions concerned autism-related injuries and that it feared a “crushing wave” of litigation. Justice Sotomayor said she discounted those “doomsday predictions.” In any event, she said, “Congress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who have suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines.”WASHINGTON — People injured by vaccines that they say were improperly designed must rely solely on a compensation system created by a 1986 law and may not sue vaccine manufacturers, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/health/02pfizer.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer’s New Chief Plans to Cut Research Spending<date>Published: February 1, 2011</date><text>Pfizer, the drug maker, announced plans Tuesday to slash its research spending by as much as $2.9 billion in the next two years, including closing the English labs that invented Viagra. The company stock soared 5.5 percent on Tuesday, to $19.22, helping lead the Dow Jones industrial average 1.25 percent higher, to 12,040.16. Analysts praised Pfizer’s cutbacks and a $5 billion stock buyback plan announced by Ian C. Read, the New York-based company’s new chief executive. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Read promised that Pfizer would stop “investing on hope,” and would focus its research on the most profitable ventures. The company said it would close its largest European research center, in Sandwich, Britain, by 2013, and abandon efforts there in allergy and respiratory drugs. The site had developed Viagra among others, and has 2,400 employees. “Extremely disappointing,” Vince Cable, the British government’s business secretary, said in a statement. Pfizer will also trim its research facility in Groton, Conn., by 1,100 people, to 3,400, while adding jobs in the university research hubs in Boston and Cambridge, England. Mr. Read, who replaced Jeffrey B. Kindler as chief executive in December, said the company was reviewing its core research strengths and planned to outsource more research. “Make bets where you can win and stop spending where you think you can’t,” he said. The company plans to reduce total research spending by 25 to 30 percent over the next two years, from $9.4 billion in 2010, to $8 billion to $8.5 billion this year, and to $6.5 billion to $7 billion in 2012. Pfizer faces declining sales of the cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world’s best-selling drug, as it loses United States patent protection in November.

Pfizer stock has lost about a quarter of its value over the last five years while the broader pharmaceutical index has dropped about 5 percent.Pfizer, the drug maker, announced plans Tuesday to slash its research spending by as much as $2.9 billion in the next two years, including closing the English labs that invented Viagra. The company stock soared 5.5 percent on Tuesday, to $19.22, helping lead the Dow Jones industrial average 1.25 percent higher, to 12,040.16. Analysts praised Pfizer’s cutbacks and a $5 billion stock buyback plan announced by Ian C. Read, the New York-based company’s new chief executive. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Read promised that Pfizer would stop “investing on hope,” and would focus its research on the most profitable ventures. The company said it would close its largest European research center, in Sandwich, Britain, by 2013, and abandon efforts there in allergy and respiratory drugs. The site had developed Viagra among others, and has 2,400 employees. “Extremely disappointing,” Vince Cable, the British government’s business secretary, said in a statement. Pfizer will also trim its research facility in Groton, Conn., by 1,100 people, to 3,400, while adding jobs in the university research hubs in Boston and Cambridge, England. Mr. Read, who replaced Jeffrey B. Kindler as chief executive in December, said the company was reviewing its core research strengths and planned to outsource more research. “Make bets where you can win and stop spending where you think you can’t,” he said. The company plans to reduce total research spending by 25 to 30 percent over the next two years, from $9.4 billion in 2010, to $8 billion to $8.5 billion this year, and to $6.5 billion to $7 billion in 2012.

PharmaSwiss, based in Switzerland, has operations in 19 Central and East European countries, as well as Greece and Israel. It reported revenue of about 180 million euros in 2010, and growth of about 20 percent annually for the last five years. The deal is expected to close this quarter or next, pending regulatory approval, and to be immediately accretive to Valeant shares. “This acquisition of PharmaSwiss solidifies our position as a leading pharmaceutical company in Central and Eastern Europe,” said J. Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive. “Valeant Europe’s strong presence in Poland, the region’s largest market, fills an important gap, and should contribute to transaction synergies,” said Pavel Mirovsky, the chief executive of PharmaSwiss, who will stay on with the combined company. Valeant specializes in neurology, dermatology and branded generics, it said. PharmaSwiss also represents multinational drug makers like Amgen, Lilly and Pfizer.</text></article>

Saris of United States District Court in Boston upheld a jury’s finding that the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals deserved the award over their claims that Pfizer illegally promoted Neurontin for unapproved uses. In her ruling on Thursday, Judge Saris tripled the jury’s award of $47.3 million under a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970. Kaiser officials claimed they were duped into believing that migraines and bipolar disorder could be treated effectively with Neurontin, approved in 1993 by the Food and Drug Administration for epilepsy. Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company intended to appeal. Kaiser, based in Oakland, Calif., claimed it was forced to pay $90 million more than it should have for the drug. Pfizer currently faces more than 300 suits accusing it of illegally promoting Neurontin or hiding its health risks. Lawyers for former users of Neurontin contend the drug maker knew the medicine posed a suicide risk and failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. The Warner-Lambert Company developed and marketed Neurontin for several years before Pfizer acquired the drug maker in 2000. Four years later, Warner-Lambert pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $430 million to resolve off-label marketing allegations by the Justice Department.Pfizer, the drug maker, has been ordered to pay a total of $142.1 million in damages for violating federal racketeering laws in the marketing of its epilepsy drug Neurontin.</text></article>

Pfizer, based in New York, is trying to keep up with its pharmaceutical rivals that are increasingly relying on biotechnology for products and profits. “This fits in the big picture of us wanting to be on the leading edge of biotherapeutics and antibody discovery, and this is one company we are very excited to work with,” Jose-Carlos Gutiérrez-Ramos, Pfizer’s senior vice president and head of biotherapeutics research, said in an interview Tuesday. Theraclone, a small company in Seattle, is receiving a jolt of new research financing. Theraclone is led by Steven Gillis, a scientist and venture capitalist who previously co-founded the biotechnology companies Immunex and Corixa. Amgen bought Immunex for about $16 billion in 2002; GlaxoSmithKline bought Corixa for about $300 million in 2005. “The fact that Pfizer selected our antibody discovery technology is, I think, a great endorsement of our science and the speed with which we can make discoveries,” Dr. Gillis said in an interview. Dr. Gillis, who is also managing director of Arch Venture Partners, took over as interim chief executive of Theraclone last year after its president and chief executive, David Fanning, died unexpectedly. Neither company would specify the amount of initial financing for the deal. The upfront money will take the form of technology access fees on two unspecified targets in oncology and two unspecified goals in infectious disease, he said. Dr. Gillis said 30 to 40 percent of the deal, or $189 million to $252 million, was “near term money” for milestones before the Phase II clinical trials. Theraclone could also earn royalties on any developed products. Pfizer is responsible for preclinical and clinical development. The announcement follows a similar, smaller deal earlier this month when Pfizer agreed to pay Seattle Genetics about $8 million upfront and up to $200 million over time for work on its antibody technology against cancer. In a much larger deal in September, a Pfizer rival, Johnson &amp; Johnson, announced that it intended to buy the antibody maker Crucell for $2.3 billion. Johnson &amp; Johnson already owned 18 percent of the Dutch company. The final terms are still pending amid some concern about a Crucell manufacturing problem. Theraclone has received other investments in its antibody work previously. That included financing from the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, partly financed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, for an experimental antibody to AIDS, and money from the Tokyo-based drug maker Zenyaku Kogyo for an antibody to influenza. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that can target and bind to other molecules. They form the body’s defense system against a bacteria, virus or toxin.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/business/global/04smoke.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer’s Chantix Runs Short in Japan After Cigarette Tax Rise<date>Published: January 3, 2011</date><text>TOKYO — When the Japanese government raised the tax on cigarettes on Oct. 1, it could have started a public health revolution in this land of heavy smokers.The tax increase should also have been a bonanza for Pfizer, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical company, which makes the leading drug to help smokers break the habit. Instead, it became a missed opportunity. Despite ample notice of the change, Pfizer failed to produce enough of the drug, Chantix, which is sold as Champix in Japan. When tens of thousands of would-be quitters rushed to their doctors for prescriptions, Pfizer was overwhelmed. Less than two weeks after the tax increase went into effect, the company was forced to suspend sales of the drug to new patients until it could ramp up production. Now, with the drug still difficult to get, Japanese health professionals and many of the nation’s smokers are grumbling. And Pfizer has given up millions of dollars in potential Chantix sales, at least temporarily, at a time when overseas markets are growing in importance. In the United States, prescriptions for the drug plunged after the Food and Drug Administration warned doctors about psychiatric side effects. “After all that advertising, it turns out they don’t have enough,” said Hiroya Kumamaru, director of the KI Akihabara Clinic in Tokyo, who is turning away patients. His clinic has enough of the drug for only the 80 patients who began their treatment before the supply squeeze. “They should have predicted something like this,” he said. A Pfizer spokesman in Tokyo, Kinji Iwase, said the company misjudged interest in the drug among Japanese smokers. “An extraordinary number of people decided to quit, and our reading of the situation was off,” Mr. Iwase said. “We expected more demand, but not to this extent.” Japan has long been a smokers’ stronghold. Cheap cigarettes sold by a government-controlled tobacco company and lax antismoking laws — smokers have almost total freedom to light up at bars, restaurants and even schools and government offices — have long encouraged the habit. About 130,000 people a year die of tobacco-related illnesses in Japan, according to the World Health Organization. But a growing health consciousness, tighter regulations on tobacco advertising and increasingly strict smoking bans on public transport have contributed to a gradual decline in smoking. The smoking rate for men was 36.6 percent in 2010, 2.3 percentage points lower than a year earlier — though far above the 24 percent smoking rate among men in the United States. The tax increase, prompted by health concerns as well as a need to raise revenue for Japan’s government, was expected to spur an even more sharp and sustained flight from cigarettes. On Oct. 1, the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes jumped from 300 yen, or about $3.60, to over 400 yen, including 70 yen in taxes. Ahead of the increase, smokers rushed to stock up; tobacco sales surged 88 percent in September from a year earlier, but slumped 70 percent in October, according to the Tobacco Institute of Japan. Surveys suggest that many smokers here are looking to quit. In one November poll of 1,110 smokers by Rakuten Research, 13.9 percent of respondents said they had stopped smoking, while 15.5 percent said they planned to stop. While sales of nicotine patches and smoking alternatives have risen, Chantix seems to be the preference for smokers trying to stop. Introduced in the United States in 2006, Chantix, which works by blocking receptors in the brain and suppressing the positive feelings induced by cigarettes, was initially seen as a global blockbuster. But reports of possible side effects, including aggression and thoughts of suicide, prompted the F.D.A. in 2009 to require the drug to carry the agency’s strongest warning on its packaging. That set off a sharp drop in sales in the United States. Since then, Pfizer has tried to emphasize the benefits of quitting smoking over the risks posed by Chantix, and has stressed that further studies are needed to determine whether the problems are caused by the drug itself or are symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. To make up for lost revenue at home, Pfizer has also looked increasingly to foreign markets. In the first nine months of 2010, while revenue from Chantix in America fell another 16.8 percent to $252 million, sales in the rest of the world grew 22.17 percent to $270 million. Clearing Japan’s drug-approval process in 2008, Pfizer successfully wooed Japanese doctors to prescribe the drug. Japan’s national health insurance covered 70 percent of the 60,000-yen cost for a recommended 12-week prescription. To stoke public interest, Pfizer started a major ad campaign, starring the slick Hiroshi Tachi, Japan’s answer to the chain-smoking Don Draper of America’s “Mad Men.” Mr. Tachi declared that Chantix had helped him quit smoking, and posed in posters with a party horn between his fingers instead of his trademark cigarette. Soon, Japanese blogs raved about the new “almighty” drug that would help Japan kick its cigarette habit. (There has been little coverage here of Chantix’s potential side effects.) By August, Pfizer was selling the drug to about 70,000 patients a month in Japan. But that did not prepare the company for the jump in demand related to the tax increase. In September, prescriptions more than doubled to 170,000, and they rose even more in October. On Oct. 12, Pfizer announced that it was stopping shipments of its “starter packs,” and instructed clinics to stop accepting new patients. Reiko Ono, 33, who has smoked for over a decade, was one of the last to secure supplies of Champix at a Tokyo clinic. She has completed eight of the 12 weeks of recommended treatment, and has, until now, resisted the urge to light up. “It hasn’t been as difficult as I thought,” Ms. Ono said. But many of Ms. Ono’s colleagues who sought the drug were told to wait, she said. “I’m lucky I moved quickly,” she said. Particularly irritating to many smokers is that Pfizer had almost a year to prepare for a surge in demand; the tax increase was approved in December 2009. Pfizer is now reassuring would-be customers that they, too, will soon have access to Chantix. In January, the drug maker says, it will have at least 450,000 starter packs available. Health professionals say that further reductions in smoking-related deaths will hinge on whether the government levies further taxes on cigarettes, which remain cheaper than in the United States and Europe, and bucks the influence of Japan Tobacco, still half-owned by the Finance Ministry. The Democratic Party of Japan, which took power after the 2009 elections, has been more proactive in setting a nonsmoking agenda, and some lawmakers are pressing to do much more. “This is just the first step. An ideal scenario is to raise tobacco prices to as much as 1,000 yen,” a Democratic lawmaker, Yoko Komiyama, said. “Whatever it takes to get more people to quit.”TOKYO — When the Japanese government raised the tax on cigarettes on Oct. 1, it could have started a public health revolution in this land of heavy smokers.</text></article>

Lorch, 68, as chairman in a power-sharing arrangement with the new chief executive of the world’s largest drug company. The action followed the sudden departure of Jeffrey B. Kindler as chairman and chief executive a week ago. Mr. Lorch, an independent director of Pfizer since 2000, is chairman emeritus and former chairman and chief executive of Armstrong Holdings, a global manufacturer of flooring, ceiling materials and cabinets. His appointment as Pfizer’s board chairman was expected by some analysts over the last week. Ian C. Read, 57, a career-long Pfizer employee, was named chief executive on Dec. 5 immediately after Mr. Kindler, 55, resigned for reasons that are not yet clear. Mr. Kindler said he wanted to “recharge my batteries” and spend more time with family. In a statement Monday, Mr. Lorch said he looked forward to working closely with Mr. Read. Mr. Lorch has been chairman of the Pfizer board’s compensation committee. In a Dec. 6 note to investors, Catherine J. Arnold of Credit Suisse analyzed the possible choices for a chairman of the board. She mentioned three younger Pfizer board members whom she said could bring new ways of thinking and one older one, William C. Steere Jr., 73, who could be more traditional. Mr. Steere, a former Pfizer chief executive from 1991 to 2000, is the only one on Pfizer’s 14-member board who has pharmaceutical company management experience. Ms. Arnold did not mention Mr. Lorch. Pfizer also announced Monday it was raising its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 18 cents a share.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/business/11pfizer.html?ref=pfizerinc">WikiLeaks Cable Discusses Pfizer Case in Nigeria<date>Published: December 10, 2010</date><text>Pfizer was accused of hiring investigators “to uncover corruption links” to Nigeria’s former attorney general and apply pressure to drop lawsuits against the company over a controversial 1996 test of antibiotics on children with meningitis, according to a secret State Department cable that related a company official’s account.Pfizer, the world’s largest drug company, denied the cable’s allegation, which was contained in documents released by WikiLeaks. The cable indicated that the information alleging corruption on the part of the attorney general was spread through the media to publicly pressure him to drop the lawsuits. “Any notion that the company hired investigators in connection to the former attorney general is simply preposterous,” Christopher Loder, a spokesman at Pfizer’s New York headquarters, said on Friday. The former attorney general, Michael K. Aondoakaa, told The Associated Press that he knew nothing of any Pfizer attempt to investigate him. “If they were doing it behind my back, it’s very unfortunate,” he was quoted as saying. Last fall, Mr. Aondoakaa dismissed a $6 billion lawsuit and criminal charges as part of a settlement agreement with Pfizer, after allegations that the drug maker’s experiment with antibiotics resulted in the deaths of Nigerian children. Pfizer contested the cause of the children’s deaths, but ultimately settled with the country for an undisclosed amount in one case, according to a Pfizer filing in November. Mr. Loder said the money was to pay Nigeria’s lawyers in the case. Last year, the Nigerian state of Kano, where the experiments occurred, accepted a $75 million settlement to drop criminal charges and a civil suit seeking more than $2 billion. Mr. Aondoakaa was not involved in the Kano settlement. In the cable, dated April 20, 2009, United States officials described an April 9 meeting in Lagos with Enrico Liggeri, Pfizer’s company manager in Nigeria. “According to Liggeri,” the cable says, “Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal attorney general Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases. He said Pfizer’s investigators were passing this information to local media.” The cable continued: “A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa’s ‘alleged’ corruption ties were published in February and March. Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa’s cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles.” In seeking comment, Pfizer would say only that Mr. Liggeri was still employed as a manager in Nigeria, but it would not say whether the company had talked with him since the cable became public. Mr. Aondoakaa was not charged with any offenses. Another part of the cable covers discussions a week earlier with Mr. Liggeri and two Pfizer lawyers about the state settlement, which had been tentatively reached even as federal negotiations continued. That part of the cable appears to accurately reflect the details of the state settlement announced in July 2009. It included $35 million for the families, $30 million for state health care programs and $10 million in legal fees. Pfizer was sued in Nigeria after reports that it had tested an experimental antibiotic called Trovan on 100 children during a 1996 meningitis epidemic. Another 100 children were given an approved antibiotic, ceftriaxone. Families later charged they had not been properly informed and that the standard antibiotic dose was too low. Some children died and others suffered brain damage, paralysis, deafness or blindness during the trial, first disclosed by The Washington Post. Pfizer said its researchers acted ethically. The company said deaths and injuries were caused by the meningitis, an inflammation of membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Trovan was approved in Europe and the United States for adults in 1997 but banned in Europe and restricted in the United States in 1999 after reports of liver failure and deaths. In the leaked cable, the embassy describes Mr. Liggeri and two Pfizer lawyers briefing the ambassador and an economics deputy about the state settlement. In a meeting, “EconDep,” who was not otherwise identified, met with Mr. Liggeri. In addition to referring to Mr. Aondoakaa, the cable says Mr. Liggeri complained the lawsuits were “wholly political in nature.”. Mr. Liggeri, contacted by e-mail early Saturday morning in Nigeria, declined to comment on the cable and referred questions to a spokesman at Pfizer headquarters. The cable was first published Friday by the British newspaper The Guardian and the Spanish newspaper El Pais.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/business/10pfizer.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer to Pay Ex-Chief $4.5 Million Severance<date>Published: December 9, 2010</date><text>Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it had agreed to give Jeffrey B. Kindler a $4.5 million severance payment after his sudden retirement on Sunday as chairman and chief executive.In total, Mr. Kindler will receive $9.5 million in cash in addition to stock and retirement benefits, according to a filing late Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Besides the severance, which is equal to one year of salary plus a bonus for the year, Mr. Kindler will receive a $3.2 million cash bonus for 2010 and $1.8 million under an incentive plan, the filing said. Mr. Kindler has agreed to noncompete, nondisparagement and confidentiality rules as part of the agreement. Mr. Kindler, 55, resigned unexpectedly last weekend before a special board meeting, saying in a statement that he wanted to “recharge my batteries, spend some rare time with my family, and prepare for the next challenge in my career.” Erik Gordon, a pharmaceutical analyst and clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said the filing showed generous payments to Mr. Kindler in the year’s salary and bonus. “For a true resignation, you wouldn’t get paid this,” said Mr. Gordon, who says he believes Mr. Kindler was probably nudged out. “This is a generous negotiated deal. It’s not out of line with what C.E.O.’s of large companies get when they’re in this position. They famously get treated very, very well.” The board named Ian C. Read, 57, president of Pfizer’s biopharmaceutical operations, to succeed Mr. Kindler as chief executive and to a newly created position of president. The board said on Sunday that it also planned to name a chairman soon from among its directors. Pfizer has been beset by patent expirations, research setbacks and federal investigations over illegal marketing. Last year, Mr. Kindler received about $14.8 million in compensation, including a $3.5 million cash bonus, $2.6 million in options and $5.5 million in stock awards. He was also promised a 12 percent raise this year. Mr. Kindler declined further comment this week. Industry analysts have said his resignation was unplanned but may please some investors who had been unhappy with Pfizer’s share price. The filing also said that Mr. Kindler agreed to cooperate with Pfizer in its litigation, which is continuing. He will forfeit some of the long-term stock and performance awards “if, at any time within one year of settlement, he engages in an activity harmful to the company.”</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/business/07views.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer’s Falling Share Price Couldn’t Be Cured<date>Published: December 6, 2010</date><text>Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, has quit, saying he is tired — perhaps of impatient investors calling for him to step down. Mr. Kindler made one sensible big deal and some mistakes, but shareholders lost about 20 percent of their investment during his four-and-a-half-year tenure. Even so, it’s far too early to judge whether he jumped or was pushed. The problem is pharma’s glacial timescale. Drug companies pour billions into research and development, yet the fruits don’t become evident for years. Pfizer’s most pressing concern is replacing revenue that will be lost in 2011 when patent protection expires on Lipitor, the company’s treatment for high cholesterol, which brought in $11 billion in revenue in 2009. The drug was first synthesized in 1985 by a company swallowed by Pfizer in 2000. And the research that led to this class of drugs was performed by a Japanese company in the early 1970s. The slowness and uncertainty of any payoff from research and development is one reason drug group bosses like to buy other companies, as Mr. Kindler did with the $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth. Mergers and acquisition activity brings growth and cost savings within an executive’s typical tenure. While it’s too early to assess fully the Wyeth deal, at least Mr. Kindler did it in early 2009 with the financial crisis still fresh, so he didn’t overpay. On the R.&amp; D. front, Mr. Kindler talked when he was appointed of rejuvenating Pfizer’s drug pipeline and tried to accomplish it by splitting the division into smaller groups. There is little sign of success as yet, but the process can take a decade or more. Along the way, Mr. Kindler paid $225 million for the rights to an allergy pill promoted as an Alzheimer’s treatment based on trials performed in the unreliable Russia market. The drug bombed, one of several errors that tarnished his reputation. But in the end, it may be the failure to turn around Pfizer’s share price that weakened Mr. Kindler’s grip on the corner office at the age of 55. The 57-year-old Ian C. Read, who succeeds him, will now get a chance to create his legacy, by his own and his predecessors’ actions. Playing With Fire Investors might wonder what Hungary is up to. After falling out with the International Monetary Fund in July, the country’s government has now raided private pensions, and Moody’s has downgraded the country’s debt to just above junk. The risk of default is considerable, as is the danger of inflation and economic crisis. But the temptation to run from I.M.F. strictures is one that other countries on the periphery of the euro zone will understand — and could eventually be tempted to copy. Hungary’s economic challenges are not as daunting as those of the euro zone. The country does not have the double-digit fiscal deficit of Ireland or Greece. The Hungarian government expects a shortfall of about 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year and hopes to get that below 3 percent of G.D.P. in 2011. Hungary’s trade position, unlike those in Spain, Greece and Portugal, is almost in balance. Its floating currency, the forint, means competitiveness is not undermined by being locked into a single currency as euro zone members are. Yet Hungary is restive. Even though its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio remains high at 79 percent, the country is tired of cutbacks and weak growth. The government is now resorting to easy methods of shrinking the deficit, like raiding private pension funds, worth some 11.5 percent of G.D.P. As half the funds’ assets are in government debt, the state can cut its borrowing ratio. Tricks like these will make Hungarians and international investors anxious. That won’t help growth and might cause a crisis. Almost half its debt is in foreign currencies, so a tumbling forint would make debt ratios worse. That is why the central bank last week acted to bolster the currency by raising interest rates. Hungary’s bid for freedom from outside constraints is another warning sign for the euro zone. Greece and Ireland have taken bailouts that will make far greater demands than Hungary has had to endure. In the zone’s periphery, too, voters and governments may tire of creditors’ demands. The risks for the economy, and for creditors, are great. ROBERT CYRAN and IAN CAMPBELL</text></article>

Kindler announcing Pfizer’s $68 billion deal for Wyeth in January 2009. In the surprise announcement on Sunday that Pfizer’s chairman chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, would be resigning, the reason cited was that Mr. Kindler was tired. “The combination of meeting the requirements of our many stakeholders around the world and the 24/7 nature of my responsibilities, has made this period extremely demanding on me personally,” he said in a statement. That may be an understatement. Last year, Mr. Kindler led Pfizer’s $68 billion deal for Wyeth, the first mega-merger since the financial crisis of 2008. The deal helped kick-start not just a deal frenzy in the health care sector — one that has yet to abate — but also helped inspire a variety of other businesses to take a risk on M.&amp;A. again. (In its release on Sunday, Pfizer said that Mr. Kindler would be replaced by Ian C. Read, the global head of its biopharmaceutical business. Its board will choose a nonexecutive chairman at a board meeting scheduled for sometime within the next two weeks.) Pfizer’s deal for Wyeth was widely seen as an effort by the big drug-maker to bolster a product pipeline that was drying up, with its patent for the blockbuster cholesterol-fighter Lipitor set to expire in 2011. In total, the Pfizer faces the expiration of 14 patents through 2014, which could cost the drug maker some $35 billion, an analyst told The New York Times last year. Striking the Wyeth acquisition when it did allowed Pfizer to take advantage of a lower purchase price for its target because of the stock market’s weakness, the willingness of banks to lend for mergers again and the strength of its balance sheet. Constance J. Horner, Pfizer’s lead independent director, praised the big deal in a statement on Sunday, saying it brought the drug maker “valuable in-line and pipeline products and capabilities in attractive growth areas, including vaccines and biologics.” Mr. Kindler joined Pfizer in 2002 as general counsel, migrating over from McDonald’s, and became its chief executive in 2006. Since then, Pfizer has acquired about 20 companies, according to data from Capital IQ. Among the most recent of those deals is its $3.6 billion purchase of King Pharmaceuticals, a biopharmaceutical drug maker. The Wyeth acquisition helped inspire a wave of other big deals since its announcement in January 2009, including another big drug deal — the $41.1 billion merger of Merck and Schering-Plough — less than three months later.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/business/06drug.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer Chief Jeffrey Kindler Retires<date>Published: December 5, 2010</date><text>Jeffrey B. Kindler is retiring as chief executive and chairman of Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical firm, the company said on Sunday evening in an unexpected announcement.Ian C. Read, 57, Pfizer’s head of global biopharmaceutical operations, will take over as chief executive immediately. The board said in its statement that it would elect a new chairman at a meeting within two weeks. Mr. Kindler, 55, ushered the company through a $68 billion purchase of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals last year, a period that included layoffs. The company also settled federal investigations in 2009 by making a $2.3 billion payment related to its off-label marketing of drugs. That settlement included a $1.3 billion criminal fine for illegal marketing of the painkiller Bextra. It was the largest criminal fine and largest health care fraud case in United States history. Pfizer faces a difficult business environment after the patent on Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug, expires in November 2011. The cholesterol-fighting drug accounted for $11.4 billion of Pfizer’s $50 billion sales last year. The timing did surprise several people who follow the company. “The departure is sudden but I doubt there was one event per se that caused Kindler’s departure,” said Tim Anderson, a pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. He added that Pfizer stock might rise on the news because investors wanted to see some change at the company. Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank who follows major pharmaceutical companies, said Mr. Kindler did not appear to have been forced out. “What I’ve heard is it was a mutual decision, and I think that’s probably true,” Ms. Ryan said on Sunday evening. “I think he’s done a lot of great things at Pfizer, and at the same time he hasn’t necessarily gotten broad support from all of Pfizer’s shareholders, which include external directors.” But Erik Gordon, a pharmaceutical analyst and clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, suggested that the board made such as sudden move because they were unhappy with Mr. Kindler. “Pfizer needed an experienced pharma executive,” Mr. Gordon said Sunday. “It had better not be ‘business as usual’ because that’s not what boards who make unexpected C.E.O. changes are looking for.” In the statement on Sunday, Mr. Kindler said he wanted to “recharge my batteries, spend some rare time with my family and prepare for the next challenge in my career.” Mr. Kindler said the timing seemed to be right to step down now that the Pfizer and Wyeth operations have been combined for nearly a year. Mr. Kindler joined Pfizer in 2002 as chief counsel after working at General Electric and McDonald’s. He succeeded Henry A. McKinnell Jr. as Pfizer’s chief in 2006. Mr. Read, who was also named president of the company on Sunday, joined Pfizer in 1978 and has led worldwide pharmaceutical operations, which account for approximately 85 percent of Pfizer’s annual revenue. He was named corporate vice president in 2001. The company presidency is a newly created position. Raymond F. Kerins Jr., Pfizer’s vice president for communications, who worked closely with Mr. Kindler, said that he was not being forced from office. “The good news is we’ve got a guy with experience,” Mr. Kerins said. “Ian Read basically has been running 85 percent of the company anyway.” Last year, Mr. Kindler also took an active role lobbying Congress and the White House over the health care overhaul. In March, he was named chairman of the industry trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.</text></article>

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/business/04drug.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer Plans $75 Million Fund for Shareholder Suits<date>Published: December 3, 2010</date><text>Pfizer has agreed to set up a $75 million fund and to create a new compliance committee to settle shareholders’ lawsuits accusing the board and top officials of failing to stop illegal marketing of its drugs, according to a settlement agreement filed in United States District Court on Friday.The company denied any wrongdoing as part of the preliminary settlement, which is subject to judicial review. A Pfizer spokesman said the fund and committee would advance the regulatory and ethics work it had already started in recent years amid a series of government investigations. Mark Lebovitch, lead counsel for the institutional investors who brought the lawsuits, said it would be one of the largest derivative settlements ever and a good outcome for shareholders. The suits were filed after Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, settled federal marketing investigations in September 2009. The company paid $2.3 billion to settle claims that it had marketed numerous drugs for unapproved purposes. The total included the largest criminal fine in United States history, $1.3 billion, on a charge of illegal marketing of the painkiller Bextra, which was withdrawn from the market in 2005. Last year’s case was Pfizer’s fourth settlement since 2002 over illegal marketing. “The core question of the case was, Where was the board when this was going on?” Mr. Lebovitch said in an interview. Pfizer brought in a powerhouse team in defense, including Robert B. Fiske Jr., the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, who had once employed the judge in the case, Jed S. Rakoff, as a federal prosecutor. District Court Judge Rakoff will hold a preliminary hearing on the settlement on Monday and rule on it later. About $22 million in lawyers’ fees for the plaintiffs, as well as expenses of up to $1.9 million, will be paid out of the $75 million fund, the court filing says. The remainder would finance the new committee for five years. The Regulatory and Compliance Committee of the board would monitor legal, regulatory and marketing activities. Ray Kerins, a Pfizer spokesman, said, “Pfizer’s directors and officers acted with integrity throughout this entire process, and we maintain strongly that plaintiffs’ case has no merit.”</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/business/global/26tax.html?ref=pfizerinc">In Ireland, Low Corporate Taxes Go Untouched<date>Published: November 25, 2010</date><text>DUBLIN — Cut Ireland’s minimum wage? Check. Collect more in property taxes from beleaguered homeowners? Check. Raise the corporate tax rate, which could plug the gaping hole in Ireland’s tattered balance sheets even faster? Well, no.The austerity plan Ireland unveiled on Wednesday to secure a bailout from its international partners makes one thing clear: much of the 15 billion euros (or $20 billion) in savings the government has pledged to find over the next four years will come from the welfare state and the working class. But the measures will not touch large businesses like Microsoft, Intel and Pfizer, which have created thousands of jobs and fueled exports in Ireland for years, thanks to one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe. Germany, France and other European countries have long complained that Ireland’s tax structure has distorted competition. Some politicians have seized on the troubles by pushing for an increase in the 12.5 percent rate as part of a rescue package of about 85 billion euros (or $114 billion), the terms of which are still being negotiated. Some of that external pressure subsided this week as the political crisis in Ireland worsened. But if Ireland cannot meet its budget-cutting targets, or if its troubled banks require even more financing than expected, some countries might push the issue back into the spotlight. From Ireland’s perspective, any future effort by its European partners to revive the issue would damage the country’s prospects for recovery once the banking crisis eases. “The corporate tax is one of the pillars of Ireland’s economy, because it drives exports and jobs, and creates tax revenues for the government,” said Paul Duffy, a vice president at Pfizer in Ireland, one of the biggest multinational employers here. Raising the tax could scare away companies and “would damage a recovery and our ability to repay the massive debts we’ve taken on,” he said. Critics, however, say that in addition to siphoning business from countries with higher corporate tax rates, some multinationals operating under Ireland’s tax rules use complicated schemes to move profits in and out of subsidiaries there. In some cases, that allows them to lower their effective tax rate, they say. That has opened Ireland to criticism from countries like Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel must justify why taxpayers should help pay for another bailout package. The argument is that Ireland could be collecting more money from the companies it has lured. Tax rates have become a contentious issue in Europe, where governments are competing as never before to lure badly needed foreign investments as the economic crisis weighs on growth. Economic activity has declined sharply in the housing and banking industries. That leaves manufacturing and exports as two of the few channels to stimulate the necessary growth. Ireland’s exports grew 6 percent over the last year and manufacturing output increased by more than 10 percent. Philip R. Lane, a professor of international macroeconomics at Trinity College Dublin, said that if the tax rate were nudged a little higher it would help the country collect significant revenue. “But in the context of a devastated economy, where it’s the only thing driving the multinational sector, trying to tweak that rate is not something that any of the political parties want to do,” he said. Ireland’s has long pursued a strategy of luring business by helping major corporations from the United States and elsewhere reduce the tax they pay on profits. While the rate is well below that of Germany and France, it is higher than in Hungary and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe. Ireland’s edge, businesses and politicians say, is that it is a small, open economy with a well-educated, nimble and English-speaking work force and with a relatively stable social compact between unions and companies. That combination has attracted drug companies like Pfizer and Forest Laboratories, and technology firms like Google and, more recently, Facebook and LinkedIn. Multinational corporations employ more than a quarter of a million people in Ireland. Google, for instance, established its European beachhead in Ireland in 2003 and has been reinvesting and expanding operations. This summer, the company announced it would hire 200 people to run a new operations center on top of the 1,500 staff members already there.. About 70 percent of the nation’s exports, and 70 percent of business spending on research and development here, comes from foreign direct investment, according to the country’s Industrial Development Agency, or I.D.A. Ireland, the body responsible for luring foreign investment to Ireland. Foreign-owned firms that are members of I.D.A. Ireland pay workers about $7.1 billion each year and provide one in seven of the country’s jobs, either directly or indirectly. All told, multinationals paid about 5 billion euros in corporate tax to Ireland last year, more than 50 percent of all corporate tax receipts, according to the group’s figures. Pfizer, which has been in Ireland for decades, is among the many multinationals monitoring the tax debate. “When you’re a company like Pfizer, you make billions of dollars of investments for the long term because Ireland has provided certainty” about the tax rate, said Mr. Duffy, the vice president. “When you start to mess with that, you raise issues of trust” that could cause some companies to reconsider the wisdom of investing in Ireland, he said. Microsoft, Intel and Hewlett-Packard recently indicated that they would reconsider whether Ireland was the best base for their main European operations if the corporate tax were to rise. Companies could find it more attractive to relocate outside of the European Union to countries whose low tax rates are not menaced by political haggling in the European Union. “The difficult calculus the Irish government has to make is if they raise the rate to siphon in more money, will that be a deterrent to future generations of foreign investors,” said Iain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics. Mr. Begg said other countries had quickly recognized that pressing the issue further with Ireland now would be counterproductive. Some officials are instead mulling the idea of a levy on Ireland’s banks, which would theoretically raise money once they returned to profitability. Tax policy is a matter of state autonomy, Mr. Begg added, and any future effort to persuade Ireland to revisit the matter would probably raise hackles in Britain and in Central and Eastern Europe, which have insisted that sovereign matters like these cannot be dictated by other countries. Irish voters have mixed feelings about the government’s decision to keep the corporate tax rate steady, even as many fret that income and property tax increases will affect their personal finances, said Paul Sweeney, economic advisor at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. “People feel that on the one hand, corporations, including Irish banks, caused the crisis, and therefore the whole corporate sector should pay,” said Mr. Sweeney. “On the other hand, because people are so nervous about the future, they know that the corporate tax is one of the factors that attracts foreign direct investment, and therefore it would be a delicate time to touch it.”</text></article>

Global sales of Lipitor, world’s top-selling medicine, dropped 11 percent to $2.53 billion in the quarter. The arrival in recent months of generics in Canada and Spain hurt Lipitor. A bigger threat to Pfizer will come next November, when Lipitor loses marketing exclusivity in the United States. Pfizer bought Wyeth last year for $67 billion, aiming to replace vanishing Lipitor revenue with the rival’s brands. But Effexor XR, a Wyeth antidepressant that once had annual sales of $3 billion, was battered by cheaper American generic versions released over the summer. Effexor XR sales plunged to $175 million in the third quarter. Pfizer’s earnings fell to $866 million, or 11 cents a share, from $2.88 billion, or 43 cents, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs and other special items, Pfizer, which is based in New York, earned 54 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 51 cents, Thomson Reuters said. Global revenue rose 39 percent to $16.17 billion, swelled by the addition of Wyeth products.</text></article>

These people asked for anonymity because the talks are private and they are not authorized to discuss them. Pfizer announced last week that it was considering selling Capsugel, which makes a variety of capsules for drugs, and had hired Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser. The sales process is still early on, these people said, adding that the buyout firms may not reach a deal. Representatives for Pfizer, Blackstone and Bain declined to comment. For several of the private equity firms, Capsugel represents the latest attractive investment in the health care sector, these people said. Blackstone already owns another drug capsule maker, Catalent Pharma Solutions, while Bain has struck a number of deals for medical companies over the past year. Pfizer has been busy with deal-making in recent days, announcing earlier this week that it has agreed to buy King Pharmaceuticals for $3.6 billion. The giant drug maker has been seeking to rejigger its business mix as it faces the looming expiration of patent rights to several drugs, notably the cholesterol fighter Lipitor next year. Capsugel reported $740 million in revenue for last year, a 4 percent drop from 2008 that Pfizer attributed to a slump in consumer spending on health products and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

The deal is Pfizer's biggest since its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year, which set off a cascade of big pharmaceutical companies' bolstering their product pipelines with acquisitions. King's stock soared 39.3 percent on Tuesday to $14.14, nearly matching Pfizer's offer price. Big drug companies have sought to strike mergers to strengthen their product lineups as patents expire, in what analysts have called a ''patent cliff.'' Late next year, Pfizer is set to lose the patent on one of its most lucrative drugs, the cholesterol fighter Lipitor. About $42.2 billion worth of pharmaceutical deals have been struck so far this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That number is close to the $45.8 billion in pharmaceutical mergers announced by the same time last year, excluding Pfizer's blockbuster Wyeth deal and Merck's $41 billion purchase of Schering-Plough. In King, Pfizer is gaining a variety of businesses that complement its own offerings. Among the most attractive are pain medications like Embeda, a strong drug that is engineered to be more resistant to patient abuse, and Flector, a medicinal patch. It is also working on other drugs like Remoxy, an oxycodone drug that is meant to be more abuse-resistant than OxyContin. Pfizer already makes pain drugs like Lyrica and Celebrex. ''We'll continue to stay focused in the areas we do business in,'' Frank D'Amelio, Pfizer's chief financial officer, said on an analyst conference call on Tuesday. ''We really want to stay focused in the areas that we've talked about before and really stay I'll call it in our core space, which is what we believe we do best.'' King also makes products like the EpiPen emergency drug injector and a variety of animal health drugs, further complementing its buyer's offerings. Pfizer said that the deal would yield at least $200 million in savings through 2013, a figure that UBS research analysts said on Tuesday was ''very conservative.'' The deal is expected to close by the first quarter next year. Analysts praised the deal. Barbara Ryan of Deutsche Bank described it in a research note as a ''disciplined, but not 'sexy' acquisition.'' Of King's products, Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Tuesday: ''These assets may potentially perform better under Pfizer's umbrella, in our view, given Pfizer's strong marketing machine.'' Pfizer executives said on a conference call Tuesday that the company will continue to pursue bolt-on deals that supplement its existing businesses. The company still has plenty of buying firepower: it reported $19.3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of July 4. King is no stranger to deal-making: it pursued a months-long hostile bid for Alpharma in 2008, eventually raising its offer to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion to seal the merger. It was through Alpharma that King gained Embeda. Pfizer was advised by JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. King was advised by Credit Suisse and the law firm Covington &amp; Burling.

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/health/12vaccine.html?ref=pfizerinc">Supreme Court to Consider Vaccine Case<date>Published: October 11, 2010</date><text>The safety of vaccines is at the heart of a case expected to be heard on Tuesday by the United States Supreme Court, one that could have implications for hundreds of lawsuits that contend there is a link between vaccines and autism.At issue is whether a no-fault system established by Congress about 25 years ago to compensate children and others injured by commonly used vaccines should protect manufacturers from virtually all product liability lawsuits. The law was an effort to strike a balance between the need to provide care for those injured by vaccines, some of them severely, and the need to protect manufacturers from undue litigation. Under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, such claims typically proceed through an alternative legal system known as “vaccine court.” Under that system, a person is compensated if their injury is among those officially recognized as caused by a vaccine. That person, or their parents, can choose to reject that award and sue the vaccine’s manufacturer, but they then face severe legal hurdles created by law to deter such actions. The case before the Supreme Court is not related to autism. But the biggest effect of the court’s ruling, lawyers said, will be on hundreds of pending lawsuits that contend a link exists between childhood vaccines and autism. Repeated scientific studies have found no such connection. Also, in several test case rulings over the last two years, administrative judges in vaccine court have held that autism-related cases did not qualify for compensation. During the last decade, about 5,800 of the 7,900 claims filed in vaccine court, or about 75 percent, have been autism-related, federal data show. Federal data shows that $154 million was paid in fiscal 2010 to 154 claimants involved in vaccine court proceedings. That figure was significantly higher than in preceding years and reflected several unusually high awards, officials involved in the program said. In the five preceding fiscal years, an average of $68 million in compensation was paid out on an annual basis, federal data indicates. A compensation fund is financed by an excise tax on vaccinations. The case to be heard on Tuesday involves an 18-year-old woman, Hannah Bruesewitz, who suffered seizures when she was 6 months old and subsequently suffered developmental problems, her parents say, after receiving a type of D.T.P. vaccine that is no longer sold. The D.T.P. vaccine protects against three potentially deadly childhood diseases: diphtheria; pertussis, which is also known as whooping cough; and tetanus. Ms. Bruesewitz’s parents have contended in court papers that the vaccine’s manufacturer, which is now a part of Pfizer, knew at the time that their daughter was immunized that there was a safer version of the D.T.P. vaccine but did not produce it. The company rejected that contention Initially, Ms. Bruesewitz’s parents brought a claim on her behalf to the vaccine court, but the severe injuries that she reportedly suffered were removed from the list of those that qualified for compensation a month before the case was heard. An administrative judge in vaccine court subsequently rejected her claim, so her parents filed a product liability lawsuit against Wyeth, a Pfizer unit that had acquired the vaccine’s manufacturer, Lederle Laboratories. Lower court judges have ruled that her claims are barred by the federal Vaccine Act. As a result, Ms. Bruesewitz, who lives with her family in Pittsburgh and requires specialized care, has not received any compensation, her father, Russell Bruesewitz, said in a telephone interview. “The cost of her care is an ongoing burden,” Mr. Bruesewitz said. The Supreme Court review revolves around the narrow question of whether Congress in passing the Vaccine Act intended to bar lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers based on so-called design defect claims. A vaccine design defect claim essentially asserts that the manufacturer should have sold a different vaccine, which plaintiffs say would have been safer than the one used. Those filing briefs arguing that Congress intended to permit such lawsuits include the American Association for Justice, a plaintiffs’ lawyers group, and the National Vaccine Information Center, an advocacy group. Those filing briefs arguing that Congress intended to bar them include the solicitor general of the United States, the Chamber of Commerce and several professional medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. James M. Beck, a lawyer in Philadelphia who defends makers of drugs and medical devices, said in a phone interview that a ruling in favor of the Bruesewitzes would allow hundreds of lawsuits asserting a link between vaccines and autism to go forward. “If these cases go forward, it will make it economically unfeasible for anyone to make vaccines in this country,” said Mr. Beck. Mr. Bruesewitz said that he and his wife were not opposed to vaccination. Instead, he said they pressed his daughter’s claim because he thought that vaccine producers needed to face the threat of litigation to produce safer medications. “What we want and are concerned about is to make sure that the safety of vaccines in this country is constantly enhanced,” Mr. Bruesewitz said.</text></article>

Lechleiter walks a mile to work every morning to think about the day ahead. He walks home in the evening, he says, “to try to forget about it.”These are challenging times for Eli Lilly, the company he leads. It is losing patent protection in the next seven years on drugs that accounted for 74 percent of its sales in 2009, a decline considered to be the worst patent cliff facing major companies in the industry. And it also had been hit by recent legal, regulatory and research disappointments, including the surprise announcement in August that a promising experimental drug treatment for Alzheimer’s was being dropped because it hurt patients’ cognitive functions more than it helped. As a result of the compound issues confronting the company, analysts and others have been pressuring Lilly to undergo major transformations similar to those of its rivals Pfizer and Merck, which made giant purchases of other companies in efforts to diversify and spur growth. For Lilly and Dr. Lechleiter, the company’s fortunes are not all that is at stake. Its economic health is closely interwoven with its hometown roots here, where it also works with about 3,000 Indiana businesses. Dr. Lechleiter, a chemist who joined Lilly 31 years ago and was named chief executive in 2008, remains confident of the company’s strategy. He asserts that it can retool with in-house research and cost-cutting, rather than resorting to mergers or big acquisitions. In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Dr. Lechleiter held to the company’s promise that revenue would not dip below $20 billion even in the expected low-tide year of 2014. He said efforts to trim $1 billion in costs and 5,500 employees by the end of 2011 were on track. And he pointed to the potential for new drugs and pending decisions by the Food and Drug Administration that might expand the markets for existing Lilly drugs. “We’ll see our way through the storm,” he said. “At a time when others say Lilly has to do a deal or Lilly has to go outside itself to solve its problems, we’re resolutely focused on what we have to do inside the company to make the innovative medicines that are at the core of value creation for Lilly and patients. That’s what we do.” Long a powerhouse for psychiatric drugs like Prozac, Zyprexa and Cymbalta, Lilly is looking to new drug opportunities in treating cancer and Alzheimer’s, two diseases that Mr. Lechleiter said will become more pressing as Americans live longer. Some analysts do not share his optimism, and point to a lack of promising products in the company’s short-term outlook. For example, Lilly has introduced only one product in the last five years, the blood thinner Effient, to sluggish early sales. It has virtually no new products to market until 2013, when it hopes to start rolling out two a year. The patent losses are daunting: Its schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, whose $4.92 billion in sales last year represented 23 percent of the company’s total, goes off patent a year from now. Cymbalta, with $3.07 billion in sales, loses patent protection in 2013. In addition, Lilly lost legal challenges this year to Gemzar, a cancer drug that sold $1.36 billion, and Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that sold $609 million. J. P. Morgan last week predicted Lilly would face “a prolonged period of depressed earnings” with sales dipping to $18.6 billion in 2015 from a peak of $23 billion in 2010. C . Anthony Butler of Barclays Capital called for Lilly to make some drastic changes, predicting that its revenue could drop to $18.8 billion in 2015. “I’m not sure what would drive the going-back-up part,” he said in an interview. He also cited the company’s longtime relationship to Indianapolis as an impediment to taking measures like slashing costs to preserve its margins and dividends. “I worry that they can’t do that because they’re too ingrained in the fabric of the community,” Mr. Butler said. Indeed, since its founding here in 1876, Lilly has become the city’s largest private employer. Mayor Greg Ballard’s father worked there for 33 years; the former mayor, Bart Peterson, works there now; and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels spent eight years on the Lilly campus. Indianapolis, a city of about 800,000, is undergoing a tax-supported, $3.3 billion downtown building boom as it gears up to host the 2012 Super Bowl. On Monday, the city, company and a developer announced plans to develop one corner of a sprawling Lilly parking lot into a $150 million hotel, apartment, retail and restaurant complex. “A recruiting magnet,” Dr. Lechleiter said as he walked through the lot, pulling a small wheeled suitcase filled with paperwork, on the way to work. He walks, he said, for exercise and time to reflect. Dr. Lechleiter said he has accepted a ride only once, in a snowstorm, in the four years since he and his wife moved closer to work, living in a penthouse in a downtown luxury hotel. As he passed through the lobby and hallways, he greeted a dozen employees by their first names before settling in his small corner office.</text></article>

Guttman, lawyer for two former Wyeth employees, predicted that the government action could result in recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars in inappropriate billings to public health programs. Nineteen states, including New York, and the District of Columbia also joined the filing. “It’s always good to have the government on your side,” Mr. Guttman said. Ray Kerins, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company had previously disclosed that it was cooperating with a government review of Wyeth’s promotional practices involving Rapamune. Pfizer also disclosed in February that there was a criminal investigation into the marketing. In a statement, the company said the whistle-blower suit was filed in 2005, four years before Pfizer bought Wyeth for $68 billion. Pfizer could be in violation of a corporate integrity agreement it signed a year ago in a separate case if it was involved in further illegal sales. In that case, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion, including a $1.3 billion criminal fine, the largest in United States history, to settle investigations into illegal marketing of the painkillers Bextra and Lyrica, the schizophrenia drug Geodon and the antibiotic Zyvox. Patrick Burns, a spokesman for Taxpayers Against Fraud, a Washington nonprofit group that works with many whistle-blowers under the federal False Claims Act, said the government nearly always wins when it joins such a legal action. “It’s going to be a big case,” Mr. Burns said. “The wild card is, it’s Pfizer. The government’s not happy with Pfizer. These are repeat offenders.” Charles S. Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment, saying the brief government filing spoke for itself. Such cases are typically shrouded in confidentiality. The filing continued a crackdown on drug industry fraud. Over the last three years, the government has also settled false claims suits against Bristol-Myers Squibb for $515 million, AstraZeneca for $520 million, Eli Lilly for $1.4 billion, and last week, a unit of Forest Laboratories for $313 million. Rapamune had sales of $376 million in 2008. The law allows the government to collect up to three times any amount it was defrauded and pay whistle-blowers 15 to 25 percent of the total. Mr. Guttman said most of those sales were for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. While doctors can use an approved drug for anything they see fit, companies are prohibited from marketing drugs for uses not approved by the F.D.A. In the whistle-blower suit, filed in United States District Court in Philadelphia, the former employees, Marlene Sandler and Scott Paris, said they were encouraged to promote the drug for heart, lung, liver and pancreas transplants, even though the F.D.A. had only approved it, in 1999, for kidney transplants. The suit also contends that Wyeth singled out two hospitals with largely black clients for off-label promotions. They were the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in New York and the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. Black patients have higher risk of transplant rejection. The Pfizer statement on Tuesday said that Wyeth was allowed to market Rapamune for that population. The Justice Department during the Bush administration declined to join in the Rapamune case. Mr. Guttman praised the Obama administration for aggressive action. Mr. Burns said the civil division of the Justice Department, which handles the cases, has been nonpolitical and commonly joins an action, after first declining, once new information emerges. He also said the health care reform overhaul strengthened the False Claims Act and increased money for enforcement.</text></article>

The vaccine, called rindopepimut, is ''no longer a strategic priority of Pfizer,'' which will return the rights to the therapy to Celldex on Nov. 1, Celldex said. The treatment is in the second of three stages of testing generally required to win regulatory approval. Pfizer licensed rights to the product in 2008 from Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus royalties. If approved, the brain cancer vaccine could have $450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in 2013, Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital, said in May. Celldex's chief executive, Anthony Marucci, said the company would need to raise more money to pay for late-stage testing but would not need another partner. Shares of Celldex, based in Needham Mass., fell $1.25, or 26 percent, to $3.53.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/business/04pfizer.html?ref=pfizerinc">Wyeth Acquisition Helps Pfizer Top Forecasts<date>Published: August 3, 2010</date><text>The drug maker Pfizer reported a 9 percent increase in second-quarter profit on Tuesday, easily topping Wall Street expectations. The company said its revenue was sharply higher because of its acquisition of a rival drug maker, Wyeth, in October.The company, which makes the cholesterol blockbuster Lipitor and the impotence pill Viagra said net income for the three months ended July 4 rose to $2.48 billion, or 31 cents a share. A year ago, income was $2.26 billion, or 34 cents a share. Pfizer has since sold millions of new shares to help pay for Wyeth. Pfizer reported revenue of $17.33 billion, up from $10.98 billion last year, an increase of nearly 58 percent, mainly because of $5.4 billion from Wyeth products. Sales in the United States jumped 63 percent and foreign sales, 54 percent. Excluding 31 cents in one-time items, income was $4.96 billion, or 62 cents a share. Those items included $1.1 billion before taxes for integrating Wyeth’s systems, employee severance and other restructuring, plus $2.1 billion before taxes for various charges related to buying Wyeth. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 52 cents a share on revenue of $16.65 billion. Pfizer faces generic competition for Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug with about $11 billion in 2009 sales, and eight other big-selling, high-margin drugs by 2015. Some of its highly promoted drugs failed in testing recently. It bought Wyeth for $68 billion to bolster revenue, cut costs and diversify, nabbing Wyeth’s vaccine and biologic drugs, consumer health products such as Centrum vitamins and its animal health business. Already, Pfizer has cut 17,900 jobs of the 19,500 planned, and it has reached half of its planned savings of $4 billion to $5 billion by 2012. Pfizer reaffirmed its 2010 profit forecast, for revenue of about $68 billion and earnings of $2.10 to $2.20 a share, excluding one-time items. Analysts expect $2.16 a share on revenue of about $67.3 billion, on average. Pfizer also maintained its 2012 targets, with revenue at about $66.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.35, excluding items. Wall Street expects only $61.66 billion share, partly because Lipitor loses United States patent protection in November 2011. An analyst at Leerink Swann, Seamus Fernandez, cited favorable currency exchange rates, lower costs and an improved gross profit margin as the reasons Pfizer beat estimates by so much. The patent losses will cut revenue in 2015, compared to 2010, an analyst at Bernstein Research Timothy Anderson wrote to investors, but “large amounts of cost-cutting and share repurchases should help keep E.P.S. flattish through the same period.” Pfizer halved its 32-cent dividend last year to help pay for Wyeth, angering investors who count on the dividend given that Pfizer stock has languished at $20 a share or less for two years. Pfizer raised the dividend to 18 cents in January, and the chief financial officer, Frank D’Amelio, said its board would raise it again in December. Altogether, prescription drugs brought in $15.02 billion, up 49 percent. Sales totaled $893 million for animal health products and $678 million for consumer health products. “Thank goodness for the Wyeth acquisition,” said an analyst, Stephen G. Brozak, of WBB Securities. “It gave them a year’s worth of breathing room” when investors can’t easily compare sales figures to year-ago quarters.</text></article>

It was the second time the rankings, which were created in 2008, have been issued. This time, 95 percent of the brand-name companies approached by the Dutch foundation that started the index agreed to provide information; two years ago, only about half did. European companies slightly edged out American companies in the rankings, while the four Japanese companies ranked were at or near the bottom. The companies are graded on many factors, including whether they offer lower prices or donate drugs in poor countries, whether they license generic versions of their products or fight to prevent them, whether they donate expertise or money to struggling health systems and whether they do research on neglected diseases. Gilead Sciences and Pfizer rose several ranks from 2008. Those falling in rank were Novo Nordisk, Bayer, Bristol-Meyers Squibb and Merck KGaA (a German company no longer connected to the Merck based in New Jersey). The index, which is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Dutch and British governments, Oxfam and other donors, also issued detailed “report cards” on 20 companies. For the first time, generic drug makers were ranked separately. Three Indian companies, Ranbaxy Laboratories, Cipla and Dr. Reddy’s, took the top three spots.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/22bizcourt.html?ref=pfizerinc">Justices Back Monsanto on Biotech Seed Planting<date>Published: June 21, 2010</date><text>In its first-ever ruling on genetically modified crops, the Supreme Court on Monday overturned a lower court’s ban on the planting of alfalfa seeds engineered to resist Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide.The decision was a victory for Monsanto and others in the agricultural biotechnology industry, with potential implications for other cases, like one involving genetically engineered sugar beets. But in practice the decision is not likely to measurably speed up the resumption of planting of the genetically engineered alfalfa. A federal district judge in San Francisco had ruled in 2007 that the Agriculture Department had approved the genetically engineered alfalfa for commercial planting without adequately considering the possible environment impact, as required by federal law. The judge vacated approval, known as deregulation of the crop, and also imposed a nationwide ban on planting those seeds. The ban was later upheld on appeal. But the Supreme Court, in a 7-to-1 decision, said the lower court judge had gone too far, ruling that the national ban prevented the Agriculture Department from considering a partial approval. That avenue, the court said, would have allowed some of the alfalfa to be grown under certain conditions; for example, isolating it from conventional alfalfa. “The district court barred the agency from pursuing any deregulation — no matter how limited the geographic area in which planting of RRA would be allowed,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote in the opinion, referring to Roundup Ready alfalfa. Justice John Paul Stevens was the lone dissenter. Justice Stephen G. Breyer did not take part because his brother, District Judge Charles Breyer, had issued the original decision. Because the Supreme Court left in place the lower court’s rejection of approving the crop, the Agriculture Department must either fully or partly approve it before growing can resume. “I think the practical impact is nil,” said George A. Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety, a Washington advocacy group that was part of a coalition of environmental groups and organic and conventional alfalfa farmers who had challenged the crop’s approval. The Agriculture Department said Monday that it was on track to complete its environmental impact statement and approve the crop in time for next spring’s planting. Speeding up planting beyond that could only occur if the agency pursues a partial approval while finishing its environmental assessment. But getting partial approval in time for this fall’s planting season — beginning in two months — might be difficult. Still, David F. Snively, Monsanto’s general counsel, called the decision a significant victory. “Monsanto and farmers in the United States are thrilled with this decision, which is far-reaching in its look at the regulatory framework that should govern biotech crops,” Mr. Snively told reporters in a conference call. The Supreme Court’s ruling could affect a similar case, also brought by the Center for Food Safety, involving Roundup Ready sugar beets. In that case, a different federal judge in San Francisco ruled last September that the Agriculture Department had failed to adequately assess the environmental impact. Planting has continued, however, because the judge, Jeffrey S. White, has not yet ruled on a remedy. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 9. The Supreme Court’s decision makes it highly unlikely that he will issue a blanket ban on the growing of the genetically engineered beets. The decision could also sway environmental law in general. Organizations like the National Association of Home Builders and the American Petroleum Institute had filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting Monsanto, while environmental groups as well as the states of California, Oregon and Massachusetts had weighed in on the side of the Center for Food Safety. Mr. Snively of Monsanto said the decision made it clear that courts must meet the same strict test in granting injunctions in environmental cases as in other cases. But Nathaniel S. W. Lawrence, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the decision also contained wording that would make it easier in some instances for lawsuits to be filed in cases of possible environmental dangers. Roundup Ready alfalfa and sugar beets were the newest additions to Monsanto’s extremely successful lines of Roundup Ready soybeans, corns and cotton. The crops contain a bacterial gene that allows them to withstand spraying with Roundup or its generic equivalents, known as glyphosate. That allows farmers to spray their fields to kill weeds while leaving the crop intact, making weed control easy. The environmental groups and others had said that the foreign gene might spread to organic or conventional nongenetically engineered crops, hurting sales of organic farmers or exports to countries like Japan that did not want genetically engineered varieties. Court Upholds Verdict The Supreme Court rejected Pfizer’s appeal of a verdict for an Arkansas woman, Donna Scroggin, who blamed the company’s menopause drugs for her breast cancer, leaving intact a $2.7 million award that may grow with punitive damages. The justices let stand on Monday a lower court decision upholding that award, which was the first federal verdict against Pfizer’s Wyeth unit over its Prempro hormone-replacement treatment. The appeal by Wyeth and Pfizer’s Upjohn unit sought to leverage a different part of the appeals court ruling ordering a new trial on punitive damages, which a jury had set at $27 million. Pfizer argued that the new trial should cover all aspects of the case, including the jury’s finding that the drugs had helped cause Ms. Scroggin’s cancer.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/health/research/06cancer.html?ref=pfizerinc">Scientists Cite Advances on Two Kinds of Cancer<date>Published: June 5, 2010</date><text>CHICAGO — Using two opposite strategies, one focused and one broad, scientists say they have made progress in taming two of the most intractable types of cancer. The focused approach shrank tumors significantly in a majority of patients with advanced lung cancer marked by a specific genetic abnormality. Even though the clinical trial was small (just 82 people, with no control group), the results were considered so striking for such sick patients that the study will be featured Sunday at the main session of the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology here. “This is a phenomenal example of finding the right patient and the right drug very early on,” said Dr. Pasi A. Janne of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who was involved in the trial. The broader strategy uses a drug that could potentially become a universal treatment for all types of cancer. It works by releasing a brake on the body’s immune system, letting the immune system attack the cancer more vigorously. In a study of patients who had advanced melanoma, those who got an experimental drug lived a median of about 10 months, compared with 6.4 months for those in a control group. After two years, about 23 percent of those who got the drug were alive, compared with 14 percent in the control group. Lung cancer and melanoma are among the hardest cancers to treat. So the studies are being viewed as significant advances, though far from cures. Dr. Steven J. O’Day of the Angeles Clinic and Research Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., a lead investigator in the melanoma trial, called the result “historic,” and added, “This is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial ever to show a survival benefit in Stage 4 melanoma.” Bristol-Myers Squibb, which sponsored the trial, is planning to apply for regulatory approval to sell the drug, ipilimumab. The lung cancer drug, by contrast, blocks an aberrant protein called ALK that is found in only about 5 percent of non-small-cell lung tumors. But in patients whose tumors have this aberration, the drug seems to work wonders. The tumors shrank significantly in 57 percent of the 82 patients, and they remained stable in 30 percent more. Beverly Sotir, 71, of Belmont, Mass., who has been taking the pills as part of the trial since July, said her tumors had shrunk without debilitating side effects. “For someone who’s been on chemo before, this is like a miracle drug,” she said. “You feel yourself. You look yourself.” Pfizer, which sponsored the study, has started a more definitive trial aimed at winning approval of the drug, crizotinib. There are caveats. The effects of crizotinib can wear off, though 72 percent of the patients in the trial were free of cancer progression for six months. As for the melanoma drug, because it removes checks on the immune system, 10 percent to 15 percent of patients who took it in the study suffered severe side effects because their immune systems attacked their own organs. Seven patients out of 540 who got ipilimumab died from these immune effects, according to a report of the study published online Saturday by The New England Journal of Medicine. Efforts to harness the immune system to fight cancer have suffered setback after setback. Because tumor cells are mutated forms of the body’s own cells, not an invading pathogen, they do not usually elicit a strong immune response. But the Food and Drug Administration this year approved a “cancer vaccine” for prostate cancer called Provenge, so-called because it trains the immune system to attack the patient’s tumors. Most such vaccines focus on a single type of cancer, or are even tailored to individual patients. Ipilimumab, by contrast, is a more general immune booster. It blocks a protein called CTLA-4 that acts as a brake on T cells, the soldiers of the immune system. It is already also being tested against lung and prostate cancer. Still, if a tumor does not elicit a strong immune response to begin with, then just keeping the response going longer would not help much, just as lifting one’s foot from the brake usually will not make a car go faster if the accelerator is not pressed. In at least one other melanoma trial, conventional chemotherapy drugs achieved median survival of about 10 months, the same as ipilimumab. Dr. Charles M. Balch, a melanoma expert at Johns Hopkins who was not involved in the trial, called the results “a single, not a home run,” though he added that for this disease even a single was important. About 68,000 Americans are expected to get melanoma this year, with 8,700 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. The numbers have been increasing, probably because of sun exposure decades ago. The trial involved 676 patients in the United States and 12 other countries with previously treated metastatic melanoma. They received either ipilimumab or an experimental cancer vaccine or both. Those who got ipilimumab alone did as well as those who got both, suggesting the vaccine had little effect.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/business/28hazard.html?ref=pfizerinc">Safety Rules Can’t Keep Up With Biotech Industry<date>Published: May 27, 2010</date><text>They are the highly trained, generally well-paid employees in the vanguard of American innovation: people who work in biotechnology labs. But the cutting edge can be a risky place to work.The casualties include an Agriculture Department scientist who spent a month in a coma after being infected by the E. coli bacteria her colleagues were experimenting with. Another scientist, working in a New Zealand lab while on leave from an American biotechnology company, lost both legs and an arm after being infected by meningococcal bacteria, the subject of her vaccine research. Last September, a University of Chicago scientist died after apparently being infected by the focus of his research: the bacterium that causes plague. Whether handling deadly pathogens for biowarfare research, harnessing viruses to do humankind’s bidding or genetically transforming cells to give them powers not found in nature, the estimated 232,000 employees in the nation’s most sophisticated biotechnology labs work amid imponderable hazards. And some critics say the modern biolab often has fewer federal safety regulations than a typical blue-collar factory. Even the head of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration acknowledges that his agency’s 20th-century rules have not yet caught up with the 21st-century biotech industry. “Worker safety cannot be sacrificed on the altar of innovation,” said David Michaels, OSHA’s new director. “We have inadequate standards for workers exposed to infectious materials.” The current OSHA rules governing laboratories, for example, were not written with genetic manipulation of viruses and bacteria in mind. “The OSHA laboratory standard deals with chemicals,” Mr. Michaels said. “It doesn’t deal with infectious agents.” Earlier this month, as a first step toward possible new regulations, the agency issued a sweeping request for information on occupational risks from infectious agents, and for suggestions on how best to reduce them. The focus is mainly on hospital and other health care workers, but any rules are expected to also cover industry laboratory workers. Some safety experts in the biotechnology industry argue that there is no big safety problem, and that workers are adequately protected by various voluntary guidelines on safe laboratory practices and by OSHA’s general rule that employers provide a safe workplace. “The OSHA requirement applies to all industries, including the pharmaceutical industry,” said John H. Keene, a biosafety consultant to industry and former president of the American Biological Safety Association, a professional society for those involved in biolab safety. But at least three trends are stoking concern among safety advocates. In the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks, the federal government stepped up research involving biowarfare threats, like anthrax, Ebola and many other of the world’s deadliest pathogens. Another factor is that the new techniques of so-called synthetic biology allow scientists to make wholesale genetic changes in organisms rather than just changing one or two genes, potentially creating new hazards. Just this month, the genome pioneer J. Craig Venter announced the creation of a bacterial cell containing totally synthetic DNA, which Dr. Venter described as the first species “whose parent is a computer.” The third trend involves the shifting focus of the pharmaceuticals industry — potentially the largest source of new biotechnology jobs. Drug makers, responding to competition from cheap generic medications, are moving beyond the traditional business of making pills in chemical factories to focus instead on vaccines and biologic drugs that are made in vats of living cells. There are currently few good statistics on biolab accidents. One study, reviewing incidents discussed in scientific journals from 1979 to 2004, counted 1,448 symptom-causing infections in biolabs, resulting in 36 deaths. About half the infections were in diagnostic laboratories, where patient blood or tissue samples are analyzed, and half in research laboratories. But that may be a “substantial underestimation,” the study’s authors wrote, because many incidents are never made public. The study was done by two biosafety experts and published in the book “Biological Safety: Principles and Practices.” A survey done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2006 found that the rate of workplace injury and illness in corporate scientific research laboratories was well below the average for all industries. The survey included labs in industries like information technology as well as biotechnology, and excluded labs handling the most dangerous pathogens. Allegations about a more recent case came to light only through a lawsuit. It was filed against the drug giant Pfizer by Becky McClain, a former molecular biologist at the company’s largest research center, which employs 3,500 people in Groton, Conn.</text></article>

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/business/19drug.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer Cutting 6,000 Jobs and Closing Eight Plants<date>Published: May 18, 2010</date><text>The drug maker, Pfizer, will cut 6,000 jobs, or 18 percent of its work force, at its 78 manufacturing plants over the next five years as it pares operations following last year’s purchase of its smaller rival, Wyeth.Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug maker, plans to close eight plants in Ireland, Puerto Rico and the United States by late 2015 and reduce activities at six factories in those countries, Germany and Britain. Pfizer had 40 manufacturing plants before buying more than three dozen Wyeth operations in the acquisition last October. The affected plants make conventional pills, injectable medicines, biotech drugs and consumer health care products. Pfizer will wind down their operations over the next 18 months to five years, depending on business considerations like the time required to transfer manufacturing. The company said in November it would close six research sites and trim jobs in the United States and Britain as part of its absorption of Wyeth. Pfizer then began a six-month study of how to reconfigure its manufacturing. “We have a complex network of manufacturing plants, with excess capacity that is not good for costs,” Nat Ricciardi, Pfizer’s president of manufacturing, said in an interview. Pfizer can be more competitive, both in its operations and drug pricing, by streamlining its plants and improving their processes, Mr. Ricciardi said. “It’s not disproportionately Wyeth,” Mr. Ricciardi said, adding that many legacy Pfizer plants and employees are on the target list. Half of the plants scheduled to close are legacy Pfizer sites, the company said. Pfizer said it is on track to reduce costs by $4 billion to $5 billion by 2012. Pfizer is counting on the savings to help offset an expected decline in Lipitor sales, the company’s $12 billion-a-year cholesterol drug, which will face generic competition late next year. The 14 plants scheduled to close or cut back operations are among Pfizer’s 40 main sites for making prescription drugs. By June, the company plans to make recommendations for plants that make animal-health products and later this year will evaluate plants that make nutritional products or drugs in emerging markets. Batt O’Keeffe, Ireland’s Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. said the job losses were “deeply regrettable.” “Pfizer remains a major multinational employer in Ireland, with more than 4,200 workers involved in the manufacture of high-end products for the life science industry worldwide.” Ireland wooed multinational companies with a low corporate tax rate but several groups, like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, have announced plans to relocate to cheaper sites. Shares of Pfizer fell 30 cents, to $15.81.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/nyregion/11pfizer.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer to Cut Jobs, Risking Repayment of Tax Breaks<date>Published: May 10, 2010</date><text>Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, plans to lay off or relocate up to 1,400 New York City employees, seven years after receiving millions of dollars in tax breaks to create jobs in the city.On Monday the company, which has already scrapped about 2,000 positions, also put its office tower at 685 Third Avenue up for sale. Pfizer officials said the company’s world headquarters would remain in the office tower at 235 East 42nd Street, near Grand Central Terminal. The company, which has been based in New York City since its founding in 1849, has about 4,400 employees here. But the company’s decision is a remarkable turnabout in Pfizer’s once robust expansion plans for New York and an embarrassment for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and state officials who had provided the drug-maker with the tax breaks in 2003. Government officials often give the breaks, or what critics call corporate welfare, to companies that forgo plans to leave the city, or that invest in new equipment and jobs. But some economists argue that those scarce resources could be better spent on transportation, education and other things that create a better environment for all employers. “This is another example that shows how useless these corporate retention deals are,” said Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, a private advocacy group. “Major companies don’t make location decisions based on tax breaks.” The Bloomberg administration has been far more stingy than Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s was in granting tax breaks to corporations threatening to leave New York. It has also worked to strengthen the penalties for companies that violate job-retention agreements. Under the terms of its deal with Pfizer, the city will seek to recover double the $12 million in tax breaks that the company ultimately used if Pfizer eliminates more than 450 jobs, said David Lombino, a spokesman for the city’s Economic Development Corporation. Pfizer bought another major pharmaceutical firm, Wyeth, last year in a $68 billion deal. Last week, Pfizer reported better than expected earnings in the first quarter of the year. “A reduction in Pfizer’s New York City work force resulting from their merger and restructuring would of course be disappointing,” Mr. Lombino said. “But we’re encouraged that they are choosing to maintain their global headquarters here and will continue to employ thousands of New Yorkers.” Mr. Lombino said the city had recaptured $48 million since 2002 from 85 companies that did not live up to the terms of their deals. The city also could have demanded that Metropolitan Life repay $24 million, or double the tax break it received in 2001 when it announced it was moving employees to Queens. After the company moved some workers back to Manhattan, officials settled for $5 million in 2008 and a promise from MetLife to keep 1,750 employees in New York City. Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, acknowledged that the company had talked to the city about repaying the tax benefits. She said she did not know the exact number of jobs that would be cut, or moved to other offices. A government official who had been briefed on the company’s plans, but who declined to be named because he was not authorized to reveal them, said that between 800 and 1,400 jobs would leave the city. “It’s all a part of consolidating our footprints in buildings we own,” Ms. Campion said. “We’re moving a number of our people to other Pfizer locations” in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Pfizer will move its remaining workers into adjoining buildings at 239 and 219 East 42nd Street. Pfizer was in the midst of buying Pharmacia for $60 billion in 2003 when Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg held a news conference with company officials. They announced that Pfizer would invest $1 billion in New York City over 15 years, buy and renovate the building at 685 Third Avenue, create 2,000 jobs and retain 5,500 workers in New York. In return, the city and the state provided the company with tax breaks and other incentives worth up to $47 million, although it used only $12 million. Pfizer’s New York City payroll reached a high of 6,500 in June 2005, according to city officials, but has declined ever since. In 2008, the company closed its longtime manufacturing plant in Brooklyn. That same year, the city ended the tax breaks because of low employment levels and forced the company to return $2.7 million in benefits.</text></article>

Pfizer and Merck -- the world's top two drug manufacturers by 2009 sales, according to IMS Health -- are counting on huge cost savings in the next few years from acquisitions of rivals Wyeth (by Pfizer) and Schering-Plough (by Merck). ''It looks like both companies are already getting leverage from merger-related cost savings, and it's going right to the bottom line,'' Damien Conover, a Morningstar analyst, said. ''This is a trend that we'll see continue going forward.'' Results of drug manufacturers in the quarter were hurt by the new health insurance overhaul legislation, which requires companies to provide larger price rebates to patients in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor. ''The results for Merck and Pfizer also complete that theme we've seen for other drug makers this quarter, that largely good results are offsetting the costs of health care reform,'' Mr. Conover said. Richard T. Clark, chairman and chief executive of Merck, told investors the health care overhaul should bolster his company's results over the long term. Merck earned $299 million, or 9 cents a share, in the first quarter. Results were hurt by special charges and a tax expense related to the health care law. That compared with $1.43 billion, or 67 cents a share a year ago. Excluding special items, Merck earned 83 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 75 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Merck's revenue more than doubled to $11.42 billion on the strength of the Schering deal. Analysts looked for $11.18 billion. Sales of the Januvia diabetes franchise jumped 32 percent to $712 million, including explosive growth outside the United States, well ahead of the estimate of $622.2 million by six analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., also said the quarterly results were helped by a $75 million to $100 million inventory buildup of its vaccines in the United States, and lower-than-expected research spending that should not continue in coming quarters. The company expects 2010 earnings of $3.27 to $3.41 a share, excluding special items. Analysts were expecting $3.41 a share. The forecast reflects flat earnings to a decline of 4.2 percent, largely because of plunging sales of its Cozaar blood pressure drug that began facing generic rivals last month. Pfizer earned $2.03 billion, or 25 cents a share in the quarter. That compared with $2.73 billion, or 40 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 60 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 53 cents a share. Pfizer posted revenue of about $16.75 billion. Analysts looked for $16.58 billion. Sales of its Lipitorcholesterol drug inched up 1 percent to $2.76 billion, above the estimate of $2.64 billion of eight analysts. Pfizer backed its 2010 profit forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 a share, excluding items, despite a revenue hit from the new health care law. The forecast reflects growth of 4 percent to 9 percent. The company, which is based in New York, affirmed its 2012 profit forecast of $2.25 to $2.35 a share, excluding items. The outlook tracks Wall Street's expectations for 2011, suggesting the Wyeth merger will prevent Pfizer earnings from plunging once Lipitor gets generic competition as soon as late 2011.

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13docpay.html?ref=pfizerinc">Data on Fees to Doctors Is Called Hard to Parse<date>Published: April 12, 2010</date><text>Pfizer recently became the latest big drug maker to start disclosing payments to doctors who act as consultants or speakers. But many followers of the pharmaceutical industry are still finding it far too difficult to follow the money.Industry bloggers and advocates for disclosure say the companies’ Web sites are not easy enough to use for patients or others who want to know which doctors are most financially entwined with drug makers. “More translucent than transparent,” is the way John Mack, editor of the Pharma Marketing blog sums up the databases. GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly and Merck are among drug makers that now operate such databases, as a response to critics who say the payments can overly influence how doctors practice medicine and prescribe drugs. In some cases, as with Lilly and Pfizer, the databases were also set up as part of settlements of federal criminal investigations into illegal marketing of drugs to doctors. But those companies say they planned to start making the disclosures anyway. The money disclosed in such databases can be substantial. Pfizer, for instance, listed $35 million in payments to 4,500 doctors and 250 research organizations from June through December 2009. But it can be hard to add up the money for one doctor from several sources, identify the biggest recipients or list them all for a hospital or a city, without laborious work by a computer expert. Starting in 2013, under the new federal health care law, these databases will become mandatory for all drug companies and medical device makers. And they will be subject to stricter disclosure requirements aimed at making them much more transparent. Those new rules, under a subset of the health care law called the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, are also expected to make it easier for the public to track a doctor’s payments. Meanwhile, though, there may be a business opportunity and public interest in Web sites like PharmaShine. The site is operated by a start-up company, Obsidian Healthcare Disclosure Services, founded by a former lawyer for Merck. Obsidian mines all the doctor disclosure data posted in disparate forms. That includes not only five drug makers’ databases, but payment disclosures from six medical device companies and two states that already require such listings, Vermont and Minnesota. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Astra-Zeneca have announced they will begin disclosing physician payments later this year; Obsidian plans to mine their data, too. PharmaShine has more than 21,000 physician listings, said George A. Dunston, who founded Obsidian in 2008 in Jersey City and started the Web site last August. The company has no paying customers yet, but it says it hopes to sell the information from one big, constantly updated database to hospitals and health systems, medical colleges — and even to drug companies eager to cross-check which physicians are taking money from whom. At a price of $799 a month, the service also includes e-mail alerts whenever select doctors are reported. Mr. Dunston said four major medical schools and a number of hospitals have expressed an interest. And for consumers, Mr. Dunston said, individual doctor look-up will be “free for the foreseeable future.” Allan Coukell, director of the Pew Prescription Project, said the government and university officials in charge of disclosure compliance could also use PharmaShine to check whether the proper reports were being made and to monitor their doctors’ outside business activities. “You could do it one by one, but that would be awfully time-consuming,” Mr. Coukell said. The Prescription Project, a consumer interest effort of the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts, was a tester of PharmaShine before its official introduction. Senate researchers have found that some prominent doctors at academic medical centers have failed to disclose millions of dollars in drug company payments, despite university requirements that they do so. Federal prosecutors say some payments are really kickbacks for illegal or excessive prescribing. Industry supporters, meanwhile, say they are trying to restore public trust, and they emphasize the importance of collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, academia and physicians to advance medicine. Some of the transparency issues are supposed be resolved when the Physician Payment Sunshine Act begins in 2013 to require fuller, more accessible disclosure of all drug industry payments of more than $10 to doctors. But until then, the disclosures come in a disparate variety of subjects, sites, thresholds and usefulness. Among the four leading drug companies making physician payment disclosures, Mr. Coukell said, Eli Lilly, which was the first to disclose, presents data as an Adobe Flash image, which he said was impossible to download or to sort. “They’ve gone out their way, I think, to present it as a Flash document,” Mr. Coukell said. Mr. Dunston said Obsidian had to retype all the Lilly data. Carole Puls, a Lilly spokeswoman, said the company purposely made its report impossible to download "to protect the integrity of the data." Lilly was concerned someone could change numbers and create a false report outside the company’s Web site, Ms. Puls said. Merck and GlaxoSmithKline display physician fees in Adobe PDF files, which must be laboriously copied if they are to be used in a sortable database. Jim Edwards, a contributor to the BNET blog who tracks the pharmaceutical industry, said all the industry disclosures were good — but limited. “Even though we know who’s receiving money and what they received, we don’t really know in many cases why they received it, or what they did,” he said. Pfizer, which released its first batch of data on doctor payments on March 31, said its Web site made it easy to look up individual physicians. Dr. Freda Lewis-Hall, Pfizer’s chief medical officer, said the company was “committed to ensuring these relationships are transparent to the public and are carefully managed.” But the company declined to identify its top recipient. Only after exporting the Pfizer data to another computer program and analyzing it could The New York Times determine that the largest Pfizer payments had gone to Dr. Gerald M. Sacks, a Santa Monica, Calif., anesthesiologist and pain expert. He was paid $146,500 by Pfizer from June through December 2009 for “expert-led forums.” Dr. Sacks did not return several messages seeking comment.</text></article>

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/03pfizer.html?ref=pfizerinc">A Pfizer Whistle-Blower Is Awarded $1.4 Million<date>Published: April 2, 2010</date><text>A federal jury has awarded $1.37 million in damages to a former Pfizer scientist who claimed she was sickened by a genetically engineered virus at a company laboratory and then fired for raising safety concerns.The case, which was decided Thursday, has raised questions about the safety of workers in the biotechnology industry and about regulations to protect them. The new head of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration said on Friday that the agency was moving to improve regulation of biological materials. The jury in the United States District Court in Hartford did not actually address whether the virus had caused the paralyzing illness from which the scientist, Becky McClain, still suffers. The judge had dismissed that claim before the trial, saying that Ms. McClain did not have adequate evidence and that it was a matter for worker’s compensation. But the jury ruled that Pfizer had violated laws protecting free speech and whistle-blowers by retaliating against Ms. McClain, who worked for the company from 1996 through 2005. The case has attracted the attention of some worker advocates, who say it shows the risks workers in biological labs encounter and the lack of rules to protect them. Ms. McClain, for example, claimed she encountered many difficulties in her attempts to learn the genetic content of the virus she suspected had infected her because it was protected as a trade secret. “It’s a field that has been trade-secreted out of the sunlight,” Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, said Friday. Mr. Nader, who has taken an interest in the case, said he had spoken to Ms. McClain three times by phone. Ms. McClain, a molecular biologist at Pfizer’s laboratory in Groton, Conn., had complained about what she saw as safety problems, including desks next to where biological experiments were done. She now suffers from a potassium deficiency that causes sporadic and temporary paralysis, which she says she believes was caused by a genetically engineered virus being used by a co-worker. A Pfizer spokeswoman said Friday that the company was disappointed in the verdict and was considering options for motions to reverse it. The spokeswoman, Elizabeth Power, said in an e-mail message that Ms. McClain had been fired for not returning to work for 11 months, not because of her safety complaints. “We thoroughly investigated Ms. McClain’s claims, and our investigation concluded that her workplace was safe and that she was not infected by any virologic materials while she was employed by Pfizer,” she said. She said OSHA had also looked into Ms. McClain’s claims and had found her workplace safe. Stephen J. Fitzgerald, one of Ms. McClain’s lawyers, said he had advised her not to speak to reporters because the case was continuing. Punitive damages have yet to be awarded. And Pfizer is expected to ask the judge to overturn the jury award. Jeremy Gruber, president of the Council for Responsible Genetics, an advocacy group urging discussion of the ethical implications of biotechnology, applauded the award. “I personally believe that Becky McClain is really the canary in the coal mine,” he said. Regulations “have not kept pace with the explosion of research.” David Michaels, who became head of OSHA in December, said he was only learning about Ms. McClain’s case. But he conceded Friday that there were “many gaps” in his agency’s standards. “New biological materials, nanomaterials, there are many things where we don’t have adequate information, and we think workers need to have protection,” he said. But he said the Obama administration was planning a new approach of having employers do more to fix their problems, and expanding rules, for example to cover more infectious agents.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/business/01payments.html?ref=pfizerinc">Pfizer Gives Details on Payments to Doctors<date>Published: March 31, 2010</date><text>Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker, said Wednesday that it paid about $20 million to 4,500 doctors and other medical professionals for consulting and speaking on its behalf in the last six months of 2009, its first public accounting of payments to the people who decide which drugs to recommend.Pfizer also paid $15.3 million to 250 academic medical centers and other research groups for clinical trials in the same period. While other pharmaceutical companies have disclosed payments to doctors, Pfizer is the first to disclose payments for the clinical trials. The disclosure does not include payments outside the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer, Kristen E. Neese, said most of the disclosures were required by an integrity agreement that the company signed in August to settle a federal investigation into the illegal promotion of drugs for off-label uses. Dr. Freda C. Lewis-Hall, Pfizer’s chief medical officer, characterized the disclosure and Web site as part of “a march to disclosure” that the company started in 2002. Pfizer is the fourth major drug company to make such disclosures, following Eli Lilly, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline. All four Web sites are searchable by the names of doctors or organizations, but all are set up in ways that make it difficult to download and analyze the entire database. “All of them are welcome, but none of them is a replacement for a single national database,” said Allan Coukell, director of the Pew Prescription Project, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trust. Beginning in 2012, drug and medical device companies will be required to disclose payments to doctors of more than $10, with the first report available in 2013. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act was passed as part of health care reform. Some states also have disclosure laws. Ms. Neese said the disclosures included elements not required by the federal agreement, like payments to academic centers and to nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The reporting also goes beyond the Sunshine law, Pfizer said, by not imposing a delay of up to four years on financial support for clinical trials. Pfizer plans to report the payments without the delay. Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine and a writer on conflicts of interest, said, “If they’re doing that — it would amaze me if they did, but if they are — that’s great.” Dr. Angell said the Pfizer amounts seemed low although she had no specific knowledge. “I can’t help but think something has escaped,” she said. Pfizer’s disclosure met with skepticism from one specialist on conflicts of interest in medicine. “I think it’s a good thing to do, but I put absolutely no trust in what drug companies voluntarily disclose to the public when those things are unaudited,” said Eric G. Campbell, lead author of a 2007 study of physician-industry relationships published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Professor Campbell, who is director of research at the Mongan Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said drug companies were trying to get ahead of a rising tide of public opinion for disclosure. The payments to doctors covered fees, travel and meals worth $25 or more and totaling $500 or more during the six-month period, Pfizer said.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/business/27nitro.html?ref=pfizerinc">F.D.A. Says Millions Got Unapproved Heart Pills<date>Published: March 26, 2010</date><text>Doctors in the United States wrote more than four million prescriptions last year for nitroglycerin tablets, heart drugs placed under the tongue to reduce the chest pain angina or to stop a heart attack.But the majority of the drugs sold had not been approved for sale, nor had their safety and effectiveness been vetted, by the Food and Drug Administration. And many doctors, who discovered only last week that pharmacies were giving their patients unproved heart tablets, now say they have no way of knowing whether patients have suffered unnecessarily as a result. “If it’s not approved and no one has tested it, we can’t be sure that it’s safe and effective,” said Dr. Harry M. Lever, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. If patients with angina took substandard or ineffective nitroglycerin tablets, Dr. Lever said, their pain might not subside and the problem could potentially progress to a heart attack. The F.D.A., which in recent years has been cracking down on a decades-old backlog of unapproved drugs, sent warning letters last week to two drug makers ordering them to stop marketing unapproved nitroglycerin tablets. But the drugs are still being sold at pharmacies while the order takes effect. The drug makers said they would comply with the order, but said that their tablets were safe. The F.D.A. said that it had not examined the quality of the products it was ordering off the market but that it had recorded problems with other unapproved nitroglycerin products in the past. The agency advised people who take unapproved nitroglycerin to continue taking their tablets but to consult their doctors about replacement prescriptions. Cardiologists regularly prescribe nitroglycerin to relieve chest pain associated with coronary artery disease. Placed under the tongue, the drug quickly dissolves into the blood, where it dilates the coronary artery, slightly decreasing blood pressure and reducing heart exertion. When taken during an initial episode of chest pain, nitroglycerin can prevent a heart attack in 3 to 4 percent of patients, said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. The problem of the unapproved tablets stems from a longstanding ambiguity about the rules for drugs whose use predates the establishment of the F.D.A. in 1927. Only one brand of nitroglycerin pills is federally approved: Nitrostat, made by Pfizer, on the market since 2000. Many makers of various drugs, not only nitroglycerin tablets, have long contended that their medications did not require F.D.A. review because they were grandfathered as pre-1938 drugs. (The F.D.A.'s powers to require new drugs to demonstrate safety before being marketed came in 1938 with passage of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.) But the agency is now disputing that interpretation of its rules. It took action on nitroglycerin tablets after looking into the matter and being struck by the large volume of prescriptions being filled with unapproved versions. “These drugs are historical remnants,” said Michael Levy, a division director in the F.D.A.’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Pharmacies likely mistake them for generic drugs or for drugs likely to be grandfathered, neither of which is the case.” Of the nearly 4.4 million prescriptions for under-the-tongue nitroglycerin tablets last year in this country, about 80 percent were filled with unapproved drugs, according to data from the research firm IMS Health. Leading cardiologists said they were shocked to learn that for years their patients might have been taking crucial heart drugs whose safety and potency had not been vetted by the F.D.A. “I was taken aback,” said Dr. Ralph G. Brindis, the president of the American College of Cardiology, a professional association representing nearly 26,000 cardiologists in the United States. Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, said it would not have occurred to him that licensed pharmacies might be filling prescriptions with unapproved drugs. “Nobody ever teaches you that in medical school,” he said. On March 16, the agency sent warning letters to two leading suppliers of the unapproved tablets, Konec Inc. of Tucson and Glenmark Generics Inc. of Mahwah, N.J., giving them 90 days to stop making the drugs and 180 days to stop shipping them. In response to a query from a reporter, a spokesman for Glenmark Pharmaceuticals in Mumbai, India, the parent company of Glenmark Generics, sent a statement saying that the company intended to comply with the agency’s directive to stop making the unapproved drugs. It added that the F.D.A. warning letter had not asked for a recall — an immediate action in which a company removes products for sale from the market. The president of Konec, Enrique Durazo, said his company regularly conducted its own lab tests to ensure that its nitroglycerin pills had the equivalent potency and stability to the approved brand-name drug. But the company has not conducted the kind of human tests, called bioequivalence studies, required for F.D.A. approval of generic drugs, he said. Konec now plans to conduct such tests and seek approval as a generic. Pfizer, which according to IMS Health sold about 900,000 prescriptions of Nitrostat last year, says it had stepped up production of the drug and expected to be able to meet the entire market demand in the United States. At CVS, the cash price for a pack of 100 tablets of 0.4-milligram Nitrostat is $21.99; the same amount of the Glenmark product costs $19.99. With the F.D.A. giving Konec and Glenmark six months to continue marketing their unapproved nitroglycerin tablets, some major pharmacy companies said they planned to continue selling them. “We still have the product available,” said Robert Elfinger, a spokesman for Walgreens, which sells the Glenmark nitroglycerin. “This is not a recall.” A spokesman for CVS, which has been selling the Glenmark drug since early 2009, said that the company would make any changes in dispensing that the F.D.A. might require. Nitroglycerin drugs are not to be confused with the explosive ingredient in dynamite. But even in drug form, nitroglycerin is an unstable chemical, which is why doctors say they cannot be sure how potent the unapproved versions might be. Moreover, because patients have varied responses, some cardiologists say they now have no way of knowing whether they have been treating their patients with an inferior product. Dr. Lever, of the Cleveland Clinic, for example, recalls a heart surgery patient telling him that something was wrong with her new tablets. They did not relieve chest pain, he recalled, and they did not cause side effects she had previously experienced. She then gave the pills, a bottle of Glenmark tablets, to Dr. Lever. Glenmark did not respond to a query from a reporter seeking comment about the matter. Dr. Lever, who has kept the bottle in his desk ever since, recalled the episode after learning of the F.D.A.’s action last week. “Every day, when I’m writing a prescription,” he said, “I’m thinking, ‘Is the patient going to get the right stuff?’ ”</text></article>

But at least one expert maintains that the prices are still too high. The deal was announced by the GAVI Alliance, a nonprofit organization, which estimated the program could save a total of 900,000 lives by 2015. The vaccines -- Pfizer's Prevnar 13 and GlaxoSmithKline's Synflorix -- prevent pneumococcal disease, which includes pneumonia and meningitis. Pneumococcal disease kills 1.6 million people a year worldwide, including 800,000 children before their fifth birthday, according to GAVI. Under the agreement, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline will provide up to 300 million doses each of their vaccines over a 10-year period. The price for the first 20 percent of the supply will be $7 a dose. Then the price will drop to $3.50 a dose for the remainder. The vaccines would be paid for by donations raised by GAVI and by the governments of the countries that ordered the vaccines. In Western markets, the pneumococcal vaccines sell for $54 to $108 a dose. ''For the price of a Starbucks latte, developing countries are going to be able to buy a dose of a life-saving vaccine,'' said Orin Levine, director of the international vaccine access center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has worked with GAVI. But Tido von Schoen-Angerer, who directs the essential medicines program at the international group Doctors Without Borders, said that even with the discounts, ''it's still quite an expensive vaccine in a developing country context.'' With at least three doses required, the price would initially be $21 per patient. The agreement is the first example of GAVI's program called advance market commitments, in which donor money is used to essentially guarantee a market for vaccine companies if they undertake development of vaccines for poor countries, or if the companies agree to build extra capacity to supply those markets with an existing vaccine. Such a strategy, if it works, might be particularly useful in spurring companies to develop vaccines for diseases like malaria, for which virtually the entire market would be in developing countries. GAVI has already received pledges that total $1.5 billion for the pneumococcal disease campaign from the governments of Italy, Britain, Canada, Russia and Norway and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. But GAVI, which is also known as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, still needs to raise another $1.5 billion by 2015 to pay for the procurement and distribution of the vaccines over the 10-year life of the program. Dr. von Schoen-Angerer said that the multibillion-dollar cost of the project was straining GAVI's finances and that the success of the pneumococcal program should be evaluated before the advance market commitment strategy was tried for another vaccine. He said that experts he consulted estimated the cost of making each dose at $1.50 to $2.50, so Pfizer and Glaxo were still making a little profit. The two companies would not disclose their costs but did not deny they would make money. ''Certainly the whole notion was to create a sustainable model,'' said Gwen Fisher, a spokeswoman for Pfizer. ''It wasn't to make it into a money-losing proposition.'' Costs could come down if vaccine makers from developing countries take part in the program. Two vaccine makers in India -- Panacea Biotec and Serum Institute of India -- are already moving toward supplying pneumococcal vaccines. Officials involved in the deal say that it formerly took many years for a vaccine developed in the West to trickle down to developing countries. But the new program would make the first vaccines available to Africa this year. ''American kids and African kids will get this new vaccine in the same year,'' Dr. Levine of Johns Hopkins said. ''That's just never happened before.'' Pharmaceutical companies already sell many of their drugs and vaccines at lower prices in poorer countries. Still, the agreement for the pneumococcal vaccines took four years to negotiate, in part because of all the parties involved. The World Bank, the World Health Organization and Unicef will all play a role in the program. PHOTO: Julian Lob-Levyt, the executive secretary of GAVI.

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/business/10drug.html?ref=pfizerinc">Merck Joins With Sanofi in Vet Drugs<date>Published: March 9, 2010</date><text>TRENTON (AP) — Two of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies said on Tuesday that they were uniting their animal health businesses in a move to become the largest supplier of veterinary medicines.The two firms, Merck &amp; Company and Sanofi-Aventis, said they would jointly own the business, which would control about 29 percent of the $19 billion annual global market for medicines for pets and livestock. That is well ahead of the current leader, Pfizer’s Fort Dodge unit, which has about 20 percent of the market. The joint venture will combine Sanofi’s Merial animal health business, the maker of the Frontline flea and tick treatment and Heartgard for preventing heartworm infection, with Merck’s Intervet/Schering-Plough unit, which makes vaccines and drugs mostly for farm animals. Merial operates mostly in North America and South America, while Intervet sells in Europe and emerging markets. Last year, Merial had sales of about $2.55 billion and Intervet had $2.74 billion, for a total of $5.3 billion. The chief executive of Merck, Richard T. Clark, noted their products and countries of operation were complementary, adding that anticipated growth would bolster resources for research. The chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis, Christopher A. Viehbacher, said the animal health market was expected to grow 5 percent a year through 2014, fueled by multiple trends. The deal, expected to close in the next year, comes amid an unusual level of jockeying in the veterinary medicine business recently. Pfizer, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical company by revenue, bought Wyeth in October for $68 billion in a diversification strategy that gave it strong businesses in vaccines, other biologic drugs, nonprescription medicines and veterinary medicines. Merck made a similar move, buying Schering-Plough in November for $41 billion for its biologic drugs, consumer health products, veterinary medicines and strong portfolio of drugs in development. Shares of Sanofi rose 3 cents, to $38.18. Merck shares fell 31 cents, to $37.04.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/business/09drug.html?ref=pfizerinc">Bidding War Pits Pfizer And Teva<date>Published: March 8, 2010</date><text>The executives at some generic drug companies have a new catchphrase: There’s no place like Ulm. There’s no place like Ulm.Ulm, a German town on the Danube, is the birthplace of Albert Einstein. But makers of brand-name and generic drugs are mentioning the town now because a three-way bidding war has broken out for Ratiopharm, a leading generic-drug maker with headquarters in Ulm, analysts said. The auction is riveting drug makers and analysts because it pits the world’s biggest maker of brand-name drugs, the American company Pfizer, against the global leader in generics, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, with headquarters in Israel. Pfizer is said to have bid as much as three billion euros — or about $4.1 billion — for Ratiopharm, Bloomberg reported last week, citing two people with knowledge of the talks. Besides Teva, analysts say, the other bidder is Actavis, a generic maker based in Iceland. Actavis has 10,000 employees worldwide and operations in 40 countries. But with global sales of roughly the same level as Ratiopharm and a heavy debt load, Actavis may have the biggest challenge convincing Ratiopharm, which is family-owned, that it would not seek to shrink the company, analysts said. Representatives for Pfizer, Teva and Actavis would not comment on market speculation. Analysts say top executives from Pfizer and Teva recently traveled to Germany to present their proposals to Ratiopharm. Actavis made its presentation Monday, according to news agencies in Europe. For all three companies, Ratiopharm is an attractive target because Germany is the largest generic market in Europe, and Ratiopharm is the second biggest generics purveyor there. Germans spent about 4.9 billion euros on generics in 2008, said Ulrich Huwald, an analyst for M.M. Warburg &amp; Company in Hamburg. Ratiopharm had global sales of 1.9 billion euros in 2008, nearly half of which were in Germany, according to the company’s Web site. But Ratiopharm also sells its products in more than 30 other countries, including established markets like Spain and Canada and emerging economies like Russia. Over all, it is the world’s fifth-largest maker of generics, accounting for 3 percent of the global market, a report last year from BCC Research said. Royal Bank of Scotland and Commerzbank, both lenders to Ratiopharm’s parent company VEM Vermögensverwaltung, are managing the sale of Ratiopharm, said Markus Braun, a spokesman for Ratiopharm. The transaction is expected to be completed this month, but the company would not disclose the names of the bidders, he said. But Ratiopharm is privately held and much about it is not publicly known. “It’s clearly the crown jewel in the German generics market. For any interested party, for Europe, it’s a megadeal,” said David M. Steinberg, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. “How profitable is it? It’s hard to know.” Teva has been aggressively expanding its global leadership in generics, in part through acquisitions. Two years ago it acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals, an American company, for about $7.5 billion. And Teva has indicated that it planned additional deals. Meanwhile Pfizer, which is based in New York, has been looking beyond its dominant position in brand-name drugs to increase its presence in generics. In 2008 it created a division called the established products business unit to sell medications that have lost their patent protection. And in the last year, Pfizer has signed licensing agreements to distribute more than 200 products from three generic-drug makers based in India. That might help explain Pfizer’s interest in Ratiopharm. “If Pfizer were to end up with that, it would make people look more closely at generics,” said Christopher T. Schott, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. But other analysts questioned the logic of a Pfizer purchase of Ratiopharm. “What is the strategic rationale for Pfizer to do it?” said Ronny Gal, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. “Maybe they are just trying to stick it to Teva, telling Teva they are not going to get away with this at a lower price.” The VEM Group put Ratiopharm on sale last year after the suicide of Adolf Merckle, who founded the company in 1973. Last month, the American drug maker Cephalon said it would buy another Merckle family asset, the Swiss generic maker Mepha, for an estimated $590 million. In Germany, Ratiopharm is the second-largest generics purveyor, behind Hexal, a part of the Sandoz division of the Swiss drug maker Novartis, but just ahead of another local generic-drug maker, Stada Arzneimittel, analysts said. Ratiopharm specializes in drugs for cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous system and metabolic disorders as well as in anti-infective medications. Pfizer, Teva and Actavis each has its own reasons to be interested in Ratiopharm, analysts said. In a note to investors last week titled “Why Ratiopharm makes sense,” David Risinger of Morgan Stanley wrote that such a deal would help Pfizer move its blockbuster drugs into global generics channels when the patents on those drugs expire — as well as helping the American company expand its presence in emerging markets. Buying Ratiopharm would allow Teva to immediately own a major share of the German market, Mr. Steinberg of Deutsche Bank said. “They have the explicit goal of being among the top three in every country,” he said. Teva is among the top three generic companies in every major Western European country, he said, except Germany. Another motivation may be that Teva and Pfizer are accumulating cash that might yield more through acquisitions, said Mr. Gal of Sanford Bernstein. “It is making 0.5 percent interest in the bank,” he said of Pfizer. “Why not buy generics?” Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank, an Actavis creditor, is said to be financing Actavis’s bid for Ratiopharm, Mr. Huwald of M.M. Warburg said. “Actavis is in a high-debt position,” he said. “Is Actavis more driven by Actavis, or by Deutsche Bank, which is interested in improving the strategic position of Actavis by buying Ratiopharm?” Analysts are already speculating about what will happen after the Ratiopharm sale. Will a losing bidder make a play for Stada, a publicly traded company with a market capitalization of about $2.3 billion with headquarters in the mineral spring town of Bad Vilbel, Germany? “Three big sharks want to gain market share in Germany, and two will not be rewarded,” Mr. Huwald said. “The highest probability is that the bidder for Stada would be Pfizer.” There’s no place like Bad Vilbel.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/business/04drug.html?ref=pfizerinc">Hopes for Alzheimer’s Drug Are Dashed<date>Published: March 3, 2010</date><text>It seemed somewhat unlikely, but in recent years an old Russian hay fever pill had become one of the world’s best hopes for treating the growing epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease.But those hopes were dashed on Wednesday when the drug failed in its first late-stage clinical trial, dealing a blow not only to patients with Alzheimer’s and their families but to the companies developing the treatment — a start-up in San Francisco called Medivation and the world’s largest drug company, Pfizer. The companies said in a statement that the drug, called Dimebon, had shown virtually no effect after six months in treating the cognitive decline or behavioral problems associated with Alzheimer’s when compared with a placebo. The result was somewhat surprising, because in a smaller previous trial, Dimebon had shown what some experts characterized as better results than any of the drugs already approved for Alzheimer’s disease. It seemed to improve cognitive function or at least stave off mental decline for about 18 months, while the existing treatments do so for only about six months, experts said. As recently as last week, an Alzheimer’s researcher had said of Dimebon, “The clinical data is by far and away superior to anything that’s ever been shown before.” That researcher, Mark A. Smith, of Case Western Reserve University, is a consultant to Medivation who is trying to figure out how the drug works. Still, some doctors and Wall Street investors had been a bit skeptical, because that earlier trial had been done in Russia, making it hard to determine how the study was conducted. Also, the mechanism by which Dimebon worked was never clear. “It just seemed too good to believe,” Dr. John Q. Trojanowski, director of the Alzheimer’s center at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an interview Wednesday. The skeptics were borne out by the results of the new trial, called Connection, which involved 598 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease in Europe and in North and South America. “The outcome for the Connection trial was unexpected,” Dr. David Hung, the chief executive of Medivation, told securities analysts in a conference call Wednesday. “With this data we have to reconsider the entire program.” Shares of Medivation lost two-thirds of their value Wednesday, plummeting to $13.10. Before the results were announced, Medivation, which has no products on the market, had a market valuation of $1.3 billion based largely on the prospects for Dimebon. The big questions now are whether the companies abandon other trials already under way for Dimebon or whether Pfizer itself, which has been paying 60 percent of the development costs, pulls out. Executives at both companies said they needed to further analyze the results before making such decisions. Dimebon, also known as latrepirdine, was sold as an antihistamine in Russia starting around 1983, though production and sales of the drug had stopped some years ago. In the 1990s, Sergey Bachurin, a scientist at the Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds in Russia, had started screening chemicals that might be used to treat Alzheimer’s. He discovered that the already approved antihistamine seemed to fit the bill. The researchers tested the drug in animals and in a small group of patients, then filed for patents. Sergey Sablin, a former researcher at the Russian institute who moved to San Francisco, shopped around for American investors to develop the drug. He met Dr. Hung, who had already succeeded with a previous company, and Medivation was set up. Medivation in turn licensed rights to Dimebon to Pfizer for a large initial payment of $225 million. Pfizer already sells Aricept, a leading drug for Alzheimer’s, but that product will be losing patent protection later this year. Shares of Pfizer fell 28 cents, or about 1.6 percent, to $17.32. Medivation and Pfizer are conducting additional trials in which Dimebon is being combined with other Alzheimer’s drugs.It seemed somewhat unlikely, but in recent years an old Russian hay fever pill had become one of the world’s best hopes for treating the growing epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease.</text></article>

While Pfizer has seen its glory fade over the last decade, its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year gave the company a whole new range of biotechnology drugs and vaccines and has apparently won the admiration of some big-name hedge funds, Reuters reports. Reuters noted that Pfizer’s stock, which traded at almost $50 per share in 2000, is currently worth $17.55. But, the news service writes: The Wyeth acquisition, which closed in October, has grabbed the attention of hedge fund stars including John Paulson, Christopher Shumway, David Einhorn and Michael Karsch.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/business/01gilgore.html?ref=pfizerinc">Sheldon Gilgore, Physician Who Led Drug Giants Pfizer and Searle, Dies at 77<date>Published: March 1, 2010</date><text>Dr. Sheldon G. Gilgore, a leader of two major pharmaceutical companies during decades of rapid change in the drug business, died Feb. 12 in his home in Naples, Fla. He was 77.The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his son Laurence. Dr. Gilgore was the rare physician to lead drug companies, first as president of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals from 1971 to 1986 and then, in a move viewed as a major recruiting coup, as president and chief executive of G. D. Searle from 1986 to 1995. At Pfizer he promoted development of the company’s first billion-dollar product, the arthritis drug Feldene. At Searle he manufactured Ambien, the nation’s most-prescribed sleeping pill, and advanced research on the blockbuster painkiller Celebrex, among other drugs. But it was after work on Fridays when he really sprang to life, his wife, Irma, said. He would rush home from Pfizer headquarters in Manhattan to attend an opera performance and then devote weekends to volunteer work, including service as chairman of the board of Clark University in Worcester, Mass., as well as raising three sons, collecting art and listening to opera records. The Gilgores were the founders of the Connecticut Grand Opera, and he served on the boards of the Philadelphia Grand Opera and the Chicago Lyric Opera. Born in Philadelphia on Feb. 13, 1932, Dr. Gilgore attended Villanova University and the medical college at Thomas Jefferson University, graduating at 24. He met Irma Swartz through her brother, also a medical student. She would become his wife of 53 years and, as a painter and pianist, introduce him to opera and art. Dr. Gilgore, who was trained in endocrinology, worked at Pfizer for 23 years. From 1971 to 1986 he was president of its largest division, pharmaceuticals. “He truly understood the science, but not just that,” said Peter C. Brandt, who was given an internship that led to his own 28-year career at Pfizer, where he became president of domestic pharmaceuticals. Dr. Gilgore, he added, also understood “how clinical physicians would use the product, what would pique their interest.” In 1986, Searle, maker of NutraSweet, lured Dr. Gilgore for its top job and a new challenge: revitalizing a company after the reign of Donald H. Rumsfeld, who had led Searle the previous eight years. Monsanto paid $2.7 billion for the trimmed-down Searle, then hired Dr. Gilgore. His office moved from 42nd Street in Manhattan to Skokie, Ill. “He was a brilliant scientist and a marketing genius,” said Dr. Edward D. Corboy Jr., a colleague and researcher at Searle. “But also, he realized that running a drug company was more than just making money.” After the Monsanto sale, Dr. Gilgore increased research and made the company strong enough to be an attractive takeover candidate some years later for his old employers at Pfizer. At Searle, Dr. Gilgore settled most of the hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits filed against the company over Copper 7, once the most popular intrauterine device in the United States. “He inherited the problem; he didn’t create it,” said Michael R. Sonnenreich, a prominent lawyer retained by Dr. Gilgore at Searle. “He was smart enough to settle and move on.” Dr. Gilgore was particularly proud of a 1988 program offering free heart drugs to people who could not afford them, and he challenged other companies to follow suit. At the same time, he fought against price control efforts in Congress. Dr. Gilgore was chairman of the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in 1994 and 1995. He told The Chicago Tribune that he had met with Senator Edward M. Kennedy to say price controls would end most drug research in America — and was promptly escorted out of the office by the senator. In an interview at the time, Dr. Gilgore said: “The fact of the matter is, prices in the United States are higher than in the United Kingdom or France or Germany or Italy or Spain. We cannot deny that they are higher. But you cannot fuel the research engine that discovers and develops new drugs on the profits that you make in countries outside the U.S.” Five years after Dr. Gilgore retired in 1995, Searle merged with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, and three years later Pfizer bought Pharmacia for $60 billion. In later years, he maintained his interest in opera and art. The Gilgores’ son Laurence is conductor of the Connecticut Grand Opera. Another son, Lance, is a lawyer in Washington for the Japanese drug company Daiichi Sankyo. The third, Lloyd, is a psychologist in Doylestown, Pa. Dr. Gilgore is also survived by his wife, five grandchildren and a brother, Dr. Gary S. Gilgore, of Naples, Fla. In Florida, the Gilgores established a private museum of 19th-century Italian paintings and sculptures that have been exhibited at museums in Philadelphia, Chicago and Italy. “Our art collection grew out of our love of opera,” Mrs. Gilgore said. “We realized those painters and sculptors lived at the same time as our favorite composers, when Puccini was conducting, Toscanini was conducting and the great opera singer Caruso was singing.”</text></article>

Pfizer, which had also been cited as a possible bidder for the generic drug maker, appears to have taken itself out of the running, according to the news service.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Add to Portfolio Sanofi-Aventis SA GlaxoSmithKline PLC Pfizer Inc Novartis AG Go to your Portfolio » Francois Mori/Associated Press Sanofi-Aventis's chief, Christopher A. Viehbacher, bought Medley of Brazil, which has its own brand identity. Just don’t call them no-name drugs. Giants like Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline are not looking to enter the commodity generics market in the United States, where chain pharmacies often determine which generics they offer based on the lowest available price  and where consumers often view generic makers as interchangeable. Instead, the big drug makers are pursuing a growing consumer base in emerging markets like Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America where many people pay out of pocket for their medicines but often cannot afford expensive brand-name drugs. And, in some emerging markets, where the fear of counterfeit drugs or low-quality medicines runs high, consumers who can afford it are willing to pay a premium for generics from well-known makers, industry analysts said. These products are known as company-branded generics, or branded generics. They carry the name of a trusted local or foreign drug maker stamped on the package, seen as a sign of authenticity and quality control. “We are able to create different tiers of products at prices they haven’t previously seen with our stamp of approval,” said Andrew P. Witty, the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline. Last year, Glaxo bought a stake in Aspen, a generic maker in South Africa, and signed agreements with Dr. Reddy’s, an Indian generic firm, to sell their products in emerging markets. Under the distribution agreement, the Dr. Reddy’s products are subject to Glaxo quality control checks and, eventually, will carry a Glaxo logo, a company spokeswoman said. Until recently, many brand-name drug makers invested the bulk of their research and marketing dollars in the development of blockbuster drugs, only to cede their intellectual property and market share to lower-priced generic competitors once patents expired. But now, with an estimated $89 billion in brand-name drug sales in the United States at risk to generic competition over the next five years, according to IMS Health, some drug makers are selling generics to offset revenue declines  as well as wring some post-patent profits from the innovative drugs they developed. It is a topic sure to be discussed at the Generic Pharmaceutical Association’s annual meeting, which begins Tuesday in Naples, Fla. “It definitely represents a change in thinking,” said David Simmons, the president of Pfizer’s established products business unit. That recently started division sells off-patent brand-name Pfizer products like the antidepressant Zoloft. It also markets generic versions of those off-patent drugs under its own Greenstone label, and distributes a number of generic drugs licensed from a few other producers. In the last year, Pfizer signed licensing deals with three India-based generic makers to sell those companies’ pills and injectable drugs in the United States and other markets, adding more than 200 products to the company’s generic portfolio. Pfizer said its Greenstone generic subsidiary had become the world’s seventh-largest purveyor of generic medicines, as measured by number of prescriptions dispensed. While drug sales in developed markets like North America have low single-digit annual growth, emerging markets, including India, China, Russia and Brazil, have growth in the midteens, said Doug Long, vice president for industry relations at IMS Health, a health information firm. As a result, some drug makers are pursuing a two-tiered strategy in developing markets: selling their own lines of more expensive name-brand products to the more affluent, as well as offering midpriced branded generic lines that include prescription and over-the-counter medicines for the broader market. Branded generics can give prominent drug makers a way to capitalize on those markets without having to compete with no-name generic producers whose selling point is rock-bottom pricing. Company-branded generics can charge more for the promise of quality. “It’s an economic opportunity for Watson and Pfizer and Sanofi and Teva,” said Paul M. Bisaro, the chief executive of Watson Pharmaceuticals, a leading generic maker. “They have a reputation that says, ‘You can count on us.’ ” Watson itself had primarily been focused on the United States market, but last year the company spent $1.75 billion in cash and stock to acquire Arrow, a generic maker that operates in 20 countries, Mr. Bisaro said. And in markets that may need antibiotics and antifungal drugs more than quality-of-life drugs like sleep aids or erectile dysfunction pills, there is a logic to branded drug makers’ acquiring local generic makers or licensing generic products to tailor their product portfolios to the local market. Last year, for example, Sanofi-Aventis spent more than 1.5 billion euros to buy Zentiva, a leading Czech generic maker; Medley, the leading producer of generics in Brazil; and Laboratorios Kendrick, a generic producer in Mexico. Sanofi is now the world’s 11th-biggest generics player in terms of sales, the company said. “For me, the interest in Medley, Kendrick and Zentiva is to acquire a portfolio of affordable medicines, recognizing that outside of the United States and Europe people are really paying for medicines out of their own pocket,” said Christopher A. Viehbacher, the chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis. “Therefore you have to have medicines that fit the pocketbook and, to me, generics really fit the bill.” Medley even has its own generic brand identity, Mr. Viehbacher said, which includes mint-green packaging that is a visible logo on pharmacy shelves. The Swiss drug maker Novartis, which unified its generic business in 2003 under the name Sandoz, recognized the consumer interest and business opportunity in generic drugs early on. “In the beginning, of course, especially other pharmaceutical companies were very skeptical about it,” said Dr. Daniel Vasella, the chairman of the board and former chief executive of Novartis. “Some competitors said that this was not right to enter a field that was competing with our own.” Now, with organic growth and the acquisition of branded generics like the German maker Hexal, Sandoz is the world’s second-largest purveyor of generic drugs, after Teva. Branded generics may appeal to leading drug makers because they represent a hybrid of the generic and name-brand models  allowing drug makers to use their existing commercial distribution system and marketing skills to sell premium-priced generics as if they were brand-name drugs, said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Under this approach, manufacturers or distributors advertise branded generics. Company sales representatives visit doctors and pharmacists to market them. And, in emerging markets where government health coverage and private insurance are less common, consumers who pay out of pocket for their own medicines would rather spend on names they can trust, Mr. Gal said in an interview last month. “Patients prefer brands,” he wrote in a note to investors last year, “and as long as they are the main payers, they will continue to use branded generics.” Still, branded generics may not be a diversification strategy for the long term. Some companies are moving into branded generics as a short-term tactic to make up for revenue shortfalls and capture near-term growth in emerging markets, Mr. Gal said. But as government health care programs and health insurers in emerging markets develop further, consumers could be encouraged or required to switch from midpriced branded generics to low-cost no-name generics, he said. He estimated that it would take at least a decade for that to happen.

Branded generics can give prominent drug makers a way to capitalize on those markets without having to compete with no-name generic producers whose selling point is rock-bottom pricing. Company-branded generics can charge more for the promise of quality. “It’s an economic opportunity for Watson and Pfizer and Sanofi and Teva,” said Paul M. Bisaro, the chief executive of Watson Pharmaceuticals, a leading generic maker. “They have a reputation that says, ‘You can count on us.’ ” Watson itself had primarily been focused on the United States market, but last year the company spent $1.75 billion in cash and stock to acquire Arrow, a generic maker that operates in 20 countries, Mr. Bisaro said. And in markets that may need antibiotics and antifungal drugs more than quality-of-life drugs like sleep aids or erectile dysfunction pills, there is a logic to branded drug makers’ acquiring local generic makers or licensing generic products to tailor their product portfolios to the local market. Last year, for example, Sanofi-Aventis spent more than 1.5 billion euros to buy Zentiva, a leading Czech generic maker; Medley, the leading producer of generics in Brazil; and Laboratorios Kendrick, a generic producer in Mexico. Sanofi is now the world’s 11th-biggest generics player in terms of sales, the company said. “For me, the interest in Medley, Kendrick and Zentiva is to acquire a portfolio of affordable medicines, recognizing that outside of the United States and Europe people are really paying for medicines out of their own pocket,” said Christopher A. Viehbacher, the chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis. “Therefore you have to have medicines that fit the pocketbook and, to me, generics really fit the bill.” Medley even has its own generic brand identity, Mr. Viehbacher said, which includes mint-green packaging that is a visible logo on pharmacy shelves. The Swiss drug maker Novartis, which unified its generic business in 2003 under the name Sandoz, recognized the consumer interest and business opportunity in generic drugs early on. “In the beginning, of course, especially other pharmaceutical companies were very skeptical about it,” said Dr. Daniel Vasella, the chairman of the board and former chief executive of Novartis. “Some competitors said that this was not right to enter a field that was competing with our own.” Now, with organic growth and the acquisition of branded generics like the German maker Hexal, Sandoz is the world’s second-largest purveyor of generic drugs, after Teva. Branded generics may appeal to leading drug makers because they represent a hybrid of the generic and name-brand models  allowing drug makers to use their existing commercial distribution system and marketing skills to sell premium-priced generics as if they were brand-name drugs, said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Under this approach, manufacturers or distributors advertise branded generics. Company sales representatives visit doctors and pharmacists to market them. And, in emerging markets where government health coverage and private insurance are less common, consumers who pay out of pocket for their own medicines would rather spend on names they can trust, Mr. Gal said in an interview last month. “Patients prefer brands,” he wrote in a note to investors last year, “and as long as they are the main payers, they will continue to use branded generics.” Still, branded generics may not be a diversification strategy for the long term. Some companies are moving into branded generics as a short-term tactic to make up for revenue shortfalls and capture near-term growth in emerging markets, Mr. Gal said. But as government health care programs and health insurers in emerging markets develop further, consumers could be encouraged or required to switch from midpriced branded generics to low-cost no-name generics, he said. He estimated that it would take at least a decade for that to happen.</text></article>

It was a modest compromise for an industry with $246 billion in prescription drug sales last year. But now, with the health care overhaul on a back burner in Washington and possibly dead for this year, drug makers are getting a sinking sense of how a piecemeal public policy future might look for them. President Obama’s proposed budget this week, for example, includes a plan he alluded to in last week’s State of the Union address: a new tax on profits from some patents and other intangible assets parked in overseas tax havens by American companies. For drug makers, which are among those most likely to be affected by such a tax, the president’s proposal “pretty much came out of the blue,” said Martin A. Sullivan, an economist formerly with the Treasury Department and Joint Committee on Taxation. Another expert agreed. “Pharma’s one that would really get hit,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “That’s a biggie.” The industry giant Pfizer, for example, which has said that 88 percent of its $56 billion in income from 2004 through 2008 originated overseas, could be subject to the corporate 35 percent tax rate on at least some of its foreign profit in the future if the president’s proposal goes through. Although the tax idea faced a cool reception from Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, it highlighted the risks to the drug industry of unpredictable election-year politics. It is a time when bolt-from-the-blue challenges may await drug makers, compared with the carefully mapped future they had worked out with the White House and the Senate under the health care legislation. As if to reinforce the continuing business challenges that drug makers face, regardless of carrots and sticks from Washington, Pfizer issued an earnings report and financial forecast this week that disappointed Wall Street. The report, on Wednesday, has helped send its shares down 6.3 percent in the last two days. Pfizer lowered its 2010 and 2012 forecasts, citing the rising dollar and the sale or spinoff of some assets, including animal health products and an H.I.V. drug. The company also noted the coming patent expirations on some of its blockbuster drugs, including Lipitor, as well as growing competition from lower-priced generics. Several of the other big American drug companies reported a mixed bag of results last week. Johnson &amp; Johnson posted a rare yearly decline in sales and gave a disappointing 2010 profit forecast. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates, helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Eli Lilly profit fell just short of expectations, and its shares declined as investors also showed concern about expirations of its drug patents. The other big American drug maker, Merck, plans to report on Feb. 16. None of those drug makers had forecast effects from a health care overhaul by Washington. But all of them had basically endorsed the Senate bill. Just last month, before the Republican candidate Scott Brown’s victory in a special election in Massachusetts upended the Democrats’ supermajority in the Senate, Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, told analysts that the Senate health care bill was “largely consistent with the principles” that were important to his industry. The drug industry had forecast lower revenue in the early years of its cost-savings deal, in which it agreed to pay $80 billion in rebates and fees over a decade. But its revenue and profit were expected to more than make up the difference later in that period as more than 30 million uninsured people began receiving health and drug coverage. And just as important, the industry had received assurances from the Obama administration and some critical Congressional Democrats that long-feared proposals that might have popular appeal  including government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and allowing the import of cheaper drugs from Canada  would be tabled in return for drug makers’ support of the rest of the health care overhaul. And some industry experts say any notions of an offshore tax had also been taken off the table. As part of the deal, the drug industry had also pledged and spent more than $100 million on TV advertising in support of the overhaul effort. It is unlikely that the drug industry will run ads promoting President Obama’s offshore tax proposal. Drug makers are fighting it through a Washington-based business coalition called Promote America’s Competitive Edge, which includes many other multinationals. The group argues that lower foreign tax rates create a level playing field for American companies and international competitors and, ultimately, save jobs in the United States. Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury economist who now writes about tax issues, said that all the big drug makers engage in offshore tax sheltering of one sort or another. And the portion of overseas profit and revenue has been growing in recent years. “Typically when a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, it transfers it to a holding company in a tax haven like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, usually on very favorable terms,” he said. “There’s a tremendous amount of income taken out of the U.S. and put into the tax haven. This proposal seems targeted to just that type of situation.” Pfizer has reported that 58 percent of its revenue came from overseas in 2008, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. For other drug markets, overseas revenue in 2008 amounted to 46 percent for Lilly, 44 percent for Merck and 42 percent for Bristol-Myers. Professor Gordon of the University of Michigan, who studies pharmaceutical companies, said the president’s new plan to tax “excessive” offshore profits had surprised the industry and revealed the risks of a piecemeal health policy. “The industry thought that it got some uncertainty off the table,” Professor Gordon said. “They’re not thrilled about what happened in Massachusetts. It’s not working to their advantage.” Some analysts, meanwhile, say parts of the $80 billion, 10-year deal could come back to bite the drug industry  if it is held to some of the cost pledges without receiving the offsetting political protection. The pact, for instance, committed the industry to support an increase in the rebate the government receives on Medicaid drugs  to 23 percent, up from 15 percent currently. In the current deficit-cutting environment, that discount may still look attractive to lawmakers. And it could conceivably be enacted by Congress at any time without being part of an industry quid pro quo. “No question that’s alive,” said Seamus Fernandez, pharmaceutical industry analyst for the health care investment bank Leerink Swann. But the overall health care reform package, he added, is “either dead or severely hobbled.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 5, 2010, on page B1 of the New York edition.With the possible demise of health care legislation, getting back to business as usual may not be the best thing for the nation’s drug makers.

Profit in the period more than doubled to $767 million, or 10 cents a share, from $266 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier, when results were hurt by a $2.3 billion legal settlement related to the marketing of the Bextra painkiller. Earnings excluding one-time items were 49 cents a share, falling 2 cents short of the average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Revenue increased 34 percent, to $16.5 billion from $12.3 billion. Pfizer forecast 2010 profit excluding certain items of $2.10 to $2.20, also below Wall Street estimates. Pfizer completed its $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in October to help replace the billions in revenue that will be lost when its top-selling cholesterol pill, Lipitor, faces generic competition next year. Pfizer is cutting costs by laying off about 19,000 workers and closing manufacturing plants and six research centers. ''Over all, it is a bit of a disappointment at the initial look,'' said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swaan &amp; Company. Shares of Pfizer, which is based in New York, fell 44 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $18.62. Pfizer projected 2012 earnings excluding certain items of $2.25 to $2.35 after generic Lipitor enters the market. Pfizer reported adjusted per-share earnings in 2009 of $2.02 and $2.42 for 2008. ''What matters is whether they can overcome the Lipitor patent expiration, and this guidance today for 2012 seems to suggest that they can,'' said Michael P. Krensavage, head of Krensavage Asset Management. Sales of Lipitor, the world's best-selling medicine, rose 1 percent, to $3.18 billion. Sales of Lyrica, a treatment for pain and fibromyalgia, rose 17 percent, to $820 million, and revenue from Chantix, used to quell nicotine cravings, fell 2 percent, to $176 million. Revenue from the impotence drug Viagra rose 9 percent, to $549 million. PHOTO: Jeffrey Kindler, chief executive of Pfizer, which is cutting workers and closing plants.

The work is being done with a $3 million grant -- from the drug maker Pfizer. Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the Stanford medical school, says Pfizer will have no say on how the three-year grant will be spent. The university plans to set up unbiased programs of postgraduate education on the Stanford campus rather than the industry-selected topics of the past that have been presented to rooms full of doctors at hotels and resorts. ''It's a fundamental change,'' Dr. Pizzo said Sunday, criticizing the drug industry for poisoning educational programs with marketing messages and doctors for ''complicity'' in taking speaker fees and expenses-paid trips. He called the grant ''a novel rebooting.'' Stanford's move was applauded by David J. Rothman, a professor and president of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at Columbia. ''It's fair to say Stanford is once again leading the pack,'' said Professor Rothman, who has written in The Journal of the American Medical Association about conflicts of interest in academic medicine. ''I will also confess I am surprised Pfizer is doing it,'' he added, ''and I don't know how many more times they will give money with no strings attached.'' Pfizer, in a statement, said it wanted to help redefine how continuing medical education was financed to ensure the independence and patient benefit of the programs, which most doctors are required to take to maintain their state medical licenses. Still, some saw inherent conflicts in the Pfizer connection. ''The announcement is self-satirizing,'' said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a Georgetown University medical professor who has researched and written about industry influence in continuing medical education. ''Pfizer's interest in better ways to manipulate physicians is well-known.'' Stanford said the curriculum would focus on areas that needed improvement, like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking cessation and infections. The university plans to use advanced technologies, including a simulated hospital, rather than lecturing. ''The Pfizer grant comes with no conditions, and the company will not be involved in developing the curriculum,'' according to a medical school press release. But Dr. Fugh-Berman said that Pfizer has major products in two of the four areas that the Stanford press release suggested might be pursued: smoking cessation and heart disease. Dr. Pizzo, the Stanford dean said he was aware that the grant from Pfizer would receive some skepticism. ''I think that's appropriate because I have a certain guarded skepticism or optimism about this, too,'' he said. ''It remains to be seen how this eventually works.'' Drug and medical device companies have paid more than $1 billion a year for continuing medical education through universities, disease associations and private vendors, about half the total cost of the programs. The industry's influence on topic selection, tone of presentations and advice given to doctors has spurred calls for reform from the Institute of Medicine, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. Pfizer has a checkered history of using such education courses to promote off-label use of its drugs. For instance Pfizer paid $2.3 billion last year to settle government fraud charges of deceptive marketing, including sponsoring supposedly independent programs promoting off-label uses for the pain drug Bextra. In 2008, it became the first drug company to say it would no longer provide such money directly to profit-making medical education companies, but only to universities and other nonprofits. But a $780,000 grant from Pfizer to the Canadian Medical Association for educational programs drew criticism because the company was given two seats on a six-member supervisory board. And a $3.4 million grant last year for the California Academy of Family Physicians to sponsor stop-smoking educational programs was questioned because Pfizer makes Chantix, a smoking cessation drug. Dr. Arnold S. Relman, a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, a Harvard professor emeritus, an outspoken critic of industry conflicts and a friend of Dr. Pizzo, said he could not understand the rationale behind the arrangement. ''If it is true -- a big, big if -- but if it is true that this money is being given without any strings at all and without any obligation on the part of Stanford to please Pfizer, then it's arguable that it's O.K.,'' Dr. Relman said. ''But it's just not a good idea for a profession that says it wants to be independent and trusted, a reliable source of information to the profession and the public about drugs, to take money from the drug company under any conditions.'' In September 2008, the Stanford medical school became the first in the nation to stop accepting industry financing for specific topics in postgraduate educational programs. It will accept only industry money that was pooled in a general fund for the education programs.

Deny and defend? Disclose and apologize? Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » With the recent bombing attempt on a flight to Detroit and the deadly bombing attack on American intelligence agents in Afghanistan, the question of how to publicly account for system failure is, of course, playing out in government. But major industries also have their share of breakdowns to account for. Consider health care. Does working for a hospital or a drug maker mean never having to say you’re sorry? Even a decade ago, according to physicians, it was standard practice for many doctors and hospitals not to inform patients about medical errors. Now an increasing number of leading medical centers are taking a different tack and encouraging doctors to apologize to patients for mistakes and to explain what went wrong. Doctors say that such accountability can help patients feel more cared for and empowered, as well as enhance the reputation of the doctor and medical center as honest brokers. Although one might assume that apologizing exposes hospitals to increased litigation, a few medical centers, including the University of Michigan Health System, have reported that the approach has reduced malpractice suits. Apologizing isn’t popular among drug makers, however. And in our litigious country, C.E.O.’s are understandably gun-shy about teeing up a costly lawsuit by issuing an apology that a court might later construe as an admission of guilt. So even though two leading drug makers last year paid massive fines to settle charges that they had illegally marketed certain drugs for unapproved uses, they did not use the word “apologize” in their public statements. Last January, the drug maker Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and paid $1.41 billion to settle criminal and civil charges that it improperly marketed an antipsychotic drug for elderly patients with dementia, potentially putting them at risk. In September, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion to settle criminal and civil charges that it had illegally marketed an anti-inflammatory drug and other products. One of its subsidiaires, the Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, pleaded guilty to a felony related to the anti-inflammatory drug. After its settlement, Lilly issued a press release saying, “We deeply regret the past actions covered by the misdemeanor plea.” (In response to a reporter’s query, Marni Lemons, a spokeswoman for Lilly, said, “We think that is an apology.”) Similarly, Pfizer’s statement said, “We regret certain actions taken in the past.” (Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said last week, “We have publicly acknowledged our conduct and taken full responsibility.”) Each drug maker also said it maintained comprehensive corporate compliance policies and had instituted additional measures as part of corporate integrity agreements with the government. If we lived in a litigation-free world, it might be easier for drug makers to go further than this. (On the other hand, without the threat of legal penalties, they might also consider themselves less accountable.) But putting litigation aside for the moment, what about a company that finds the strength to directly apologize to physicians and patients whose ethics or well-being may have been undermined by questionable marketing or potentially risky drugs? The difference between apologizing and simply offering a “regret” may seem semantic. Yet some ethicists and analysts say that different words do, in fact, reflect divergent approaches to accountability. A company that openly apologizes does more than merely take public responsibility for its actions  it also signals to its own employees that certain practices are unacceptable, analysts say. And, they add, a company expressing regret may not be accepting blame. After all, you can regret an event, like an earthquake or a hurricane, in which you played no role. “Companies use ‘regret’ as a way of avoiding accountability,” said Dr. Carl Elliott, a professor at the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota. “You regret something that happened, not something that you did.” In one of the few pharmaceutical mea culpas of last year, the chief executive of Genzyme in Cambridge, Mass., wrote a letter to patients with two rare genetic conditions, apologizing for a medication shortage that occurred after the company shut down a manufacturing facility because of viral contamination. The letter acknowledged that the company hadn’t maintained a sufficient inventory of the drugs. “We certainly failed to meet the needs of these communities,” says Jamie Manganello, Genzyme’s associate director of global patient advocacy. “I don’t think there was a choice not to apologize.” Indeed, in light of a Harris poll last month that reported that Americans trust drug makers only slightly more than they trust tobacco or oil companies, contrition still could have a public relations upside for drug makers. The poll was published at the end of a year in which a series of government investigations and lawsuits showed how some drug makers paid leading physicians and patient advocacy groups, engaged in misleading marketing, supported ghostwritten articles in medical journals and tried to squelch doctors’ concerns about drug safety. Although the industry has recently changed its approach to some of these practices, industry watchers say drug makers could advance their cause by also apologizing. “The companies should be saying, ‘We did lousy; we did not put our best foot forward,’” says Doug Wojcieszak, the founder of the Sorry Works! Coalition, a consultant group in Glen Carbon, Ill., that trains medical professionals in the art of apologizing. OPENLY apologizing also has the potential to turn a problem into a teachable moment for employees, thereby preventing a repeat occurrence, says Paul Levy, the chief executive of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. In 2008, a surgeon at his hospital mistakenly operated on the wrong side of a patient. The doctor and other hospital personnel apologized. And Mr. Levy publicly dissected the event on his blog, called “Running a Hospital.” The medical profession, he says, was initially hesitant to embrace contrition. But, he says, “as in any field, once you have a few leaders do it and the world doesn’t end and, in fact, is made better, then people tend to follow.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 10, 2010, on page BU4 of the New York edition.AH, the thorny and seemingly never-ending topic of employee error and corporate misconduct: How does your company handle it?

One of its subsidiaires, the Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, pleaded guilty to a felony related to the anti-inflammatory drug. After its settlement, Lilly issued a press release saying, “We deeply regret the past actions covered by the misdemeanor plea.” (In response to a reporter’s query, Marni Lemons, a spokeswoman for Lilly, said, “We think that is an apology.”) Similarly, Pfizer’s statement said, “We regret certain actions taken in the past.” (Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said last week, “We have publicly acknowledged our conduct and taken full responsibility.”) Each drug maker also said it maintained comprehensive corporate compliance policies and had instituted additional measures as part of corporate integrity agreements with the government. If we lived in a litigation-free world, it might be easier for drug makers to go further than this. (On the other hand, without the threat of legal penalties, they might also consider themselves less accountable.) But putting litigation aside for the moment, what about a company that finds the strength to directly apologize to physicians and patients whose ethics or well-being may have been undermined by questionable marketing or potentially risky drugs? The difference between apologizing and simply offering a “regret” may seem semantic. Yet some ethicists and analysts say that different words do, in fact, reflect divergent approaches to accountability. A company that openly apologizes does more than merely take public responsibility for its actions  it also signals to its own employees that certain practices are unacceptable, analysts say. And, they add, a company expressing regret may not be accepting blame. After all, you can regret an event, like an earthquake or a hurricane, in which you played no role. “Companies use ‘regret’ as a way of avoiding accountability,” said Dr. Carl Elliott, a professor at the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota. “You regret something that happened, not something that you did.” In one of the few pharmaceutical mea culpas of last year, the chief executive of Genzyme in Cambridge, Mass., wrote a letter to patients with two rare genetic conditions, apologizing for a medication shortage that occurred after the company shut down a manufacturing facility because of viral contamination. The letter acknowledged that the company hadn’t maintained a sufficient inventory of the drugs. “We certainly failed to meet the needs of these communities,” says Jamie Manganello, Genzyme’s associate director of global patient advocacy. “I don’t think there was a choice not to apologize.” Indeed, in light of a Harris poll last month that reported that Americans trust drug makers only slightly more than they trust tobacco or oil companies, contrition still could have a public relations upside for drug makers. The poll was published at the end of a year in which a series of government investigations and lawsuits showed how some drug makers paid leading physicians and patient advocacy groups, engaged in misleading marketing, supported ghostwritten articles in medical journals and tried to squelch doctors’ concerns about drug safety. Although the industry has recently changed its approach to some of these practices, industry watchers say drug makers could advance their cause by also apologizing. “The companies should be saying, ‘We did lousy; we did not put our best foot forward,’” says Doug Wojcieszak, the founder of the Sorry Works! Coalition, a consultant group in Glen Carbon, Ill., that trains medical professionals in the art of apologizing. OPENLY apologizing also has the potential to turn a problem into a teachable moment for employees, thereby preventing a repeat occurrence, says Paul Levy, the chief executive of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. In 2008, a surgeon at his hospital mistakenly operated on the wrong side of a patient. The doctor and other hospital personnel apologized. And Mr. Levy publicly dissected the event on his blog, called “Running a Hospital.” The medical profession, he says, was initially hesitant to embrace contrition. But, he says, “as in any field, once you have a few leaders do it and the world doesn’t end and, in fact, is made better, then people tend to follow.”</text></article>

Pfizer will have the rights to develop Athersys's cells to treat inflammatory bowel disease, the companies are expected to announce on Monday. It will pay Athersys $6 million initially and up to $105 million in the future. The relatively small payment reflects that ''it's really early for cell therapy and there's more research to be done,'' said Ruth McKernan, chief scientific officer of Pfizer Regenerative Medicine, a unit created by the company about 18 months ago to develop treatments based on stem cells. Athersys's cells, derived from human bone marrow, have not yet been tested in people with inflammatory bowel disease, a term that encompasses ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. But the product, called MultiStem, is in early human testing as a treatment for heart attacks and for cancer patients receiving bone marrow transplants. Athersys, founded in 1995 and based in Cleveland, is publicly traded and still unprofitable. Its shares closed at $1 on Friday. Stem cells can form different types of tissue in the body. Pfizer and Athersys envision the cells being infused into patients not to replace damaged tissue but rather to produce various proteins that would help existing tissues heal or prevent them from being damaged. Stem cells derived from adult tissues, like MultiStem, are less ethically controversial than stem cells from human embryos. But MultiStem has been dogged by scientific controversy. The cells were initially developed at the University of Minnesota, which said they were multipotent adult progenitor cells -- almost as versatile as embryonic cells. But some scientists had trouble replicating those findings, and some papers published by the Minnesota researchers were retracted or corrected. Dr. McKernan said that those controversies were ''in the past now'' and that scientists have been able to replicate the findings. Big pharmaceutical companies have been cautious about stem cells because of the ethical controversies and the early stage of the research. Also, some cell-based therapies must be tailored to each patient, a departure from the business model of producing one-size-fits-all pills. But as the science of stem cells has advanced, drug companies are taking an interest. Pfizer is also developing a stem-cell treatment for macular degeneration, an eye disease, working with University College London. It is doing research with Novocell, a San Diego company trying to turn embryonic stem cells into insulin-producing cells to treat diabetes. Novo Nordisk is working with Cellartis on stem-cell treatments for diabetes. Johnson &amp; Johnson has invested in Novocell and Tengion, another regenerative medicine company. GlaxoSmithKline is providing $25 million to Harvard's stem-cell institute. And Novartis and Roche have invested in Cellerix, a Spanish stem-cell company.</text></article>

But creating a blockbuster quality-of-life drug like Viagra involves more than just being innovative or being first. Sometimes it requires a drug maker to create and market a whole new category of disease. The template goes something like this: Start with a legitimate quality-of-life issue  like fitful sleep or shyness  that does not yet have its own prescription medication and is debilitating to a few people a lot of the time. Next, position the quality-of-life issue as a medical condition with symptoms so common it covers vast numbers of people who had previously not identified themselves as having a health problem, or who thought they were just experiencing an occasional and normal annoyance. Articles in medical journals with high estimates on the prevalence of the issue help convince doctors and journalists of its scope. F.D.A. approval of the new drug legitimizes the condition as a problem with a medical solution. The uncertainty for drug makers as this kind of script plays out is whether doctors and the public will buy into a hitherto unrecognized disease, said Alan Cassels, a pharmaceutical policy researcher at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. “Marketers know you don’t sell the steak, you sell the sizzle,” said Mr. Cassels, the co-author of “Selling Sickness: How the World’s Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies Are Turning Us All Into Patients.” With premature ejaculation drugs, he said, “It will come down to convincing physicians that this is a serious disease and convincing most men that, if they have unsatisfactory intercourse and they don’t last up to a minute, they have a medical problem.” Premature ejaculation can be extremely distressing for men, said Dr. Wayne J. G. Hellstrom, a professor of urology at the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. “They don’t usually last in their relationships,” said Dr. Hellstrom, who has consulted for Johnson &amp; Johnson. The International Society for Sexual Medicine, a professional association, has developed a definition for premature ejaculation. It is a condition “characterized by ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute of vaginal penetration,” and which is accompanied by feelings of distress and lack of control. Sciele’s spray-on drug contains lidocaine and prilocaine, which act on sensory nerve endings in the penis, said Dr. Mike Wiley, director of urology for Sciele. The company studied the product on several hundred men who had a typical ejaculation time of about 36 seconds, Dr. Wiley said. After using the product, the typical time from penetration to ejaculation was about 2.6 minutes  about a two minute increase. While there is no doubt that some men are distressed about their inability to control their orgasms, there is little concrete evidence to suggest that there is an epidemic of premature ejaculation. In response to a query from this reporter, a public relations representative for Sciele sent material to back up the claim that one in three American men suffer from this affliction. One study, a 1999 report on sexual dysfunction in the United States, has been disputed by some sexologists because it was based on a sociology survey from 1992 that included questions about issues like fidelity  but was not created by epidemiologists to answer sexual health questions.

Some medical associations said so. Many gynecologists and physicians said so. Respected medical journals said so, too. Along the way, television commercials positioned hormone drugs as treatments for more than hot flashes and night sweats -- just two of the better-known symptoms of menopause, which is technically defined as commencing one year after a woman's last menstrual cycle. One commercial about estrogen loss by the drug maker Wyeth featured a character named Dr. Heartman in a white coat discussing research into connections between menopause and heart disease, Alzheimer's disease and blindness. ''When considering menopause, consider the entire body of evidence,'' Dr. Heartman said. ''Speak to your doctor about what you can do to help protect your health during and after menopause.'' Connie Barton, then a medical office assistant in Peoria, Ill., was one woman who responded to such messages. She says she took Prempro, a hormone drug made by Wyeth, from 1997, when she was 53, until 2002, when she received a diagnosis of breast cancer. As part of her cancer treatment, she had a mastectomy to remove her left breast. Now Ms. Barton, who said in an interview that she used Prempro in part because her doctor told her it could help prevent heart disease and dementia, is one of more than 13,000 people who have sued Wyeth over the last seven years, claiming in courts across the country that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer and other problems. The suits also assert, based on recently unsealed court documents, that Wyeth oversold the benefits of menopausal hormones and failed to properly warn of the risks. In October, a jury in a Pennsylvania state court awarded Ms. Barton $75 million in punitive damages from Wyeth on top of compensatory damages of $3.75 million. The drug giant Pfizer, which absorbed Wyeth and its hormone drugs in a merger this year, says that Prempro is a safe, federally approved drug that did not cause Ms. Barton's breast cancer. Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, says Wyeth acted responsibly by including a clear warning about a breast cancer risk on Prempro labels and by updating the warning as new evidence emerged. Mr. Loder also notes that Pfizer plans to appeal every product-liability case on menopausal drugs it loses, including Ms. Barton's. While Wyeth has faced periodic complaints about its blockbuster menopause drugs, the latest lawsuits have turned the company's menopausal hormone franchise into the kind of case study dissected at Ivy League business schools. Lawyers have made some documents public in the suits, and The New York Times and the nonprofit Public Library of Science filed successful motions to unseal thousands of documents in July. To be sure, even some doctors who think hormone therapy has risks say it is the most effective treatment for symptoms directly associated with menopause. The documents that have surfaced in the Wyeth cases offer a rare glimpse inside the file cabinets and hard drives of a major drug company. And the cases demonstrate the importance of litigation in detailing exactly how drug makers operate their businesses, says Dr. Jerome L. Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who has written about the subject in The Journal of the American Medical Association. ''The information coming out in litigation helps us understand how a belief in a 'protective benefit' of estrogens on the heart was able to spread like wildfire through the medical community,'' says Dr. Avorn, who is not involved in the Wyeth litigation. ''Thousands of doctors prescribed the drugs for millions of women on that basis,'' he says, adding that studies later contradicted the belief. ''It will be very interesting to see whether the courts are able to connect the dots and make it clear whether this was a kind of medical ventriloquism on Wyeth's part.'' PREMPRO is a combination of Premarin, an estrogen drug derived from the urine of pregnant mares and first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1942, with an additional hormone, progestin.</text></article>

Pfizer said Tuesday that it had licensed the worldwide rights to a treatment for Gaucher disease, a rare genetic disorder, from Protalix Biotherapeutics, an Israeli biotechnology company. The deal signals the start of an effort by Pfizer to enter the business of selling ultra-expensive drugs for ultra-rare diseases, a market that big pharmaceutical companies once largely ignored. And the move will put the company into direct competition with Genzyme, the biotechnology company that already sells a drug called Cerezyme to treat Gaucher disease. Genzyme has been struggling to recover from a severe shortage of Cerezyme brought about by manufacturing problems. Pfizer will pay Protalix $60 million initially and up to $55 million later. The companies will split expenses to market the drug and the revenue from its sales on a 60-40 basis, with Pfizer having the larger share. Protalix is close to filing its application for federal approval of the drug. The product, called taliglucerase alfa, could reach the market next year. Although analysts viewed the deal as a validation of Protalix's drug and its novel manufacturing process, shares of Protalix fell nearly 14 percent, to $8.51, apparently because investors were disappointed that Pfizer did not acquire the company. Pfizer's shares rose nearly 4 percent, to $18.85. Protalix makes proteins that serve as drugs in genetically engineered carrot cells that grow inside plastic bags. That is far less costly, it says, than the process used by most biotechnology companies, including Genzyme, which is to use genetically engineered hamster ovary cells growing in stainless steel tanks. That will probably mean that Protalix's taliglucerase will be cheaper than Cerezyme, though executives at Pfizer and Protalix declined to discuss the price on Tuesday. Big pharmaceutical companies once tended to disregard rare diseases, preferring to develop blockbusters for common ailments like diabetes and high cholesterol. But with sales growth slowing and older blockbusters losing patent protection, the companies have become more willing, even eager, to sell specialized drugs. ''This is the first step in the pursuit of a formal strategy around orphan drugs and rare diseases,'' David Simmons, president of Pfizer's established products business unit, said in an interview. While there might be few patients with each disease, he said, ''collectively, it's a very large patient population with a great unmet medical need.'' Besides, Genzyme has proved that even a drug for a rare disease can generate big sales if the price of the drug is high enough. Only about 5,700 people in the world are being treated with Cerezyme. But since the drug costs about $200,000 a patient each year, sales exceeded $1 billion last year. Pfizer is not alone in pursuing treatments for rare diseases. In October, GlaxoSmithKline announced a deal with Prosensa, a Dutch company, to develop drugs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And in June, Novartis won approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell its drug Ilaris as a treatment for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome. Only about 300 Americans suffer from that syndrome, an inflammatory condition caused by a gene mutation. Philip Nadeau, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Company, called the entrance of Pfizer as a competitor a ''modest negative'' for Genzyme. However, Mr. Nadeau said, ''even Pfizer's marketing prowess is unlikely to relieve'' safety concerns some doctors have about the Protalix drug. The main concern is that because it is produced in plant cells, taliglucerase may spur immune reactions in some patients. Genzyme's stock rose a bit less than 1 percent, to $51.11. The company announced Monday that it had resumed shipping some newly manufactured Cerezyme. Manufacturing had been shut down in June after a virus contaminated the company's factory in Boston. The shortfall left Genzyme vulnerable to Protalix and also to Shire, a British drug company that is also developing a drug for Gaucher disease. Because of the shortage, the Food and Drug Administration has been allowing some patients to use the Shire and Protalix drugs even though they have not been approved. Gaucher disease is an enzyme deficiency that can cause an enlarged liver and spleen, anemia, frequent bleeding and bone weakness. All three drugs consist of the enzyme that people with Gaucher disease are missing.</text></article>

Related Public Database Is Urged to Monitor Drug Safety (November 24, 2009) Times Topics: Pfizer Inc. Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Wyeth Go to your Portfolio » A jury reached a $28 million judgment in one of the women’s cases on Monday, while a judge unsealed a month-old $75 million judgment in the other case. The earlier finding of punitive damages had been sealed to avoid prejudicing the second jury in the same courthouse. Pfizer said it would appeal the Philadelphia decisions, as it has in two similar cases it has lost elsewhere in the country. The company’s potential financial liability from such lawsuits remains uncertain. At least 1,500 other product liability suits have been filed over the hormone drugs in the Philadelphia court, lawyers said, and a total of more than 10,000 around the country. Wall Street analysts, though, said the latest judgments would have little effect on Pfizer unless the punitive damages were upheld on appeal. “At this point, it doesn’t concern me too much,” said Timothy Anderson, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. In stock trading Monday, Pfizer shares were up 17 cents, closing at $18.53, near their 52-week high. But plaintiffs’ lawyers say they are winning the overall legal battle over hormone therapy, contending they have secured financial settlements for undisclosed amounts in at least 10 other cases before the suits went to trial. The issue has become Pfizer’s by dint of its acquisition of two companies  Pharmacia in 2003 and Wyeth in January  that marketed the drugs as a standard, long-term hormone treatment for menopausal women, until medical evidence emerged indicating that such therapy raised women’s risk of breast cancer. The Philadelphia cases were filed there because Wyeth’s headquarters had been there. Esther E. Berezofsky, a lawyer for one of the women who won the awards in Philadelphia said Monday, “This is just the tip of the iceberg.” She said that in cases that had reached jury judgments, women with breast cancer had won damages in 10 of the 12 hormone drug cases, although many are on appeal. Ms. Berezofsky also said a federal appeals court decision in St. Louis this month had significantly improved plaintiffs’ chances of receiving punitive damages and winning appeals. In that decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit overturned an award of $27 million for an Arkansas woman, citing improper testimony by an expert witness. But the court ordered a new trial on punitive damages. The judges’ ruling said “there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could conclude that Wyeth acted with reckless disregard to the risk of injury.” Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company filed a motion last week asking the panel or the full appellate court to review that decision. The hormonal drugs are still used by millions of women to treat symptoms of menopause. But after estrogen was linked to breast cancer in 2002 by a federally financed research effort, the Women’s Health Initiative, the Food and Drug Administration added black-box warnings to the drugs’ labels, cautioning that they be used at the smallest possible doses for the shortest possible time. Sales of the drugs exceeded $2 billion a year before the 2002 study and then plunged, although they have regained some ground. Last year, $1.4 billion in estrogen drugs and nearly $400 million in estrogen-progestin combinations were sold in the United States, according to IMS Health, an industry consulting firm. Wyeth makes Premarin, which contains estrogen, and Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin. Pharmacia and Upjohn made Provera, a progestin hormone sometimes combined with estrogen. On Monday a jury in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court awarded $28 million in punitive damages to Donna Kendall of Decatur, Ill., whose breast cancer was found after she had taken hormone drugs for 11 years. The jury had already given her $6.3 million in compensatory damages. Punitive damages in Pennsylvania require a finding of “wanton and reckless” conduct. The jurors heard testimony that Wyeth paid consultants and ghostwriters of medical journal articles to play down concerns about breast cancer, as well as testimony that Pharmacia did not study known risks. The punitive award was split $16 million for Wyeth and $12 million for Pharmacia. After that ruling was made public, Sandra M. Moss, the judge who leads the complex litigation program at the Philadelphia court, unsealed a $75 million punitive damage award from last month in a case brought against Wyeth by Connie Barton of Peoria, Ill. She was also awarded $3.7 million in compensatory damages previously made public. Mr. Anderson, the Bernstein analyst, said it was significant and in Pfizer’s favor that the hormone products were still F.D.A.-approved. Other products whose makers have paid many billions of dollars in damages were withdrawn from the market, he said, citing Merck’s Vioxx, a painkiller that was linked to heart attacks and strokes, and American Home Products’ fen-phen, an antiobesity drug linked to heart and lung risks. “This isn’t nearly as clear-cut,” Mr. Anderson said. “And you have this more-difficult-to-prove breast cancer injury.” But Tobias L. Millrood, a lawyer for Ms. Kendall, said some of the jurors in Philadelphia told him and defense lawyers Monday that the evidence showed that the companies had clearly put profits over safety.

Mr. Millrood called on Pfizer to settle the cases. “It’s not a responsible reaction to keep these women on hold forever,” he said. Pfizer took the opposite view.

Related Public Database Is Urged to Monitor Drug Safety (November 24, 2009) Times Topics: Pfizer Inc. Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Wyeth Go to your Portfolio » A jury reached a $28 million judgment in one of the women’s cases on Monday, while a judge unsealed a month-old $75 million judgment in the other case. The earlier finding of punitive damages had been sealed to avoid prejudicing the second jury in the same courthouse. Pfizer said it would appeal the Philadelphia decisions, as it has in two similar cases it has lost elsewhere in the country. The company’s potential financial liability from such lawsuits remains uncertain. At least 1,500 other product liability suits have been filed over the hormone drugs in the Philadelphia court, lawyers said, and a total of more than 10,000 around the country. Wall Street analysts, though, said the latest judgments would have little effect on Pfizer unless the punitive damages were upheld on appeal. “At this point, it doesn’t concern me too much,” said Timothy Anderson, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. In stock trading Monday, Pfizer shares were up 17 cents, closing at $18.53, near their 52-week high. But plaintiffs’ lawyers say they are winning the overall legal battle over hormone therapy, contending they have secured financial settlements for undisclosed amounts in at least 10 other cases before the suits went to trial. The issue has become Pfizer’s by dint of its acquisition of two companies  Pharmacia in 2003 and Wyeth in January  that marketed the drugs as a standard, long-term hormone treatment for menopausal women, until medical evidence emerged indicating that such therapy raised women’s risk of breast cancer. The Philadelphia cases were filed there because Wyeth’s headquarters had been there. Esther E. Berezofsky, a lawyer for one of the women who won the awards in Philadelphia said Monday, “This is just the tip of the iceberg.” She said that in cases that had reached jury judgments, women with breast cancer had won damages in 10 of the 12 hormone drug cases, although many are on appeal. Ms. Berezofsky also said a federal appeals court decision in St. Louis this month had significantly improved plaintiffs’ chances of receiving punitive damages and winning appeals. In that decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit overturned an award of $27 million for an Arkansas woman, citing improper testimony by an expert witness. But the court ordered a new trial on punitive damages. The judges’ ruling said “there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could conclude that Wyeth acted with reckless disregard to the risk of injury.” Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company filed a motion last week asking the panel or the full appellate court to review that decision. The hormonal drugs are still used by millions of women to treat symptoms of menopause. But after estrogen was linked to breast cancer in 2002 by a federally financed research effort, the Women’s Health Initiative, the Food and Drug Administration added black-box warnings to the drugs’ labels, cautioning that they be used at the smallest possible doses for the shortest possible time. Sales of the drugs exceeded $2 billion a year before the 2002 study and then plunged, although they have regained some ground. Last year, $1.4 billion in estrogen drugs and nearly $400 million in estrogen-progestin combinations were sold in the United States, according to IMS Health, an industry consulting firm. Wyeth makes Premarin, which contains estrogen, and Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin. Pharmacia and Upjohn made Provera, a progestin hormone sometimes combined with estrogen. On Monday a jury in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court awarded $28 million in punitive damages to Donna Kendall of Decatur, Ill., whose breast cancer was found after she had taken hormone drugs for 11 years. The jury had already given her $6.3 million in compensatory damages. Punitive damages in Pennsylvania require a finding of “wanton and reckless” conduct. The jurors heard testimony that Wyeth paid consultants and ghostwriters of medical journal articles to play down concerns about breast cancer, as well as testimony that Pharmacia did not study known risks. The punitive award was split $16 million for Wyeth and $12 million for Pharmacia. After that ruling was made public, Sandra M. Moss, the judge who leads the complex litigation program at the Philadelphia court, unsealed a $75 million punitive damage award from last month in a case brought against Wyeth by Connie Barton of Peoria, Ill. She was also awarded $3.7 million in compensatory damages previously made public. Mr. Anderson, the Bernstein analyst, said it was significant and in Pfizer’s favor that the hormone products were still F.D.A.-approved. Other products whose makers have paid many billions of dollars in damages were withdrawn from the market, he said, citing Merck’s Vioxx, a painkiller that was linked to heart attacks and strokes, and American Home Products’ fen-phen, an antiobesity drug linked to heart and lung risks. “This isn’t nearly as clear-cut,” Mr. Anderson said. “And you have this more-difficult-to-prove breast cancer injury.” But Tobias L. Millrood, a lawyer for Ms. Kendall, said some of the jurors in Philadelphia told him and defense lawyers Monday that the evidence showed that the companies had clearly put profits over safety. Mr. Millrood and defense lawyers were allowed by a judge to talk with the jurors after the award was made. Mr. Millrood called on Pfizer to settle the cases. “It’s not a responsible reaction to keep these women on hold forever,” he said. Pfizer took the opposite view. Mr. Loder, the spokesman, said Wyeth and Pharmacia did nothing wrong and Pfizer would appeal all of its losses. “We feel very strongly that Wyeth and Pharmacia acted responsibly,” Mr. Loder said. “They provided accurate warnings, performed studies on benefits and risks, and kept the F.D.A. fully informed.”</text></article>

The city seized the land for a private “urban village” that was never built. Pfizer's complex is in the background. Enlarge This Image Photographs by Christopher Capozziello for The New York Times City Councilman Robert M. Pero said, “I'm sure that there are people that are waiting out there to say, 'I told you so.'” “Look what they did,” Mr. Cristofaro said on Thursday. “They stole our home for economic development. It was all for Pfizer, and now they get up and walk away.” That sentiment has been echoing around New London since Monday, when Pfizer, the giant drug company, announced it would leave the city just eight years after its arrival led to a debate about urban redevelopment that rumbled through the United States Supreme Court, and reset the boundaries for governments to seize private land for commercial use. Pfizer said it would pull 1,400 jobs out of New London within two years and move most of them a few miles away to a campus it owns in Groton, Conn., as a cost-cutting measure. It would leave behind the city’s biggest office complex and an adjacent swath of barren land that was cleared of dozens of homes to make room for a hotel, stores and condominiums that were never built. The announcement stirred up resentment and bitterness among some local residents. They see Pfizer as a corporate carpetbagger that took public money, in the form of big tax breaks, and now wants to run. “I’m not surprised that they’re gone,” said Susette Kelo, who moved to Groton from New London after the city took her home near Pfizer’s property. “They didn’t get what they wanted: their development, their big plan.” Ms. Kelo lived in a small pink house in the Fort Trumbull section that was square in the sights of city and state officials who wanted to revitalize the area. The city had created the New London Development Corporation to buy up the nine-acre neighborhood and find a developer to replace it with an “urban village” that would draw shoppers and tourists to the area. Economic development officials in Connecticut used that plan  and a package of financial incentives  to lure Pfizer to build a headquarters for its research division on 26 acres nearby. With an agreement that it would pay just one-fifth of its property taxes for the first 10 years, Pfizer spent $294 million on a 750,000-square-foot complex that opened in 2001. By then, Ms. Kelo, the Cristofaros and several neighbors had sued the city to stop it from using its power of eminent domain to take their property. The lawsuit, Kelo v. New London, wound up at the Supreme Court in 2005 as one of the most scrutinized property-rights cases in years. In a 5-to-4 decision, the high court ruled that it was permissible to take private property and turn it over to developers as part of a plan to bolster the local economy. Conservative justices, including Clarence Thomas, dissented. Justice Thomas called New London’s plan “a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation.” The decision was widely criticized, and spurred lawmakers across the country to adopt statutes to prevent similar uses of eminent domain. Scott G. Bullock, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group in Arlington, Va., said that 43 states had moved to protect private-property rights since the Kelo decision. New York and New Jersey are among the seven that have not, he said. Mr. Bullock, who represented the landowners in New London, said Pfizer’s announcement “really shows the folly of these plans that use massive corporate welfare and abuse eminent domain for private development.” “They oftentimes fail to live up to expectations,” he added. For its part, Pfizer said it had no stake in the outcome of the Kelo case nor any interest in the development of the land that was acquired by eminent domain, according to a statement provided by a spokeswoman, Liz Power. After Pfizer completed its $67 billion acquisition of Wyeth, another drug giant, in October, Ms. Power said, “We had a lot of real estate that we had to make strategic decisions about.” She said Pfizer would try to sell or lease its buildings in New London and would “continue to pay our taxes to the city as scheduled.” The complex is currently assessed at $220 million, said Robert M. Pero, a city councilman who is scheduled to become mayor next month. The company pays tax on 20 percent of that value and the state pays an additional 40 percent, Mr. Pero said. That arrangement is scheduled to end in 2011, around the time Pfizer, which is currently the city’s biggest taxpayer, expects to complete its withdrawal. “Basically, our economy lost a thousand jobs, but we still have a building,” Mr. Pero said. Then again, he added, “I don’t know who’s going to be looking for a building like that in this economy.” Some residents said they expected Pfizer to seek a revaluation of its buildings if they wind up vacant in two years; Ms. Power declined to comment. Mr. Pero said that he was offended that Pfizer did not notify city officials about the decision before Monday or give them a chance to argue against it or even fully understand it. But he said he did not regret the decisions he and other elected officials had made to bring Pfizer to New London for what they had hoped would be a long and fruitful stay. “I’m sure that there are people that are waiting out there to say, ‘I told you so,’ ” Mr. Pero said. “I don’t know that even today you can say, ‘I told you so.’ ” But Mr. Cristofaro and Ms. Kelo both said just that. Ms. Kelo, a nurse who works in New London and Norwich, Conn., said she was still bitter about the loss of her house, which she sold for $1 to Avner Gregory, a preservationist. Mr. Gregory dismantled the house and moved it across town. It now stands as a bright-pink symbol of the divisive dispute that drew so much attention to New London. “In all honesty, I’m not happy about what happened to me,” Ms. Kelo said.

The new company, ViiV Healthcare, will initially be 85 percent controlled by GlaxoSmithKline and 15 percent controlled by Pfizer. With headquarters in London, the company initially has a portfolio of 10 licensed drugs, including some of the earliest, like AZT and lamivudine, and later ones, like maraviroc, with combined sales of about $2.7 billion in 2008. It also has seven drugs in the pipeline. The companies say they will try to develop new drugs and new formulations of existing ones, like combination doses for children. ViiV Healthcare will also seek partnerships with other companies to develop multidrug cocktails. Some in the field were pleased. Dr. Jorge Bermudez, executive secretary of Unitaid, an agency based in Geneva that buys AIDS drugs for the poor, quickly invited ViiV to join its “patent pool” holding licenses on medicines so they can be made generically. But Mark Harrington, executive director of the Treatment Action Group and a longtime AIDS activist, was skeptical. Mr. Harrington said he worried that separating AIDS work from the larger companies could result, for example, in too little money for a big clinical trial. And the mergers of the last decade meant fewer scientists assigned to AIDS research. “We’d love to be proved wrong,” he said, “but we’re worried that fewer companies in the field could mean innovation is slowed down.” More Articles in Health » A version of this article appeared in print on November 10, 2009, on page D6 of the New York edition.Two of the world’s biggest drug makers last week spun off their divisions that manufacture AIDS drugs and combined them into one company focusing on the disease.

Pfizer, which makes the cholesterol treatment Lipitor, the impotence treatment Viagra and the smoking cessation drug Chantix, slashed costs in manufacturing and marketing, research and development and more to produce net income of $2.88 billion, or 43 cents a share. That was up from $2.28 billion, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company had a big legal charge over improper promotion of its painkillers. Sales fell 3 percent, to $11.62 billion, from $11.97 billion. Pfizer completed its $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth on Thursday and said it planned to continue cutting costs. The combined company is expected to eliminate nearly 20,000 jobs by the time integration is complete. Pfizer has cut 6,500 jobs so far this year. Pfizer said that, excluding one-time charges, earnings per share would have been 51 cents. Analysts were expecting 48 cents on revenue of $11.41 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Another drug maker, Biogen Idec, said its profit rose 34 percent in the third quarter, helped by increased sales of its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. The company said its profit rose to $277.6 million, or 95 cents a share, from $206.8 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time costs, Biogen said it earned $1.12 per share, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Revenue rose 3 percent, to $1.12 billion from $1.09 billion. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts expected a profit of $1.04 per share and revenue of $1.11 billion. Sales of Tysabri grew 21 percent, to $207 million, Biogen said. At the end of the quarter, 46,200 patients were using Tysabri, up from 43,300 at the end of the second quarter. Tysabri is used for multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease.</text></article>

Schumer, Democrat of New York, decided to share his personal experience in fighting high cholesterol. Mr. Schumer, top, said his doctor had directed him to take Lipitor, which is made by Pfizer, and then, after his cholesterol levels had dropped, suggested that he try a less expensive, generic medication. But he switched back after his cholesterol levels went back up. ''I'm taking Lipitor even though it's more expensive,'' Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer hastened to add that Pfizer has its headquarters in Manhattan -- a local shop, in other words. That prompted Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to suggest that Mr. Schumer try a more natural remedy: red yeast rice. ''I'll bring the pills for you tomorrow,'' he told Mr. Schumer. Presumably, Mr. Grassley, bottom, who hails from a state famous for corn, had no geographic interest in promoting a rice product. But the exchange inspired Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, to make a pitch for his own locally grown remedy for high cholesterol. ''Grapefruit might do the same thing for you,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''How about a pastrami sandwich?'' Mr. Schumer replied. ''How would that do?'' DAVID M. HERSZENHORN PHOTOS</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Abbott Laboratories Go to your Portfolio » Although advances in drug regimens since the 1990s have added nearly 20 years to the average life expectancy of a person with H.I.V./AIDS, the report card graded the drug makers overall with a below-average C-minus and recommended improvements. “There’s an opportunity now to kick it up a notch,” said Bob Huff, antiretroviral treatment director of the Treatment Action Group in New York and a board member of the rating group. Twenty-one members of the AIDS Treatment Activists Coalition, a nonprofit group formed in 2001, researched the drug companies, interviewed executives and assigned grades assessing performance over the last quarter century, Mr. Huff said. The companies were scored on research and development, pricing, patient assistance programs, marketing, and community relations. More than one million people in the United States are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, though only about half of them have been discovered and treated, the government says. Untreated, H.I.V./AIDS leaves people vulnerable to infections and cancers. While treatment reduces symptoms and extends life, there is no cure. The report gave its highest grade, a B, to Merck, for producing Isentress, the first of a new class of AIDS drugs called integrase inhibitors. It also praised Merck for freezing prices for lower income users. Isentress, approved in 2007, is already used by 11 percent of the more than 550,000 people treated in the United States, Michael S. Seggev, a spokesman for Merck, said Wednesday. “We’re very pleased to have achieved the highest grade on the report card,” he said. “They’re the most respected and most representative coalition of H.I.V. community groups in the U.S., so their opinion is very meaningful.” The group gave an F to Abbott for raising the wholesale price of Norvir, the first drug proved to increase survival in AIDS patients, by 400 percent in 2003. Norvir is a key ingredient in most AIDS treatment cocktails. The price increaes provoked an outcry by many patients and others. An Abbott spokesman, Dirk van Eeden, responded Wednesday, “The H.I.V. community is an important stakeholder for us, so yes, we do take notice of the comments they make.” He added, “We really believe we’ve discovered important medicines and played our part in making sure the patients who need it can get it.” Other grades included a B for Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, owned by Johnson and Johnson as a separate company focusing on infectious diseases; C-plus for Pfizer, which announced in April a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to spin off a company focused on H.I.V.; C-plus for Gilead Sciences; C-minus grades for Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline, both criticized for high prices; a D-plus for Boehringer Ingelheim; and a D for Hoffman LaRoche, which the coalition said has the most expensive drug on the market. Representatives for Pfizer, Gilead and Boehringer responded Wednesday that they valued the group’s opinion and continued their work in AIDS. Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline officials each said they were “disappointed” and deserved better grades. Other companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The coalition was to some degree biting the hand that feeds it. It receives all of its financing from drug companies, mostly for activists to travel to meetings with them. The executive director, Edward T. Rewolinski, disclosed specific amounts to The New York Times for the last two years. “None of our members has the wherewithal to afford this activity,” he said. “People like that would never be influenced by the flow of money,” Jennifer Flynn, managing director of an unrelated AIDS group, Health GAP, in New York, said. The top fund provider was Gilead with $100,000, followed by Pfizer, $63,000; Bristol-Myers Squibb, $50,000; Tibotec, $45,000; Merck, $15,000; and Boehringer, $5,000. Abbott gave no money. Mr. Huff said the grading group was insulated from financing requests. “There’s no sugarcoating,” he said. “The membership feels that the pharmaceutical industry can be doing a much better job, whether it’s innovation or pricing.” The coalition was formed in 2001 partly to coordinate contacts with drug companies instead of letting the industry decide whom to invite to meetings.

Seggev, a spokesman for Merck, said Wednesday. “We’re very pleased to have achieved the highest grade on the report card,” he said. “They’re the most respected and most representative coalition of H.I.V. community groups in the U.S., so their opinion is very meaningful.” The group gave an F to Abbott for raising the wholesale price of Norvir, the first drug proved to increase survival in AIDS patients, by 400 percent in 2003. Norvir is a key ingredient in most AIDS treatment cocktails. The price increaes provoked an outcry by many patients and others. An Abbott spokesman, Dirk van Eeden, responded Wednesday, “The H.I.V. community is an important stakeholder for us, so yes, we do take notice of the comments they make.” He added, “We really believe we’ve discovered important medicines and played our part in making sure the patients who need it can get it.” Other grades included a B for Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, owned by Johnson and Johnson as a separate company focusing on infectious diseases; C-plus for Pfizer, which announced in April a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to spin off a company focused on H.I.V.; C-plus for Gilead Sciences; C-minus grades for Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline, both criticized for high prices; a D-plus for Boehringer Ingelheim; and a D for Hoffman LaRoche, which the coalition said has the most expensive drug on the market. Representatives for Pfizer, Gilead and Boehringer responded Wednesday that they valued the group’s opinion and continued their work in AIDS. Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline officials each said they were “disappointed” and deserved better grades. Other companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The coalition was to some degree biting the hand that feeds it. It receives all of its financing from drug companies, mostly for activists to travel to meetings with them. The executive director, Edward T. Rewolinski, disclosed specific amounts to The New York Times for the last two years. “None of our members has the wherewithal to afford this activity,” he said. “People like that would never be influenced by the flow of money,” Jennifer Flynn, managing director of an unrelated AIDS group, Health GAP, in New York, said. The top fund provider was Gilead with $100,000, followed by Pfizer, $63,000; Bristol-Myers Squibb, $50,000; Tibotec, $45,000; Merck, $15,000; and Boehringer, $5,000. Abbott gave no money. Mr. Huff said the grading group was insulated from financing requests. “There’s no sugarcoating,” he said. “The membership feels that the pharmaceutical industry can be doing a much better job, whether it’s innovation or pricing.” The coalition was formed in 2001 partly to coordinate contacts with drug companies instead of letting the industry decide whom to invite to meetings.</text></article>

City of New London — though much like the legal case itself, the court’s role is virtually incidental to the tale. That’s because long before the court determined in 2005 that a town in Connecticut could use the “takings clause” of the Fifth Amendment to seize private homes in order to transform a lunch-pail community into a hip urban center, this case had been tried and decided in the court of made-for-TV movies. The story of a little pink house in New London and its determined owner launched a thousand enraged editorials, galvanized a movement to condemn Justice David Souter’s New Hampshire home and eventually led more than 40 state legislatures to change their laws on eminent domain. Throughout this ruckus, the court’s actual opinion was so much constitutional wallpaper. Skip to next paragraph LITTLE PINK HOUSE A True Story of Defiance and Courage By Jeff Benedict Illustrated. 397 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $26.99 “Little Pink House” is the story of Susette Kelo, who left a loveless marriage in 1997 to renovate a tiny Victorian water­front house. Kelo quickly found herself on the wrong end of an ambitious plan to turn her neighborhood into a vast corporate playground for Pfizer Inc., complete with a luxury hotel, a health club and sleek condos. The investigative reporter Jeff Benedict has decided to cast Kelo in the style of Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich. But this comes at some journalistic cost: by the time he’s finished introducing us to his protagonist (who “had a body that defied the fact that she had delivered five children. Her fiery red hair ran all the way down to her waist”), he risks having written the world’s first bodice-ripper about the takings clause. Still, Benedict has pieced together a fascinating narrative, using e-mail messages, planning documents, interviews and personal diaries to produce a sordid account of ruthless local politicians working hand-in-medical-glove with big business to drive hard-working Americans from their homes. Susette Kelo’s reluctant transformation from shy nursing student to national property rights hero contrasts strikingly with the Cruella De Vil machinations of Claire Gaudiani, the head of the New London Development Corporation. In Benedict’s telling, Gaudiani’s penchant for seductive clothing and academic doublespeak makes her a perfect foil for the naïve Susette. Cutting deals with local politicians, Pfizer executives and the governor’s office, Gaudiani is the face of progress at any cost. Benedict strives for balance, but balance here consists of toggling back and forth between Kelo’s story and that of the powerful interests seeking to crush her. The law itself barely gets a walk-on bit, with the Supreme Court’s analysis of the case accorded less than a paragraph. To be sure, Benedict notes that Connecticut law puts property owners at a disadvantage in disputes of this sort. But echoing the Institute for Justice, the Washington law firm that fought Kelo’s case largely in the national media, he persistently frames legal questions as epic battles between haves and have-nots, between passionate humans and out-of-touch jurists. This is a legal edifice built not on case law and precedent, but on the vague sense that courts should always vote for the good guys. As a story about injustice, “Little Pink House” is a success. Nobody can be immune to the plucky redhead, the zany deli owner or the terrified senior citizens, battling to live quietly in the homes they love. But to the extent that this is a story about the justice system, it’s built on preconceptions about the cold inhumanity of the law. With little regard for the possibility that judges might base decisions on cases and state statutes, Benedict implies it was judicial whim or ideology that knocked down Kelo’s community, and that by failing to vote for Kelo the justice system betrayed her. Pitting an all-too-human Susette Kelo against the heartless “five strangers in black robes” is a convenient frame for the narrative. It’s also a dangerous one, as Kelo herself learned when, in the swirl of publicity surrounding the decision, she began getting calls from militia groups offering to help protect her home with guns. After almost a decade of fighting, Kelo’s little pink house was disassembled and relocated to a different hilltop with a different water view. It’s hardly a story­book ending, but then so few cases that end up at the Supreme Court can boast one of those. Perhaps it’s better for everyone that, faced with the choice between delivering made-for-TV resolutions and dispassionately applying state law, courts generally seek to apply the law.

Grassley to Pfizer about Harvard Medical School (pdf) Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » The senator, an Iowa Republican who is investigating the drug industry’s influence on the practice of medicine, also asked for any Pfizer e-mail, faxes, letters or photos regarding Harvard medical students who have protested drug company influence. Mr. Grassley, in a letter to Pfizer, wrote that he was “greatly disturbed” to read an article in The New York Times on Tuesday describing a Pfizer representative taking cellphone photographs of the medical students last October at a campus demonstration against industry influence. “I find this troubling as I have documented several instances where pharmaceutical companies have attempted to intimidate academic critics of drugs,” he wrote. The request for information about Pfizer payments to Harvard Medical faculty members in the last two years expands Mr. Grassley’s investigation of industry payments to three Harvard psychiatrists who had promoted antipsychotic medicines for children. According to records Mr. Grassley obtained from drug companies, the professors were accused of not properly reporting at least $4.2 million in payments from 2000 to 2007. One of them has been suspended from conducting clinical trials. The investigation continues. A Pfizer spokesman said on Tuesday that the company “will fully cooperate with Senator Grassley’s request for information.” The spokesman, Ray Kerins, said Pfizer regrets if the photograph taken by the sales representative “was offensive to anyone involved,” but believes the company has acted legally and ethically and that collaboration with medical schools is “a valuable source of innovation and scientific advancement.” David Cameron, spokesman for Harvard Medical School, said in an e-mail message, “We are unable to provide comment on this matter." Mr. Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, asked Pfizer to provide details of faculty payments since Jan. 1, 2007, and communications regarding the students since Jan. 1, 2008, to be delivered to him by next Wednesday. At the October demonstration, which involved about 50 Harvard Medical students and was sponsored by the American Medical Student Association, some protesters saw a man photographing them with a cellphone. He later identified himself as a Pfizer representative but did not give his name. David Tian, one of the students, photographed the man and said he worried that the man had been sending photos to Pfizer. Mr. Kerins said recently that the man had told him the photos were for the man’s personal use. Mr. Kerins said the man, whom he declined to name, had done nothing improper. Harvard policy prohibits drug representatives from interacting with students on the medical campus but does not bar them from the campus or from taking photographs. The dean of the medical school, Dr. Jeffrey S. Flier, recently appointed a 19-member committee to review the school’s financial conflict of interest policies. Its first meeting, which will not be public, is planned for Thursday. The American Medical Student Association, in a national survey of medical schools last year, gave the Harvard Medical School an F grade for how well it controlled drug company payments to faculty members. Dr. Flier said Harvard deserved an “incomplete” rather than an F because it had not submitted paperwork to the association. But the students said they had based their grade on Harvard’s published policies. The Times reported Tuesday that Harvard officials had said about 1,600 of the medical school’s 8,900 professors and lecturers informed the dean that they or a relative had a financial interest in a business related to their teaching, research or clinical care. The faculty disclosures do not specify how much money they receive, nor are they public.

Mr. Zerden later discovered something by searching online that he began sharing with his classmates. The professor was not only a full-time member of the Harvard Medical faculty, but a paid consultant to 10 drug companies, including five makers of cholesterol treatments. “I felt really violated,” Mr. Zerden, now a fourth-year student, recently recalled. “Here we have 160 open minds trying to learn the basics in a protected space, and the information he was giving wasn’t as pure as I think it should be.” Mr. Zerden’s minor stir four years ago has lately grown into a full-blown movement by more than 200 Harvard Medical School students and sympathetic faculty, intent on exposing and curtailing the industry influence in their classrooms and laboratories, as well as in Harvard’s 17 affiliated teaching hospitals and institutes. They say they are concerned that the same money that helped build the school’s world-class status may in fact be hurting its reputation and affecting its teaching. The students argue, for example, that Harvard should be embarrassed by the F grade it recently received from the American Medical Student Association, a national group that rates how well medical schools monitor and control drug industry money. Harvard Medical School’s peers received much higher grades, ranging from the A for the University of Pennsylvania, to B’s received by Stanford, Columbia and New York University, to the C for Yale. Harvard has fallen behind, some faculty and administrators say, because its teaching hospitals are not owned by the university, complicating reform; because the dean is fairly new and his predecessor was such an industry booster that he served on a pharmaceutical company board; and because a crackdown, simply put, could cost it money or faculty. Further, the potential embarrassments  a Senate investigation of several medical professors, the F grade, a new state law effective July 1 requiring Massachusetts doctors to disclose corporate gifts over $50  are only now adding to pressure for change. The dean, Dr. Jeffrey S. Flier, who says he wants Harvard to catch up with the best practices at other leading medical schools, recently announced a 19-member committee to re-examine his school’s conflict-of-interest policies. The group, which includes three students, is to meet in private on Thursday. Advising the group will be Dr. David Korn, a former dean of the Stanford Medical School who started work at Harvard about four months ago as vice provost for research. Last year he helped the Association of American Medical Colleges draft a model conflict-of-interest policy for medical schools. The Harvard students have already secured a requirement that all professors and lecturers disclose their industry ties in class  a blanket policy that has been adopted by no other leading medical school. (One Harvard professor’s disclosure in class listed 47 company affiliations.) “Harvard needs to live up to its name,” said Kirsten Austad, 24, a first-year Harvard Medical student who is one of the movement’s leaders. “We are really being indoctrinated into a field of medicine that is becoming more and more commercialized.” David Tian, 24, a first-year Harvard Medical student, said: “Before coming here, I had no idea how much influence companies had on medical education. And it’s something that’s purposely meant to be under the table, providing information under the guise of education when that information is also presented for marketing purposes.” The students say they worry that pharmaceutical industry scandals in recent years  including some criminal convictions, billions of dollars in fines, proof of bias in research and publishing and false marketing claims  have cast a bad light on the medical profession. And they criticize Harvard as being less vigilant than other leading medical schools in monitoring potential financial conflicts by faculty members. Dr. Flier says that the Harvard Medical faculty may lead the nation in receiving money from industry, as well as government and charities, and he does not want to tighten the spigot. “One entirely appropriate source, if done properly, is industrial funds,” Dr. Flier said in an interview. And school officials see corporate support for their faculty as all the more crucial, as the university endowment has lost 22 percent of its value since last July and the recession has caused philanthropic contributors to retrench. The school said it was unable to provide annual measures of the money flow to its faculty, beyond the $8.6 million that pharmaceutical companies contributed last year for basic science research and the $3 million for continuing education classes on campus. Most of the money goes to professors at the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals, and the dean’s office does not keep track of the total. But no one disputes that many individual Harvard Medical faculty members receive tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year through industry consulting and speaking fees. Under the school’s disclosure rules, about 1,600 of 8,900 professors and lecturers have reported to the dean that they or a family member had a financial interest in a business related to their teaching, research or clinical care. The reports show 149 with financial ties to Pfizer and 130 with Merck. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 3, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.BOSTON  In a first-year pharmacology class at Harvard Medical School, Matt Zerden grew wary as the professor promoted the benefits of cholesterol drugs and seemed to belittle a student who asked about side effects.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image David Tian An October 2008 photograph of a Pfizer sales representative taking a picture of students on the Harvard Medical School campus demonstrating against pharmaceutical company influence. Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » That is why David Tian, a first-year Harvard medical student, said he found it “strange and off-putting” last fall when a man who identified himself as a Pfizer employee took a cellphone photo of students as they demonstrated against pharmaceutical industry influence on campus. “We could only assume he intended to share this with his company,” Mr. Tian said. The students did not get the man’s name, but they took his picture. Asked about the mysterious Pfizer man on campus and shown his picture, a company spokesman said he had recently contacted the employee and concluded that he had done nothing wrong. Declining to name him, the spokesman, Ray Kerins, said the employee had photographed the students for personal use. Mr. Kerins preferred to talk about Pfizer’s support of the medical school, which, according to Harvard officials, includes private payments to at least 149 faculty members, corporate donations of $350,000 to the school last year, $234,000 for continuing medical education classes, and two Pfizer-financed research projects on campus. “We’ve got top-class collaboration in place with leading medical institutions around the world, and we’re very proud of them,” Mr. Kerins said. Whatever the unidentified Pfizer representative was up to, Mr. Tian and other students said they saw him again two weeks after the campus protest, at a public lecture on campus about conflicts of interest in medical research.

Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » That is why David Tian, a first-year Harvard medical student, said he found it “strange and off-putting” last fall when a man who identified himself as a Pfizer employee took a cellphone photo of students as they demonstrated against pharmaceutical industry influence on campus. “We could only assume he intended to share this with his company,” Mr. Tian said. The students did not get the man’s name, but they took his picture. Asked about the mysterious Pfizer man on campus and shown his picture, a company spokesman said he had recently contacted the employee and concluded that he had done nothing wrong. Declining to name him, the spokesman, Ray Kerins, said the employee had photographed the students for personal use. Mr. Kerins preferred to talk about Pfizer’s support of the medical school, which, according to Harvard officials, includes private payments to at least 149 faculty members, corporate donations of $350,000 to the school last year, $234,000 for continuing medical education classes, and two Pfizer-financed research projects on campus. “We’ve got top-class collaboration in place with leading medical institutions around the world, and we’re very proud of them,” Mr. Kerins said. Whatever the unidentified Pfizer representative was up to, Mr. Tian and other students said they saw him again two weeks after the campus protest, at a public lecture on campus about conflicts of interest in medical research.

Drug industry analysts have fantasy mergers. In the pharmaceutical version of the game, analysts use balance sheets to project how big-league drug companies could acquire more nimble rivals. The goal is to enhance product rosters, while reducing costs by shedding redundant staff and operations. Dreaming up dream teams has become a popular sport since Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, said it would buy Wyeth last month in a deal valued at $68 billion. Meanwhile, the big Swiss drug maker Roche is engaged in a hostile tender offer for the 44 percent of the American biotechnology company Genentech that it does not already own. ''Cash is up but valuations are down,'' said David S. Moskowitz, director of research at Caris &amp; Company, an investment bank. ''We see this as a major year of consolidation.'' In interviews, a half-dozen analysts suggested that three other giants -- Merck, Sanofi-Aventis and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- could be in the takeover hunt. The most talked-about targets are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough. ''When you are trying to prognosticate, look for companies that are already collaborating, that already have a relationship with late-stage drugs or drugs that are already on the market,'' said Jason Napodano, an analyst with Zacks Investment Research. ''Then you buy 100 percent rights to the drug by buying the whole company.'' Merck is among the big pharmaceutical companies that are facing patent expirations on top-selling drugs with few promising prospects to replace them. The company, with a market value of about $60 billion, tops many analysts' lists as a potential acquirer. It has $6.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, according to the latest publicly available data. Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck, which makes the bone drug Fosamax and the Gardasil vaccine for the virus that can cause cervical cancer, did not dispute the prospects for a merger when asked about the company's plans during a recent conference call with analysts. ''There are opportunities across the whole spectrum that we look at,'' Mr. Clark said. In response to a reporter's query, a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail message that Mr. Clark was traveling and not available to elaborate. Analysts said it was simply a question of whether Merck would pursue a more traditional drug maker, like Schering-Plough, with which it already collaborates on cholesterol treatments and which has a market capitalization of about $29 billion. Or Merck might expand into another realm with a biotechnology company like Gilead Sciences, a $46 billion company that specializes in H.I.V. drugs. Among other big pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis have enough cash to be in the market for the kind of purchase that would help them restock product lines while reducing expenses through consolidation. But executives at those companies have all said they are not interested in megamergers. ''These big massive deals, I've been through two of them, and you're out of the picture for three or four years trying to get those bedded down,'' Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi's chief executive since December, said in a recent telephone interview. He was referring to his 20 years at GlaxoSmithKline during which he saw the company, originally SmithKline, merge with Beecham in 1989 and Glaxo Wellcome in 2000. ''Making companies so big is one of the reasons our research and development innovation went off,'' Mr. Viehbacher said. His plan, he said, is to increase Sanofi's research partnerships with outside companies and expand into generics, vaccines and over-the-counter drugs. As for medium-size companies, analysts said that Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca could be either buyers or sellers. But Lilly, with a market cap of about $37 billion, is still digesting its $6.5 billion purchase of ImClone five months ago, which may make it unlikely to buy anything else soon. David Brennan, chief executive of the $51 billion AstraZeneca, recently told reporters his hands were full cutting the work force while looking for small acquisitions. Mr. Moskowitz of Caris, among other analysts, said that likely takeover candidates included Schering-Plough and Bristol-Myers, because they have fewer drugs whose patents are lapsing and have a number of drugs in the mid or late stages of development.</text></article>

Kindler, did not have much time to celebrate. Skip to next paragraph Related In Wyeth, Pfizer Sees a Drug Pipeline (January 27, 2009) Wyeth Deal May Slow Pfizer Biotech Acquisitions (January 27, 2009) Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Wyeth Go to your Portfolio » There was too much gloomy news to deal with. The companies’ combined work force of 128,000 will shed 19,000 jobs. Pfizer will slash its stock dividend in half. And Pfizer is taking a $2.3 billion charge to settle a federal investigation over illegal off-label promotion of its former painkiller, Bextra. Investors celebrated Mr. Kindler’s big day by sending Pfizer’s stock down more than 10 percent. And yet, for Mr. Kindler, the Wyeth deal promises a big payoff. The combined company would be the fourth largest in the United States by market value based on Monday’s stock prices, which valued Pfizer at $105 billion and Wyeth at $57 billion. Only Exxon, Wal-Mart and Procter &amp; Gamble would be larger than Pfizer. And it gained control of a range of biotech drugs, vaccines, consumer products and research opportunities to try to fill the gaps in its own product pipeline. “This is not about a single product,” Mr. Kindler, 53, said at the news conference at Pfizer headquarters in Manhattan on Monday morning where the deal was formally announced. “It is about creating a broad, diversified portfolio of businesses, ones in which the people that are great at science can do what they do best and the people that are great at providing access to customers can do what they do best. And it is just such a perfect fit.” His counterpart, Bernard J. Poussot, 56, the Wyeth chairman, who appeared beside Mr. Kindler, also termed it a “perfect” fit. But it will be Mr. Kindler’s job to make it work. He will be chairman of the merged companies, which will be known as Pfizer, while Mr. Poussot is expected to depart if the merger is completed as planned this year. If the Pfizer-Wyeth deal had gone into effect last year, Mr. Poussot would have been entitled to about $38 million in cash severance, pension, health benefits and other perquisites. But because of changes the Wyeth board put in place on Jan. 1, the total value of the golden parachute is worth less than half that amount  an estimated $18.3 million. In many ways, Mr. Kindler, the Harvard-trained lawyer who has led Pfizer since July 2006, had spent the last two years preparing for a big deal. He has already cut $2.8 billion in costs and 15,000 jobs. He has turned research away from the cardiovascular medicines that helped make Pfizer a giant but whose fading glory is embodied in the $13 billion-a-year cholesterol drug, Lipitor, which will lose its United States patent in 2011. Now, if the deal is completed, Pfizer, which had sales of $48 billion in 2007, is looking forward to absorbing Wyeth, which is based in Morristown, N.J. As many big mainline pharmaceuticals companies face their own patent problems and the prospect of cheap generic competitors to their best-selling drugs, the Wyeth deal will help Pfizer smooth a potential patent “cliff” into a mere bump in the road, says Barbara Ryan, a Deutsche Bank analyst. A predicted 30 percent drop in revenue in four years will be only 10 percent at worst, she said. “This just has to happen in this industry,” Ms. Ryan said in an interview. “As a scale player, Pfizer can generate dramatically more earnings out of Wyeth than Wyeth can alone.” Two Pfizer chairmen before Mr. Kindler have made major acquisitions with grand ambitions, only to see them falter. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $90 billion in 2000 mainly to gain control of Lipitor, and it bought Pharmacia for $60 billion in 2003 to get the painkiller Celebrex. But Lipitor spawned no successor drug, and Celebrex sales plummeted after a similar drug, Vioxx, made by Merck, was linked to strokes and heart attacks. Mr. Kindler said the Wyeth purchase was different. “We have obviously learned a lot from our prior acquisitions,” he said, conceding they had “hurt morale and hurt productivity.” To make the Wyeth deal work, Mr. Kindler promised to cut $4 billion in combined spending by 2012 and to slash 15 percent of the companies’ combined work force. But he said he would do so “thoughtfully and being very careful to protect the core asset that makes both of these companies successful.” Pfizer also said Monday that it would cut its dividend in half, to 16 cents a share, partly to shore up credit ratings, as the company borrows $22.5 billion to help finance the deal from five banks  four of which recently received federal bailout money. “It’s good to see banks doing what banks are supposed to be doing,” Mr. Kindler said. “I think it is really good for America to support a competitive, strong, healthy, biopharmaceutical industry.” David Moskowitz, an analyst with Caris &amp; Company, praised the deal for its biotechnology drugs and vaccines from Wyeth and the cost-cutting potential of combined operations. In a note to investors Monday, he predicted an “exciting” year for pharma mergers and acquisitions, with Schering-Plough and Bristol-Myers Squibb being the most likely takeover targets. Timothy D. Anderson, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said he expected cost-cutting to be closer to $6 billion. “The next big pharma merger is likely to see a level of cost-cutting not seen before,” he wrote Monday to investors. Certainly, Wyeth and Pfizer employees were bracing themselves for deep cuts. Magid Abou-Gharbia, director of the Center for Drug Discovery Research at Temple University, who recently left Wyeth after 26 years as a scientist and manager, said he has been receiving calls from anxious Wyeth scientists. “I’m trying to be a calming factor,” Mr. Abou-Gharbia said in a telephone interview Monday. “Remind them that I went through three mergers at Wyeth, and after each one, the organization emerged stronger.” As investors digested Pfizer’s news, the stock fell 10.3 percent to $15.65 a share Monday. Wyeth held steady, down 0.8 percent to $43.39 after rising 12.6 percent Friday on the takeover rumor. Mr. Kindler defended the dividend cut, saying the Wyeth purchase gave “clarity” to future earnings. Pfizer also reported its fourth-quarter financial results, showing that revenue dropped 4 percent, to $12.35 billion, as it lost United States exclusivity for the allergy drug Zyrtec and the colon-cancer drug Comptosar. Excluding special charges, Pfizer said it would have earned 65 cents a share, up from 50 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier. But Pfizer’s earnings dropped by more than 90 percent, to $266 million, or 4 cents a share, after one-time charges  the biggest being the $2.3 billion set aside to settle the Justice Department’s Bextra case. The government had accused Pfizer of paying off doctors and making false and misleading claims about the drug to encourage its unsafe use for acute and surgical pain. The investigation has also expanded to the marketing and safety of other Pfizer drugs. A spokeswoman for Michael Sullivan, the United States attorney for Massachusetts, who is leading the investigation, did not return phone calls. Bextra was withdrawn by Pfizer in 2005. The company settled Bextra complaints from 33 states for $60 million last October and agreed to pay $894 million to settle suits over Bextra On any other day, the Bextra settlement might have been big news for Pfizer  which is why some analysts said the company had probably decided to disclose it on Monday. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: January 28, 2009 An article on Tuesday about Pfizer’s $68 billion acquisition of a rival drug maker, Wyeth, misstated the price of two previous Pfizer acquisitions.

Wyeth itself will also now be unlikely to buy other companies. On Monday, it withdrew from talks about buying Crucell, a Dutch vaccine maker, sending Crucell’s shares tumbling about 14 percent in Nasdaq trading. In deciding to buy one of its Big Pharma brethren, albeit one with considerable expertise in biotech drugs, Pfizer dispelled the hopes of some investors that it would acquire a major biotechnology company like Amgen or Biogen Idec. Amgen’s shares fell nearly 4 percent on Friday, when news of a possible Wyeth deal surfaced, while Biogen shares, also hurt by positive news about a competitor’s drug, fell 7 percent. Both stocks recovered somewhat on Monday. But Amgen and Biogen are big enough to fend for themselves. More precarious is the condition of many smaller biotechnology companies, those without revenue-producing products and profits. With capital markets frozen, many of these companies are running out of cash and looking to sell themselves or their products to a larger company. “There are probably 5,000 biotech companies out there that are waiting for a deal to save them,” said Oleg Nodelman, portfolio manager at the Biotechnology Value Fund, which invests in smaller biotechnology companies. Pfizer executives say they remain interested in alliances and deals. “We are going to continue to look at opportunities for innovative drugs and technology,” Corey S. Goodman, the president of Pfizer’s Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center in South San Francisco, Calif., said Monday. But others say the debt that Pfizer took on to buy Wyeth might preclude it in the short run from buying any but the smallest of biotech companies. And when two big companies merge, talks for deals with smaller companies tend to get put on the back burner, as management’s attention is diverted and the newly combined company assesses its research pipeline. “It will just drag people’s attention away, and they will want to do only the critical things,” said Jonathan MacQuitty, a partner at venture capital firm Abingworth. With small, unprofitable private biotech companies unable to go public, venture capitalists’ hope for a payout are typically based on selling the companies they start to pharmaceutical companies. Matt Geller of Geller Biopharm, a boutique investment bank, says that because Wyeth is so science-oriented, it has been seen as a good potential partner for smaller and middle-size biotechnology companies. “Unfortunately,” he said, “it does take a potential buyer of smaller biotech companies off the market.” Pfizer, on the other hand, had a reputation for paying top dollar for products or for smaller companies. It raised many eyebrows last September, for instance, when it agreed to pay $225 million initially, and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars later, for the rights to an Alzheimer’s disease drug being developed by Medivation, a San Francisco company. Pfizer is behind many of the other large pharmaceutical companies in moving into biologic drugs, which are made in living cells and are more immune to generic competition. But it is trying to make strides. In late 2007 it hired Mr. Goodman, an academic neuroscientist and biotechnology entrepreneur, to lead its move in that direction, in part by arranging alliances with smaller companies and with universities. To keep the operation nimble, Mr. Goodman reports directly to Mr. Kindler, the chief executive, and has a fair degree of autonomy. Some experts say Pfizer’s purchase of Wyeth might actually spur other pharmaceutical companies to buy biotechnology companies. One reason Pfizer was interested in Wyeth was the latter’s expertise in manufacturing biotech drugs and vaccines. “I think it’s just further evidence of how valuable these assets are,” said Kris Jenner, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund. “There are plenty of buyers outside of Pfizer who are interested in biotech assets.” Moreover, Pfizer’s ability to arrange $22.5 billion in debt financing from five banks for the Wyeth acquisition raises the chances that Roche will be able to raise the money it needs to acquire the 44 percent of Genentech that it does not already own. Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical giant, first proposed to pay $43.7 billion for those shares in July, an offer Genentech rebuffed as too low. Analysts expect Roche to raise its bid, but its difficulty in arranging financing has slowed negotiations. Big pharmaceutical companies are not the only ones who can buy companies or drugs. In some cases, mid-size biotech companies like Cephalon and Myriad Genetics are outracing larger companies to snap up some drugs. That is why Mr. Nodelman, at the Biotechnology Value Fund, said he did not expect the Pfizer-Wyeth deal to have much of a braking effect on acquisitions of small companies or their drugs. “All it means is there is one less company that might do a deal with them,” he said.

That is why Mr. Nodelman, at the Biotechnology Value Fund, said he did not expect the Pfizer-Wyeth deal to have much of a braking effect on acquisitions of small companies or their drugs. “All it means is there is one less company that might do a deal with them,” he said.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Related Your Money: Preparing Your Budget for Disaster (January 17, 2009) Add to Portfolio Sprint Nextel Corp Home Depot Inc Pfizer Inc Wyeth Sprint Nextel Corporation Go to your Portfolio » On Monday alone, companies across the employment spectrum announced more than 65,000 job cuts in the United States and around the world, a stark sign that businesses are enduring a painful, protracted downturn. Monday’s toll included 20,000 cuts at Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and mining machinery; 8,000 jobs at the wireless provider Sprint Nextel; 7,000 workers at Home Depot, and 8,000 from the expected merger of the pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and Wyeth. The beleaguered automaker General Motors announced that it would cut shifts at plants in Michigan and Ohio, where the downturn has hit hardest, eliminating some 2,000 jobs. And Texas Instruments said after the market closed on Monday that it would cut 3,400 jobs or 12 percent of its work force through 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 buyouts or retirements. In Europe, the banking and insurance group ING said it would cut 7,000 jobs; the electronics company Philips, 6,000; and the steel maker Corus, 3,500 worldwide. “We’re now into the danger zone,” said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight. “It really becomes pernicious because the uncertainty increases, corporate confidence is badly battered, and you get these severe measures being taken.” President Obama cited the layoff announcements in remarks Monday morning as he urged action on an $825 billion economic stimulus package of tax cuts, emergency benefits and public spending projects. “These are not just numbers on a page,” Mr. Obama said. “As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold. We owe it to each of them and to every single American to act with a sense of urgency and common purpose. We can’t afford distractions and we cannot afford delays.” The United States economy has dropped some 2.59 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, and unemployment rose to 7.2 percent last month. Economists worry that the economy could now be losing as many as 600,000 jobs a month, and they said Monday’s layoff announcements served to underline the stricken state of the labor market. Last week, the government reported that first-time unemployment claims had risen to 589,000 for the week ending Jan. 17, tying a record high set in December. The latest job cuts  and the additional announcements likely to come in a cascading pattern as job losses through the economy cause demand to shrink further and thus lead to more layoffs mean more pain for states, as unemployment insurance claims rise and deplete state coffers. The Obama administration has proposed setting aside $43 billion to help blunt the problem and provide for new recipients of unemployment insurance and existing ones. That money is intended to raise the weekly benefits, to extend how long people can collect those payments and to cover more types of workers, like part-timers. It is largely based upon an estimate that the unemployment rate will peak at 8.3 percent in 2010. But if unemployment reaches the double-digits, as some economists expect, the funding will almost certainly not be enough, economists say. “The economy is deteriorating at a faster clip than even the most dreary forecasts had expected,” said the economist Joseph Brusuelas. “At the current trend, $43 billion will not be sufficient, should we breach 9 percent unemployment and maybe reach into the double digits.” Monday’s announcements only added to a grim parade of job cuts from Wall Street to wireless providers to computer companies to retail stores. Last week, Microsoft announced it would cut 5,000 jobs over the next year and a half; Sony in Japan and Ericcson in Sweden each announced 5,000 layoffs; and the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said it was eliminating 1,000 jobs. Carmakers in Japan, South Korea and Europe have also cut jobs in recent months as did the cellphone maker Nokia. “It steepens the whole downturn,” said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. “The magnitude of these layoffs indicates that the downturn in the labor markets seems to be accelerating.” “This is a big deal,” said Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “We’re losing jobs at an incredibly rapid rate, and even with that, I’m worried they’re accelerating. We’re seeing a much more rapid rate of layoff announcements.” Caterpillar, which has been hurt by falling orders for construction and mining machinery, said Monday morning that it would cull 20,000 workers through layoffs and buyouts. It said it would make “sharp declines” in overtime and eliminate scores of temporary and contract jobs. The company said 2009 would be one of its weakest years since World War II. “These are very uncertain times,” the chief executive, James W. Owens, said in a statement. “While it’s painful for our employees and suppliers, it’s absolutely necessary given economic circumstances. We expect to have most of the actions needed to lower employment and cost levels in place by the end of the first quarter.” “We were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices,” Mr. Owens said. The wireless provider, Sprint Nextel, said its 8,000 job cuts were part of a plan to trim labor costs by $1.2 billion, and said most of the cuts would be completed by March 31. About 850 of the job cuts are expected to come through buyouts, which will cost the company $300 million in severance costs and related expenses. “Labor reductions are always the most difficult action to take, but many companies are finding it necessary in this environment," Sprint’s chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, said. Home Depot, the country’s largest home-supply chain, said it would cut 7,000 jobs, about 2 percent of its work force, and would close its higher-end Expo Design Center business, which includes 34 stores. Carol B. Tomé, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview that the company began exploring ways to save its Expo business months ago, but “as we kept looking at alternatives the business kept getting softer and softer.” With no sign of consumers cracking open their wallets anytime soon, executives simply realized, “we can’t fix it.” Stephanie Rosenbloom and Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.

The deal would not only create a pharmaceutical behemoth but would be a rarity in the current financial tumult: a big acquisition that is not a desperate merger of two banks orchestrated by the government. It would also be the first big merger backed by Wall Street in months. While credit has been notoriously tight of late, five banks have agreed to lend Pfizer $22.5 billion to pay for the deal. Pfizer, which has roughly $26 billion in cash, would finance the deal through the loans, some of its cash and stock. If the transaction is completed as planned, it would be the biggest merger since AT&amp;T and BellSouth combined in a $70 billion deal in March 2006, according to the research firm Capital IQ. The deal is expected to be announced Monday, the people involved in the negotiations said. The merger almost came unhinged at the 11th hour. While the boards of both companies agreed to the broad outlines of the deal and its price before the weekend, these people said, one issue was still a sticking point: whether Pfizer would be allowed to back out of the deal if the economy worsened or Wyeth's prospects faded. In better times, deals often falter on matters of strategy or price. But in this case, because of the ailing economy, Pfizer has agreed to pay a staggering breakup fee, $4.5 billion, if it does not complete the deal under certain circumstances -- if, for example, its credit rating drops and it can no longer finance the deal. That is almost twice the typical breakup fee for a deal of this size. If the acquisition is completed, it may demonstrate that Wall Street is willing to lend again, at least to the nation's top companies with the best credit ratings. ''If banks need to send a message that they're loaning, they want to be loaning to this quality of company,'' said Catherine Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse. Pfizer's bid is being financed by four banks that received federal bailout money: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the people involved in the deal said. Such banks have been criticized for not doing more lending since they received the government aid. Barclays, which acquired Lehman Brothers out of bankruptcy in the fall, is also providing financing, these people said. Pfizer appears to be taking advantage of the bad market for credit to buy Wyeth at a lower price than it might fetch if competing bids were to emerge, which analysts do not expect. ''They have a unique opportunity now because not everybody can get that capital,'' said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. Because the combined company is expected to generate more than $20 billion in cash a year, Ms. Ryan said, ''even when they borrow money, they will still have plenty of revenue.'' Under the terms of the deal, Pfizer would pay $50.19 a share for the company -- $33 a share in cash and 0.985 Pfizer shares worth $17.19 a share based on Pfizer's closing price on Friday. That is roughly a 29 percent premium over the share price before word of the deal leaked on Friday. Wyeth's management team would depart, the people involved in the negotiations said. Pfizer is also planning to cut its quarterly dividend in half to 16 cents, these people said, in an effort to maintain its credit rating. After news reports disclosed the talks on Friday, investors applauded the possibility of a deal. Shares of Wyeth rose $4.91, or 12.6 percent, to close at $43.74. Pfizer climbed 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $17.45. Pfizer expects to save $4 billion annually by combining with Wyeth; those savings will be phased in over three years. Pfizer's chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, first approached Wyeth last spring with a phone call, people involved in the talks said. The negotiations heated up in the summer but appeared to collapse when the banking system went into a tailspin in September and October.</text></article>

But Mr. Hardy is British, and the British health authorities refused to buy the medicine. His wife has been distraught. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Hazel Thompson for The New York Times Bruce and Joy Hardy of Ruislip, England, are awaiting a British agencys reconsideration of its rejection of a medicine sought by Mr. Hardy, a kidney cancer patient. The Evidence Gap Setting a Price on Life Articles in this series will explore medical treatments used despite scant proof they work and will consider steps toward medicine based on evidence. All Articles in the Series » Multimedia Graphic Drug Spending on the Rise Graphic The Cost of Care Enlarge This Image Steve Forrest/Insight-Visual, for The New York Times Dr. Michael Rawlins, the chairman of the agency, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. “Everybody should be allowed to have as much life as they can,” Joy Hardy said in the couple’s modest home outside London. If the Hardys lived in the United States or just about any European country other than Britain, Mr. Hardy would most likely get the drug, although he might have to pay part of the cost. A clinical trial showed that the pill, called Sutent, delays cancer progression for six months at an estimated treatment cost of $54,000. But at that price, Mr. Hardy’s life is not worth prolonging, according to a British government agency, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The institute, known as NICE, has decided that Britain, except in rare cases, can afford only £15,000, or about $22,750, to save six months of a citizen’s life. British authorities, after a storm of protest, are reconsidering their decision on the cancer drug and others. For years, Britain was almost alone in using evidence of cost-effectiveness to decide what to pay for. But skyrocketing prices for drugs and medical devices have led a growing number of countries to ask the hardest of questions: How much is life worth? For many, NICE has the answer. Top health officials in Austria, Brazil, Colombia and Thailand said in interviews that NICE now strongly influences their policies. “All the middle-income countries  in Eastern Europe, Central and South America, the Middle East and all over Asia  are aware of NICE and are thinking about setting up something similar,” said Dr. Andreas Seiter, a senior health specialist at the World Bank. Even in the United States, rising costs have led some in Congress to propose an institute that would compare the effectiveness of new medical technologies, although the proposals so far would not allow for price considerations. At the present rate of growth, medical costs will increase to 25 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product in 2025 from 16 percent, with half of the increase coming from new drugs and devices, according to the Congressional Budget Office. To arrest this trend, the United States needs to adopt at least some of NICE’s methods, said Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. Sean Tunis, who served earlier in the Bush administration as, respectively, administrator and chief medical officer of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. Tunis said he spent a lot of time in government “learning about NICE and trying to adopt the processes and mechanisms they used, and we just couldn’t.” That’s because the idea of using price to determine which drugs or devices Medicare or Medicaid provides has provoked fierce protests. But Dr. McClellan said the American government would soon have no choice. Drug and device makers, which once routinely denounced the British for questioning product prices, have begun quietly slashing prices in Britain to gain NICE’s coveted approval, especially because other nations are following the institute’s lead. Companies have said that they will consult with NICE to help determine which experimental compounds enter the final stage of clinical trials, so the British agency’s officials will soon influence which drugs enter the market in the United States. The British government created NICE a decade ago to ensure that every pound spent buys as many years of good-quality life as possible, but the agency is increasingly rejecting expensive treatments. The denials have led to debate over what is to blame: company prices or the health institute’s math. Dr. Michael Rawlins, chairman of NICE, blames the industry, saying that some companies raise prices “to get profits up so their executives can get better bonuses.” Dr. Karol Sikora, a prominent London oncologist, said that the institute’s math was flawed and that Dr. Rawlins had a “personal vendetta” against cancer treatments. Drug company executives who were interviewed uniformly promised to cooperate with NICE, but industry advocates were not so kind. Robert Goldberg, vice president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, an advocacy group financed by drug makers, likened Dr. Rawlins and his institute to terrorists and said their decisions were morally indefensible. Developing a Method It all started with Viagra. Pfizer’s introduction of the drug in 1998 panicked British health officials, who feared it would wreck the government’s health budget. So they placed restrictions on its use. Pfizer sued, claiming the government’s decision was arbitrary. To defend itself against similar claims, the government needed a standard method of rationing. The following year, NICE opened. Asked whether he thought the institute would succeed, Frank Dobson, the Labor health minister at the time, famously said, “Probably not, but it’s worth a bloody good try.” Britain’s National Health Service provides 95 percent of the nation’s care from an annual budget, so paying for costly treatments means less money for, say, sick children. Before NICE, hospitals and clinics often came to different decisions about which drugs to buy, creating geographic disparities in care that led to outrage.

Generic pills for high blood pressure, which had been in use since the 1950s and cost only pennies a day, worked better than newer drugs that were up to 20 times as expensive. Skip to next paragraph Briana Brough for The New York Times "The pharmaceutical industry ganged up and attacked, discredited the findings," said Dr. Curt D. Furberg, public health sciences professor at Wake Forest University and former chairman of the steering committee of the Allhat study. The Evidence Gap Comparing Remedies Articles in this series will explore medical treatments used despite scant proof they work and will consider steps toward medicine based on evidence. Previous Articles in the Series » Multimedia Graphic Hypertension Drugs, After Allhat Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » Lee Celano for The New York Times "There was a feeling there was a political and economic agenda as much as a scientific agenda," said Dr. Michael Weber, professor of medicine at the Health Science Center at Brooklyn and a former investigator in the Allhat study. The findings, from one of the biggest clinical trials ever organized by the federal government, promised to save the nation billions of dollars in treating the tens of millions of Americans with hypertension  even if the conclusions did seem to threaten pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer that were making big money on blockbuster hypertension drugs. Six years later, though, the use of the inexpensive pills, called diuretics, is far smaller than some of the trial’s organizers had hoped. “It should have more than doubled,” said Dr. Curt D. Furberg, a public health sciences professor at Wake Forest University who was the first chairman of the steering committee for the study, which was known by the acronym Allhat. “The impact was disappointing.” The percentage of hypertension patients receiving a diuretic rose to around 40 percent in the year after the Allhat results were announced, up from 30 to 35 percent beforehand, according to some studies. But use of diuretics has since stayed at that plateau. And over all, use of newer hypertension drugs has grown faster than the use of diuretics since 2002, according to Medco Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefits manager. The Allhat experience is worth remembering now, as some policy experts and government officials call for more such studies to directly compare drugs or other treatments, as a way to stem runaway medical costs and improve care. The aftereffects of the study show how hard it is to change medical practice, even after a government-sanctioned trial costing $130 million produced what appeared to be solid evidence. A confluence of factors blunted Allhat’s impact. One was the simple difficulty of persuading doctors to change their habits. Another was scientific disagreement, as many academic medical experts criticized the trial’s design and the government’s interpretation of the results. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies responded by heavily marketing their own expensive hypertension drugs and, in some cases, paying speakers to publicly interpret the Allhat results in ways that made their products look better. “The pharmaceutical industry ganged up and attacked, discredited the findings,” Dr. Furberg said. He eventually resigned in frustration as chairman of the study’s steering committee, the expert group that continues to oversee analysis of data from the trial. One member of that committee received more than $200,000 from Pfizer, largely in speaking fees, the year after the Allhat results were released. There was another factor: medicine moves on. Even before Allhat was finished, and certainly since then, new drugs appeared. Others, meanwhile, became available as generics, reducing the cost advantage of the diuretics. And many doctors have shifted to using two or more drugs together, helped by pharmaceutical companies that offer combination pills containing two medicines. So Allhat’s main query  which drug to use first  became “an outdated question that doesn’t have huge relevance to the majority of people’s clinical practices,” said Dr. John M. Flack, the chairman of medicine at Wayne State University, who was not involved in the study and has consulted for some drug makers. Dr. Sean Tunis, a former chief medical officer for Medicare, remains an advocate for comparative-effectiveness studies. But, as Allhat showed, “they are hard to do, expensive to do and provoke a lot of political pushback,” said Dr. Tunis, who now runs the nonprofit Center for Medical Technology Policy, which tries to arrange such trials. “There’s a lot of magical thinking,” he said, “that it will all be science and won’t be politics.” Expensive Pills Promising better ways to treat high blood pressure, drug companies in the 1980s introduced a variety of medications, including ones known as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors. Although there was no real evidence the newer pills were better, diuretics fell to 27 percent of hypertension prescriptions in 1992, from 56 percent in 1982. Use of the more expensive pills added an estimated $3.1 billion to the nation’s medical bill over that period. So the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, part of the federal National Institutes of Health, decided to compare the various drugs’ ability to prevent heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems. “This was a big-bucks issue,” said Dr. Jeffrey Cutler, the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s project director for the study. Allhat  short for the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial  began enrolling patients with high blood pressure, age 55 and older, in 1994, with more than 42,000 people eventually participating. Patients were randomly assigned one of four drugs: a diuretic called chlorthalidone; an ACE inhibitor called lisinopril, which AstraZeneca sold as Zestril; a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, sold by Pfizer as Norvasc; and an alpha blocker, doxazosin, which Pfizer sold as Cardura. Cardura was added only after Pfizer, which had already agreed to contribute $20 million to the trial’s costs, increased that to $40 million, Dr. Cutler said. Early Trouble Signs Pfizer’s bet on Cardura proved a big mistake. As the Allhat data came in, patients taking Cardura were nearly twice as likely as those receiving the diuretic to require hospitalization for heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood adequately. Concerned, the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute announced in March 2000 that it had stopped the Cardura part of the trial. What happened next provided the first signs that the Allhat evidence might not be universally embraced. 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 28, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.The surprising news made headlines in December 2002. Generic pills for high blood pressure, which had been in use since the 1950s and cost only pennies a day, worked better than newer drugs that were up to 20 times as expensive. Skip to next paragraph Briana Brough for The New York Times "The pharmaceutical industry ganged up and attacked, discredited the findings," said Dr. Curt D. Furberg, public health sciences professor at Wake Forest University and former chairman of the steering committee of the Allhat study. The Evidence Gap Comparing Remedies Articles in this series will explore medical treatments used despite scant proof they work and will consider steps toward medicine based on evidence. Previous Articles in the Series » Multimedia Graphic Hypertension Drugs, After Allhat Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » Lee Celano for The New York Times "There was a feeling there was a political and economic agenda as much as a scientific agenda," said Dr. Michael Weber, professor of medicine at the Health Science Center at Brooklyn and a former investigator in the Allhat study. The findings, from one of the biggest clinical trials ever organized by the federal government, promised to save the nation billions of dollars in treating the tens of millions of Americans with hypertension  even if the conclusions did seem to threaten pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer that were making big money on blockbuster hypertension drugs. Six years later, though, the use of the inexpensive pills, called diuretics, is far smaller than some of the trial’s organizers had hoped. “It should have more than doubled,” said Dr. Curt D. Furberg, a public health sciences professor at Wake Forest University who was the first chairman of the steering committee for the study, which was known by the acronym Allhat. “The impact was disappointing.” The percentage of hypertension patients receiving a diuretic rose to around 40 percent in the year after the Allhat results were announced, up from 30 to 35 percent beforehand, according to some studies. But use of diuretics has since stayed at that plateau. And over all, use of newer hypertension drugs has grown faster than the use of diuretics since 2002, according to Medco Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefits manager. The Allhat experience is worth remembering now, as some policy experts and government officials call for more such studies to directly compare drugs or other treatments, as a way to stem runaway medical costs and improve care. The aftereffects of the study show how hard it is to change medical practice, even after a government-sanctioned trial costing $130 million produced what appeared to be solid evidence. A confluence of factors blunted Allhat’s impact. One was the simple difficulty of persuading doctors to change their habits. Another was scientific disagreement, as many academic medical experts criticized the trial’s design and the government’s interpretation of the results. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies responded by heavily marketing their own expensive hypertension drugs and, in some cases, paying speakers to publicly interpret the Allhat results in ways that made their products look better. “The pharmaceutical industry ganged up and attacked, discredited the findings,” Dr. Furberg said. He eventually resigned in frustration as chairman of the study’s steering committee, the expert group that continues to oversee analysis of data from the trial. One member of that committee received more than $200,000 from Pfizer, largely in speaking fees, the year after the Allhat results were released. There was another factor: medicine moves on. Even before Allhat was finished, and certainly since then, new drugs appeared. Others, meanwhile, became available as generics, reducing the cost advantage of the diuretics. And many doctors have shifted to using two or more drugs together, helped by pharmaceutical companies that offer combination pills containing two medicines. So Allhat’s main query  which drug to use first  became “an outdated question that doesn’t have huge relevance to the majority of people’s clinical practices,” said Dr. John M. Flack, the chairman of medicine at Wayne State University, who was not involved in the study and has consulted for some drug makers. Dr. Sean Tunis, a former chief medical officer for Medicare, remains an advocate for comparative-effectiveness studies.

Patients who had suffered a heart attack and were taking Vioxx, a painkiller that has been withdrawn from the market, had 2.7 times the risk of having another heart attack or dying compared with patients not taking painkillers, according to research presented Tuesday at the American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans. Patients taking Celebrex had double the risk; patients taking the generic diclofenac had 1.9 times the risk, and those taking ibuprofen had 1.3 times the risk, the study found. Based on the findings, doctors should avoid prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for these patients, or give them at low doses, a researcher said. Also Tuesday, researchers said that the risk of heart attacks and strokes for heart-stent patients taking the anti-clotting drug Plavix increased if they also took anti-ulcer medicines like Nexium. Doctors implant about two million stents a year and often prescribe blood thinners like Plavix, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, to avoid clots. But the drugs raise the risk of stomach bleeding, so they also prescribe Nexium, made by AstraZeneca, or a rival drug in a group known as proton pump inhibitors. About a third of these patients suffered complications within a year, the study said.</text></article>

The company made official a deal that would pay $60 million to settle investigations by 33 states and the District of Columbia over Bextra, while also agreeing to adopt compliance measures. Various states claimed that Pfizer promoted the painkiller for uses it was not approved for. While a physician is allowed to prescribe drugs for off-label uses, a company cannot market them for unapproved uses. States also contended that the company misrepresented the safety of the drug. Pfizer withdrew Bextra in 2005. As part of the settlement, Pfizer denied that its promotional practices violated any laws. Separately, Pfizer said it stood behind an antismoking drug, Chantix, which had been linked this year by the Food and Drug Administration to possible psychiatric problems. The company said it was unclear whether an increase in reports was because the problems were growing or because of a greater awareness of drug safety issues.</text></article>

Pfizer said it earned $2.3 billion, or 34 cents a share, in the latest quarter. That was up from $761 million, or 11 cents a share, a year ago. Its adjusted earnings amounts to 62 cents a share. That is 2 cents a share more than analysts surveyed by ThomsonReuters expected. The company says revenue slipped to $11.97 billion, from $11.99 billion a year ago. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $12.01 billion. The company, which makes Viagra, said United States sales of the cholesterol fighter Lipitor and some drugs with generic competition dropped sharply, but that other medicines sold well. Another drug maker, Schering-Plough, said Tuesday that third-quarter profit fell 23 percent on higher costs, but the results still beat Wall Street expectations on strong sales of the arthritis drug Remicade and gains in the international market. Schering-Plough, which is based in Kenilworth, N.J., earned $551 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with profit of $713 million, or 45 cents a share, during the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 63 percent, to $4.58 billion, from $2.81 billion. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges, the company said it earned 39 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected profit of 31 cents a share on revenue of $4.48 billion. The overall sales increase came despite a 15 percent drop in the company's cholesterol franchise. At Biogen Idec, the biotechnology company, third-quarter profit surged 73 percent on higher sales of the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri, topping Wall Street forecasts and prompting the company to raise its profit outlook for the year. Biogen hit a milestone in the quarter, topping $1 billion in revenue, despite what could have turned out to be a tough period. During the quarter, Biogen reported two new cases of a potentially fatal brain disease in Tysabri patients, but sales remained strong. The company earned $206.8 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with profit of $119.4 million, or 41 cents a share, during the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 38 percent to $1.09 billion from $789.2 million. Excluding restructuring and other charges, Biogen earned 98 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected profit of 90 cents a share on revenue of $1.01 billion. Sales of the company's multiple sclerosis drug Avonex, its lead revenue driver, rose 26 percent to $573 million in the third quarter, while Tysabri sales reached $236 million worldwide.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Mary Altaffer/Associated Press The painkiller Bextra was linked to a disorder that causes sloughing of the skin. Related Times Topics: Pfizer Inc. Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » Tim Boyle/Getty Images Celebrex is still being sold years after cardiovascular concerns were first raised. The announcement comes approximately one year after Merck announced a $4.85 billion reserve to settle litigation involving the similar painkiller Vioxx, which Merck pulled off the market in September 2004 after studies linked it to strokes and heart attacks. Pfizer withdrew Bextra seven months later, but left Celebrex on the market, contending that it was less dangerous  a decision that was supported by the Food and Drug Administration on the overwhelming recommendation of a federal advisory panel. In 2007, worldwide sales of Celebrex were $2 billion. In a news release announcing the settlement, Pfizer’s general counsel, Amy W. Schulman, said the agreements would allow the company to focus on its core business. “Inevitably, litigation can be distracting and putting these matters behind us should better enable physicians to consider Celebrex purely on the strength of its clinical data and its ability to meet the diverse needs of patients in pain.” Pfizer shares closed down 6 cents on Friday, at $16.91. Plaintiffs’ lawyers had filed lawsuits at the state and federal levels against Pfizer, claiming that both drugs had harmed people who took them. Pfizer would not disclose how many total cases it was settling or what percentage of them involved Bextra, but they were believed to be the large majority. In addition to cardiovascular risks associated with Bextra, it was linked to serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a debilitating and sometimes fatal disorder that causes sloughing of the skin. Cases involving the rare disorder, known as SJS, were not covered in the settlement agreements announced Friday; these cases have generally already been settled. The settlement Pfizer announced Friday follows two key court rulings in the last year that were favorable to the company, which is based in New York. In November 2007, United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer, in San Francisco, ruled that the plaintiffs had not offered adequate scientific proof that the 200-milligram dose of Celebrex  the most commonly prescribed dose  had caused heart attacks and strokes. As a result of that ruling and a similar state-level decision by New York Supreme Court Judge Shirley Kornreich, many lawyers dropped clients who claimed they suffered heart attacks or strokes after taking the 200-milligram dose. That meant that Pfizer’s Celebrex liability was limited, although some patients  those who had taken the 400-milligram dose  still had claims. Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra all belong to a category of drugs known as Cox-2 inhibitors. A large study led by doctors at the Cleveland Clinic and paid for by Pfizer is under way to determine whether Celebrex, the only drug in the Cox-2 inhibitor class that remains on the market, carries any more cardiovascular risk than other widely used painkillers. The drug’s labeling information currently includes a boxed warning of possible cardiovascular risks, but similar warnings are also required on two over-the-counter painkillers: ibuprofen, sold as Advil and other brands, and naproxen, of which Aleve is perhaps the best-known brand. Daniel Becnel, a plaintiff’s lawyer in Reserve, La., who represents more than 150 patients, said he was pleased with the Pfizer settlement. Pfizer had discussed settling many of the cases over the last two years, but Mr. Becnel said it was not until the Feinberg Group law firm got involved that settlement discussions began in earnest. The firm, based in Washington and New York, is known for its volunteer work assigning payments from the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund. Mr. Becnel said the Feinberg Group negotiated settlements with each lawyer involved in the case after reviewing medical records of their clients. “The Becnel group of settlements involves 150 people and each of those were negotiated individually,” he said. “After all the records were reviewed by their team of expert lawyers, we agreed to a settlement.” Perry Weitz, a Manhattan lawyer representing 1,700 clients, said the settlement was good for the claimants. “It means they’ll get their money sooner rather than later.” Pfizer said the $894 million charge, to be counted against third-quarter results, which are scheduled to be announced next week, would amount to $640 million after taxes. Some of that  the company did not disclose how much  will be recouped from insurance companies. The $894 million consists of $745 million to settle personal injury claims, $89 million related to consumer fraud claims, and $60 million to settle lawsuits brought by state attorneys general. As of the second quarter, the company had $26.3 billion in cash and short-term securities. When Merck last year agreed to settle the Vioxx claims, it reversed the company’s long-stated position that it would litigate every one of those cases. Approximately 57,000 people have filed claims that they were injured by Vioxx. About $100 million has been paid from that Merck fund so far.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Even Footing Related Health Sector Puts Its Money on Democrats (October 29, 2007) Blog The Caucus The latest political news from around the nation. Join the discussion. Election Guide | More Politics News Lobbyists and executives in the industry say the swing reflects the fact that Democrats control both houses of Congress, are expected to increase their majorities and may win the White House, giving them a dominant voice on health policy. “There’s a new world order,” Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said when asked why Democrats were getting more of the industry’s money. The figures illustrate the maxim that money follows power, all the more so since public programs account for a growing share of spending on prescription drugs: 34 percent in 2006, up from 23 percent in 2000. So the companies’ fortunes depend more than ever on government decisions, and leading Democrats have offered proposals that would further expand the role of the public sector in financing and delivering health care. The industry has shown strong Republican leanings in the past. While Democrats in Congress have severely criticized drug makers and health insurance companies, Republicans have worked closely with them on many issues, fending off countless proposals for stricter regulation. But a new trend in campaign contributions emerges from data reported by Pfizer, Amgen, Johnson &amp; Johnson, other companies and their trade associations. In the 2008 election cycle, pharmaceutical companies  their employees and political action committees  have donated $20 million to federal candidates and the parties, with 49 percent going to Democrats and 51 percent to Republicans, according to the data, compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign finance. Not since 1990 has the split been so nearly even. By contrast, Democrats got just 31 percent of the industry’s donations in 2000 and 2006, 26 percent in 2002 and 34 percent in 2004. Contributions by the American Medical Association show a similar pattern. Democrats have received 52 percent of the $882,000 in contributions reported by its political action committee in the current election cycle. In prior elections, the doctors’ group favored Republicans, giving them 61 percent of its donations in 2002, 80 percent in 2004 and 70 percent in 2006. Fred P. DuVal, treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association, said: “Parity between the parties is now the operating principle for many corporate political action committees in the health care industry. That’s a sea change.” Mr. DuVal is a government relations consultant whose clients include Pfizer and Aetna. The leading campaign contributors in the pharmaceutical industry in 2007-8, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, have been Pfizer, Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson. All three heavily favored Republicans in the last four election cycles, but the proportion of money going to Democrats now approaches or exceeds 50 percent at each company. “People in the pharmaceutical industry have not suddenly changed their spots,” said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. “They understand who will be writing legislation in the next few years. They want to be at the table.” The trend is well illustrated by the shift at Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker. The company’s employees and its political action committee made 85 percent of their contributions to Republicans in 2000. Republicans got 81 percent in 2002, 69 percent in 2004 and 67 percent in 2006. But Democrats have received 51 percent of the $1.2 million in contributions reported in the current election cycle. On its Web site, Pfizer now boasts that its political action committee supports equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, Republicans received 70 percent of the contributions in 2000, 61 percent in 2002, 63 percent in 2004 and 61 percent in 2006. But in the current campaign, Democrats have received 59 percent of the $964,000 in donations reported by Johnson &amp; Johnson employees and the company’s political action committee. One other factor that may have chilled enthusiasm for giving to Republicans is that the party’s presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, has not taken a typically Republican stance toward the industry. Mr. McCain has supported legislation to let the government negotiate directly with drug companies to obtain lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries, a position that is anathema to the industry. He wants to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada and some other countries. He has defied makers of brand-name drugs by pushing legislation to speed the approval of lower-cost generic drugs. And he championed legislation to codify patients’ rights, a bill strenuously opposed by insurers and President Bush. In a recent television advertisement, the McCain campaign boasts that “he took on the drug industry.” At a Republican presidential debate in January, after Mr. McCain criticized drug companies, one of his rivals, Mitt Romney, told him, “Don’t turn the pharmaceutical companies into the big bad guys.” Mr. McCain shot back, “Well, they are.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on October 14, 2008, on page A18 of the New York edition.WASHINGTON  After favoring Republicans by a ratio of more than two to one for most of the last decade, pharmaceutical companies and others in the health care industry are now splitting their contributions evenly between the two major parties, campaign finance reports show.

In prior elections, the doctors’ group favored Republicans, giving them 61 percent of its donations in 2002, 80 percent in 2004 and 70 percent in 2006. Fred P. DuVal, treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association, said: “Parity between the parties is now the operating principle for many corporate political action committees in the health care industry. That’s a sea change.” Mr. DuVal is a government relations consultant whose clients include Pfizer and Aetna. The leading campaign contributors in the pharmaceutical industry in 2007-8, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, have been Pfizer, Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson. All three heavily favored Republicans in the last four election cycles, but the proportion of money going to Democrats now approaches or exceeds 50 percent at each company. “People in the pharmaceutical industry have not suddenly changed their spots,” said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. “They understand who will be writing legislation in the next few years. They want to be at the table.” The trend is well illustrated by the shift at Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker. The company’s employees and its political action committee made 85 percent of their contributions to Republicans in 2000. Republicans got 81 percent in 2002, 69 percent in 2004 and 67 percent in 2006. But Democrats have received 51 percent of the $1.2 million in contributions reported in the current election cycle. On its Web site, Pfizer now boasts that its political action committee supports equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, Republicans received 70 percent of the contributions in 2000, 61 percent in 2002, 63 percent in 2004 and 61 percent in 2006. But in the current campaign, Democrats have received 59 percent of the $964,000 in donations reported by Johnson &amp; Johnson employees and the company’s political action committee. One other factor that may have chilled enthusiasm for giving to Republicans is that the party’s presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, has not taken a typically Republican stance toward the industry. Mr. McCain has supported legislation to let the government negotiate directly with drug companies to obtain lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries, a position that is anathema to the industry. He wants to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada and some other countries. He has defied makers of brand-name drugs by pushing legislation to speed the approval of lower-cost generic drugs. And he championed legislation to codify patients’ rights, a bill strenuously opposed by insurers and President Bush. In a recent television advertisement, the McCain campaign boasts that “he took on the drug industry.” At a Republican presidential debate in January, after Mr. McCain criticized drug companies, one of his rivals, Mitt Romney, told him, “Don’t turn the pharmaceutical companies into the big bad guys.” Mr. McCain shot back, “Well, they are.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Related Health Guide: Epilepsy RSS Feed Get Health News From The New York Times » Pfizer’s tactics included delaying the publication of studies that had found no evidence the drug worked for some other disorders, “spinning” negative data to place it in a more positive light, and bundling negative findings with positive studies to neutralize the results, according to written reports by the experts, who analyzed the documents at the request of the plaintiffs’ lawyers. One of the experts who reviewed the documents, Dr. Kay Dickersin of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, concluded that the Pfizer documents spell out “a publication strategy meant to convince physicians of Neurontin’s effectiveness and misrepresent or suppress negative findings.” Pfizer issued a statement Tuesday denying that it had manipulated Neurontin data, saying “study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the study, and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in which the study was conducted.” The expert reports, unsealed Monday in a federal court in Boston, add to accusations that the pharmaceutical industry has controlled the flow of clinical research data, blurring the lines between science and marketing. In April, for example, a group of academic doctors questioned the validity of drug industry research after finding that Merck had hired ghostwriters to produce scientific articles about Vioxx, then recruited prestigious doctors to serve as their official authors. Vioxx, a painkiller, was withdrawn from the market in 2004 after research indicated it could cause strokes and heart attacks. Last winter, Merck and Schering-Plough were criticized for delaying the release of a study on their best-selling cholesterol medication Vytorin that showed the drug did not slow the growth of plaque in arteries. In the case of Pfizer’s Neurontin, the negative studies would have increased doubts about the drug’s value for several unapproved uses  treating bipolar disorder, controlling certain types of pain and preventing migraine headaches, according to the expert opinions. So-called off-label use of Neurontin for those conditions helped propel its sales to nearly $3 billion a year before it lost patent protection in 2004. In one example, the experts concluded that Pfizer had deliberately delayed release of a study that showed the drug had little effect against pain that is a complication of long-term diabetes, even as the outside researcher who was a lead investigator for the study, Dr. John Reckless of Bath, England, pushed to publish the unflattering findings on his own. Dr. Reckless’s office said Tuesday that he could not be reached for comment. According to one September 2000 e-mail message by a Neurontin team leader at Pfizer, “The main investigator in the U.K. (Dr. Reckless) is keen to publish but this will have several ramifications.” The team leader later wrote, “I think we can limit the potential downside of the 224 study by delaying publication for as long as possible.” Pfizer said Tuesday that it had submitted the Reckless study to two journals which declined to publish it. The results were not published until 2003 and, according to plaintiffs’ experts, when they did appear they were combined with two other studies and together the findings concluded Neurontin was effective for treating neuropathic pain. Another series of e-mail messages had the subject line “Spinning Serpell,” a reference to an investigator on the study, Dr. Michael Serpell of Glasgow, Scotland. In the e-mail exchange a senior marketing manager for Pfizer and a professional medical writer discussed how to cast the results in a more favorable light for a poster presentation at a medical conference, the experts concluded. “If Pfizer wants to use, present and publish this comparative data analysis in which two of the five studies compared make the overall picture look bad, how do we make it sound better than it looks on the graphs?” the medical writer asked. Pfizer discontinued its marketing program for Neurontin in 2004 after the drug became available as a generic. That same year, the company paid $430 million to settle federal criminal and civil claims that Warner-Lambert, which Pfizer acquired in 2000, promoted Neurontin for unapproved uses during the 1990s. At the time, Pfizer said the illegal marketing had occurred before Pfizer acquired the company or drug. On Tuesday, Pfizer repeated that it had instituted procedures when it acquired Warner-Lambert to make sure there was no off-label promotion of Neurontin. Despite that settlement, separate legal action involving the drug is still pending in Boston, where consumers and third-party payers including insurance companies and trade unions want Pfizer to repay them billions of dollars for Neurontin prescriptions. The plaintiffs accuse Pfizer of fraudulently misrepresenting the drug’s benefits. Thomas Greene, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the documents in the case revealed that even after the Neurontin settlement. “Pfizer continued with the medical marketing firms and planted marketing messages in journal articles that Neurontin was effective while they knew that their own clinical trials had failed to demonstrate it was effective,” Mr. Greene said. Dr. Dickersin, the Johns Hopkins expert, said that of 21 studies she reviewed, five were positive and 16 negative, meaning they did not prove the drug was effective. Of the five positive studies, four were published in full journal articles, yet only six of the negative studies were published and, of those, two were published in abbreviated form.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » Pfizer also is ending new research in heart disease, including treatments for high cholesterol and hardening of the arteries, as part of a standard, periodic tweaking of its research strategy, a spokeswoman, Liz Power, said Tuesday. Pfizer expects to spend $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion on research and development this year, a huge budget for the industry. Pfizer’s global research and development campuses are in Groton and New London, Conn. Like most of its rivals, Pfizer has been reorganizing and cutting costs to deal with looming generic competition and a lack of blockbusters in its pipeline. Ms. Power said Pfizer needed to focus research, particularly costly late-stage human testing, on areas where patient needs are not meant by existing treatments, where there is a sizable commercial market and where the company has expertise and a good chance for scientific success. The company has identified six high-priority areas for research: cancer, pain, inflammation, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. Heart drugs remain a big market given the aging population in developed countries, and Pfizer sells the world’s top-selling cholesterol fighter, Lipitor. However, that market is considered saturated, and many drug categories already have significant generic competition that is eroding sales of brand-name medicines. Lipitor, which generates about $12 billion a year in revenue, will lose its American patent late in 2011. The experimental drug considered Pfizer’s most promising candidate as a successor, torcetrapib, was yanked from development late in 2006 because it was linked to an unexpected number of deaths and heart complications. Pfizer also gave its semiannual update for investors on its research pipeline, stating that it now has 114 human studies of drugs in process and that the number of studies in the final stage has grown from 16 to 25 since its last update in March.

But to corporate America, they are marketing opportunities. More then 170 major corporations -- including Google, Best Buy, Pfizer, FedEx, Allstate, AT&amp;T and Hewlett-Packard -- are spending millions of dollars at the two conventions to promote their brands and their political agendas, creating a trade-show atmosphere away from the podium. General Motors, for example, is providing 700 hybrid and flex-fuel cars as the ''official vehicle provider'' to shuttle politicians around. To show off just how ''flex'' some of these vehicles are, G.M. has teamed with the Molson-Coors Brewing Company to power cars with ''waste beer,'' or beer that is damaged during production and turned into ethanol. Beer and driving usually do not mix. But this unusual combination is part of the automaker's effort to establish its ''green'' bona fides at a time when G.M. and other Detroit automakers are seeking financial support from Congress to build more fuel-efficient vehicles. ''Given the white-hot attention to the conventions,'' said Greg Martin, a G.M. spokesman, ''this is a good chance to showcase our vehicles to a wide range of delegates and opinion leaders whose influence extends beyond Washington and their communities.'' AT&amp;T set up in the parking lot of the Pepsi Center in Denver to give conventiongoers a chance to try out the new iPhone. Coca-Cola was handing out Dasani water to people standing in security lines at Invesco Field. Union Pacific has a new hybrid locomotive on display, part of a 30-car fleet it is using for parties at both conventions. A Minneapolis company that makes a fire retardant called FoamPro will have six fire trucks emblazoned with an elephant logo at the Republican convention. ''For companies, conventions are an attractive place to be,'' said Giovanna Torchio, director of business development at Jack Morton Worldwide, a marketing agency. ''You have a concentrated group that have multiple roles and share a passion.'' Major corporations help bankroll the conventions, too. A total of $112 million in private money was raised through the sale of sponsorships by host committees at both conventions to finance them. This compares to $16 million in federal money available to each venue to cover convention costs. (Each venue receives an additional $50 million in federal antiterrorist money, but it is earmarked to pay for security.) Donations to the host committees are tax deductible, and they come with a promise of political access that is harder to come by under new ethics rules passed by Congress last year. Corporations are banned from making direct political contributions, but they can write six- and seven-figure checks and receive V.I.P. credentials to the convention floor, invitations to private events with members of Congress, and space to set up logo-plastered booths at convention events. (They can even put their logo on key cards at the hotels where delegates are staying.) The companies also see the conventions as good networking opportunities with other businesses, and a chance to provide story fodder to the 15,000 members of the news media. Most companies at the conventions are already skilled Washington hands. A report from the Campaign Finance Institute, a Washington nonprofit organization that studies money and politics, found that the 173 donors to the host committees -- mostly corporations but also several trade unions -- have contributed $180 million to federal candidates and spent $1.3 billion in lobbying federal officials since 2005. At both conventions, the biggest corporate presence is Qwest, which has donated $6 million in telecommunications services to each host committee and is the ''official telecommunications provider.'' The company's chief executive, Edward A. Mueller, hosted an invitation-only reception at the Denver Art Museum.</text></article>

But a new study suggests that the drug could help certain women -- those who suffer the sexual side effects of antidepressants -- to achieve an orgasm. Pfizer, which makes Viagra, financed the study, which appears in the current issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. The researchers compared the effects of Viagra with a placebo in an eight-week study of 98 women who reported at least a month of sexual dysfunction from taking antidepressants. They found that 72 percent of the women who took Viagra reported overall sexual improvement in a questionnaire that takes into account arousal, enjoyment and orgasm; 27 percent of those taking the placebo reported such gains. During the study, women taking Viagra suffered headaches and indigestion at a higher rate than women taking the placebo. The average age of the women in the study was 37, and none had entered menopause. Initial endocrine levels did not differ significantly between the groups, and the women agreed to try to have sex at least once a week. Previous studies, including those financed by Pfizer, have not shown that Viagra works for women.</text></article>

Although all three companies face major threats from generic competition, the latest results show that demand for medicines is holding up relatively well at a time of economic downturn. Pfizer's quarterly earnings more than doubled on higher sales of its prescription medicines and lower costs. The company earned $2.78 billion, or 41 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with 18 cents a year earlier. Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 55 cents a share. Analysts on average expected 54 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Glaxo, based in Britain, posted a pretax profit of £2.02 billion ($4.04 billion), or 27.2 pence a share, a 13 percent increase. The average per share forecast was 25 pence. Wyeth's second-quarter profit fell 7 percent, to $1.12 billion, or 83 cents a share, from 87 cents a year earlier, because of generic competition faced by its Protonix ulcer drug. That was still better than investors had expected, and Wyeth shares rose nearly 2 percent, to $45.55. Pfizer stock rose nearly 4 percent to close at $19.07, though some of the shine was taken off by news that the company's Chantix quit-smoking drug had lost more than a third of its sales in the United States because of safety concerns. Glaxo's American depositary receipts gained 11 cents to close at $48.66 after the company said it would delay the completion of a share buyback program. Pharmaceutical stocks have had a rough ride in recent years, reflecting growing anxiety about multiple patent expirations on blockbuster drugs over the next five years, at a time when few new drugs are emerging from company laboratories. Shares of Pfizer, which faces loss of exclusivity on its top-selling drug, Lipitor, for high cholesterol, have lost more than a quarter of their value in the last year. Against that backdrop, leading drug makers are rethinking their strategy. Some are trying to bolster their pipelines by striking ever bigger deals with biotechnology companies. Roche Holding, for example, offered this week to buy out the remainder of Genentech for $43.7 billion. Others are aiming to improve their operations in other ways. Glaxo's chief executive, Andrew Witty, who took over in May, used Wednesday's results presentation to outline a new strategy. Mr. Witty said the company would become much more diversified with lower costs and a more pragmatic approach to research and investment.</text></article>

So Dr. Curtis, an anthropologist then living in the African nation of Burkina Faso, contacted some of the largest multinational corporations and asked them, in effect, to teach her how to manipulate consumer habits worldwide. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Colgate-Palmolive Company Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Val Curtis Val Curtiss hand-washing campaign began in 2003 in Ghana. Dr. Curtis, now the director of the Hygiene Center at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, had spent years trying to persuade people in the developing world to wash their hands habitually with soap. Diseases and disorders caused by dirty hands  like diarrhea  kill a child somewhere in the world about every 15 seconds, and about half those deaths could be prevented with the regular use of soap, studies indicate. But getting people into a soap habit, it turns out, is surprisingly hard. To overcome this hurdle, Dr. Curtis called on three top consumer goods companies to find out how to sell hand-washing the same way they sell Speed Stick deodorant and Pringles potato chips. She knew that over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors  habits  among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues. “There are fundamental public health problems, like hand washing with soap, that remain killers only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.” The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to  Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever  had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines. If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day  chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins  are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands advertising that no morning is complete without a minty-fresh mouth. A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers  which are effective even if applied at high noon  are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup. “OUR products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter &amp; Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers’ lives, and it’s essential to making new products commercially viable.” Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods. But for activists like Dr. Curtis, this emerging research offers a type of salvation. For years, many public health campaigns that aimed at changing habits have been failures. Earlier this decade, two researchers affiliated with Vanderbilt University examined more than 100 studies on the effectiveness of antidrug campaigns and found that, in some cases, viewers’ levels of drug abuse actually increased when commercials were shown, perhaps in part because the ads reminded them about that bag of weed in the sock drawer. 1 2 3 4 Next Page » More Articles in Business »A FEW years ago, a self-described “militant liberal” named Val Curtis decided that it was time to save millions of children from death and disease.

Dr. Curtis, now the director of the Hygiene Center at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, had spent years trying to persuade people in the developing world to wash their hands habitually with soap. Diseases and disorders caused by dirty hands  like diarrhea  kill a child somewhere in the world about every 15 seconds, and about half those deaths could be prevented with the regular use of soap, studies indicate. But getting people into a soap habit, it turns out, is surprisingly hard. To overcome this hurdle, Dr. Curtis called on three top consumer goods companies to find out how to sell hand-washing the same way they sell Speed Stick deodorant and Pringles potato chips.

He and Michelle stood up to hug. The moment they touched, Max unleashed a string of high-pitched barks. “He likes being close to us, but he doesn’t like us being close to each other,” Allan said.

Downstairs, Allan pointed to Max, who was lying on the floor and staring at his tail. He looked angry at it, disturbed by it. “You can see the pressure building in his psyche until he’s ready to explode,” Michelle said. And then he did: Max jumped to his feet and lunged.

The practice of prescribing medications designed for humans to animals has grown substantially over the past decade and a half, and pharmaceutical companies have recently begun experimenting with a more direct strategy: marketing behavior-modification and “lifestyle” drugs specifically for pets. America’s animals, it seems, have very American health problems. More than 20 percent of our dogs are overweight; Pfizer’s Slentrol was approved by the F.D.A. last year as the country’s first canine anti-obesity medication. Dogs live 13 years on average, considerably longer than they did in the past; Pfizer’s Anipryl treats cognitive dysfunction so that absent-minded pets can remember the location of the supper bowl or doggy door. For lonely dogs with separation anxiety, Eli Lilly brought to market its own drug Reconcile last year. The only difference between it and Prozac is that Reconcile is chewable and tastes like beef. Doggy diet pills may be plainly absurd, but scientists in an expanding field known as behavioral pharmacology say that the combination of new drug therapies and progressive training techniques can solve problems that in the past almost always resulted in euthanasia. The supposed effectiveness of psychiatric medicines in treating mood and behavior issues is prompting new questions in the centuries-old debate over what, exactly, separates mankind from the beasts. If the strict Cartesian view were true  that animals are essentially flesh-and-blood automatons, lacking anything resembling human emotion, memory and consciousness  then why do animals develop mental illnesses that eerily resemble human ones and that respond to the same medications?

Pfizer announced an agreement Wednesday to head off generic competition for its flagship drug until November 2011  up to 20 months later than many analysts had been expecting. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Paul Sakuma/Associated Press The cholesterol medication Lipitor is the worlds top drug, with $12.7 billion in sales last year. The drug maker settled global patent disputes with Ranbaxy Laboratories, a generic drug maker in India that had threatened to market its own version of Lipitor. The cholesterol medication is the world’s top drug, with $12.7 billion in sales last year. By delaying Ranbaxy’s generic version of Lipitor, which might have been sold as early as March 2010, Pfizer has won extra time for exclusive sales of Lipitor, potentially totaling billions of additional dollars. Lipitor’s current price can exceed $3 a day, while a generic version might eventually sell for well below $1. Ranbaxy said it had agreed to the settlement partly to avoid the uncertainty of continuing to fight Pfizer’s patent claims in court after years of litigation. “This brings closure to a number of ongoing patent lawsuits and provides certainty and visibility to the launch of Ranbaxy’s generic atorvastatin,” said Dr. Malvinder Mohan Singh, the chief executive, referring to generic Lipitor. As part of the agreement, Pfizer granted licenses to Ranbaxy authorizing the company to sell generic Lipitor in seven other important pharmaceutical markets: Australia, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The deal will let Ranbaxy sell its drug in those seven countries two to four months before patents expire, according to Chuck Caprariello, a spokesman for Ranbaxy. That could potentially mean that generic Lipitor will become available in Canada earlier than in the United States. But the dates Ranbaxy will begin marketing in Canada and the six other countries were not disclosed. Pfizer also dropped its challenge to Ranbaxy’s current sale of a generic Lipitor in four other countries  Brunei, Malaysia, Peru and Vietnam  allowing those sales to continue. Both companies said the agreement did not involve any payments. Pfizer, based in New York, said the agreement contained no provisions that would run afoul of the Federal Trade Commission. The agency has frowned on arrangements in which makers of name-brand drugs pay off generic manufacturers to keep them from entering the market. The F.T.C. has argued that such arrangements, called reverse payments, harm the public by inflating drug prices and the agency has challenged them in court, with mixed results. “We don’t have any of the items that the F.T.C. has identified as being of concern such as reverse payments,” David Reid, Pfizer’s acting general counsel, said in a conference call with investors Wednesday morning. During that call, Mr. Reid called the agreement “pro-patient, pro-competition and pro-intellectual property.” Jonathan D. Leibowitz, an F.T.C. commissioner who has voiced particular concern about agreements that drive up pharmaceutical costs, said the agency would review the settlement. “Not every agreement between a brand company and a generic to settle a patent dispute is going to violate the antitrust laws,” Mr. Leibowitz said, “but we’re certainly going to take a very close look at this deal.” Ronny Gal, a generic pharmaceutical analyst for the investment company Sanford C. Bernstein, said such an agreement clearly was not envisioned by the Hatch-Waxman Act, the 1984 law meant to encourage generic drug competition. Mr. Gal said that the agreement meant that consumers would continue to pay branded pharmaceutical prices for Lipitor longer than necessary. Yet, Pfizer has been more cautious in antitrust matters than many of its competitors and Mr. Gal said the agreement was probably fashioned in such a way that it would avoid F.T.C. opposition. Shares of Pfizer, which has recently traded near its lowest point in a decade, ended the day up 5 cents at $17.77. While the deal has the effect of extending Lipitor’s market exclusivity by up to 20 months, the exact extension is unclear. The date Lipitor loses market exclusivity has been a matter of dispute, with one patent expiring in March 2010 and another in June 2011. The company had argued that Lipitor might be protected by patents expiring in 2016 and 2017 but analysts have said those are minor patents not likely to be upheld. In any case, Mr. Gal said the extension would be worth more than a billion dollars to Pfizer. Analysts also said the deal probably means that Pfizer can preserve its 7 percent dividend for now. “Inasmuch as Lipitor generics are delayed and this remedies the matter, its dividend should be secure for a bit longer,” Dr. Tim Anderson, a pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note to clients. Pfizer has mounted an aggressive marketing campaign to defend its Lipitor brand against recent competition from simvastatin, a generic version of Zocor, a similar anticholesterol drug that lost patent protection in 2006. Studies have shown that for many patients hoping to control cholesterol levels, simvastatin is a viable substitute for Lipitor, known generically as atorvastatin. A big difference between the two is that Lipitor costs $2.50 to $3 a day, while simvastatin can cost 75 cents to $1 a day, or as low as 10 cents a day at some discount pharmacies. As the first company to file with federal regulators to market a generic version of Lipitor, Ranbaxy has legal rights to 180 days of generic market exclusivity. During that six-month period, the maker can price generic drugs fairly close to the brand-name version. Prices generally decline sharply when other generic competitors enter the market. The settlement agreement does not prevent other generic companies from challenging the Lipitor patent, but Ranbaxy’s “first filer” rights in the United States eliminates much of the incentive to do so. Shares of Ranbaxy were up 2.6 percent Wednesday. The settlement also allows Ranbaxy to market a version of Caduet, a Pfizer product that combines Lipitor with a blood-pressure medication, Norvasc.

The date Lipitor loses market exclusivity has been a matter of dispute, with one patent expiring in March 2010 and another in June 2011. The company had argued that Lipitor might be protected by patents expiring in 2016 and 2017 but analysts have said those are minor patents not likely to be upheld. In any case, Mr. Gal said the extension would be worth more than a billion dollars to Pfizer. Analysts also said the deal probably means that Pfizer can preserve its 7 percent dividend for now. “Inasmuch as Lipitor generics are delayed and this remedies the matter, its dividend should be secure for a bit longer,” Dr. Tim Anderson, a pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note to clients. Pfizer has mounted an aggressive marketing campaign to defend its Lipitor brand against recent competition from simvastatin, a generic version of Zocor, a similar anticholesterol drug that lost patent protection in 2006. Studies have shown that for many patients hoping to control cholesterol levels, simvastatin is a viable substitute for Lipitor, known generically as atorvastatin. A big difference between the two is that Lipitor costs $2.50 to $3 a day, while simvastatin can cost 75 cents to $1 a day, or as low as 10 cents a day at some discount pharmacies. As the first company to file with federal regulators to market a generic version of Lipitor, Ranbaxy has legal rights to 180 days of generic market exclusivity. During that six-month period, the maker can price generic drugs fairly close to the brand-name version. Prices generally decline sharply when other generic competitors enter the market. The settlement agreement does not prevent other generic companies from challenging the Lipitor patent, but Ranbaxy’s “first filer” rights in the United States eliminates much of the incentive to do so. Shares of Ranbaxy were up 2.6 percent Wednesday. The settlement also allows Ranbaxy to market a version of Caduet, a Pfizer product that combines Lipitor with a blood-pressure medication, Norvasc.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Managing Globalization: Justice Isnt Globalized Yet As a result, the Supreme Court announced on Monday that a lower court’s judgment allowing the high-profile lawsuit against the companies to move forward was automatically affirmed. A quorum of six of the nine justices is necessary for the court to conduct business. While the recusal of four justices is unusual, so was the case that provoked it, a consolidation of 10 lawsuits filed in the name of everyone who lived in South Africa from 1948 to 1994 and who was injured by the official system of racial separation. The dozens of corporate defendants represented a who’s who of American business. The outcome calls attention to the occasionally uncomfortable consequences of the justices’ ownership of stock in individual companies. With solitary recusals being much more frequent, a 4-to-4 deadlock is a more common outcome than an inability to proceed with the case at all. That happened on March 3, when nonparticipation by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. resulted in a 4-to-4 tie in a case on the permissibility of damage suits against the makers of federally approved pharmaceuticals. According to his most recent financial disclosure form, the chief justice owns stock in Pfizer Inc., the corporate parent of the defendant in that case, Warner-Lambert Company v. Kent, No. 06-1498. It remains to be seen whether the absence of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. from the Exxon Valdez punitive damages case, argued on Feb. 27, will result in a tie vote. His ownership of Exxon Mobil stock led to his recusal from that case, Exxon Shipping Company v. Baker, No. 07-219. In a tie vote, the lower court’s decision is upheld but it has no effect as precedent in other cases. Federal law makes it mandatory for judges to remove themselves from cases if they own even a single share of stock in a company that is a party in a case. Judges, unlike some executive branch officials, are not required to divest themselves of their stock holdings. Nonetheless, Congress acted in 2006 to deal with the recusal problem by making divestiture more appealing. It extended to the federal judiciary the relief from capital gains tax liability that it had already granted to executive branch officials who sell individual stocks and reinvest the proceeds in government securities or approved mutual funds. Whether the apartheid case, which seeks $400 billion in damages from the corporate defendants, ever gets to trial remains highly uncertain, despite the Supreme Court’s inability to act on the companies’ request to dismiss it. The government of South Africa strongly opposes the litigation, and the Bush administration supported the companies’ appeal on the ground that the case “is causing present injury to important interests of the United States and the Republic of South Africa.” The Supreme Court’s order in the case, American Isuzu Motors, Inc. v. Ntsebeza, No. 07-919, listed Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito along with Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer as having taken “no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.” “Since a majority of the qualified justices are of the opinion that the case cannot be heard and determined at the next term of the court, the judgment is affirmed,” the order said. The outcome has the same effect as a tie vote  it makes no law and does not set any precedent. As is usual, the court did not give reasons for the justices’ recusals. Exxon Mobil is a defendant, as is another company in which Justice Alito owns stock, Bristol-Myers Squibb. Justice Breyer owns stock in several of the companies. Chief Justice Roberts owns the stock of another defendant, Hewlett-Packard. Justice Kennedy’s reason for recusal does not appear to be stock, but rather a son’s employment with another defendant, Credit Suisse, a situation that has previously led the justice to disqualify himself. The plaintiffs have invoked one of the oldest federal laws, the Alien Tort Statute, which was enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789. It is a jurisdictional statute that does not by itself convey any substantive rights. Rather, it authorizes the federal courts to decide “any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” The Alien Tort Statute, sometimes called the Alien Tort Claims Act, lay dormant for most of two centuries until it was rediscovered as a way to seek redress in United States courts for human rights violations committed overseas. The Supreme Court, while not foreclosing the use of the statute for that purpose, has been notably skeptical. A footnote in a 2004 Supreme Court decision on an unrelated Alien Tort Statute case referred specifically to the South African lawsuit, noting that there was “a strong argument that federal courts should give serious weight to the executive branch’s view of the case’s impact on foreign policy.” In its ruling last October allowing the case to proceed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, ordered the district court to consider defenses it had not previously addressed. These include whether the suit presents a “political question” that is beyond the institutional capacity of a federal court to resolve.

The company has begun negotiating settlements with individual plaintiff's firms, David S. Ratner, a lawyer with Morelli Ratner, said in a phone interview. ''It's been going on for a few weeks,'' he said. Mr. Ratner, a member of a steering committee of lawyers for the drugs' users, said he did not know which specific firms were involved in the settlements. More than 3,000 patients have claimed that the drugs caused heart attacks and strokes. Celebrex, in the same class of medicines as Merck's recalled Vioxx, is Pfizer's third-best-selling drug. The product, which is still on the market, generated $2.3 billion in sales in 2007, a 12 percent increase from the previous year. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Pfizer had reached settlements with three law firms representing more than 200 of the thousands who sued over the drugs. Firms have been offered $40,000 to $50,000 a client to resolve Bextra cases and as much as $200,000 a client for Celebrex, The Journal reported, citing an unidentified lawyer. Pfizer withdrew Bextra in April 2005 after it was tied to a potentially fatal skin condition. The first Bextra trial, due to begin May 5 in federal court in San Francisco, was postponed until May 29, according to court records. Ray Kerins, a Pfizer spokesman, declined to comment on pending litigation.</text></article>
