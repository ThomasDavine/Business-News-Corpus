Campbell said net income fell to $100 million, or 31 cents a share, from $113 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 6 percent to nearly $1.61 billion. Excluding revamping charges, earnings increased 30 percent to 43 cents a share, topping the 38 cents expected by analysts.

But its overall results beat expectations as its baked goods and snacks, which include Pepperidge Farm products, Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies, sold well. Campbell said it planned to step up advertising and new product offerings in its soup line to drive demand rather than relying on price cuts. The company, like all food makers, is also facing higher food costs and plans to raise prices in the United States to offset that. Campbell said net income rose 11 percent, to $187 million, or 57 cents a share, up from $168 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat analyst expectations for earnings of 52 cents a share, according to FactSet. Revenue in the period, which ended May 1 and was the third quarter of Campbell’s fiscal year, edged up to $1.81 billion from $1.80 billion a year ago, matching expectations. Sales in the company’s baking and snacking unit rose 10 percent. Food service segment sales were up 5 percent. Sales of soup, sauces and beverages outside the United States rose 7 percent. But sales in its United States soup, sauce and beverage unit fell 8 percent. The company said higher prices had deterred some customers.

The disappointing results were partly a result of deep discounting by a rival brand, Progresso, which is owned by General Mills and posted a 30 percent increase in sales volume. Campbell said it earned $239 million, or 71 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $259 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Jan. 30 and was the second quarter of Campbell’s fiscal year, fell to $2.13 billion from $2.15 billion. Profit matched Wall Street analysts’ forecasts while sales fell short. Stock in the company, which is based in Camden, N.J., fell $1.36, to $33.58 a share. Campbell said it expects 2011 earnings per share to decline 1 to 3 percent. It expects sales to range from down 1 percent to up 1 percent. In November, it forecast growth of 2 to 4 percent for earnings and 1 to 3 percent for sales, which was lower than the goals it gave in September. “The overall competitive environment remains challenging throughout the food industry, particularly in the U.S.,” Campbell’s chief executive, Douglas R. Conant, said. Campbell’s soup sales fell 4 percent in the United States in the quarter, surprising analysts and investors who thought soup would have sold well given this winter’s severe weather. Campbell said it planned to ease up on promotions in the second half of its fiscal year and would instead focus on advertising and other strategies to strengthen its brand.Campbell Soup posted a decline in quarterly profit on Friday and lowered its outlook for the year, citing disappointing soup sales.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/business/media/26adco.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Food Ads Seek to Play Up the Festive in Home Cooking<date>Published: November 25, 2010</date><text>FORGET visions of sugar plums. The treats dancing in the heads on Madison Avenue are the prosaic products found on supermarket shelves.The weeks before Christmas always bring increased spending on campaigns for packaged foods like soup, candy, soft drinks, flour, canned and frozen vegetables, gravy, coffee, cake mixes, broth and cookies. For this holiday season, such advertising is being stepped up because food marketers have been intensifying efforts to reach the millions of cash-short consumers who are eating and entertaining at home more often. “Our consumers are telling us, now more than ever, they want to save money,” said Keith Vines, vice president for sales and marketing at House-Autry Mills in Four Oaks, N.C., which makes products like corn meal, hushpuppy mix and chicken breading. “We’ve had a lot more visitors to our Web site downloading recipes.” So House-Autry is inviting cooks to enter a holiday contest, called I’m Dreaming of a Fried Christmas, by uploading video clips to a section of the Web site The company is also asking consumers to visit Facebook and join an organization fancifully named the Southern Cooking Preservation Society. “With the economy, people are looking for simple ways to make their holidays special,” said Lora Van Velsor, vice president of marketing for baking and syrups at the Pinnacle Foods Group in Mountain Lakes, N.J. As a result, Pinnacle is taking steps like introducing bottles of its Mrs. Butterworth’s syrup in three Christmas designs — the first time in the brand’s 50-year history it has been dressed for the holidays — and bringing out a range of dessert toppings, Amazing Glazes, under the Duncan Hines name. The goal is to help shoppers “add a little flair without a lot of cost,” Ms. Van Velsor said. “We all aspire to be ‘cake boss,’ but very few of us are, myself included.” BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, is the creative agency for Pinnacle.For Christmas 2010, Godiva chocolate is adding television to its campaign, which until now has run only in magazines and stores. A commercial plays up the brand’s Belgian heritage by using the actor David Suchet — who portrayed Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie’s Belgian detective — as the voice-over announcer. “The time was right to be moving onto TV,” said Lauri Kien Kotcher, chief marketing officer and senior vice president for global brand development at Godiva Chocolatier in New York, part of the Ulker Group unit of Yildiz Holding. The reason was the broader distribution for the brand as a result of a new line, Godiva Gems, which is priced lower than traditional Godiva offerings. To underline the message that Gems help make Godiva “more accessible,” Ms. Kien Kotcher said, the ads show hundreds of pieces of chocolate and carry the theme “May your life be filled with Godiva.” The campaign is being created by the Acme Idea Company in South Norwalk, Conn. “The core of the strategy is ‘Don’t save your Godiva for a special occasion two or three times a year,’ ” said Scott Kulok, creative head at Acme, because “is there not a special occasion every day?” For decades, the Campbell Soup Company has run magazine ads before Christmas to promote products like Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup, Swanson chicken broth and Pepperidge Farm stuffing, featuring recipes for mainstay dishes like green bean casserole. This year, the company also has online ads, iAds for the Apple iPhone, applications for smartphones and a presence in social media like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. “We’re trying to be where consumers are,” said Lisa Walker, a vice president at Campbell Soup in Camden, N.J., and, in particular, “engage younger consumers.” That means “pushing out more in the digital space than ever before,” she added. For instance, a campaign for Swanson broths, housed on a Web site, offers light-hearted discussions of whether to say “stuffing” or “dressing” and whether it should be served inside or outside the bird. And the brand is offering a chance to post and read “turkey tweets” on Twitter. Agencies that work for Campbell include BBDO New York and two owned by WPP, the G2 unit of the Grey Group and the Y&amp;R New York unit of Young &amp; Rubicam Brands.At Starbucks Corporation, “we’re talking more about our Christmas Blend coffee than we have historically,” said Terry Davenport, senior vice president for global brand and creative at Starbucks in Seattle, referring to the seasonal packaged coffee beans sold in supermarkets and the company’s stores. For 2010, Starbucks is bringing out a Christmas Blend version of its VIA Ready Brew instant coffee. Ads by BBDO New York pair the two varieties and promise, “You’ll jingle all day long.” The ads are part of a holiday campaign that carries the theme “Share in the taste of the season with Starbucks.” “Last year, we had a very strong holiday,” Mr. Davenport said, and the company hopes to repeat that with a promotion, “The 12 days of sharing,” which he said would offer customers in Starbucks stores “a hot deal of the day each day for 12 days” starting Dec. 1. Supermarket distribution of Christmas Blend is limited, Mr. Davenport said, to maintain its special character. “The day after Christmas, those red bags of coffee start to look like last season,” he said, adding: “We can just open them and brew them. It’s a little hard for supermarkets to do that.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/24campbell.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Campbell Reports Decline in U.S. Soup Sales<date>Published: November 23, 2010</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company said that its domestic soup sales fell in the first quarter as more money spent on promotions did not persuade shoppers to buy.Consumers did buy more of the company’s condensed cooking soups, a sign that people wary about the economy are still eating at home more. But Campbell reported declining sales of ready-to-serve and condensed soups. Douglas R. Conant, who is stepping down as president and chief executive in July 2011, said in a conference call on Tuesday that Campbell lacked new products to help draw people to the category, saying shoppers would not buy on price alone. Campbell earned $279 million, or 82 cents a share, in the first quarter, down 8 percent from $304 million, or 87 cents a share, a year ago. The performance missed analysts’ expectations by a cent. The estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters usually remove one-time items. Campbell’s stock fell 83 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $34 a share. Campbell said its first-quarter revenue fell 1 percent to $2.17 billion from $2.2 billion. That was shy of Wall Street’s estimates of revenue of $2.2 billion. The company previously said that heavy promotional spending in the quarter had not spurred sales. Campbell’s introduced a $100 million ad campaign in September to promote its soup brands, facing tough competition from other soup makers and sellers of low-price meals.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/economy/22ahead.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Looking Ahead to Economic Reports This Week<date>Published: November 21, 2010</date><text>ECONOMIC REPORTS With Thanksgiving on Thursday, some reports this week have been moved up the calendar.

Conant, planned to step down in July after a decade leading the company.Denise Morrison, president of Campbell’s North American soup, sauces and beverages, is expected to succeed him. The company’s board named Ms. Morrison, 56, chief operating officer and appointed her to the board in anticipation of her election as chief executive. Mr. Conant, 59, is to depart at the end of the company’s fiscal year on July 31 and work with Ms. Morrison until then. He declined to discuss his plans beyond that point. Mr. Conant has been chief executive and president of Campbell since January 2001, when he was brought on to rebuild the company and stabilize sales of its line of condensed soup. Sales have softened recently, however, leaving Ms. Morrison with some challenges ahead.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/business/04soup.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Campbell’s Profit Rises, but Forecast Disappoints<date>Published: September 3, 2010</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company, the world’s largest soup maker, reported higher quarterly profit and income on Friday, but gave an earnings forecast that trailed analysts’ estimates.The company said it expected earnings to rise by 5 to 7 percent, to $2.59 to $2.64 a share, in the year through July 2011. Analysts had forecast $2.64 a share, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter profit increased 64 percent, the company said in a statement. Net income rose to $113 million, or 33 cents a share, in the period ending Aug. 1, from $69 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 30 cents on average. Revenue fell less than 1 percent, to $1.52 billion. Soup sales fell 5 percent in the United States in the last quarter after rising 2 percent in the previous period. Ready-to-serve and condensed varieties each declined 7 percent. Beverage sales jumped 12 percent, as the company sold more V8 juice drinks. Douglas R. Conant, Campbell’s chief executive, said consumers were being extremely selective amid tightened household budgets and high unemployment. “There is a palpable change in consumer buying behavior that is unlike anything we have experienced, certainly for a few decades,” Mr. Conant said in a conference call with analysts. “Mom is not sending the teenagers out to go pick up the groceries now. She’s looking at where the best deal is, and sort of surgically buying.” Analysts said the company’s outlook did not inspire investors. “It’s starting to feel a little bit like Groundhog Day where every year going into soup season everybody’s big bet is whether this year is going to show improvement after a disappointing last season,” said Edward Aaron, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Denver. “We certainly haven’t seen any fundamental evidence to support the view that it will.” Campbell, which is based in Camden, N.J., said marketing and selling expenses rose 6 percent, to $221 million, last quarter, driven in part by increased advertising expenses. The company said it expected overall sales to rise 2 to 3 percent in 2011, less than its long-term sales goal of 3 to 4 percent. Mr. Conant said Campbell would adjust promotions and ads depending on the season and the store or retail chain to adapt to consumer buying habits. Campbell shares fell 2.97 percent, or $1.11, to close at $36.21.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/business/25soup.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Profit Slides 3.4% at Campbell Soup<date>Published: May 24, 2010</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company reported on Monday that its third-quarter revenue rose almost 7 percent — its biggest quarterly increase since 2008. But one-time expenses lowered its net income.The 3.4 percent decline in net income was a reversal of a trend in which Campbell, the world’s largest soup maker, increased net income by cutting expenses. Campbell’s chief executive, Douglas R. Conant, said the company expected adjusted earnings per share for the entire fiscal year to be at the high end of the company’s previously issued outlook of 9 to 11 percent growth. The company, based in Camden, N.J., reported that net income fell to $168 million, or 49 cents a share, in the three months ended May 2, down from $174 million, or 49 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time costs that included $12 million for restructuring and $10 million in deferred tax payments related to the health insurance reforms, the company said its adjusted earnings came to 54 cents a share. That beat the 51 cents that Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected. Overall revenue increased 6.9 percent, to $1.8 billion, from $1.69 billion a year ago, as soup revenue in the United States rose 2 percent. Overall revenue was in line with analysts’ expectations. Ready-to-serve soup revenue increased 4 percent. The company did not release precise figures, but said that its Chunky soup sales were strong. That means the products rebounded from the second quarter, when company executives said they had made mistakes in the way they promoted a reintroduced line of Chunky soups.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/business/23soup.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Campbell Soup’s Profit Rises 11%<date>Published: February 22, 2010</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company said on Monday that its quarterly profit rose 11 percent from a year earlier despite an 18 percent decline in sales of its ready-to-serve soups.

Arriving now is a campaign that declares French fried onions are not just for green bean casseroles anymore. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Campbell Soup Co Go to your Portfolio » The campaign is for French’s French Fried Onions, sold by the French’s Foods division of Reckitt Benckiser. The product has been a crucial ingredient in the mainstay side dish, concocted in the kitchens of the Campbell Soup Company, that is known as classic green bean casserole, holiday green bean casserole, original green bean casserole or famous green bean casserole. The recipe was created by Campbell in 1955 to stimulate sales of its condensed cream of mushroom soup. As the leading brand of French fried onions, French’s  known previously as Durkee’s  benefited mightily from the popularity of the recipe. But there is only so far being an ingredient in someone else’s recipe can take you  particularly when the recipe is associated with special meals, at Thanksgiving and Christmas, rather than year-round usage. The campaign spotlights the leading role played by French’s French Fried Onions in a recipe of its own creation, called Crunchy Onion Chicken, which is intended as an everyday dish. The recipe features crushed French fried onions as a coating for chicken that has been dipped in egg batter, which is then baked. (Those with long memories may recall a recipe for a baked chicken dish from the Kellogg Company that uses crushed Kellogg’s Corn Flakes in similar fashion.) The Crunchy Onion Chicken recipe was introduced in magazine advertisements in 2005. It is intended to be a main course that is simple and fast to prepare. The campaign includes television commercials, the first for the product in five years; video clips online; recipes on two Web sites, frenchs.com and frenchsfoods.com; a cooking contest; a promotion with a $25,000 grand prize; and a public relations effort. Social media may be next. The media budget for the campaign is estimated at $5 million, with an additional $15 million or so devoted to the remaining marketing elements. Several agencies are collaborating on the campaign. Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of Havas, is handling the creative assignment. Zenith Media in New York, part of the ZenithOptimedia unit of the Publicis Groupe, is the media agency. The agencies working on the contest, named the French’s Cook-Off, are Source Marketing in Norwalk, Conn.; Genuine Interactive in Boston; and the Bender Hammerling Group in Montclair, N.J. The campaign is indicative of the stepped-up activity among marketers of prosaic pantry products during the economic downturn. They are trying to capitalize on the fact that more consumers are eating at home because it is usually cheaper than dining out. One reason families enjoy going out to eat is because each family member “can find something on the menu” he or she likes, says Dana Lawnzak, senior brand manager for French’s French Fried Onions at the Reckitt Benckiser food division in Chester, N.J. By comparison, there is usually only one main dish prepared when a family dines at home and it becomes a challenge to find something “everyone likes,” she adds. “Maybe more now than ever,” Ms. Lawnzak says, the campaign is “trying to solve that dinner dilemma for mom: ‘What am I going to make for dinner tonight?’ ” Ms. Lawnzak says. (Ms. Lawnzak uses “mom” to reflect that most of the cooking is done by the wife and mother of the house. As a result, the campaign is aimed at mothers, ages 25 to 54.) The campaign presents French’s French Fried Onions as part of the French’s line-up, which includes products like French’s mustards and French’s Worcestershire sauce. The ads use a theme, “Happy starts here,” that was introduced last year for the other French’s products. “It’s the first time we’ve folded French Fried Onions under the French’s umbrella,” Ms. Lawnzak says, which should be a more efficient way to promote the French fried onions. The decision to expand beyond the casserole is not meant to denigrate that dish. “Everyone knows the green bean casserole,” Ms. Lawnzak says, praising it as “a great holiday tradition.” But “extending usage to the everyday has been a bit of a challenge,” she adds. “We’ve been looking for new usages probably since 1955.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Remember how the Florida citrus folks used to proclaim that orange juice was not just for breakfast anymore?

Mr. Goerke, who worked for Campbell from 1955 until he retired in 1990, also created the company’s Chunky soup line. Donald Edward Goerke was born in Waukesha, Wis., on Aug. 8, 1926.

Besides his son David, Mr. Goerke is survived by another son, Brian; a daughter, Ann Nassoura; a brother, Fred; and seven grandchildren. His wife, the former June Marie Uthus, died in 2008. Mr. Goerke was a marketing manager with Franco-American, then a division of Campbell, when he was asked to supervise the development of a new canned pasta for children. The shape was crucial on two counts. The first was durability: it had to withstand canning and reheating. The second was damage control: long pasta and young children mix dangerously, with child, chair and walls ending up beribboned with dripping strands. A simple “O,” Mr. Goerke realized, would solve both problems. Its stable shape allowed a thinner strand of pasta to be used, making the reheated product less gummy. It also fit tidily in the bowl of a spoon. Shapes considered and rejected by Mr. Goerke’s team included baseballs, cowboys, spacemen and stars.

(The family name is pronounced GUR-key.) He earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from what was then Carroll College in Waukesha and an M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin. Besides his son David, Mr. Goerke is survived by another son, Brian; a daughter, Ann Nassoura; a brother, Fred; and seven grandchildren. His wife, the former June Marie Uthus, died in 2008. Mr. Goerke was a marketing manager with Franco-American, then a division of Campbell, when he was asked to supervise the development of a new canned pasta for children. The shape was crucial on two counts. The first was durability: it had to withstand canning and reheating. The second was damage control: long pasta and young children mix dangerously, with child, chair and walls ending up beribboned with dripping strands. A simple “O,” Mr. Goerke realized, would solve both problems. Its stable shape allowed a thinner strand of pasta to be used, making the reheated product less gummy. It also fit tidily in the bowl of a spoon. Shapes considered and rejected by Mr. Goerke’s team included baseballs, cowboys, spacemen and stars.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/realestate/commercial/16camden.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Sprucing Up in Campbell’s Hometown<date>Published: September 15, 2009</date><text>CAMDEN, N.J.  Companies redevelop their corporate homes all the time, but few efforts lately have been as closely watched as the move by the Campbell Soup Company to remake its 40-acre home here. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image KlingStubbins A sleek two-story, glass-fronted employee services building under construction on the Campbell campus in Camden. Above, a rendering of the completed center and its courtyard. Two years ago, the company was designated by the state of New Jersey to be a master developer, whose role is to provide oversight for redeveloping the Gateway neighborhood, one of the most neglected parts of this still blighted city. Gateway, covering only about 135 acres, is an eastern portal into the city. It is about a half mile from the downtown and about a mile from the Delaware River waterfront. It is also near the Walter Rand Transportation Center and busy thoroughfares like Admiral Wilson Boulevard and Interstate 676, which leads into Philadelphia. But aside from Campbell’s sprawling 670,000-square-foot campus, the Gateway area has struggled. Roughly a third of it is now vacant or holds abandoned buildings. In early 2007, Campbell, which has been a fixture in Camden since 1869, announced a plan to modernize and redevelop its Gateway property. Cramped for space in buildings dating mostly to the 1950s and early 1960s, and confined by busy public roads that bisect much of its campus, the company considered leaving Camden altogether. But it decided to remake its existing campus and use it as an anchor for a 100-acre office park. Robert Zane, vice president for real estate operations at Campbell, said the company did not expect to build the park itself or to be a landlord. Instead, it plans to work with local and state officials to lure developers and tenants to an office park that would be too expensive for most companies to develop on their own. Recent legislation in New Jersey gives tax credits over a 10-year period to companies with 250 employees or more that invest in a facility within a half mile of a rail station. Using these incentives, Mr. Zane said, net annual rent for tenants in the park might be as low as $4 or $5 a square foot, compared with about $32 a square foot in Center City Philadelphia. Last fall, Campbell started the first phase of its redevelopment. Under a $92 million plan that covers redeveloping its own property and acquiring some of the land for the office park, the company began building a sleek two-story, glass-fronted 80,000-square-foot employee services building in the center of its corporate campus, which is now dominated by about a half dozen older buildings. Campbell executives hope the new building will help the company present a more modern public face and provide a place, somewhat akin to a student center, where its 1,200 full-time headquarters employees can gather. Plans call for the building to offer a 276-foot-long exhibition hall for displaying artifacts from Campbell’s history, conference rooms, a modern cafeteria (with a soup bar, of course), a large courtyard, and dedicated classroom space for employee training and development. “This building is going to bring us to a very different position for attracting future employees,” Mr. Zane said. Once this building is finished, Campbell plans to renovate many of its older buildings to provide up to 40,000 square feet of additional offices as well as conference space. The company also plans to use glass-enclosed walkways to connect some of those buildings to its new building, to create a more circular, seamless and easy-to-navigate campus, said Richard J. Farley, the principal in charge of the project at the Philadelphia office of KlingStubbins, an architecture and engineering company. The new building is expected to be finished next spring. It is already an anomaly in an area where the horizon is dominated by distressed structures, like the large vacant 1927 department store that sits nearby on Admiral Wilson Boulevard. It was one of the first department stores opened by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, which started as a catalog company. The fate of the old Sears building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its Classical Revival-style architecture, has been murky for years. Twice in the last two years, Campbell has tried to buy the site from Ilan Zaken, a Philadelphia-based clothing manufacturer, who acquired it in 2007. But after the latest round of negotiations fell through, the company asked city officials in June to consider using eminent domain to acquire the Sears building so that Campbell can eventually buy it for demolition. This request is expected to come before the city’s planning board in October. Mr. Zaken did not respond to e-mail messages seeking comment. Plans for the new office park now call for 350,000 to 400,000 square feet of space, and almost certainly more if the Sears building is acquired and demolished. While no tenants have yet signed on, Campbell has acquired some 15 acres in the last two years. Company executives say the old store and its once-bustling parking lot now take up an unsightly 3.5 acres in a prime development area highly visible from Admiral Wilson Boulevard and near the planned entrance to Campbell’s redeveloped campus. While Camden is plagued with high rates of crime, some parts of the city are humming with development. The area next to the Delaware River is already home to a new stadium, used mostly for minor league baseball; an aquarium; and a 100,000-square-foot waterfront technology and business incubator center. Some of Camden’s health care and educational institutions have been expanding. Last December, the Cooper University Hospital opened a new 312,000-square-foot patient care building, and in January the Camden campus of Rutgers unveiled a 50,000-square-foot building for its law school. Both are in the central business area. Nevertheless, the city’s commercial revival is expected to be a long-term effort. While Camden has tried to lure companies from across the river for years, “the Gateway business park is going to have to be established before big companies really start arriving,” said James P. Mullarkey, a partner at GVA Smith Mack, a Wayne, Pa.-based real estate company. Still, he said, “the residential resurgence has been a success in Camden, and that will certainly stimulate things.” More Articles in Real Estate » A version of this article appeared in print on September 16, 2009, on page B6 of the New York edition.CAMDEN, N.J.  Companies redevelop their corporate homes all the time, but few efforts lately have been as closely watched as the move by the Campbell Soup Company to remake its 40-acre home here.

The Campbell Soup Company, which introduced Chunky in 1969, will present the brand as a reward for a hard day’s work rather than as fuel for gridiron greatness. The revised approach is scheduled to begin next week in ads on television and radio, in print and online. Those with long memories  or memories for marketing trivia  may recall the beer campaigns of the 1970s and ’80s that celebrated men and their jobs. Budweiser ads proclaimed “For all you do, this Bud’s for you” and Miller High Life told men finishing work: “When it’s time to relax, one beer stands clear. If you’ve got the time, we’ve got the beer.” Replace the cold brews with hot soup, and add a child or two to demonstrate that men today are family-oriented, and voilà, vintage paeans to labor are updated for an economy that evokes the recessions of the ’70s and ’80s. Executives for Chunky and their agency, Y&amp;R, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam Brands division of WPP, say they are not completely giving up on football. Chunky continues as a sponsor of the N.F.L., for example, and Troy Aiken, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, will take part in public relations initiatives. “The brand wouldn’t be where it is today without the N.F.L.,” said Michael Barkley, vice president for ready-to-serve soup at Campbell in Camden, N.J. But the football-centric campaigns that featured players like Donovan McNabb, LaDainian Tomlinson and Kurt Warner  and, in some years, mothers of players  are being benched. The spotlight is turning to blue-collar men who work in shipyards or quarries and on farms and who come home to children they play with and help care for. Instead of slogans replete with football references like “Meals that fill you up right,” and comparisons of playing pro football to “a day working the line,” the new campaign is more straightforward, offering observations like this: “A man’s got to eat. He just wants to eat better.”  It is “a decision that isn’t taken lightly,” Mr. Barkley said, particularly since the football campaigns helped Chunky  the second-largest Campbell brand, behind only the mainstay red-and-white soups  double its sales from 1997 to 2o02. But research showed that the Chunky brand had recently “lost some relevance” with its core consumers, he added, men ages 35 and older. And sales have declined for the last three of Campbell’s fiscal years, according to data from Information Resources Inc., with the slump accelerating: down 6.4 percent in fiscal 2007, 12.4 percent in fiscal 2008 and 14.7 percent in fiscal 2009. (The Campbell fiscal year typically runs from early August through late July.) To reverse that trend, Mr. Barkley said, Chunky ads, previously aimed more at men than women, will also try to speak to the wives and mothers who typically buy the food for their families. “To get to the guy,” he added, “we have to get the stamp of approval from the female head of household.” So ads will run on Web sites like foodnetwork.com and ivillage.com as well as menshealth.com and nfl.com, and in magazines like Cosmopolitan and male titles like Men’s Health. The media agency for Chunky is Mediaedge:cia in New York, part of the GroupM unit of WPP. The differences from the previous campaigns are also meant to signal that there is “news about the product,” Mr. Barkley said, in the form of recipe changes like adding more vegetables and lean meat. To make the campaign more realistic, the commercials were cast and filmed in Seattle, he said, using “regular blue-collar workers with day jobs” instead of actors. Each commercial shows a man working hard at a hard job as these words appear on screen: “Why we made Campbell’s Chunky soup.” As they arrive home, greeting their children, these words appear: “Why we’re making it better.” And like a regular guy who puts his money where his mouth is, Campbell will increase the marketing budget for Chunky in fiscal 2010 by 50 percent, to more than $30 million.  The Chunky changes are being made as some see a trend toward romancing the blue-collar trades, which coincides with the recession’s doubts about white-collar pursuits like investment banking, mortgage brokering and whatever it is that hedge fund managers do. Although that is not the reason for the overhaul, “as a brand we need to be the everyday guy’s advocate and celebrate him,” said James Caporimo, executive vice president and group creative director at the Y&amp;R New York office. That contrasts with situation comedies and ads in which “this guy is always the butt of the joke,” he added, mocked or portrayed as an obtuse dolt despite how “he breaks his pick all day long” for his family. As valuable as football players have been to Chunky, Mr. Caporimo said, they are celebrities rather than workaday men. So a decision was made to focus on “that blue-collar guy doing his job, not hating it, doing it with a lot of gusto,” he said. Gusto?

Christopher Growe, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said the growth in Campbell’s United States soup sales, though strong, had come against easy comparisons and produced relatively little in terms of profit growth during the quarter.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/business/12campbell.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">New Soups Help Profit Beat Forecast at Campbell<date>Published: September 11, 2008</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as price increases and newer products such as lower sodium soups helped offset higher commodity costs.

(AP)  The Campbell Soup Company said its quarterly profit more than doubled from the period a year earlier, helped by the sale of a chocolate unit, but its results fell short of Wall Street forecasts and its shares fell more than 6 percent. The company said its results were hurt by a decline in soup sales in the United States and an increase in commodity costs, but it posted a one-time gain of $467 million as a result of the sale of its Godiva Chocolatier unit. Net income was $532 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $217 million or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended April 27 and was the third quarter of Campbell’s fiscal year, rose to $1.88 billion from $1.75 billion. The latest results include a $467 million after-tax gain as a result of the $850 million sale of Godiva. Excluding one-time items, Campbell earned $165 million, or 43 cents a share, down from $179 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. The profit fell short of the 44 cents a share expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Campbell’s stock fell $2.25, to $33.70 a share. Soup sales were down 3 percent compared with an unusually strong third quarter in 2007. Condensed soup sales were flat, while ready-to-serve products slipped 9 percent. The chief executive, Douglas R. Conant, said that higher prices hurt sales and that Campbell’s profit margin was pinched by higher costs for ingredients. The company, based in Camden, N.J., said sales were up by more than 10 percent in all three divisions of its Pepperidge Farm brand, but earnings for the unit were flat because of higher commodity prices.

(AP)  Challenged by preservationists and stymied by a state judge, the Campbell Soup Company said on Wednesday that for now it had dropped its plans to seek demolition of the 80-year-old Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company building in downtown Camden, N.J., to build an office park. It also announced a new plan that would keep the company in the city. Campbell, which has been in Camden since its founding in 1869, had raised the possibility of leaving the impoverished city if the Sears building, which is abandoned, were not razed. A Campbell spokesman, Anthony J. Sanzio, said Wednesday that the company had considered expanding its own headquarters but not developing an office park, and looked into a move to central New Jersey. But in the end, Mr. Sanzio said, Campbell could not abandon Camden. “We were doing right by our hometown,” he said. Campbell’s new plan calls for the company to expand its headquarters at a cost of about $72 million, and for state and local government agencies to pay more than $23 million for road improvements in the area. Instead of 500,000 square feet of office space in the development, the new plan calls for 200,000 square feet. The first plan was thrown out by a judge last year because of a conflict of interest on the city’s planning board. Last year, Ilan Zaken, an owner of the clothing retailer Dr. Denim and the hip-hop-oriented T-shirt maker Miskeen Originals, bought the Sears building and planned to restore it for about $1 million. Campbell’s officials are skeptical of Mr. Zaken’s plans and say that making the building usable would cost at least $6 million. “Should the Sears building not be restored, Campbell will still be here,” Mr. Sanzio said. The company preferred the original plan to raze the building, said Mr. Sanzio, adding the company might still buy the property. More Articles in New York Region »MOUNT LAUREL, N.J.

Buffett disclosed an 8.6 percent stake in the largest company in the sector. On Friday, the ketchup maker H. J. Heinz Company forecast quarterly profit above expectations and Hormel Foods posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Both benefited from price increases that helped offset rising commodity costs, though lower pork prices also aided Hormel. Even Campbell Soup Company, which missed analysts’ estimates for its fiscal second quarter, reported on Friday that its domestic soup business had improved and that it should benefit from price increases it took this month. Friday’s reports came a day after Mr. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had taken an 8.6 percent stake in Kraft Foods, making it the largest shareholder. “I think there’s a bit of a halo effect that comes with any announcement of Buffett taking a position in any security and how it ripples through the sector,” said Matthew P. Kaufler, portfolio manager at Clover Capital Management. Clover owns 670,596 Kraft shares and 364,576 Heinz shares. The Standard &amp; Poor’s packaged foods index rose more than 3 percent on Friday, to its highest level in almost a month. Food stocks are traditionally considered defensive plays when the economy slows, since people always need to eat. The shares, however, had been battered over the last two months by soaring prices for wheat, cocoa and other commodities. Adding to those cost pressures was concern that consumers in the United States would begin to balk at the price increases being used to offset some commodities’ costs. “We clearly know that we need to try to continue to advance pricing to try to keep up with these cost increases,” Jeffrey M. Ettinger, Hormel’s chief executive, said. He said that the company has not seen consumers balking at the prices in grocery stores, but added that its food service business was enountering some softness as consumers eat out less often. Hormel said profit rose to $88.2 million, or 64 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on Jan. 27, from $75.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier, on an 8 percent sales increase. Analysts on average forecast 58 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Campbell profit fell to $274 million, or 71 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 27, from $285 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier, despite a 7 percent increase in sales. Heinz said it expected a profit of 67 cents to 68 cents a share in the third quarter ending Jan. 30. Analysts on average were expecting 63 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Hormel shares rose 3.9 percent, Heinz shares rose 5.2 percent, Campbell rose 6.1 percent and Kraft was up 6.9 percent.

The Web site includes video clips from a cross-country trip that Ms. Horchow took in the summer, during which she spoke with women from Las Vegas to Nantucket, Mass., about making and maintaining friendships. The campaign, with a budget of $2 million to $3 million, includes a public relations initiative, a survey of American women on the topic of friendship and print advertising. The campaign is indicative of the efforts being made by mainstream marketers to take advantage of the growing ardor among consumers for online social networking. Ad spending on Web sites like Bebo, Buzznet, Facebook and MySpace  by companies like Blockbuster, Circuit City, Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Sony  is expected to total $1.2 billion this year, according to eMarketer, a research company, and climb to $1.9 billion in 2008. Marketers are also building their own Web sites that encourage socializing among consumers, with brand presences that range from understated to deafening. In addition to Pepperidge Farm, the marketers going into the social media business include Jockey, with a humorous site for young men (jockeyunderwars.com) devoted to a video contest, and Dove, with an earnest site for women (campaignforrealbeauty.com) devoted to subjects like body image and self-esteem. We started with this notion of wanting to move our communication with our consumers from telling them about us to having a dialogue with them, said Michael Simon, vice president and general manager at the Pepperidge Farm snacks division in Norwalk, Conn. To make possible that shift to two-way marketing from one-way marketing, Mr. Simon said, the company conducted ethnographic research by going into our consumers homes, sitting down with them, talking to them about how they use our products. During those conversations, this notion of connection came up again and again, he added, and how hectic lifestyles, life in general, has gotten in the way of women forging and strengthening ties with friends  over, say, a pot of tea and a plate of cookies. If Pepperidge Farm can present itself to those consumers as the brand that can help enable connections and reconnect with friends, Mr. Simon said, that will be seen in a positive light. There are of course drawbacks to becoming involved in the lives of consumers outside the realm of trying to influence their purchasing behavior. For instance, what if Pepperidge Farm helps one friend get in touch with another to remind her she has not paid back a debt? Maybe then she isnt a friend, Mr. Simon said, laughing. Some consumers might object to the commercial aspects of the site; for example, the Pepperidge Farm brand logo is prominent on the home page. Yes, theyre selling cookies, Ms. Horchow said in a telephone interview. But theyre also interested in getting into the nitty-gritty of this and helping bring people together. To curry favor with consumers, brands are realizing they have to do a lot more than making something that tastes good, she added. Connecting on a personal level with people makes your life better. Ms. Horchow, who praised Pepperidge Farm for asking me to spread my gospel about the benefits of social connections, will work with the company for a year, she said, adding that it may continue beyond that. Ms. Horchow plays a significant role in the public relations elements of the campaign, which are being produced by DeVries Public Relations in New York. The Web offers us so much opportunity for blowing ideas out, said James Allman, chief executive at DeVries. Were not confined to thinking about a 30-second spot. Many campaigns centered on social networking use little traditional advertising or none at all, said Mr. Allman, who previously worked for advertising agencies in New York like Ammirati Puris Lintas. For example, a campaign that DeVries developed for the Pantene hair-care line sold by Procter &amp; Gamble, which encourages women to cut their hair and donate it to cancer patients, was supported by minimal advertising, Mr. Allman said, and we are almost three times over our projected traffic for the Web site (beautifullengths.com).

Weakness in the soup business was mitigated by strength in the Pepperidge Farm cookie and cracker business and V8 juice line. “The soup business was weak, and you don’t like to see it, but it was offset by some great performance elsewhere,” said Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones. “V8 continues to do very well; Pepperidge Farm continues to do very well.” Soup sales were held down by an exceptionally warm autumn, but Campbell said it expected the business to “deliver better performance” as the fiscal year progresses. The first quarter is typically when retailers begin stocking up soup for the cooler fall and winter months. Campbell said net earnings were $270 million, or 70 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter that ended Oct. 28, down from $291 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 71 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said gross margins were hurt, as it spent more on advertising and marketing, and its price increases were not enough to offset higher costs for ingredients, especially wheat, which is used in the baking business and in making some soups. Net sales rose 7 percent, to $2.30 billion, aided by greater sales volume, a higher proportion of sales of more expensive products, and the weak dollar, which raised the value of overseas sales. The company has been increasing sales with newer products like lower-sodium soup, while also expanding its soup business into China and Russia. It said in August that it was exploring options for its Godiva Chocolatier business, which could lead to a sale of the upscale brand. Campbell shares fell 32 cents, to $34.94.

Campbell had threatened to abandon its corporate headquarters in Camden, where 1,200 employees work, if it did not get approval to demolish the building.

But Cocoa Puffs are another matter. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Making the Health Cut Trying to persuade critics the industry does not need government regulation, 11 big food companies, including McDonalds, Campbell Soup and PepsiCo, have agreed to stop advertising to children under 12 products that do not meet certain nutritional standards. Some of the companies, like Coca-Cola, have already withdrawn all such commercials or are in the process of doing so. Others, like General Mills, said they would withdraw them over the next year or so, while a handful agreed to expand their self-imposed bans to radio, print and Internet advertising. Still, the agreements will probably amount to a ripple rather than a sea change in terms of what foods children see pitched on their favorite television shows and Web sites. For example, while General Mills will no longer be advertising Trix to the 12-and-under crowd, it will continue to peddle Cocoa Puffs, which have one less gram of sugar per serving. And it will be able to continue advertising Trix on television shows and other media that are considered to cater to families rather than just children. That qualifier amounts to a major loophole, given the media-watching habits of children. An episode of Nickelodons SpongeBob SquarePants, for instance, is viewed by an average audience of 876,000 children age 6 to 11, according to Nielsen Media Research, and falls in the category of shows that are off-limits to ads for junk food. But American Idol from Fox, which qualifies as a family show, attracts 2.1 million children in the age group. The companies have also agreed for the first time to open their marketing plans to the Council of Better Business Bureaus and its Childrens Advertising Review Unit, which will review them and report publicly on the findings. This scrutiny and the pledges to self-regulate, which will be announced at a Federal Trade Commission event today, are an attempt to show corporate responsiveness to growing concerns about childhood obesity. We are hopeful that people will look at this and say that the community has done a substantial, enormous amount of work, said Dan Jaffe, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers. Advertisers spend some $900 million annually on television tailored to children under 12, according to industry estimates. Together, the companies involved represent two-thirds of the total childrens advertising market, according to the Better Business Bureau. Cadbury Adams, Coca-Cola, Hershey, Kellogg, Kraft, Mars and Unilever are the other participating companies. The nutritional parameters vary by company, but are all based on the 2005 United States Dietary Guidelines developed by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. A pat on the back from critics is unlikely. The pledges, which were made under the threat of regulatory intervention and, in some cases, the threat of lawsuits, fall short of the demands from child advocacy groups. Most critics have been pushing for uniform guidelines for marketers to follow and for oversight from a body with the authority to enforce them. This is great public relations for the companies, but it doesnt go nearly far enough, said Susan Linn, co-founder of the Boston-based group Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. It is going to be impossible to monitor if the companies are actually doing what they say. To some degree, the pledges appeared to be an effort by the food companies to get out in front of a forthcoming government study on childhood obesity. Senators Sam Brownback and Tom Harkin announced July 5 that they would postpone a report from a task force they formed with the Federal Communications Commission in lieu of the companies plans to announce concessions today. At the time, Senator Brownback said, The extension will allow for a more thorough examination of new initiatives. The financial impact of the pledges on television networks like Nickelodeon, ABC Family and Cartoon Network will depend on how well the food companies can tweak their products. Many of the companies are not automatically withdrawing their products from the airwaves; rather, they are trying to reformulate the foods to meet nutritional guidelines. If they cannot do so to their satisfaction, they say they will replace ads for so-called junk foods with spots for healthier alternatives. Cadbury Adams, the maker of Bubblicious chewing gum, says it will either withdraw advertisements of the brand from certain media or will direct half of its current Bubblicious budget to the promotion of healthier eating habits. The company declined to specify how much it spends promoting Bubblicious each year, but said that a healthier habit might be choosing a smaller portion of gum. MTV Networks, which owns Nickelodeon and other channels popular with younger viewers, expects the agreements to have minimal impact on its bottom line. Many products sold by these companies havent been on our air for years, said Jim Perry, executive vice president for ad sales at Nickelodeon and MTV Networks Kids and Family Group. Marva Smalls, executive vice president for Nickelodeon public affairs, added, We have been on the road pressing for this. 1 2 Next Page » Elizabeth Olson contributed reporting.

Even as other businesses fled  Campbell itself shut down a manufacturing plant in 1990  the company tried to breathe life into the town. In 1957, it opened a new corporate headquarters there; in 1970, it established the Campbell Museum, and in 1971, it built a new research complex. Long before anyone talked about corporate citizenship, Campbell was among Camdens most upstanding citizens. Now, as state and city planners struggle to give the town fresh momentum, the company can once again provide crucial support. Its proposal to spend $72 million to improve its headquarters and lure developers to a proposed adjacent office park would be a tremendous help. But the promise comes with a condition that runs counter to the companys well-deserved reputation for staying with Camden in good times and bad. Unless the city razes the 80-year-old Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company store, which Campbell believes would clash with its glistening new headquarters and office park, Campbell says it may leave town altogether. This could severely damage Camdens hopes for a comeback. We would urge Campbell to think again before risking its reputation for good citizenship and to explore other courses of action. One alternative would be to draw on the talent of noted architects and preservationists to work this historically significant building into its overall development plans. The building, located on a highway about a mile from Camdens downtown, is admittedly in poor shape. Sears left in 1971, and the structure has since been used as a car dealership and offices, and finally by the Camden Housing Authority. It is now vacant, with a hole in the roof and its front door gone. Campbell says it is an impediment to renewal. Constructed in the classical revival style, and listed on the state and national historic registries, the building was one of the first stores designed to take advantage of the countrys attachment to the automobile. Equipped with a 600-car parking lot, it lured shoppers from throughout South Jersey. Another reason the building is important to preservationists is that many of Camdens other significant buildings, including the Walt Whitman Hotel and several stately houses, have been torn down. Campbell says the city should be looking toward its future, not its past, and many New Jersey officials believe that in this situation Campbell holds all the cards. The city, they say, simply cannot take the risk that Campbell and its 1,700 employees and contractors might pick up their marbles and leave. That is a risk, but Campbell would suffer a terrible black eye if it left. And it might face a lawsuit if it tore the building down. Campbell could avoid all this trouble by taking a more imaginative approach and blending the old building with the new. One Camden retailer has indicated he would invest $1 million to open a store and offices in the building and says he would like to work with the company. Campbell is right when it says Camden must focus on the days ahead. But the citys comeback hopes will be even brighter if it can build on its past glory.

A colonnaded temple to both commerce and the automobile, the store, in the classical revival style, had a lot with parking spaces for about 600 cars. Skip to next paragraph Ryan Donnell for The New York Times The former Sears, Roebuck building in Camden is a designated historic site, but the door has been ripped off and the interior is rotting. The Campbell Soup Company says it interferes with its redevelopment plans. Ryan Donnell for The New York Times The Campbell Soup Company wants to demolish a 1927 building that housed a Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company store in Camden, N.J., and use the site to upgrade its headquarters, pictured here, and create an office park. But in 1971, as the middle class fled the city, the store closed, and reopened at a mall in nearby Moorestown. In the years afterward, most of the drivers who stopped by this despondent stretch of freeway were visiting seedy strip joints. And the old Sears building went on to become a car dealership, then an office. Today it is vacant, vandalized and in need of repair. Now, amid an effort to revive a city mired in a crippling cycle of crime and unemployment, the Campbell Soup Company, Camdens longtime and most prominent corporate resident, has proposed expanding its presence and transforming the area where the empty store sits into an office park. The soup company is prepared to spend $72 million to improve its headquarters, and has also promised to help lure developers to an adjacent office park with the help of $26 million in state funds. But the companys pledge comes with one nagging caveat: The Sears building, which is listed on state and national historic registries, must come down. If not, Campbell Soup, which has been an enormous presence in the city since 1869, may abandon Camden and go elsewhere. Thousands of the citys residents worked at the factory on the Delaware River, producing the famous condensed soup invented by John T. Dorrance, until the plant closed in 1990. The company still employs 1,200 workers at its corporate headquarters here, and its soup cans, which captured Andy Warhols fascination with the American marketplace, are visible everywhere in this city  on wall murals, hanging in courthouses and, most prominently, on the front of a downtown baseball stadium. Leveraging that reputation, the soup company says it could lure investors to the office park. But the Sears building, with its wide footprint, would thwart the effort, blocking the views of all the proposed development, including a view of the Campbell headquarters, the company said. If youre leaving Philadelphia, you would like that office park to be visible for potential occupants, said Anthony J. Sanzio, a Campbell Soup spokesman. This structure is completely inconsistent with what one would expect in a 21st-century office park. In mid-May, the citys planning board narrowly approved the soup companys application to raze the yellow brick building. Local leaders, ranging from the mayor to the heads of community groups, said it was important for Camden  one of the nations poorest cities, according to recent census figures and studies  to look forward, especially when the past and the present look the way the old Sears building does. As if to emphasize that point, in the past few days the front door of the building has been ripped down, exposing the buildings moldy innards. Those opposed to the demolition are a small but committed group that includes a former owner of the building, preservationists, a local activist, a Camden historian and the head of the local N.A.A.C.P. branch. They have asked questions about a citys connection to its past, and about the influence of corporations on development. Im not submitting to blackmail from anyone, said Frank Fulbrook, an activist here who has a filed a lawsuit against the soup company as well as the heads of the local planning board and the redevelopment agency, saying the planning board violated procedures when it approved Campbells demolition plans. I want Campbells to stay, but Im not going to beg them, said Mr. Fulbrook, who owns a few properties in Camden. For the city, the importance of the company  the only Fortune 500 corporation operating here  is hardly disputed. In fact, it is spelled out in the development agreement for the proposed 110-acre office park, which notes that the soup company is one of the largest taxpayers in Camden and contributes millions to local charities. In its odd but not-so-subtle vernacular, the agreement spells out the stakes: It says that if the soup company were to relocate its headquarters out of the city, it is probable that these numerous public benefits derived by citizens of the city, county and the State of New Jersey would be severely reduced if not eliminated. The importance of the faded Sears building, surrounded by abandoned buildings, overgrown lots and roads riddled with potholes, is less clear. But Paul W. Schopp, a consultant hired by the buildings previous owner  who in 2000 wrote the successful application for its designation as a historic site  sees it differently. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in New York Region »CAMDEN, N.J.  For decades after it was built in 1927, shoppers drove to the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company store on Admiral Wilson Boulevard just beyond the center of town. A colonnaded temple to both commerce and the automobile, the store, in the classical revival style, had a lot with parking spaces for about 600 cars. Skip to next paragraph Ryan Donnell for The New York Times The former Sears, Roebuck building in Camden is a designated historic site, but the door has been ripped off and the interior is rotting. The Campbell Soup Company says it interferes with its redevelopment plans. Ryan Donnell for The New York Times The Campbell Soup Company wants to demolish a 1927 building that housed a Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company store in Camden, N.J., and use the site to upgrade its headquarters, pictured here, and create an office park. But in 1971, as the middle class fled the city, the store closed, and reopened at a mall in nearby Moorestown. In the years afterward, most of the drivers who stopped by this despondent stretch of freeway were visiting seedy strip joints. And the old Sears building went on to become a car dealership, then an office. Today it is vacant, vandalized and in need of repair. Now, amid an effort to revive a city mired in a crippling cycle of crime and unemployment, the Campbell Soup Company, Camdens longtime and most prominent corporate resident, has proposed expanding its presence and transforming the area where the empty store sits into an office park. The soup company is prepared to spend $72 million to improve its headquarters, and has also promised to help lure developers to an adjacent office park with the help of $26 million in state funds.

The company raised its full-year profit forecast and a spokesman said Campbell expects trends in the soup business to improve in the third quarter as frigid temperatures have hit much of the country. Campbell said profit rose to $285 million, or 72 cents a share, from $254 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the gain on the sale of a Pepperidge Farm center, earnings were 68 cents a share, ahead of the 63 cents expected by analysts, and Campbell's stock rose $2.71, or 7 percent, to $42.29 a share. Sales in the period, which ended Jan. 28 and was the second quarter of Campbell's fiscal year, rose 4.2 percent, to $2.25 billion, though soup sales in the United States fell 1 percent. The company, based in Camden, N.J., said retailers built up less soup inventory in the quarter than a year earlier, likely as a result of the warmer weather. Campbell said it now expected earnings from continuing operations to rise 10 to 12 percent in fiscal year 2007, up from its previous forecast of a 5 to 7 percent increase.

French fries, ice cream, candy, cupcakes and potato chips from the machines, lunch lines, school stores and even school fund-raising events could disappear under a voluntary agreement between the companies and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation. The plan, which may take effect at the beginning of the next school year, is the first nationwide effort to set strict nutrition guidelines for school vending machines. Because the guidelines are voluntary, critics say they will not be effective. Both the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a frequent critic of the food industry, and the School Nutrition Association want government regulation instead. Our organization feels pretty strongly that we need some kind of nutrition guidance from the Department of Agriculture, said Janey Thornton, president of the nutrition association. Dr. Carlos Camargo, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health was more positive. I think its helpful for groups that have traditionally denied any connection between snack foods and obesity or health to be acknowledging now that there are links, and that moves the agenda forward, Dr. Camargo said. A bill introduced in the Senate this year would require the Agriculture Department to set standards for snack foods based on those that the Institute of Medicine is expected to issue by the end of the year. The agreement will be more difficult to implement than those announced in May between the three largest soft drink companies and the alliance, which is a partnership of the William J. Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association, in which companies agreed to replace sugary soft drinks with more healthful beverages. The soft drink companies account for 90 percent of soft drinks in schools, which are sold through the company distributors. But there are about 70 snack food companies that supply schools, and those products are sold through independent vendors who are not in the agreement. That means yesterdays initiative will require the companies to educate vendors on the need for more healthful snacks. At the news conference announcing the new initiative, former President Bill Clinton said: The companies are going to work to convince distributors and even their competitors to follow suit. I think after today, their competitors are going to have a very difficult time explaining why they wont. Several company officials agreed. The power of this alliance is to get others to join it, said Charles Nicholas, a spokesman for Frito-Lay. Under the guidelines, products could contain no more than 35 percent sugar by weight and have no more than 230 milligrams of sodium. No trans fats would be allowed. No product could get more than 35 percent of its calories from fat. The guidelines would also set calorie limits for each serving based on age: 150 calories for elementary school children, 180 calories for middle school children and 200 calories for high school students. The five food manufacturers  Dannon, Kraft Foods, Mars, PepsiCo and the Campbell Soup Company  agreed to make specific changes in what they sell to schools. They are the following: ¶Mars has created a new line of nutritious snacks. ¶Frito-Lay, a unit of PepsiCo, is reformulating several products to meet the guidelines. ¶Kraft is decreasing the sodium and calories in products it sells for school vending machines. ¶Campbell is promoting soups that are lower in calories, fat and sodium, and offering additional products with less sodium. ¶Dannon is reducing the sugar content of its Danimals drinkable yogurt by 25 percent. Some states and school districts already have strict limits on food sold outside the government-regulated school lunch and breakfast programs. But the Center for Science in the Public Interest in a survey of states found that two-thirds of them had either extremely weak policies on snack foods or no policy at all. Dr. Thomas Robinson, associate professor of pediatrics at the Stanford School of Medicine and director of the Center for Healthy Weight at the Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital, takes the long view: This problem is similar to what happened to tobacco over the last several decades; things happened incrementally, Dr. Robinson said. Mr. Clinton reminded his audience that problems of this magnitude arent solved in a day. We didnt get in this fix overnight, and we wont get out of it overnight, he said.

Sprinkled into everything from bread to cheese, soups and breakfast cereal, just about every fast-food restaurant meal and now even fresh cuts of meat, salt is ubiquitous in the American food supply. And according to government data, Americans eat far too much of it. Now the nations largest doctors group, the American Medical Association, is going after the government and the food industry to reduce what it sees as a persistently high level of salt in many processed foods. At its annual meeting in late June, the medical association recommended that the Food and Drug Administration limit the amount of salt that food companies are allowed to add to products. Specifically, the medical association, which had never before called for regulation of a food ingredient, asked the F.D.A. to revoke salts long-time status as a substance that is generally recognized as safe, a classification that warrants little oversight. Instead, the F.D.A. should regulate salt as a food additive, the medical group said. If the recommendation were adopted, packaged-food companies would have to adhere to limits on allowable sodium levels for various categories of food, and speed up the search for an alternative to salt as a preservative and flavor enhancer. The initiative has thrust salt into the limelight as a public health concern and raised questions over how attentive the F.D.A. has been to the problem of excess sodium consumption. In response, the F.D.A. says that within the next few months it will solicit comments in preparation for a hearing or workshop on the health concerns about salt, something the agency has never done before. The food industry, which adamantly opposes any regulation of salt, is lobbying the government to stop any attempts to force companies to limit salt in food. Last month, the head of the Salt Institute, Richard L. Hanneman, met with Dr. John O. Agwunobi, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, to lobby against salt regulation by the F.D.A. The Salt Institute represents companies like Morton International, based in Chicago, and United Salt, based in Houston. The total value of the United States salt market is $340 million. Mr. Hanneman said he argued that the science did not support reductions of salt across the board. He is in the same camp as a minority of scientists, some of whom are consultants to the Salt Institute, who question whether lowering salt consumption would benefit large numbers of people. Mr. Hanneman instead pushed for the health agency to finance a comprehensive study on the overall health effects of reducing salt. There are a variety of effects that can happen with lowering sodium, some of them negative, so I dont think we should be just considering the one effect of lowering blood pressure, said Dr. Michael H. Alderman, professor of epidemiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Dr. Alderman says he is a consultant to the Salt Institute but that he is not paid for his work. Dr. Agwunobi did not return calls seeking comment. Most other health experts, however, long ago accepted that excessive sodium consumption leads to various health problems. Along with the American Medical Association, groups like the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine and the governments National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute say it has been known for at least two decades that salt-induced high blood pressure, or hypertension, is a significant contributor to heart disease and stroke, the No. 1 and No. 3 causes of death in the United States. (Cancer ranks second.) In 2004, researchers at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute published a study in The American Journal of Public Health concluding that 150,000 lives could be saved annually if sodium levels in packaged and restaurant foods were cut in half. Food companies say they are working voluntarily to lower the amount of sodium in their products. The industry has paid great attention to overall sodium levels, said Robert Earl, senior director of nutrition policy at the Food Products Association, a lobbying group representing packaged food manufacturers. It has responded over decades by creating reduced-, low- or no-sodium products, as well as making changes that the consumer never sees. Despite such efforts, American sodium consumption has not declined in recent years. The governments dietary guidelines say that the average young adult should eat less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day and that the threshold should be 1,500 milligrams for certain people  those with high blood pressure, African-Americans (who are at higher risk for hypertension) and anyone middle-aged or older. Yet, on average, Americans consume more than 3,300 milligrams of sodium a day, compared with 3,100 milligrams in 1994, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »FRANK HALL knows he probably should not eat Hungry-Man dinners.

The company increased prices on soups and other products earlier this year and those increases appeared to be working, analysts said. New products like premium soups in cartons and microwaveable versions of older varieties also helped soup sales, the company said. Earnings rose to $166 million, or 40 cents a share, from $146 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. The profit exceeded the 35 cents a share expected by analysts. Shares of Campbell's rose $1.10, to $33.75. Sales in the period, which ended April 30 and was the third quarter of Campbell's fiscal year, rose 6 percent, to $1.84 billion, a figure that was also better than analysts had expected. The company said soup sales and profits were helped by its move away from promotions, which have the effect of cutting into prices, and into advertising. The company raised its earnings forecast to a 9 percent to 10 percent increase over the $1.64 a share posted the previous year. In February, Campbell said it was raising prices on some of its soup, sauce and beverage products by a weighted average of 2.3 percent as it tried to offset higher expenses, particularly for oil. Tomato prices are also rising, and the company said it now expected inflation to add 4 percent or more to costs next year, compared with its previous outlook of 3 percent to 4 percent. Sales of soup rose 15 percent in the United States in the quarter, the company said. The total United States soup, sauces and beverages segment had a 14 percent increase. Pepperidge Farm sales rose 11 percent, though overall baking and snack sales were nearly flat. International soup and sauce sales fell 1 percent, hurt by currency factors.

Excluding one-time items, the company posted a better-than-expected 8 percent rise in fiscal first-quarter earnings, as the price increases helped offset rising costs of commodities, packaging and energy. Though the price increases cut into sales volume, sales of higher-margin condensed soups - the kind sold in Campbell's familiar red and white cans - rose 1 percent in the United States, helping profitability. The quarter compares with a strong year-earlier period, when Campbell spent heavily on promotions to help spur soup sales, while its rival, General Mills, raised prices on its Progresso soups. This year, Campbell raised suggested retail prices on its soups and some other products by an average of 4.8 percent to offset rising costs. The company, which also makes Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers and Godiva chocolate, said profit was $302 million, or 73 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter that ended Oct. 30, compared with $230 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings in the 2006 first quarter included a $60 million benefit for a tax settlement related to transactions involving government securities, an $8 million tax expense related to repatriating earnings from non-United States subsidiaries and a $13 million gain on an adjustment in how the company accounts for inventory. Sales rose 1 percent, to $2.11 billion. Analysts on average had forecast $2.13 billion.

A campaign that began this week for the Campbell's Select line of higher-priced soups features the actor John Lithgow singing and dancing in commercials that offer humorous tributes to the brand. The campaign, carrying the theme "Why settle when you can Select," is being created by BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. In the commercials, Mr. Lithgow performs over-the-top songs about Campbell's Select and a new variety, Select Gold Label, that were written by David Yazbek, who also wrote the music and lyrics for the songs Mr. Lithgow performs in his hit Broadway show "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels." Skip to next paragraph Forum: Media, Advertising and Marketing The campaign is the most elaborate send-up of musical comedy to be sponsored by a premium-priced soup brand since 1970, when Stan Freberg presented Ann Miller in a commercial, tap-dancing atop an eight-foot replica of a can of Great American Soup, sold by the H. J. Heinz Company. The Campbell's Select campaign, with a budget estimated at more than $20 million, is part of efforts by giant food marketers to persuade consumers to pay more for products that are presented as being of better quality than ordinary brands. Campbell's Select is priced about twice as high as the Campbell's condensed soups bearing the red-and-white labels, and Select Gold Label is about 15 percent to 20 percent more than Campbell's Select. (Think of the progression as going from Ford to Mercury to Lincoln.) Among other examples of the trend are a new line of premium-priced boxed chocolates from Russell Stover Candies, called Russell Stover Private Reserve; a new sandwich, the Portobello Mushroom Six Dollar Burger, introduced last month by the Carl's Jr. division of CKE Restaurants; and clothing sold by Wal-Mart Stores under brand names like George and Metro 7, which are meant to be more fashionable than the retailer's more prosaic apparel. Campbell Soup has sold Campbell's Select since 1999, when the line, called Home Cookin' upon its debut in 1983, was renamed and restaged. That Select soups are ready to serve (unlike the red-and-white label soups, to which water must be added) is meant to appeal to those who buy soups like Progresso, sold by General Mills. But a sales chart for Campbell's Select resembles a yo-yo's path, according to data from Information Resources, a company that tracks product sales in food, drug and mass-market stores, excluding Wal-Mart (which does provide that data to research services). Sales rose to $205.4 million in Campbell's 2003 fiscal year, from $170.5 million in fiscal 2001, only to fall to $151 million in fiscal 2005. (The fiscal year ends on July 31.) Recent sales growth for the red-and-white and Chunky soup lines "gives us the opportunity to fix the Select brand," said Sean Connolly, vice president and general manager for United States soup at Campbell Soup in Camden, N.J. "In the last 22 years, the brand has changed its label, its look, its name," he added. "That inconsistency has led to an inconsistent level of performance." So now, Campbell's Select is to be positioned as what the company is calling "premium irresistible soup," Mr. Connolly said, because "we know from our research that premium soup represents a tremendous growth opportunity, not only in soup but across numerous categories." With the "Why settle when you can Select" theme, he added, the company is hoping to appeal to a "target audience who we call food lovers, women ages 25 to 54 who are willing to try new products, willing to trade up, by delivering a product that lives up to the promise of irresistible premium-quality taste." That promise is made by Mr. Lithgow in a devil-may-care manner through song-and-dance numbers in the commercials, which are directed by David LaChapelle, known for photography and music video clips. Many of the spots start with Mr. Lithgow on a set presented as his home kitchen, which swings open in the center to reveal a set representing a stylish restaurant-cum-nightclub peopled with the glamorati. "At last, a soup as irresistible as me," Mr. Lithgow declares, tongue firmly in cheek, in a commercial for a Select Gold Label variety called Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato. Among the lyrics to his song: Why settle when you can Select Why not go go for gourmet? Hey, don't be a schlepper, this Roasted Red Pepper Tomato is Restaurant-style soup all the way Mr. Lithgow is "someone who represents fine taste, quality, the essence of the brand, but will not be elitist, better than thou or a snob," said Ed Maslow, senior vice president and senior creative director at BBDO New York. That could have been the impression consumers took from the campaign if the ads had featured a chef, gourmet or celebrity who symbolized good taste, he added, which would not have "felt comfortable in the Campbell's franchise." The Broadway-style presentation is meant as "a celebration of the product that says 'new,' " Mr. Maslow said, and the lyrics are "specific to what the soup is exactly about" without being boring like a recitation of product attributes delivered by "a talking head." The commercials are appearing on broadcast television series like "Ghost Whisperer," "Medium" and "Two and a Half Men" as well as during cable reruns of shows like "Crossing Jordan," "Law &amp; Order" and "Will &amp; Grace." Print advertisements are to appear in magazines in which Campbell Soup typically advertises, like People, as well as in magazines read by the target audience, like Bon Appétit, Food &amp; Wine, Newsweek, O: The Oprah Magazine and Real Simple. Heinz and Mr. Freberg, the humorist turned ad man, beat Campbell Soup by more than three decades to the idea of a commercial for higher-priced soup centered on an elaborate production number. In the Great American Soup commercial, Ms. Miller sang "Let's face the chicken gumbo and dance," accompanied by 20 chorus girls and the Billy May Orchestra while 4,000 jets of water colored red, white and blue gushed behind them. The commercial became so well-known that it was widely mentioned in the obituaries for Ms. Miller, who died in January 2004. Mr. Maslow said that he was "vaguely familiar" with the Great American Soup commercial, adding, "Someone told me about it." "In no way did it influence what we did here," Mr. Maslow said. "What Great American Soup did had nothing to do with this whatsoever." Perhaps there can be an "American Idol"-type contest between the Campbell's Select and Great American Soup spots. The victor could face the winner of a showdown between the look-alike commercials for the Apple iPod and Lugz boots.

I had only been with StockPot for six months. Everything was going swimmingly. We were all nodding and smiling, and I was feeling extremely proud of myself. Then I made the mistake of asking the chef if there was anything else she wanted to know. She asked if our soups began with a base or a stock and I answered that we used a base. I was met with silence. My answer destroyed the moment. The meeting ended soon afterward and we lost the sale. Later, I asked our chef what was wrong with what I said. He explained that a stock starts with roasted bones, and a base is a mix of dehydrated vegetables and spices. The stock is generally considered superior. I said that with a name like StockPot we really needed to start with a stock, and I made him change over 100 soup recipes. He hated me for three months. When I started at the company, the corporate plane stopped in Cincinnati, where I lived, to pick me up and fly me to Seattle. It was my moving day, and I had all of my things with me. The senior executives from Campbell headquarters in Camden, N.J., were on the flight to brief me. I moved around from seat to seat and met with them, one after the other. It was an unusual first day on the job. That was the old plane with red bands around it that identified it as belonging to Campbell. Recently, on a flight in the company's new corporate plane from Philadelphia to Oakland, I got a phone call on the flight and thought to myself, "Do I rock!" I tried to act nonchalant as I strolled to the cockpit to take the call. After I hung up I asked the pilots where we were. All I could see were the clouds and the mountains below. I wanted to know if they navigated by things they recognized. For instance, did they know to take a left at a certain mountain peak? One said no, they mostly used autopilot. My staff knows that they're going to get a ton of assignments when I can download the e-mails I've written during the flight. I always take a spare battery with me on these flights so I can work for hours. Once a flight attendant tapped me on the shoulder to say that someone complained about my fingernails clicking on the laptop keys. You have no idea how difficult it is to type quickly on the pads of your fingers when you have long nails. I'm the passenger the flight attendant has to tell twice to shut down the laptop before landing. If I'm traveling with a colleague he usually says: "They're saying people have to shut equipment down now. Are you going to do it or wait until they tell you a third time?" As told to Patricia R.

Kraft Foods, Nestlé, Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup are all working with a biotechnology company called Senomyx, which has developed several chemicals, most of which do not have any flavor of their own but instead work by activating or blocking receptors in the mouth that are responsible for taste. They can enhance or replicate the taste of sugar, salt and monosodium glutamate, or MSG, in foods. By adding one of Senomyx's flavorings to their products, manufacturers can, for instance, reduce the sugar in a cookie or salt in a can of soup by one-third to one-half while retaining the same sweetness or saltiness. Now, for instance, a 10 3/4-ounce can of Campbell's Home-style chicken soup, which the company says contains two and a half servings, has more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium. That would probably be cut to a little over 1,500 milligrams when the chemical is added. (The government recommends consumption of no more than 2,400 milligrams of sodium a day.) Unlike artificial sweeteners, Senomyx's chemical compounds will not be listed separately on ingredient labels. Instead, they will be lumped into a broad category - "artificial flavors" - already found on most packaged food labels. "We're helping companies clean up their labels," said Senomyx's chief executive, Kent Snyder. Senomyx, based in San Diego, uses many of the same research techniques that biotechnology companies apply in devising new drugs. Executives say that a taste receptor or family of receptors on the tongue or in the mouth are responsible for recognizing a taste. Using the human genome sequence, the company says, it has identified hundreds of those taste receptors. Its chemical compounds activate the receptors in a way that accentuates the taste of sugar or salt. It is still experimenting to determine the most potent compounds, its chief scientist, Mark Zoller, said. While food safety experts applaud efforts to reduce salt, MSG and sugar, they expressed concerns about the new chemicals, saying that more testing needed to be done before these were sold in food. But Senomyx maintains that its new products are safe because they will be used in tiny quantities. Kraft, Nestlé, Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup have contracted with Senomyx for exclusive rights to use the ingredients in certain types of food and beverages, although the companies declined to identify those categories. Elise Wang, an analyst at Smith Barney, said that Kraft was planning to use Senomyx's sweet flavoring to reduce the sugar in powdered beverages like Kool-Aid by one-third. Campbell Soup, she said, is looking at cutting sodium levels by a third with the salt flavoring. "There's applicability for our soups, sauces and drinks like V8," a spokesman for Campbell, John Faulkner, said. A Kraft spokesman declined to offer specifics on the company's relationship with Senomyx, but said that Kraft was committed to reducing the sugar and salt levels in many products. Nestlé and Coke also declined to comment. Senomyx's salt enhancer, in particular, has the potential to be a boon to the food industry. For years, corporate scientists have been looking in vain for ways to reduce sodium levels in packaged food without losing flavor. "It's a real challenge," said Christine M. Homsey, senior research food scientist at Food Perspectives, a consulting firm in Plymouth, Minn. "Nobody's come up with anything even close to ideal." The Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group based in Washington, is seeking to get the Food and Drug Administration to pay more attention to the high sodium levels in packaged foods. In February, it filed a lawsuit seeking to force the F.D.A. to regulate salt as a food additive. The effort, if successful, could spur companies to limit salt in their products. Mr. Synder said that Senomyx's salt enhancers were still in the development phase and would not appear in foods for at least two years. The company's most advanced product, he said, is its replacement for MSG, which last month received safety approval from the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association. He expects food items with this product to appear in supermarkets sometime in the first half of next year.

"That's an actress," I said, "not his mother." Needless to say, Griffin was quite disappointed. I was wrong. That was Wilma McNabb, the true mother of Donovan. But in 2001, her son's first year as part of Chunky's "mama's boys" campaign, an actress portrayed her. It was at that commercial shoot that Wilma, a former nurse, had an epiphany. "I said: 'I can do that. I can do what she's doing,' " she said by telephone yesterday. "I knew all the lines. I'd seen the script." (And, she said, she had always served Campbell's soup at home. "Was there any other?" she said.) The agency that created the campaign - which has featured John Elway, Kurt Warner, Michael Strahan and Terrell Davis with their faux mothers - found Wilma McNabb gregarious and gave her a chance to mother her son and his Philadelphia Eagles teammates with various Chunky flavors. "I remember our agent called and said, 'They want to do something different and they want to use you,' " she said. Now, she is the only mother - real or not - in the campaign, which is part of Campbell's sponsorship that makes it the National Football League's official soup. "She is very good on her feet," said James Caporimo, executive creative director of Young &amp; Rubicam. "We were a little nervous at first. But she turned out to be a star. She's very poised. And there's no question she's gotten better. She's really terrific." The Chunky campaign has merged fiction with the reality of Wilma McNabb's cooking macaroni and cheese ("too much cheese for us older folks") and red beans and rice for her son and teammates. The commercials portray her as the Eagles' den mother, reading stories to players in a hotel room ("John Elway drove 98 yards"), steering the team bus driver away from stopping at a roadside fast-food joint, and knitting scarves and caps for players. "Let's hear a battle cry!" she shouts to players on the sideline in one of the commercials this season. In the other, her son says, "Our team's a family; she's the mom," which prompts the team to douse her with a bucket of Gatorade. "They really got me," she said about the bucket that was dumped on her. "I didn't know they were doing it, so you could see they had the element of surprise." John Faulkner, a spokesman for Campbell's, said that the McNabb commercials "resonate because of the very public role she plays with the team." The homey scenes of Mother McNabb dishing out soup in the Eagles' locker room is a jarring reminder that the less wholesome Terrell Owens-Nicollette Sheridan opening to "Monday Night Football" was filmed in the same locale. But no soup for T. O.! Although Donovan is the undisputed family star, Wilma, who is better known as Charlene (her middle name), or Char the Star, is easily recognized. She is usually visible on television during games, watching from a luxury box at Lincoln Financial Field. People ask her to repeat her "battle cry" exhortation, and she said that when she travels with the Eagles, rival fans say: " 'Oh, here's Miss Chunky.' It's intimidation with Chunky." She said, "This is fun, but I don't like the notoriety." Campbell's does not offer sales figures to back the Donovan-Wilma effect on Chunky sales, but Caporimo of Young &amp; Rubicam said he was pleased that the soup giant had given the players-and-their-mothers campaign time to develop since 1997. "A lot of clients don't give the time for a campaign to gain traction," he said. "It's like a snowball and it builds." He added that the agency was not unhappy when references to the Chunky Soup Curse cropped up because of injuries to Davis, Warner and, yes, McNabb. Perhaps, some online wags suggested, it was vengeance wreaked by the use of fake moms over real ones. "When it becomes part of the vernacular, it's more than a commercial," Caporimo said. Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director of Pickett Advertising, who analyzes athletes' marketing appeal, said the commercials used humor effectively, sold Chunky as a "hearty meal" for people as large as a football player and were not shown so often that the audience got tired of the message. Now, as she has since she first got the Chunky gig, Wilma McNabb will wait until after the Super Bowl to see if Campbell's wants her back for another season.

That's because the Camden-based company is retiring the Franco-American name of its canned pasta and gravy.

Campbell bought the Franco-American company -- a leading commercial food manufacturer of its time --in 1915. It was started by a French immigrant, Alphonse Biardot, in Jersey City in 1887.

The Pepperidge Farm unit of Campbell Soup has asked BrightHouse Live in Atlanta to develop concepts for advertising the Goldfish line of crackers, pretzels and other snacks, which Y.&amp; R. Advertising, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam Brands division of the WPP Group, has handled since 1998. Although Y.&amp; R. Advertising remains the agency of record for Goldfish, as it does for other Pepperidge Farm products, it is now BrightHouse Live's assignment to present Pepperidge Farm with what the company hopes will be the next clever campaign. Advertisement The decision by Pepperidge Farm is the first such step affecting the Campbell Soup account at Y.&amp; R. Advertising, which also includes brands like Pace salsa, Chunky soup, V8 beverages and Prego pasta sauces. The move is emblematic of the attempts by big marketers to search beyond the usual suspects for more effective selling strategies. Marketers besides Campbell Soup that are expanding their agency relationships in unexpected directions include Anheuser-Busch, BMW, Burger King, Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever. "We have a very solid relationship with Y.&amp; R.," Nan Redmond, director for corporate and brand communications at Pepperidge Farm in Norwalk, Conn., said yesterday. "There has been no realignment of agency-of-record status," she added, "but now BrightHouse Live is working on developing some new creative communication directions for the Goldfish brand." "There's a special strategic direction here we're looking to," Ms. Redmond said, which she declined to discuss, citing competitive reasons, "and we felt it requires additional capabilities." Neither Pepperidge Farm nor BrightHouse Live previously disclosed the agency's new role on Goldfish. After this reporter received an e-mail message last week from an unfamiliar address discussing the decision, Ms. Redmond confirmed it, as did executives of Y.&amp; R. Advertising and BrightHouse Live. "We've been doing it for a couple of months," said Michael Edmeades, who joined BrightHouse Live as president when it was opened in November 2003 by BrightHouse, a strategic consultant described by its founder, the adman Joey Reiman, as an "ideation corporation." Mr. Edmeades said Goldfish was the first packaged-goods assignment for BrightHouse Live, which he called "a hybrid between an advertising agency and a marketing consultancy." BrightHouse Live also has clients like the ESPN cable television network. Pepperidge Farm spent $6.5 million to advertise Goldfish in major media during the first eight months of the year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, compared with $11.1 million in the period a year ago. For all of 2003, spending totaled $16.3 million, TNS reported, almost unchanged from $16.7 million in 2002. Pepperidge Farm sells more than a dozen varieties of Goldfish, from the traditional orange-colored fish-shaped crackers to exotic styles like Baby Goldfish, Giant Goldfish, Flavor Blasted Goldfish and Goldfish Colors. Many campaigns are aimed at children and teenagers, with others geared toward the more traditional adult snack buyers. Sales of the myriad Goldfish lines totaled $249.9 million in the 52 weeks that ended Oct. 31, according to Information Resources, down 0.4 percent from the period a year ago. The data include sales in supermarkets, drugstores and mass-merchandise chains except for Wal-Mart Stores. Goldfish marketing was fairly prosaic for many years, and sales had been flat, until 1995, when Pepperidge Farm tried new advertising, additional varieties and improved distribution. The agency then was Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York, which lost the Goldfish assignment along with the other Pepperidge Farm products in 1998 to Y.&amp; R. Advertising in a consolidation by Campbell Soup. The most recent work for Goldfish from Y.&amp; R. Advertising, Ms. Redmond said, has been aimed at the so-called tween market, ages 8 to 12, as well as teenagers. One campaign reintroduced Flavor Blasted Goldfish with new flavors and packages. The data from Information Resources showed a 43.4 percent increase in dollar sales of the line in the 52 weeks that ended Oct. 31. Another recent campaign, Ms. Redmond said, introduced Goldfish Sandwich Snackers, two crackers with fillings between in flavors like cheddar cheese and peanut butter. In September 2003, Y.&amp; R. Advertising brought out a major campaign for the Pepperidge Farm brand that introduced an animated character, a driver of a Pepperidge Farm truck, meant to personify brand traits like quality and freshness. Liz Reilly, a spokeswoman for Y.&amp; R. Advertising, said the agency has had "extreme success with the Campbell brands" it handles. Y.&amp; R. Advertising has been closely watched since Ann Fudge, an executive with a background in packaged-goods marketing, joined Y.&amp; R. Brands last year as chairwoman and chief executive. In that time, the agency has landed clients like Callaway Golf, Toys "R" Us and Weight Watchers International and kept one account, 7Up, from departing. But some clients like Burger King and Kraft Foods have left, and the large Jaguar account was placed in review this month.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/business/23soup.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Profit Up 9% at Campbell as It Reverses Slump in Soup<date>Published: November 23, 2004</date><text>y The Associated Press The Campbell Soup Company reported a 9 percent gain in first-quarter profit yesterday as sales of products from soups to chocolates rose. Earnings for Campbell in the quarter that ended Oct. 31 were $230 million, or 56 cents a share, up 9 percent from the period a year ago, when profit was $211 million, or 51 cents a share. The company's performance beat the consensus expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call by 4 cents. Sales rose nearly 10 percent, jumping to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion. The company, based in Camden, N.J., reiterated its expectations that earnings per share would grow by 5 percent to 7 percent in the fiscal year that ends at the end of July. Campbell is in the fourth year of a campaign to deal with gradually declining sales of its profitable condensed soups. In a conference call yesterday with analysts, company executives said sales of condensed soup were up 10 percent over the 2003 period, reversing a trend of slumping sales in that division. The chief executive, Douglas R. Conant, said Campbell still had a long-term goal of stabilizing condensed soup sales - not necessarily expanding them. Campbell's ready-to-serve line of soups, which includes the Chunky brand that is heavily advertised during televised N.F.L. games, had 18 percent growth from the period a year ago. One reason sales grew faster than profits was that marketing costs rose 7 percent. In addition to soup, Campbell brands include V8 juices, Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers, Prego pasta sauce, Pace picante sauce and Godiva chocolates. Shares closed up $1.35, or 4.9 percent, to $28.71.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E6DF1E39F937A1575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;ref=campbellsoupcompany">COMPANY NEWS; CAMPBELL NAMES CHAIRMAN AND RAISES ITS DIVIDEND<date>Published: September 24, 2004</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company named Harvey Golub, a former chief executive of the American Express Company, as chairman and raised its quarterly dividend 7.9 percent to reflect improving sales and profit.

O'Neill, then the United States Treasury secretary, set off a furor here by suggesting that the country might have avoided collapse had it ever bothered to learn to export. The real trouble with Argentina, Mr. O'Neill told The Economist, is that "they don't have any export industry to speak of at all." He added: "And they like it that way." While Argentina is still far from becoming a trade powerhouse, one company that has bucked the trend for decades by successfully selling abroad is Swift Armour S.A. Argentina, the country's leading meat products company. Unlike most of its domestic rivals, Swift generates more than 70 percent of its sales through exports, and inward-looking Argentina desperately needs the dollars earned by exports to stabilize its large debt. Run by Carlos Oliva Funes, a soft-spoken executive with more than three decades of experience in the beef business, Swift is generating jobs and setting an example for other Argentine companies that are seeking to increase sales by tapping into foreign markets. The company has added almost 1,000 people to its payroll since 1999, bringing its work force to 2,570; during that time many of its competitors cut workers. And at the government's urging, Swift is now sharing some of its expertise with smaller companies that want to export tea, honey, olive oil and other products. "Swift has always gotten the bulk of its revenue from exports, and that's helped us weather the ups and downs of the economy," Mr. Oliva Funes, 61, said in an interview at the company's headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires. "It's worked well for us, so we're sponsoring some small companies to try and teach them a little bit about how to export so they can do the same." Founded in 1907, Swift has long been a big name in Argentina's beef industry, employing as many as 23,000 people after the government briefly took over the company in the early 1970's. Swift became a private company again in 1977 when a local investment group led by Mr. Oliva Funes bought it and set out to streamline it to make it more profitable. Three years later, a smaller but more efficient Swift changed hands again when the Argentines sold out to the Campbell Soup Company of Camden, N.J., though Mr. Oliva Funes stayed on as a director. For most of the next two decades, Swift thrived as one of Campbell's biggest suppliers of frozen and canned beef, used to make soups. In 1997, Campbell's transferred control of Swift to a subsidiary, Vlasic Foods International, which was spun off as an independent company a year later. But Vlasic soon decided to abandon its commodity businesses and focus on its operations in the United States, and it put Swift up for sale in 1999. Hoping to seize the chance to buy the company back, Mr. Oliva Funes started hunting for investors. Before long, he brought on board two Wall Street private equity funds, J. P. Morgan Latin America Capital Partners and Greenwich Street Capital Partners, which divided up a 49 percent stake in Swift. With the help of Argentine investors, Mr. Oliva Funes raised $55 million and took a 51 percent stake in the company. Swift got off to a rocky start under new ownership. The company was hit hard by a drop in beef prices after outbreaks of mad cow disease in Europe and of bovine hoof-and-mouth disease in Argentina. Brazil's decision to devalue its currency in early 1999 also hurt Swift's earnings, making Brazilian beef more competitive on world markets. The Argentine peso was still pegged to the American dollar at that time. By 2003, Swift's sales had dropped to $137 million a year from $160 million in 1999. To weather the storm, Swift sealed long-term contracts with big buyers like Campbell's and Kraft Foods, and actively sought out new clients around the globe. Today the company exports beef products to 70 countries and is on track to report more than $200 million in sales this year. "We used to be a reliable supplier for Campbell's Soup," Mr. Oliva Funes said. "Now we're a reliable supplier for a variety of companies all over the world." Swift's aggressiveness also helped it ride out Argentina's economic crisis better than most. When the Argentine economy collapsed in late 2001 and most investors were pulling money out of the country, Swift went on a buying spree. In 2002, Swift spent $4 million to buy Cabaña Las Lilas, one of Argentina's best-known brands of premium beef. A few months later, it snapped up a bankrupt meatpacking plant near the Uruguayan border named Vizental for $8 million, which increased its production capacity by about 35 percent. "In the middle of the crisis, instead of pulling back, what we did was raise our bet by going out and buying more assets," said Alfredo M. Irigoin, a partner in the Buenos Aires office of JPMorgan Partners, the private equity arm of J. P. Morgan Chase &amp; Company. "But if Swift hadn't been such an exporter, forget it, it wouldn't have paid off." Other Argentine companies are starting to follow Swift's example, taking advantage of a weak peso to export. The government expects export revenues to grow 14 percent this year to a record $33.5 billion, though this is mostly because of a jump in prices for commodities like soybeans and oil. Brazil, by contrast, is on track to bring in more than $90 billion from exports this year. But most companies here, especially the smaller ones, still face formidable obstacles to becoming exporters. Credit remains scarce and costly, making it hard for companies to market their products to potential overseas buyers. With a few exceptions, foreign investors have been reluctant to fill that void, preferring to wait and see if Argentina's economic recovery is sustainable. Moreover, the government, strapped for cash, levies taxes of up to 45 percent on exports to help pay the country's huge public-sector debt, currently equivalent to about 127 percent of gross domestic product. "There are several companies doing a good job at exporting, but it has taken years of persistence," said Enrique S. Mantilla, the president of the Chamber of Exporters of Argentina. "There's talent here, but it's not easy to put that talent to use in a country with so much volatility."</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/14/business/14soup.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Marketing Cost Cited as Profit Falls at Campbell<date>Published: September 14, 2004</date><text>y Bloomberg News The Campbell Soup Company said yesterday that fourth-quarter profit declined 20 percent, the biggest drop in more than two years, as costs for marketing and job cuts rose. Net income fell to $59 million, or 14 cents a share, from $74 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Sales in the period ended Aug. 1, which was a week shorter than the year-earlier quarter, dropped 1.5 percent, to $1.43 billion. Excluding the impact of the shortened quarter, sales rose 5 percent, helped by higher prices and the weaker dollar. Advertisement The company increased promotions to stem declines in condensed-soup sales as more consumers buy ready-to-serve versions. It also eliminated about 400 jobs, or less than 2 percent of workers, resulting in costs of 5 cents a share. The quarter's results included a gain of $6 million, or 2 cents a share, from the sale of a closed factory in California. Excluding the sale and costs to cut jobs, profit was a penny short of the 18-cent average estimate by Thomson Financial. Campbell "is doing an impressive job driving top line, but little of this progress seems to be dropping to the bottom line," David Nelson, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst in Chicago, wrote in a report. Shares of Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., fell 70 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $25.50. They have declined 4.7 percent this year. The company, which also makes Godiva chocolates and Pepperidge Farm cookies, is adding products like reduced-sodium V8 juice and Goldfish crackers free of trans-fats to appeal to health-conscious consumers. It is also promoting its ready-to-serve soups. Sales of ready-to-serve soups including the microwavable Select lines climbed 8 percent in 2004, with Soup at Hand sales more than doubling. United States sales of condensed soup, which require mixing with water, declined 2 percent last year as consumers switched to more convenient soups. Campbell said it expected per-share earnings in fiscal 2005 to rise 5 percent to 7 percent, the same level it forecast in June. It had expected profit to rise as much as 8 percent. Campbell, which had about 25,000 employees worldwide as of August 2003, said in June that it was reducing layers of management, leaving unfilled open positions and eliminating redundant operations. In February, the company combined its North American soup, sauces and beverages businesses into a single unit.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE6DE1E31F935A3575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;ref=campbellsoupcompany">MEDIA; Products Slide Into More TV Shows, With Help From New Middlemen<date>Published: September 6, 2004</date><text>Leslie Moonves loves to talk about the Steven Spielberg movie ''Minority Report.''

''That movie was packed with brands,'' he said. ''I sat in the movie theater and thought A, the movie's working, and B, if Spielberg can do it without compromising the artistry, we can, too.'' Television networks have worked hard in the last two years to strike their own product placement deals, closing the gap with the movies. CBS plans to broadcast product-themed nights, with a single brand featured on consecutive shows, although Mr. Moonves declined to offer details. Entire episodes of NBC's ''The Apprentice'' will revolve around one brand: instead of selling lemonade or giving rickshaw rides, the aspiring business tycoons will sell Mars's newest candy bar, hawk Crest toothpaste and construct a new toy for Mattel. Campbell's Soup has been written into ''American Dreams,'' with NBC and the soup maker sponsoring a real-life essay contest mirroring one in the show's plot. The new emphasis on product placement in television has brought new players into the business -- brand wranglers who work with programmers and advertisers. They are pushing the placement, which they like to call ''brand integration,'' into new territory, sometimes acting as co-producers and even building new programming around the brands. ''There's been a gold rush that reminds me of the Internet 10 years ago,'' said Scott Donaton, editor of Advertising Age and the author of ''Madison &amp; Vine,'' a book about the convergence of the entertainment and advertising industries. ''Many went to the advertisers and said, 'You can't handle Hollywood. Let me do it for you.' Then they went to the networks and promised to handle the advertisers.'' Some of the new integrators are traditional product placement firms, while others are advertising agencies that have started entertainment divisions. New companies devoted to product integration have also popped up. All see the chance to profit from the growing closeness between programmers and advertisers, who have been forced to band together to counter falling ratings, a fragmented audience and new technology like digital video recorders that allow viewers to skip traditional commercials altogether. Madison Road Entertainment, which calls itself an independent, advertiser-driven television studio, is one of the newest players. The two-year-old Los Angeles company was created by Tom Mazza, the former president of Columbia TriStar Television; Jak Severson, a longtime marketing executive; and Rob Long, a former writer for ''Cheers.'' The company worked on some of this season's highest-profile product integration deals -- for example, helping bring Levi's, Crest and Mars to the ''The Apprentice.'' Madison Road also struck a deal to brand the photo shoots that cap episodes of UPN's ''America's Next Top Model,'' and its executives said they had a deal in the works for the Fox Network's ''Bernie Mac'' show. But the small company is hunting much bigger game. Madison Road is aiming to create what programmers and advertisers call branded entertainment, working products into the fabric of a show from the start of its development. ''The best way to bridge these two worlds, who often speak very different languages, is to come in at the very beginning of the creative process,'' the president of the company, Mr. Mazza, said. He said a cable channel had ordered a pilot for a branded show created by Madison Road, and that six others were in development. He would not discuss details. Alliance, the product placement arm of the advertising company Grey Global, is moving aggressively into the product integration business. Its chief executive, Jarrod Moses, recently brokered a deal for the Hasbro game ''Operation'' game to be written into NBC's medical show ''Scrubs.'' Now he is pushing the company further.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/25/business/company-news-campbell-soup-to-cut-400-employees-worldwide.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">COMPANY NEWS; CAMPBELL SOUP TO CUT 400 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE<date>Published: June 25, 2004</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company will reduce its work force by about 400 workers worldwide, mostly through layoffs, the company announced.

That earnings total is up from $96 million, or 23 cents a share, registered a year earlier.Sales in the quarter rose to $1.6 billion from $1.4 billion.The company's profit was 4 cents higher than the expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call, and Campbell stock rose $1.50, or 7 percent, to $22.95 a share.Results last year were pulled down by $17 million worth of one-time charges and accounting changes. Excluding those factors, earnings in the quarter a year earlier were 27 cents a share.The company said sales of condensed soup increased 2 percent for the quarter, but have fallen 6 percent for the fiscal year so far.Campbell's chief executive, Douglas R. Conant, singled out the improved soup sales to explain the unexpectedly strong quarter.''It's clear that the investments we have made in improving the quality and convenience of our products are beginning to have a meaningful impact on our results,'' Mr. Conant said.North American soup sales grew to $600 million from $516 million, an increase of 16 percent.Sales of sauces and beverages, biscuits and cookies were up, as well as overseas sales of soups.But the profits on sauces and beverages, and biscuits and confectionery products, slipped from a year ago, the company said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/business/company-news-campbell-drops-interim-from-division-president-s-title.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">COMPANY NEWS; CAMPBELL DROPS INTERIM FROM DIVISION PRESIDENT'S TITLE<date>Published: April 11, 2003</date><text>Campbell Soup said yesterday that it had named Larry S.

But the timing of the grant in 2001 was delayed, resulting in no grants issued to employees in fiscal 2001, and two issued in fiscal 2002.The only people who received option grants in fiscal 2001 were Doug Conant, who was hired as CEO in January 2001, and a small number of other executives who received grants in their sign-on packages. Therefore, if you calculated the percentage of options that were granted that year to the company's top five highest paid executives, you would arrive at 87.1 percent, an abnormally high number. The percentages of options that were granted to the top five highest paid executives in fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2002 are 6 percent, 7.3 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. If you look at this trend, it's clear that fiscal year 2001 was an aberration.JOHN FUREYCamden, N.J., Nov. 14.The writer is vice president and corporate secretary of the company.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/14/business/campbell-soup-s-earnings-decline-6.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Campbell Soup's Earnings Decline 6%<date>Published: November 14, 2002</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company reported today that its first-quarter profit fell 6 percent. The company said higher sales of snacks were more than offset by a sharp drop in soup sales compared with a year ago.The results beat Wall Street estimates. Net income was $161 million, or 39 cents a share, for the three months that ended on Oct. 27. A year earlier, the company, which is based in Camden, earned $171 million, or 42 cents a share.Excluding a one-time charge of $31 million, Campbell earned $192 million, or 47 cents a share. That topped the estimate of 44 cents from analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. The charge was to cover the decline in value of a business Campbell bought in fiscal 1999, Stockpot, which makes fresh and frozen premium soups.First-quarter revenue totaled $1.71 billion, down 1.4 percent from $1.73 billion in the period a year ago.Sales in the biscuits and confectionery division grew 8 percent, to $410 million, as Pepperidge Farm cookies and Goldfish crackers, Arnott's cookies and Godiva chocolates all posted growth.But sales at the North American soup divisions fell 7 percent, to $746 million, with American soup shipments down 8 percent and condensed soups down 14 percent.Shares of Campbell rose $1.63, to $21.42.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/us/campbell-recalling-soup-in-wrong-cans.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Campbell Recalling Soup in Wrong Cans<date>Published: October 07, 2002</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company is recalling one day's production of cream of mushroom soup after cans were found to contain New England clam chowder, which could pose a danger to people allergic to shellfish, the company said.It was not clear how many cans were affected, but Campbell said it was ''a small quantity.''

That matched the consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.A year earlier, Campbell, the world's biggest soup maker, reported net income of $52 million, or 13 cents a share. Sales in the fourth quarter totaled $1.22 billion, up 5 percent from $1.16 billion a year ago.Douglas R. Conant, the chief executive, said the company had made substantial progress in the restructuring plan. A 17 percent increase in spending on marketing did not bring as much return as hoped, but it helped increase sales of products like soups, V8 juices, Prego pasta sauces, Arnott's biscuits and Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers.''We feel very good about the momentum we're building,'' Mr. Conant told analysts in a conference call.He said more changes were needed to ''get the product portfolio right.'' But he expects a stronger financial performance in the fiscal year just begun, he said, followed by an even better one in fiscal 2004. The company forecast earnings per share of $1.35 for fiscal 2003, excluding a likely gain of about 12 cents a share from the effect of new accounting rules.

The whole time I was in college and graduate school, I was no more than 10 miles from home. But I became interested in tennis at 13 or 14 and traveled to tournaments all over the country.I won several championships in Illinois and attended Northwestern University on a tennis scholarship. I found that I was better at teaching tennis than playing it, so I became a tennis pro. In my first year of graduate school, a few of us volunteered to give lessons to underprivileged students from the area. There was a shy girl of about 6 who would sit on the bench and watch me the whole two hours, from 5 to 7 p.m. After a few days, I asked if she would like to try.At first she couldn't even catch a ball with two hands. By the end of the summer, she was able to hit a backhand solidly while on the move. I gave her an old racquet I had, and she'd hit the ball against the fence while I gave lessons. The more she could hit the ball, the more I saw her self-esteem grow. It turned out that she had great athletic ability.I have taught tennis to my wife, Leigh, too, but in turn she has enhanced my creative side. When one of my former employers, Parker Brothers, was sold and I had to look for a job, the company sent me to a handwriting expert and said I could bring my wife. I've had hundreds of hours of management training, and I got more out of that one hour than from all those courses. The expert told us to write a couple of sentences for her to analyze. While I wrote mundane things like ''My name is . . .'' my wife wrote part of a Shakespeare sonnet. Our conversation with the expert highlighted how incredibly richer my life is because of what my wife has exposed me to.On my first day at my first job, with General Mills in Minneapolis, I was still tan from teaching tennis. I had long hair and a Fu Manchu mustache and a tan line where my sweatband had been. I wore a khaki suit, a yellow shirt, a madras tie and Earth Shoes. After I looked around and saw what other employees looked like, I made a quick trip to a clothing store.My first assignment was to write the message from Betty Crocker on the back of the potato-bud package. My mother thought this was hilarious. She was from the South and believed in home cooking. We always had rice or freshly mashed potatoes. First, she asked: ''What's a product manager?'' And then: ''What do you know about Betty Crocker?''In business as in tennis, I love to win. I tell people two things. First, if you've committed to something, you'd better deliver.Second, don't be a pain. Just as Tom Hanks said in the movie ''A League of Their Own'' that there's no crying in baseball, there's no whining in business.</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/29/business/company-news-campbell-soup-to-acquire-erin-foods-from-greencore.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">COMPANY NEWS; CAMPBELL SOUP TO ACQUIRE ERIN FOODS FROM GREENCORE<date>Published: June 29, 2002</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Erin Foods unit of the Greencore Group for $26 million to gain sales in Ireland.

The results were hurt in part by higher marketing expenses.Campbell said it earned $122 million, or 30 cents a share, in the quarter that ended April 29, compared with $139 million, or 32 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.The results matched analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. In mid-February, when the forecast had been 32 cents a share, Campbell said it expected earnings of 28 to 30 cents.Net sales for the company, based in Camden, N.J., rose to $1.44 billion from $1.39 billion, propelled by a 7 percent volume increase in soup business in the United States. Consumer purchases of soup rose 12 percent, the company said.Douglas R. Conant, who took over as chief executive in January, has bolstered marketing spending to renew interest in Campbell's lines of canned soups.''I think the Street is holding its breath and waiting to see exactly what Doug Conant does,'' said Leonard Teitelbaum, a Merrill Lynch analyst. ''He certainly has made changes to personnel; he has positioned the company to get closer to the trade and to monitor execution more carefully.''Total marketing costs rose 10 percent in the quarter, while advertising increased about 50 percent. Campbell's United States division posted quarterly growth in most of its soup lines, especially Chunky and Campbell's Select. Still, the company's share of the soup market has fallen 1.5 percent in the last year and is now 69 percent, Campbell said.Recent inventory reductions by retailers have led to lower-than-expected soup shipments, Campbell executives told analysts in a conference call. If that continues, fourth-quarter shipments could be flat.In a statement, Mr. Conant called the market share unacceptable. Still, he said that ''the significant marketing investments we made in soup clearly had an effect on our third-quarter performance.''Overall sales of soups and sauces rose 3 percent, to $955.2 million. Biscuits and confectionery items increased 4 percent, to $362.7 million.Campbell said it expected earnings for the full fiscal year of $1.60 to $1.64 a share before one-time items, reiterating projections given earlier in the year. First Call analysts are expecting $1.64.In trading yesterday, shares of Campbell rose 5 cents, to $30.</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/17/business/company-news-campbell-creating-separate-division-for-soup.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">COMPANY NEWS; CAMPBELL CREATING SEPARATE DIVISION FOR SOUP<date>Published: April 17, 2001</date><text>Campbell Soup, which has been struggling to revive its soup business, will split its North American division into two units, one for soup and the other for beverages, sauces and prepared foods, the company said yesterday.

Campbell Soup responds to Progresso attacks ads.<date>Published: March 07, 2001</date><text>THE empire of soup is striking back.The Campbell Soup Company, seeking to stem further erosion of its once-commanding lead in the American soup market, is beginning to respond to assertive attack advertising that has been appearing for more than two years on behalf of its primary rival, the Progresso brand of soups sold by the Pillsbury Company unit of Diageo P.L.C. The Campbell response, in the form of three television commercials, is running in Northeastern cities where Progresso has made significant inroads into Campbell's sales and is likely to be expanded.''We're making clear there are product-based differences'' between the two brands in the quality and quantity of soup ingredients ''that make the Campbell line superior to Progresso's,'' said Tom Sebok, executive vice president and managing director at the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.BBDO New York is creating the tough new Campbell ads along with the New York office of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam division of the WPP Group.The Campbell commercials echo the tactics and tone of the commercials that have been running since late 1998 for Progresso, down to deriding the eating of the competitor's brand as a childish habit that adults ought to outgrow. The Progresso spots are created by the New York office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, part of the Bcom3 Group.The Campbell counterthrust is indicative of a more confrontational attitude that has pervaded advertising, particularly in the once prosaic field of packaged goods. Increasingly, campaigns reflect the growing sophistication of American shoppers, who have become well versed in comparing and contrasting the various brands they regularly buy.''We're going to be aggressive in supporting our business and meeting competitors of all sorts,'' said Jeremy Fingerman, vice president for United States soup at Campbell in Camden, N.J. ''People will be surprised at how well we compete.''The Campbell response spots come after the company decided last fall to reintroduce its long-running campaign carrying the theme and jingle ''M'm! M'm! Good!'' as part of intensified efforts to reverse a sales slump in its mainstay Campbell's condensed soups, known by their red and white labels.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/28/business/company-news-campbell-hires-two-executives-to-shore-up-soup-sales.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">COMPANY NEWS; CAMPBELL HIRES TWO EXECUTIVES TO SHORE UP SOUP SALES<date>Published: February 28, 2001</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company said yesterday that it had hired two consumer-products veterans to fill new positions to revive its soup sales.

The price was generally in line with analysts' expectations.Unilever executives also said that the group was close to a long-expected sale of Bestfoods Baking, which could fetch as much as $1.4 billion. Unilever is talking to the Sara Lee Corporation about the baking unit, which includes Entenmann's, Freihofer's and other brands in the United States, but it has declined to give details of the negotiations.In a television interview from Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World Economic Forum, Antony Burgmans, the Unilever co-chairman, said today that news of a deal would emerge ''pretty soon,'' but he did not elaborate.Unilever's divestitures have fueled speculation among analysts that it might be planning to bid for the Clairol cosmetics business in America, which is being sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb. But Nicolas Sochovsky, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said Unilever was far more likely to use the proceeds to pay off debt, which stood at 1.8 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last September, because the company ''has got a lot to prove to the market'' after the Bestfoods acquisition.For Campbell, which has struggled to generate earnings growth on its own, the deal will bring significant expansion in Europe, including factories in Britain, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Sweden that employ about 1,300 workers. The brands Campbell is acquiring have annual sales of about 435 million euros ($402 million), Unilever said. While they have grown only slowly in recent years, they command steady profit margins of around 18 percent.The deal is still subject to approval by the European regulators whose conditions on the $24.3 billion Bestfoods acquisition led to the sale.Patrick Cescau, Unilever's foods director, said Campbell had bought all the brands Unilever had to sell, and that by concluding the deal swiftly it had spared its employees some uncertainty. Mr. Sochovsky at Lehman Brothers said a ''clean sale'' to a single buyer ''would be viewed by the market as reasonably positive.'' Unilever shares rose 2.5 pence, to 509 pence, in London.Unilever announced a $5 billion program almost a year ago to trim its work force and focus on 400 top-selling brands. But while culling lines, it has also been buying aggressively in the United States, snapping up Slim-Fast Foods and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream as well as Bestfoods.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/09/business/campbell-soup-picks-chief-playing-down-talk-of-sale.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Campbell Soup Picks Chief, Playing Down Talk of Sale<date>Published: January 09, 2001</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company announced yesterday that it had hired a new chief executive, fueling speculation that the largely family-owned company intended to overcome its troubles by rebuilding instead of seeking a sale.After nine months of searching, the company selected Douglas R. Conant, 49. He is an experienced food industry executive who built a reputation by reinvigorating well-known but often listless brands at Nabisco, a chief rival of Campbell, which also makes Pepperidge Farms baked goods, V8 juice and Godiva chocolates.Though he has never before been a chief executive, Mr. Conant said his background as a turnaround specialist especially suited him to rebuilding Campbell Soup. Sales of Campbell's trademark soups are lower than they were a decade ago, sending the company's revenue into a tailspin last year and forcing it repeatedly to warn investors to lower expectations.''It's not daunting at all,'' Mr. Conant said in an interview. At Nabisco, whose acquisition by Philip Morris was completed last month, Mr. Conant inherited flat sales of Lifesavers and Planters peanuts, only to propel their growth into double digits. ''I've been doing this for 25 years, and this is very manageable.''Well regarded though Mr. Conant is, not all analysts share his optimism. Mr. Conant succeeds David W. Johnson, 68, who first took the helm in 1990, when the company was also struggling. Aggressive at cutting costs, Mr. Johnson presided over Campbell as its stock rose nearly sixfold in eight years, to a high of more than $60 in 1998.Then his successor, Dale F. Morrison, abruptly left last March after Campbell's stock fell more than 50 percent during his three-year tenure, and Mr. Johnson came out of retirement to right the company once more.The company's revenue and stock price have recovered somewhat. But many analysts say that could be primarily attributed to easy comparisons versus the previous fiscal year's poor performance and the search by investors for havens from high-technology storms.''It's all about the soup,'' said Leonard Teitelbaum, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''That is the engine, if that doesn't go, the earnings aren't going to be there.''</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/16/business/with-campbell-s-profit-down-13-it-may-not-be-soup-just-yet.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">With Campbell's Profit Down 13%, It May Not Be Soup Just Yet<date>Published: November 16, 2000</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company said today that its fiscal first-quarter profit fell 13 percent because of higher marketing costs aimed at increasing soup sales.Net income in the quarter, which ended on Oct. 29, fell to $204 million, or 47 cents a share, from $235 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose slightly, to $1.78 billion from $1.77 billion, the company said.Campbell said it spent 14 percent more on advertising of soup in the United States, where it controls more than 70 percent of the market. David Johnson, the company's interim chief executive, said in September that Campbell would increase marketing spending to try to win back customers it has lost to cheaper store brands or to premium soups sold under the Progresso label of Diageo P.L.C.''It is good that Campbell is spending more money on advertising,'' said Mark Bogar, a fund manager at Putnam Investments, who holds about 580,000 Campbell's shares. ''But I don't know what the outcome is going to be.''Soup shipments in the quarter rose 4 percent in the United States. October soup sales in the United States rose by a ''high single digit'' percentage from a year earlier, said F. Martin Thrasher, president of North American operations, who added, ''We are seeing encouraging signs that the fight-back plan is working.''Still, earnings for the year will be largely unchanged from last year's $1.65 a share, Mr. Johnson said in a conference call with investors and analysts, as the company continues to spend money on marketing and other initiatives.Shares of Campbell rose 67 cents today, to $30.48. The stock price has increased about 20 percent over the last month or so, buoyed by takeover speculation. Campbell, the world's largest soup maker, has been cited by analysts as a potential takeover target of ConAgra, the No. 2 food company in the United States.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/15/arts/tv-notes-ethical-question-of-a-view-host-having-her-soup-and-eating-it-too.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">TV NOTES; Ethical Question Of a 'View' Host Having Her Soup And Eating It, Too<date>Published: November 15, 2000</date><text>If you watch ''The View,'' ABC's late-morning talk show, you are likely to hear a lot about Campbell's Soup.Last week, for instance, one of the co-hosts, Meredith Vieira, said while sitting on the set, ''I have to give Campbell's a lot of credit because my daughter, Lily, won't eat anything. But she eats Campbell's Mega Noodle.''Barbara Walters, who is also the anchor of ''20/20 Friday,'' responded, ''Didn't we grow up -- eating Campbell's soup?'' Her co-hosts replied, ''Mm! Mm! Good!''In other segments the program's co-executive producer, Bill Geddie, sampled a Campbell's ''soup of the day'' on camera.These references and segments are part of an arrangement between the show and Campbell Soup Company: in return for an undisclosed sum that ABC executives said would cover the cost of the trip to Los Angeles by ''The View'' this week, ABC and the show agreed to incorporate on-air discussions and feature segments involving Campbell into eight programs of which Campbell is the primary sponsor.ABC is calling the arrangement, which was disclosed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, an experiment. But it raises questions about whether such an arrangement is appropriate on a show that is partly owned by and stars one of the most famous journalists of ABC News, Ms. Walters. Ms. Walters's production company, Barwall Productions, is a co-owner of the program with ABC.Integrated advertising campaigns, staples of television in its early days, are not uncommon now. They are becoming more prominent as advertisers seek ways to reach an increasingly splintered audience that is ever ready to click to other channels during commercials. For instance, for its hit reality show, ''Survivor,'' CBS not only sold commercials to Target, the discount chain, and to Reebok, the sneaker company, but it also prominently featured those companies' products on the show.But Ms. Walters is a news personality, and such a promotional campaign would violate the rules for her prime-time program, ''20/20.'' ABC News does not allow this type of integrated advertising with its sponsors because it would clearly taint reporting that is supposed to be authoritative and unbiased.ABC said it was allowed on ''The View'' because it is considered an entertainment program and is overseen by ABC Daytime, an entertainment division. It does not have advertising policies as stringent as ABC News's.In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walters said that she saw how the arrangement could be perceived as problematic.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/nyregion/l-be-more-clear-on-what-s-in-soup-cans-164046.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Be More Clear On What's in Soup Cans<date>Published: September 17, 2000</date><text>To the Editor:The Soapbox ''Mmm, Mmm, Genetically Engineered'' (Aug. 27) by Jerry Flanagan assures us that yellow journalism is alive and well in New Jersey. Are we to believe that, as this patchwork of innuendo and less-than-half-truths implies, that Cambell Soups are harmful, in spite of their certification for soundness by both the Federal Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration?The essay mentioned a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that found that when a Brazil nut's gene was engineered into soybeans, people with nut allergies would have react badly to the beans. To raise this issue disregards the facts.Well before the soybean with the Brazil nut gene was ready for marketing, the seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred, brought the new beans to the University of Nebraska to evaluate allergic potential. The results showed that the beans could induce an allergic reaction. Knowing that allergic reactions to Brazil nuts were on the order of one in 100,000 and that the number of potential deaths from eating the beans would be less than two a year, the company canceled its soy bean program. That's what Mr. Flanagan should have told us. If Campbell's vegetables contain Brazil nut genes, fish genes or antibiotic marker genes, he should say so. Innuendo is uncalled for.MELVIN A.

M'M! GOOD SLOGAN<date>Published: September 10, 2000</date><text>Campbell Soup Company last week reported a steep drop in quarterly and yearly earnings and sales, a day after the world's largest soupmaker said it was resurrecting its ''M'm! M'm! Good!'' slogan to boost soup sales. Camden-based Campbell put much of the blame on a 4.5 percent decline in consumption of its United States soups. For its fourth quarter, ending July 30, Campbell reported earnings per share of 14 cents, a 50 percent drop from 28 cents for the same period a year ago. Net fourth-quarter earnings were $59 million, down 62 percent from $121 million a year ago. Net sales in the quarter declined 8 percent to $1.2 billion, down 5 percent before the effect of currency and divestitures. Sales in the fiscal year Fiscal were $6.3 billion, down 2 percent from the previous year. The company on Wednesday launched six new 30-second television ads focusing on the condensed soups and a new ready-to-serve line. The campaign will continue through April. Campbell also will advertise in newspapers and on radio. The ads, which are part of the company's ''back to basics'' plan, will focus on the health benefits, wholesomeness and convenience of the soups, including new pop-top cans on ready-to-serve varieties.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/business/quarterly-net-to-fall-short-at-campbell.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Quarterly Net To Fall Short At Campbell<date>Published: September 08, 2000</date><text>The Campbell Soup Company, the world's biggest soup maker, said today that its first-quarter profit would miss estimates because of higher spending intended to increase demand.Earnings for the quarter ending in October will fall short of analysts' forecasts by 6 to 8 cents a share, Campbell said in a statement. The company was expected to earn 52 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.This is the second time in four months that Campbell has said earnings will fall short of forecasts. David Johnson, the company's interim chief executive, said Campbell would advertise more as it tries to woo consumers who switched to cheaper store-brand soups or bought soups made by the Progresso unit of Diageo P.L.C. Soup sales in the United States have been little changed over the last year while Campbell's sales have dropped about 4.5 percent.''Consumers did not reach for our brands with the same love and loyalty as before,'' Mr. Johnson said in a conference call. ''We neglected our fundamentals and we got our just deserts.''Shares in Campbell, which also makes Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers and V8 vegetable juice, have declined about 41 percent over the last year. They fell 25 cents, to $25.13 today.Investors said they were not surprised by the report of falling soup sales.''It's a dullsville story,'' said John Stratton, the president of Stratton Management. ''The question for them is how do you grow your business again? With a new ad campaign? They're kind of grasping at straws.''The company, based in Camden, said profit for fiscal 2001 would be about even with the $1.65 a share it earned this year. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.69, according to First Call.This week, the company said it was returning to the ''M'm! M'm! Good!'' slogan that made its soups a household staple in the 1930's. Campbell controls more than 70 percent of the United States soup market.As part of the slogan's revival, Campbell plans to increase marketing spending by double-digit percentages in the first half of fiscal 2001, the company said during the conference call. It declined to give specific dollar figures.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/03/business/l-which-burner-965464.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Which Burner?<date>Published: September 03, 2000</date><text>To the Editor:It was only after I put down the paper and went into the kitchen for a little lunch that I realized something about your article on the destiny of the Campbell Soup Company (''The First Family of Soup, Feeling the Squeeze,'' July 30).Matters dynastic, corporate, executive, financial, promotional, sociological, historical, genealogical -- even equestrian -- filled the pages.

They spend their time raising horses and frequenting upper-class haunts like Newport, R.I. Except for a flurry of news reports about a decade ago, when the question of whether they would sell the Campbell Soup Company last arose, they mostly stay out of the papers and keep low profiles. They did not return repeated phone calls over the last month seeking interviews.And while John T. Dorrance, the chemist who went to work for his uncle and came up with the idea of condensed soup, spent more than 30 years at Campbell, none of his nine surviving grandchildren are active at the company.John T. Jr., known as Jack, was the last Dorrance to run Campbell. His three children split about a third of the company when he died in 1989. The eldest son, John III, whose main claim to fame was his decision in the mid-90's to become an Irish citizen in what some critics viewed as a tax-avoidance move, has sold his stake. The other two are Campbell directors: Bennett, a Phoenix real estate developer who is active in local philanthropy; and Mary Alice Malone, who owns a horse farm, Iron Spring, in Coatesville, Pa. She is known for competing in dressage.George S. Strawbridge Jr. and Diana Strawbridge Wister are the children of Margaret, one of Dr. Dorrance's four sisters. Mr. Strawbridge, who is a Campbell director, has a reputation as a savvy investor whose business sense prevailed over emotion in the mid-90's, when, as a large shareholder, he was instrumental in selling two Philadelphia banks. He is also president of the National Steeplechase Association. Ms. Wister lives in luxurious locales like Mount Desert Island, Me.Another branch of the family includes Charlotte Colket Weber and Tristram C. Colket Jr. Ms. Weber, also a Campbell board member, divides her time between New York and Ocala, Fla., where she breeds thoroughbreds. Mr. Colket is a director of Vlasic Foods International, the ailing pickle maker that Campbell spun off in 1998.Dorrance Hamilton and Hope van Beuren, the daughters of Elinor, formed a voting trust to pool their shares. Mrs. Hamilton is very active in philanthropy in Philadelphia. Mrs. van Beueren lives near Newport, and her son, Archbold, is the only family member working for Campbell, as president of Godiva Worldwide, in Manhattan.

In headline after headline, one food company after another has committed to a sale or a merger, leaving the descendants of John T. Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup more than a century ago, with an agonizing decision: Should they sell the Campbell Soup Company, which has been in the family's hands for three generations but is now struggling? Or should they hire new management to revive flagging sales of its chicken noodle and tomato soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies and perhaps become an acquirer itself?Despite its status as family-controlled company, Campbell has been managed over the last decade to emphasize the quarterly results favored by Wall Street analysts and large outside investors. Under its energetic chief executive, David W. Johnson, Campbell boasted ever-fatter profit margins and a stock price that climbed nearly sixfold in roughly eight years, to more than $60 a share in 1998, just after he left.But those gains did not last long after Mr. Johnson handed over management of the company to Dale F. Morrison in 1997. In recent years, consumers have increasingly turned away from Campbell's familiar red-and-white cans to soups that seem fresher and easier to open and prepare. As overall sales of canned soup have flattened, Campbell has lost business to cheaper private-label brands and, more recently, its nemesis, Progresso. And competitors like Nabisco have nibbled away at its Pepperidge Farm cookie and cracker business.Lately, with many rivals joining forces and gaining clout with supermarket chains, the threat to Campbell has grown. ''The fundamentals of the business seem to be putrid,'' said Art Cecil, an analyst for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, which owns shares in Campbell.Mr. Cecil is not alone. Campbell's stock now trades at $26.4375, down 56 percent from that 1998 peak. For the fiscal year ended last August, the company earned $724 million on sales of $6.4 billion, but more recently, the results have deteriorated. Earnings fell 14 percent in the quarter ended in April, compared with the period a year earlier. Despite all the merger talk, only one Wall Street analyst is now recommending the stock.Correction: August 6, 2000, Sunday An article last Sunday about the prospects for the continued independence of the Campbell Soup Company misspelled the surname of an analyst at Prudential Securities who said the company was being hurt by changing consumer preferences. He was John McMillin, not McMillan.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/20/business/food-companies-urged-to-end-use-of-biotechnology-products.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">Food Companies Urged to End Use of Biotechnology Products<date>Published: July 20, 2000</date><text>A coalition of consumer and environmental groups announced yesterday what they hope will be the biggest and best-organized effort yet in the United States to pressure food companies to abandon the use of genetically modified crops.Starting with the Campbell Soup Company, the coalition said it would target well-known food companies and try to generate thousands of consumer letters, phone calls and signatures on petitions urging them to stop using genetically modified foods until more testing was done. The group also wants all companies to label products that contain such ingredients.In Europe, food companies have largely abandoned the use of such ingredients because of consumer opposition fanned by aggressive campaigns. But in the United States, consumers have expressed little concern about genetically modified foods and many are not even aware that such foods are being sold.''This is going to be the first sort of sustained effort on the European model,'' said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, one of the groups in the coalition, the Genetically Engineered Food Alert.The coalition could spend $1 million, or more, he said. That is still considerably below the $50 million a group of agricultural biotechnology companies committed in April to spend over several years on television advertising and other measures to defend their products.The group has named no other targets yet than Campbell. But Jean Halloran of Consumers Union, which is cooperating with the coalition though not a member, said the coalition would choose ''corporations that have food products that Americans really regard as staples of their kitchen, that they feed to their kids.'' Besides soup, Campbell makes Pepperidge Farm cookies, V8 juice, Prego pasta sauce and Godiva chocolates.John Faulkner, a Campbell's spokesman, said the company saw no need to eliminate genetically engineered ingredients because they were as ''equally nutritious and equally safe'' as nonmodified ones. He said that fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of calls to the Campbell's consumer hotline concerned genetic engineering. And even if Campbell wanted to eliminate such ingredients, he said, it could not, because a large percentage of the corn and soybeans grown in the United States is genetically altered. ''We don't control the supply chain,'' he said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/06/business/the-markets-market-place-a-higher-bid-puts-pressure-on-bestfoods.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Higher Bid Puts Pressure On Bestfoods<date>Published: June 06, 2000</date><text>The board of Bestfoods met last night to discuss a sweetened takeover offer of about $20 billion, or $72 a share, from Unilever amid increasing pressure from shareholders to sell the company.At the same time, Bestfoods was pursuing a $15 billion purchase of the Campbell Soup Company, the beleaguered maker of canned soups that has been struggling to expand its business over the last several years. One person involved in the talks said the company would also discuss its options with Campbell at the board meeting, which may resume today. Representatives of Campbell and of Bestfoods refused to comment on the reports.Unilever increased its bid by $6 a share, to $72, Sunday night, executives said. That offer for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Thomas' English muffins, Entenmann's baked goods and Knorr soups was up from the $61 to $64 originally offered in April. At the time, the board of Bestfoods unanimously rejected the plan, saying the price was inadequate and that it did not think it was ''opportune to consider a sale of the company.''Both Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans, the co-chairmen of Unilever, arrived in New York on Friday and have been waiting anxiously for breakthroughs in their bid to acquire Bestfoods. ''They look very tired,'' said a person close to the talks. ''This is gamesmanship. It's three-dimensional chess, with humans.''In an interview last month, Mr. Burgmans said his company was surprised that the $66-a-share offer had not brought Bestfoods executives to the negotiating table. ''What puzzles and amazes us,'' he said, ''is that at that price, a premium of 34 percent over what the stock was trading at, they haven't come up to talk to us.'' The company has seemed unwilling to bid higher, without a real competitor other than Bestfoods' reluctance.It is not clear whether the latest increase will be enough to make the board budge from its position, although several large investors said they thought Unilever was headed in the right direction.''I do think Bestfoods will end up selling at a price anywhere from $72 to $75,'' said Alexi Makkas, a principal equity analyst for State Street Global Advisors in Boston, which, with 5.7 million shares, is the fourth-largest shareholder of Bestfoods. ''Bestfood's management team are rational people and they understand they are not going to be able to get this sort of value on their own. They have been adamant the entire time about doing the best thing for shareholders.''</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/21/nyregion/briefing-soup-maker-campbell-soup.html?ref=campbellsoupcompany">BRIEFING: SOUP MAKER; CAMPBELL SOUP<date>Published: May 21, 2000</date><text>Campbell Soup Company, the world's largest soup maker, last week reported a 14 percent drop in fiscal third quarter earnings and said full-year results may miss forecasts because of weak demand for its soups. The maker of Campbell's Soup, Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers and V8 vegetable drinks said earnings fell to $139 million, or 32 cents per diluted share, in the third quarter ended April 30, from $162 million, or 37 cents, in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected a third-quarter profit of 31 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks earnings estimates.''Soup sales remain dismal and clearly they're guiding estimates down by 8 to 12 cents,'' said David Nelson, food industry analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. Nelson issued a ''sell'' rating on Campbell shares in April. The decline in third-quarter profits and the gloomy outlook came as little surprise to many industry analysts who had lowered earnings estimates in recent weeks after trade figures showed Campbell's soup sales fell sharply during the quarter.</text></article></page></root>
