The network said Wednesday that it would bring the series back next year, potentially extending the scheduling pattern that features “X Factor” in the fall and “American Idol” in the spring. Ray Mickshaw/FoxPaula Abdul and Simon Cowell on “The X Factor.” Mike Darnell, the president of alternative entertainment for Fox, said in a statement that the decision to order a second season was a “complete no-brainer.” Regular telecasts of “The X Factor,” created by Simon Cowell, have averaged about 13.5 million viewers since the series started in September. It has dramatically improved Fox’s performance on Wednesday and Thursday nights, but it has underwhelmed the television industry, in part because “Idol” has higher ratings and in part because Mr. Cowell said ahead of time that he expected 20 million viewers to tune in. In an interview last week, Mr. Cowell said he had overstated the ratings potential of the series but he expected the ratings to pick up when the viewer voting period begins on Wednesday night. “When we go live,” he said, “I do think we’re going to see a real difference.” Last week, Fox announced that “X Factor” viewers would be able to vote by calling, texting, sending a Twitter direct message or using a Verizon mobile phone app. Mr. Darnell noted in his statement on Wednesday that “The X Factor” had “won every night it’s been on the air,” referring to the 18-to-49-year-old demographic. In that category, regular telecasts of the program have averaged a 4.7 rating and an 11 share.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7DE133AF935A15753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">EDITORIAL; How to Fix the Wireless Market<date>Published: October 26, 2011</date><text>It's good that wireless companies have agreed to warn customers when they are about to exceed monthly limits on voice, text or data usage or incur international roaming fees, which can result in thousands of dollars of extra charges. But consumers need more protection. The voluntary agreement announced last week between the main wireless industry group and the Federal Communications Commission only scratches the surface of troublesome pricing practices that have flourished in an industry that faces insufficient competition. The deal imposes no penalties on the wireless companies for violations. It might work, but the F.C.C. must convince carriers that violations will lead to real regulations with bite. Carriers often fail to respond to complaints without intervention from government regulators. For years, Verizon Wireless incorrectly billed millions of customers for data access that they did not use. Last year, the company publicly acknowledged the problem and agreed to pay $53 million in refunds and a $25 million settlement with the F.C.C. -- after the agency opened an investigation. The wireless industry argues that it should remain as unregulated as possible because it is very competitive. But this not true. Most customers, locked into their contracts by high early-termination penalties, have no easy way to switch providers. (There are some unlocked plans, but they can be more expensive and offer more limited service.) And two companies -- Verizon and AT&amp;T -- now control 60 percent of the market nationwide. Wireless pricing policies reflect this uncompetitive landscape. Take cellphone text messaging. Companies typically charge from $5 for 250 texts a month (2 cents per message) to $20 for an unlimited package. Pay-as-you-go rates can be as high as 20 cents a message. But the cost of sending a text message is about a third of a penny, according to Congressional testimony from Srinivasan Keshav, a professor at the University of Waterloo. The markup is enormous. Even the most expensive monthly wireless data plans, costing about $15 for 250 megabytes or 6 cents per megabyte, are orders of magnitude cheaper than cellphone text pricing. It is hugely profitable for companies to segregate voice, data and text into different plans and to force customers to buy a different plan for each device, like a phone or a tablet. But, on today's networks, segregating services makes little sense technologically. This expensive segregation would be more difficult to maintain if the market were truly competitive and consumers could easily switch from one company to another that offers a better deal. The regulatory outlook is not promising. The F.C.C. has shied away from asserting that voice and data moving on wireless networks are the same thing, which would allow it to apply its greater authority over phones to broadband access services. But it could curtail high early-termination fees on phone contracts, which are subject to more intense regulation. This would increase competition by making it easier for customers to change carriers. If Congress allows the F.C.C. to reallocate television broadcasters' unused spectrum and auction it for wireless broadband, the F.C.C. could set rules to ensure that the spectrum is available to more competitors. Perhaps the most effective path would be for the F.C.C. to declare broadband access to be a telecommunication service over which it has more control. Without action, consumers are stuck with a deregulated, less-than-competitive market.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/technology/verizon-profit-jumps.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Profit Doubles; Customers Attracted by High-End Products<date>Published: October 21, 2011</date><text>Verizon Communications, the nation’s second-largest telephone company, said on Friday that its profit doubled during the last quarter, bolstered by customers attracted by its portfolio of iPhone and Android devices. But like AT&amp;T, which reported its third-quarter results on Thursday, Verizon added fewer new contract customers than analysts expected. This in part reflects an overall slowdown in the wireless industry, and a heated-up rivalry between Verizon and AT&amp;T, analysts said. It also resulted, though, from the later-than-expected announcement of the iPhone 4S, which kept many consumers from upgrading or buying new devices. “Everyone was frozen, waiting for the iPhone,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst with J. P. Morgan who covers the telecommunications industry. Even so, Verizon added 1.3 million customers, bolstering its total subscriber base to 107.7 million. Of those new customers, 882,000 were contract customers. With these results, Verizon outpaced AT&amp;T, which reported that it signed up 319,000 wireless customers during the same quarter. Verizon said it sold two million iPhones during the quarter. It declined to give the number of iPhone 4S’s it sold; that device became available after the quarter ended. Executives did say they sold out of their supply of iPhone 4S’s on the first day the phones were available for sale, Oct. 14. The phones have been on back order since then. In its earnings report, AT&amp;T revealed that it had activated 2.7 million iPhones during the quarter, and sold 1 million iPhone 4S’s after the quarter ended. Verizon revealed that 20 percent of its iPhone customers jumped over from rival carriers and 80 percent were current customers upgrading their handsets. Analysts said Verizon’s robust catalog of Android smartphones, tablets and mobile hot spots, particularly those compatible with the company’s next-generation wireless network, known as LTE, helped sharpen the company’s edge over AT&amp;T. Of the 5.6 million smartphones that Verizon sold this quarter, 1.4 million were LTE devices. “They haven’t needed the iPhone for years while AT&amp;T had it, and this is no different,” said Rick Franklin, an analyst at Edward Jones, a financial services firm. Those new additions, combined with profit margins on those customers and a low rate of defections among its current customer base, ushered the company into a “stunningly profitable quarter,” Mr. Franklin said. In addition, the sale of those devices, which require expensive data plans to use them, helped nudge the amount of money the company makes per subscriber up 2.4 percent, to $54.89, over the same period a year earlier. During the third quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, Verizon’s profit rose to $1.38 billion, or 49 cents a share, up from $659 million, or 23 cents a share, in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted earnings for the quarter, excluding certain items, were 56 cents a share, compared with 55 cents a share in the previous quarter. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected that the company would report 55 cents a share for adjusted earnings. Revenue rose 5.4 percent, to $27.9 billion, during the quarter, compared with $26.5 billion during the same period a year earlier, the company said. After the announcement of the results, shares rose modestly, closing up 32 cents at $37.42. The landline portion of Verizon’s business, which includes its business and FiOS offerings, did not fare as well, dipping 1.3 percent, to $10.15 billion. The company attributed that decline to the damage caused by Hurricane Irene as well as to the two-week employee strike during August. The financial fallout from both events cost the company $250 million, executives said. In a call to investors and analysts on Friday morning, Francis J. Shammo, the chief financial officer at Verizon, said that the company was looking forward to a robust fourth quarter. “We will compete extremely heavily,” he said. “And when we compete head to head, we generally win.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 27, 2011 An article on Saturday about Verizonâs quarterly earnings misidentified the company executive who predicted a robust fourth quarter.

Madison Ave. Can't Connect<date>October 14, 2011, 11:43 am</date><text>Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesJillian Wright, the owner of a spa on East 66th Street near Madison Avenue, and others in the area have had trouble with their Verizon phone connections. At Bistro Chat Noir, an upscale French restaurant on Manhattan’s Upper East Side frequented by celebrities like Woody Allen, Madonna and Natalie Portman, the phone and Internet service is often out, so credit cards cannot be processed. When that happens, Suzanne Latapie, a manager and one of the owners, asks customers to fill out forms with their credit card information, so she can process payments later, sometimes using a neighbor’s Internet line. “Obviously, this is not the way we want to do business,” said Ms. Latapie, who has started giving clients her personal cellphone number to avoid missing reservations when the restaurant’s phone is not performing properly. “When people can’t get through, I tell them it’s Verizon. And if they live in this area, they know — because they have the same problem.” However irritating, sporadic utility failures are not uncommon. But along a a stretch of Madison Avenue in what is arguably the city’s most expensive shopping and eating district, phone and Internet blackouts have become a nightmarish routine of life for many expensive restaurants, stores and hotels. For weeks now, mundane tasks — making dinner reservations and paying for purchases by credit card — have become a frustrating challenge. “We are in the highest rent district in North America and we don’t have communication,” said Jillian Wright, whose spa on East 66th Street is on the second floor of a brownstone building and not ideal for walk-ins. Ms. Wright said she was losing clients daily, and her spa’s phone number goes straight to a voicemail message apologizing to clients for Verizon’s service. The service failures have affected dozens of businesses, primarily in the East 60s along Madison Avenue. The scope of the problem varies, with some businesses having no phone or Internet service at all for the past several weeks and others experiencing blackouts that last days or a few hours. The situation has become so irritating that a neighborhood organization, the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District, convened a meeting in September between Verizon representatives and local business operators. Verizon offered an array of solutions but no time frame for carrying them out, which left some business owners exasperated. “Every single phone call is our lifeline,” said Ms. Wright, who started her business 12 years ago and said she did not pay herself anything in September and may do the same thing this month. “I’m not a corporation. I’m a working mom in New York City and a small-business owner. It’s hard enough without being cut off.” According to those who attended the meeting with Verizon, several larger stores, including Chanel, Valentino and Roberto Cavalli, as well as a hotel, the Plaza Athénée, have also been affected by the service failures. But no one from any of those businesses could be reached or wanted to talk about the problem. The cause of the problem lies with the city’s subterranean labyrinth of circuitry, Verizon says. While phone cables and steam pipes run near each other throughout the city, they sit particularly close to each other under Madison Avenue — about two feet apart — exposing the cables to moisture from the steam pipes. Water and humidity negatively affect the conductivity of the copper cables, John Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman, explained. When the cables are flooded, Verizon will dry them, but in the long run, water, humidity and the salt used to melt snow in the winter corrode the cables beyond repair. On Madison Avenue, underground humidity has been a lingering issue, Mr. Bonomo said. But this past summer’s heavy rains — and a strike by Verizon workers — have taken a toll. “In the past, we have been able to rectify problems by repairing existing cables, or replacing sections,” Mr. Bonomo said. “But the extreme flooding and rains that we experienced in late August and during the month of September overcame our normal maintenance efforts, completely damaging larger sections of cabling and air pressurization systems designed to keep cables dry under more normal conditions.” Verizon is also trying to expand its more advanced Fios fiber-optic system, which is less susceptible to water damage, to more businesses along Madison Avenue, though installing Fios takes time. Meanwhile, business owners are left coping as best they can. “Few things could be more crippling to a business than sporadic or nonworking phones, but that is what some businesses on Madison Avenue have endured, going back weeks,” said City Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, who represents the neighborhood. “Verizon has a responsibility to provide stable service. They seem to be working on it, but these businesses need the service they count on to be fully restored.” Some business owners, like Ms. Wright, are already in the process of switching over to Time Warner, which provides a digital alternative to the underground cables. Others are considering taking legal action against Verizon. Dan Constantine, the general manager of Amaranth, a Mediterranean restaurant on East 62nd Street whose monthly Verizon bill varies from $500 to $900, said he had been stunned by the blackouts. “It’s like a third world country,” Mr. Constantine said, with frustration and a hint of irony. “Madison Avenue is like a third world country.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/choosing-the-right-iphone-data-plan/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Choosing the Right iPhone Data Plan<date>October 12, 2011, 8:12 pm</date><text>If you have decided to get a new iPhone, the choice is a whole lot harder than what color — black or white — or how much storage — 16, 32 or 64 gigabytes — you want. The next step is choosing a carrier, and while your decision may be based on any number of factors like coverage or the compelling nature of commercials, I was trying to figure it out by looking at the best value. And I am flummoxed because — big surprise — the carriers don’t make it easy. Apple lays out the various plans for you in a very convenient fashion, but the plans (by design) are not comparable. Let’s take a stab at it anyway. First, no one talks on phones any more. So we can start with the minimum number of voice minutes for that. For AT&amp;T and Verizon that is $40 a month. For Sprint it is $80, but that includes unlimited data and text messaging. So on to the other two carriers in those categories. AT&amp;T gives you only two options for text messages: pay per use and unlimited for another $20. Unless you are a teenager, you aren’t going to send 100 text messages a month. There are loads of ways to send text messages free outside the carrier’s control (including the new iMessage feature on the iPhone), so go for pay per use and never use it. Do the same for Verizon, though I suppose you could pay $5 a month for 250 text messages a month, just as insurance. Now the hard part: data. It’s hard because you never really know how much to use. (You can check your use by looking at your account with your current carrier.) But you are going to use at least two gigabytes a month. For AT&amp;T that’s $25, and for Verizon it’s $30. So at this point, it its AT&amp;T at $65 and Verizon at $70. These two plans look cheaper than Sprint, but Sprint is letting you have more data. Should you need more data (or you still don’t believe Sprint’s marketing that it is no longer the customer-unfriendly company it once was), AT&amp;T sells four gigabytes for $45 and you can use the phone as a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot for other devices, like an iPad or a laptop. You can get the same amount from Verizon, but it will cost $50. (that’s $30 for two gigabytes of data and another $20 for two additional gigabytes with mobile hotspot service). So again, advantage AT&amp;T, by $5.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/how-to-pick-the-best-iphone-4s-carrier/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">How to Pick the Best iPhone 4S Carrier<date>October 12, 2011, 8:29 pm</date><text>If you’re in the market for an iPhone 4S, you may be wondering which carrier you should give your money to. After all, you now have a new choice to consider, Sprint, not to mention the ever-shifting landscape of each carrier’s plans and add-ons. Let’s try to break it down. In order to do this, however, we must start by acknowledging that different people want different things out of their phone. Some people travel internationally a great deal; some stay stateside almost all of the time. Some people are counting pennies; some people are rolling in cash. So before we go any further, let’s identify a few categories that all carriers can be judged by. Network quality – Some call this “coverage,” others “speed,” but it’s all basically the same–will your calls and texts and browsing get through? Plan costs – How much will you be paying each month? Is one carrier considerably cheaper than another? And remember–this category has more to do with data costs these days than it does with voice minutes. International roaming costs – All iPhone 4S’s are world phones, so they can function in most places on the globe. But are you locked in to your carrier’s international calling plan if you leave the country, or can you swap SIM cards and use a local provider for far less? Browsing while talking – Only AT&amp;T‘s network lets you use a Web browser and Internet-enabled apps at the same time you are talking to someone on the phone. On a Verizon or Sprint phone, you have to hang up your call to go on the Internet. Not all these factors are equal — and they’re certainly not valued the same way by every user. Network quality seems fairly important to everyone, but international costs? If you do care about that, then you care a lot. That being the case, let’s rank their importance as best we can, giving each a value from 4 points (most important) to 1 (least important). For example, here’s how my needs stack up: Ranking Values Network Quality: 4 (I want my phone to work.) Browsing while talking: 3 (It’s not huge, but I like it.) Plan costs: 2 (The difference in plan prices is between $5 and $10 for me.) International costs: 1 (I am rarely out of the country.) Your mileage may vary, but you can do the same ranking/points list. Now, let’s shift gears slightly. While everyone’s going to prioritize differently, there are some things we do know for sure: Verizon has a better network than AT&amp;T or Sprint. (You may disagree.) Sprint has the cheapest plans. Only AT&amp;T lets you browse and talk at the same time. Only Verizon lets you use local SIM cards when abroad. So, we can give points to this as well, with the higher point value going to the company with the better/most consumer-friendly attribute. There are three players, but in all cases, there’s always a tie between two of them, so I’ve limited the points field to 2 points: Attribute Values Network Quality: Verizon 2, AT&amp;T 1, Sprint 1 Plan costs: Sprint 2, Verizon 1, AT&amp;T 1 Browse and talk: AT&amp;T 2, Verizon 1, Sprint 1 International costs: Verizon 2, AT&amp;T 1, Sprint 1 Now, I’m no Nate Silver, but if you take your ranking values and multiply them by the attribute values, you get a rough idea of which carrier is better at the things which are important to you. Again, I’ll use my preferences as an example: Network quality was my most important thing, at 4 points. That means that Verizon gets 8 points (ranking value of 4 points times attribute value of 2), while AT&amp;T and Sprint each get 4 points. Browsing while talking was my second-most important thing, at 3 points. That means that AT&amp;T gets 6 points for that, while Verizon and Sprint get 3 each. Plan costs was my third-most important thing, at 2 points. That means that Sprint gets 4 points for that, while Verizon and AT&amp;T get 2 each. International costs was last, at 1 point. Verizon gets 2 points, and AT&amp;T and Sprint each get 1 point. So, add that all up and… Verizon – 15 points AT&amp;T – 13 points Sprint – 12 points Looks like I know which carrier I’m supposed to go with.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/carrier-rivalry-sharpens-as-iphone-comes-to-sprint/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Carrier Rivalry Sharpens as iPhone Comes to Sprint<date>October 4, 2011, 11:54 pm</date><text>Apple’s speedier, fancier version of the iPhone 4, the 4S, will sharpen Apple’s competition with Google, whose Android operating system has been gaining market share. But Tuesday’s announcement will also probably fan the flames of a rivalry that is almost as fierce. Apple announced that in addition to AT&amp;T and Verizon, Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 4S, beginning Oct. 14. For years, AT&amp;T benefited from being the only American carrier with the iPhone. And Verizon saw an increase in sales once it added the device to its portfolio, albeit a minor one. The carriers are counting on the lucrative revenue generated by smartphone owners and the expensive data plans that those devices require to buoy their financial outlook as they move away from their legacy landline businesses. Now that most people in the country own a cellphone, one of the last remaining areas of growth is getting them to upgrade to more sophisticated smartphones. For Sprint, the stakes are even higher. The beleaguered carrier has a lot riding on the success of its ability to sell the iPhone on its network. But does Sprint have a shot at luring customers away from AT&amp;T and Verizon? Sprint may have one advantage — it still offers unlimited data plans for its line of smartphones, something that Verizon and AT&amp;T have already abandoned in favor of tiered data plans. We’ve already seen the carriers taking potshots at one another in advertising campaigns and trying to appeal to consumers by adjusting their pricing structures. AT&amp;T has announced that it will give away the iPhone 3GS free for new contract subscribers on its network — something Verizon and Sprint cannot offer, as there is no compatible version of that phone model for their respective networks. “The elbows are getting sharper,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Now that they have most of the same portfolio, we’re going to start to see the carriers hone in on their own offerings as a way to pitch themselves.” Verizon will probably promote the quality of its network, he said, while AT&amp;T will boast about its download speeds and having the broadest portfolio of iPhones, with the iPhone 3GS, 4 and 4S. Sprint’s ace will be its unlimited data plans. Expect the battleground to get bloodier in the coming weeks as the iPhone 4S goes on sale.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/cell-phone-service-on-some-subway-platforms-starts-next-week/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Cellphone Service Coming to the Subway<date>September 22, 2011, 4:07 pm</date><text>Daniel Barry for The New York TimesPassengers trying to use cellphones at Atlantic Avenue station in Brooklyn in 2007 during a service snarl. Starting Tuesday, in Chelsea, the phones will work. It may be that no technological advancement in New York transportation history has been so equally desired and dreaded, but the ability to chat on a cellphone in the subway will finally be available — though in a very limited way — next week. The wired underground project will begin on Tuesday at four stations in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, where subscribers to the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile networks will be able to talk away on station platforms, transportation officials said. Service will cease during trips in the tunnels, however, and anyone with a Verizon phone will be out of luck. Providing the ability to rearrange meetings, converse with friends and be a bigger pest than usual to one’s fellow subwaygoers has been a long-sought goal of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The pilot program will introduce cellphone reception to the C-E platforms at 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue and three other stations along West 14th Street: the A, C, E and L platforms at Eighth Avenue; the F, M and L platforms at Avenue of the Americas; and the Seventh Avenue station that serves the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 lines. The trial has no scheduled end date. The transportation authority says it hopes to extend the service to other parts of the system if it is deemed successful. The program is starting about two years late. Transit Wireless, the company behind it, signed a contract in 2007 with New York City Transit and promised to begin a trial in downtown Manhattan by 2009. The project stagnated until last year, when the company secured financing from an Australian wireless operator.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/another-view-why-c-e-o-s-need-to-engage-washington/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Another View: Why C.E.O.'s Need to Engage Washington<date>September 15, 2011, 2:18 pm</date><text>Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Nels Olson is vice chairman and co-leader of the Board and C.E.O. Services Practice at Korn/Ferry International. American chief executives fall into two camps: those who relish opportunities to engage with Washington and those who engage only when threatened with a subpoena. This notion of engagement is even more relevant at a moment when the United States is struggling with high unemployment, slow economic growth and yawning budget deficits. In the coming months, Washington will be making decisions about federal spending and tax policy that will reshape the government’s fundamental role in the American economy for years to come. At the same time, both Congress and the Obama administration are under increasing pressure to find ways to create jobs and kick-start growth as the 2012 election approaches. As a result, chief executives and business leaders from companies of all shapes and sizes will almost certainly find their local representatives and senators eager to hear a private-sector perspective from outside the Beltway. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Ivan Seidenberg, the former chief executive and chairman of Verizon, fits the archetype of the corporate leader who sees the long-term benefit of having a presence in the capital. As chief executive, he frequently met with regulators, members of Congress and White House officials (including invitations to speak with the president with other chief executives). President Obama named him to the President’s Export Council in July 2010, and he served for three years as chairman of the Business Roundtable, the Washington-based group that advocates pro-business policies. Among the senior executives working for him at Verizon are a former congressman and Verizon executive vice president for public affairs, Thomas Tauke; and a former general counsel for the United States trade representative, Peter Davidson, now senior vice president for government relations at Verizon. Also among them, until 2008, was William B. Barr, a former attorney general of the United States. “I’ve focused on Washington because it’s essential to the long-term health of Verizon, but also because I want to help develop solutions to the nation’s pressing problems,” Mr. Seidenberg said. As the White House, policy makers and legislators grapple with issues like deficit reduction, spending cuts and tax changes, engaging Washington is critical for corporate leaders, given the ramifications of regulation, taxation, global trade and more. While this is understood by top executives like Mr. Seidenberg and others, there is a clear need for leaders from outside the Fortune 500 to similarly ratchet up their efforts to have their voice heard and address what Mr. Seidenberg has characterized as “a growing disconnect between Washington and the business community.” Why Washington Engagement Matters The federal government and, to a lesser extent, state government are deeply entwined in sectors throughout the American economy. Regulation, in particular, can affect companies significantly and in unexpected ways, given that statutes are regularly being modified in a range of areas, including environmental protection, consumer privacy and workplace conditions. It is far preferable to try to influence the process than be stuck responding to the result. “If you’re not engaged, you can wake up one morning and find a big problem on your hands,” said Jim McNerney, chairman, president and chief executive of Boeing, who is acutely aware of the need to develop relationships in Washington, given that the company is consistently the second-largest recipient of United States government contracts after Lockheed Martin. There is some evidence that companies increasingly recognize the likelihood of public policy’s affecting their operations, based on the findings of a McKinsey global survey of business executives in February. Among survey respondents from companies in North America, 71 percent said they expected increased involvement from both government and regulators — the highest percentage of any region in the world. Another indicator is that membership in the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of leading American companies, has increased to 205 from 143 over the past 12 months. How Chief Executives Should Engage The engagement of chief executives with Washington can take many forms. The traditional steps of making campaign contributions, joining trade associations and hiring government relations staff members remain important. But they are no longer sufficient. Mr. McNerney of Boeing recommends that work on public policy issues become one of the experiences expected of executives as they rise through ranks toward the chief executive’s office. “It is more important than ever to have experience with Washington built into the background of people who run companies,” he said. Reinforcing the importance of chief executive involvement is the proliferation of advocacy efforts by those who are not chief executives. In 2010, there were nearly 13,000 registered lobbyists in Washington. The large number of lobbyists creates more competition for companies as they seek to deliver their message to policy makers. “You can’t outsource the Washington knowledge to external lobbyists or your in-house government relations people,” says Bill Green, chairman and former chief executive of Accenture. “As a C.E.O., you have to have some level of depth on the issues of the day and the issues that could affect your company in the future. Relying solely on the government relations folks to raise the red flag is not sufficient and does not serve your shareholders well. In today’s world, you have to be part of the ongoing dialogue.” But even with their stature and mastery of issues, chief executives must be prepared for challenges and frustrations, said David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. “There’s generally no one person you can talk to who can make the decision.” “Because Washington has 536 independent subcontractors, you have to do a lot of talking and a lot of participating to get buy-in,” Mr. Cote said, referring to the president and all members of Congress. “That can be frustrating for us who are used to talking to one person and getting a problem solved. But that’s the way it works, and you have to participate.” The Benefits of Engagement Washington engagement is undeniably a form of risk management — developing the relationships with officials that can help a chief executive to resolve differences (policy or otherwise) before they strike at the heart of a company’s brand or balance sheet. But engagement should not be viewed entirely as a defense mechanism. Being positioned to shape policies as they develop, and to seize opportunities emanating from policy changes, can also be a catalyst for corporate growth. And a healthy, vibrant relationship between chief executives and Washington, resting on communication and cooperation, will ultimately translate to a stronger, more dynamic economy that can deliver higher levels of job creation and greater prosperity for the American people.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/new-verizon-chief-plays-coy-about-a-vodafone-deal/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">New Verizon Chief Is Coy About a Vodafone Deal<date>September 11, 2011, 7:35 pm</date><text>For years, there has been speculation that Verizon Communications will make some sort of deal with its wireless partner, Vodafone. In an interview with The Financial Times, Verizon’s new chief executive is coy about what the two may do: “I wouldn’t rule it [a merger] out but I also wouldn’t tell you that it’s something that’s on our immediate horizon either.” Read more »</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/in-dispute-with-verizon-union-invokes-members-911-work/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">In Dispute With Verizon, Union Invokes Members' 9/11 Work<date>September 6, 2011, 6:29 pm</date><text>Communication Workers of AmericaA new ad from the union representing Verizon workers invokes Sept. 11. For almost a decade, Sept. 11, 2001, was a kind of third rail for Madison Avenue, almost never brought up in advertisements for fear of being perceived as exploitative or tasteless. An example of an evolution in that approach — particularly as the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks nears — is being provided by a union that is invoking its members’ efforts “at ground zero” in a dispute with management. The union is the Communication Workers of America, which is negotiating a new contract with Verizon Communications. The union ended a strike against Verizon last month, although the two sides had not reached a settlement. Bargaining between the two sides has resumed, said Bob Master, a spokesman for the union, and to keep its side of the story in the spotlight the union is planning to run an ad in The New York Times on Wednesday. The ad features Joe Hanley, a union member who works for Verizon, appearing in a photograph in front of a construction site. The ad carries the headline, “When the towers came down he stepped up,” and underneath, in smaller type, are these words: “But now he’s sick and Verizon wants to slash his benefits.” The text of the ad describes how Mr. Hanley was among union members who “rebuilt the phone system” in Lower Manhattan and restored the operations of the New York Stock Exchange just days after Sept. 11. “But as a result of his work” at ground zero, the ad continues, Mr. Hanley “now suffers from numerous health problems that have required multiple surgeries and ongoing radiation treatment.” Verizon wants a new contract that will “eliminate sick days for workers hurt on the job,” the ad declares, and “force workers like Joe to pay thousands per year in healthcare costs.” Verizon maintains that it needs significant concessions from the employees who work for its landline division to increase its lagging profitability. When the union members were on strike, Verizon ran ads in newspapers and on television and radio describing how well paid its employees are and how it needed the concessions to remain competitive in the landline business. The ad ends by asking readers to “tell Verizon: Heroes like Joe deserve better. Negotiate a fair contract.” The reference to “heroes” echoes the text at the start of the ad, which described how Verizon called the workers heroes in the wake of their rebuilding efforts. Mr. Master said that officials of the union “definitely were sensitive” to perceptions that they would be “trying to capitalize on” the events of 9/11 to make their case against Verizon. For one thing, he said, the ad is issue advertising rather than commercial advertising. It is not selling a product, he added, but rather “telling a corollary part of the story” of Sept. 11 “that directly affected our members.” The ad is not intended to be “about those who gave their lives on 9/11,” Mr. Master said, like emergency responders. Instead, the ad is centered on “the very important work our members did” after the towers fell, he added, and “our members had a role to play in bringing the country back.” Mr. Master estimated that 1,300 to 1,500 of the union’s members who work for Verizon were “involved in some way in the telecommunications rebuilding project after 9/11.” Of them, he estimated, about 800 are being monitored for aftereffects of their exposure to ground zero and “hundreds are suffering from serious respiratory or other illnesses.” While “the ad is very clearly not about those who gave their lives on 9/11,” Mr. Master said, it is about the union’s members who “did extraordinary work” and “took extraordinary risks.” The ad was created by GMMB, an agency in Washington owned by the Omnicom Group that specializes in issue and political advertising.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/opinion/verizons-tax-bill.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon’s Tax Bill<date>Published: September 1, 2011</date><text>To the Editor: Two facts not mentioned in “Where Pay for Chiefs Outstrips U.S. Taxes” (Business Day, Aug. 31): Verizon’s tax payments in 2010 totaled $430 million, and its total tax bill for 2010 was $2.5 billion, including $2.2 billion in federal income taxes. These are documented in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Indeed, some tax payments have been deferred because of federal economic development policies that have accelerated Verizon’s investment in America’s technology infrastructure. In 2009 and 2010 alone, Verizon invested $33.3 billion in infrastructure — sustaining jobs for Verizon union employees and creating jobs at other companies that rely on broadband communications. Given this — and the fact that our chief executive’s 2010 compensation target was about 140 times lower than our tax bill — it was regrettable to see Verizon featured in the article. Despite the opinions of the article’s source, the Institute for Policy Studies, identified as “a liberal-leaning research group,” Verizon fully complies with all tax laws and pays its fair share of taxes.

As the biggest telecom deal in years, one that could reshape the American wireless landscape, AT&amp;T‘s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA drew scores of supporters and critics alike. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links U.S. Moves to Block AT&amp;T Merger with T-Mobile Those backing the deal, including communications workers unions and lawmakers, echo AT&amp;T’s arguments that the merger would create jobs and expand the nation’s high-speed cellular networks. Opponents, including competitors like Sprint Nextel, consumer groups and other politicians, contend that the combination would hurt competition and lead to higher prices and fewer jobs. Now that the Justice Department has sued to block the deal, here’s what some of those parties have to say. (AT&amp;T’s biggest competitor, Verizon Communications, declined to comment.) Supporting the merger Communications Workers of America, the union that represents thousands of AT&amp;T workers: “The decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to seek to block the merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA is simply wrong. “In today’s sinking economy, where millions of Americans are looking for work, the DOJ has filed suit to block a merger that will create as many as 96,000 quality jobs. In the U.S., where too many Americans, especially in rural areas, don’t have access to the tools of Internet technology, the D.O.J. is looking to block a plan to build out high speed wireless access to 97 percent of the country. … “Instead of acting to block this merger, our government should be looking to support companies that create, keep and return good jobs to the United States.” Opposing the merger Sprint Nextel’s Vonya B. McCann, senior vice president of government affairs: “The D.O.J. today delivered a decisive victory for consumers, competition and our country. By filing suit to block AT&amp;T’s proposed takeover of T-Mobile, the D.O.J. has put consumers’ interests first. Sprint applauds the D.O.J. for conducting a careful and thorough review and for reaching a just decision – one which will ensure that consumers continue to reap the benefits of a competitive U.S. wireless industry. Contrary to AT&amp;T’s assertions, today’s action will preserve American jobs, strengthen the American economy, and encourage innovation.” Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin: “We applaud the Justice Department for their action to protect consumers in a powerful and growing industry that reaches virtually every American. Preserving choices means ensuring competition, and competition ultimately benefits consumers.” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota: “I have long believed that this merger would be a terrible deal for consumers, and I’m pleased the Department of Justice has taken the wise step of officially opposing it. I’ve heard from families across Minnesota that cell phone expenses are an ever-rising percentage of their bills each month, and this merger could make wireless bills increase by as much as 25 percent — a burden families certainly don’t need in this tough economy. This merger would also hurt competition and concentrate enormous power in the hands of just two companies-AT&amp;T and Verizon — who would control more than 80 percent of the wireless market. I’m glad the Justice Department recognizes that this merger would hurt consumers and I hope that the court will agree and block it from moving forward.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts: “The Justice Department’s decision to take action to block AT&amp;T’s purchase of T-Mobile is a victory for competition, consumers and choice. We should be protecting American consumers holding their cell phones, not just telecommunications titans holding stock in the companies. “The merger would reduce the number of national wireless companies from four down to three, sending the mobile marketplace into a telecommunications time machine back to 1993. That would be an historic mistake.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/u-s-moves-to-block-att-merger-with-t-mobile/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">U.S. Moves to Block AT&amp;T Merger with T-Mobile<date>August 31, 2011, 10:56 am</date><text>Stephen Crowley/The New York TimesJames M. Cole, the Justice Department’s deputy attorney general, said the merger would result in “higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products.” 5:13 p.m. | Updated The Justice Department on Wednesday sued to block AT&amp;T’s proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA, a deal that would create the largest carrier in the country and reshape the industry. “The department filed its lawsuit because we believe the combination of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products for their mobile wireless services,” James M. Cole, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference. AT&amp;T said it would “vigorously contest this matter in court.” The Justice Department’s complaint, which was filed in United States District Court in Washington, said that T-Mobile “places important competitive pressure on its three larger rivals, particularly in terms of pricing, a critically important aspect of competition.” Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The complaint Reacting to the Justice's Suit Against AT&amp;T Deal Sprint Shares Surge on AT&amp;T Setback The complaint also highlighted T-Mobile’s high speed network and its innovations in technology, noting that it was the first to use Google’s Android operating system and BlackBerry wireless e-mail, among other things. “AT&amp;T’s elimination of T-Mobile as an independent, low-priced rival would remove a significant competitive force from the market,” the complaint said. “Thus, unless this acquisition is enjoined, customers of mobile wireless telecommunications services likely will face higher prices, less product variety and innovation, and poorer quality services due to reduced incentives to invest than would exist absent the merger.” Shares of AT&amp;T ended the day down 3.9 percent. In trading in Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Telekom tumbled nearly 8 percent. &lt;br /&gt; The Justice Department has broad authority to influence proposed deals. In January, the U.S. sued Comcast for its proposed merger with NBC Universal; the case was settled at the same time with Comcast agreeing to some concessions. On rare occasions, the agency takes the more aggressive step of suing to block a deal altogether, as it did with AT&amp;T and earlier this year with H&amp;R Block’s bid for the owner of TaxAct tax-preparation software. Sometimes just the threat of legal action is enough to stymie a deal, as in May when Nasdaq and a partner dropped their rival bid for the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company. In other cases, the Justice Department will remain silent, blessing a deal by default. In a statement, AT&amp;T said: “We are surprised and disappointed by today’s action, particularly since we have met repeatedly with the Department of Justice and there was no indication from the D.O.J. that this action was being contemplated. “We plan to ask for an expedited hearing so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed. The D.O.J. has the burden of proving alleged anticompetitive affects and we intend to vigorously contest this matter in court.” That could mean a potentially lengthy court fight. Companies have triumphed over the Justice Department before, such as a federal judge sided with Oracle in its purchase of PeopleSoft in 2004. Yet there is still the chance that two sides could reach a settlement on the deal. In a news conference on Wednesday, Sharis A. Pozen, the acting assistant attorney general, indicated that a compromise was still a possibility, saying: “We apprised them of our serious concerns. And as any party can do, our door is open. If they want to resolve those concerns, we can certainly do that.” AT&amp;T also expects to enter in discussions about a possible solution, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. Indeed, AT&amp;T has one powerful incentive to try to salvage the deal. Under the terms of the agreement that AT&amp;T signed with Deutsche Telekom, AT&amp;T would pay a breakup fee of $3 billion in cash, as well as a roaming agreement and spectrum rights — an estimated total value of $6 billion — if the acquisition did not go through for regulatory reasons. AT&amp;T already has three high-priced law firms advising on the deal, including Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Arnold &amp; Porter and Crowell &amp; Moring. T-Mobile is receiving legal advice on the merger from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz; Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton; and Wiley Rein. Ever since AT&amp;T announced plans to buy T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion in March, the deal has proved controversial. Lawmakers, consumer advocates and rivals have voiced opposition to the merger, saying it would significantly reduce competition. The deal would have left just three major players: AT&amp;T, Verizon and the significantly smaller Sprint Nextel. The complaint also noted that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile currently compete head to head in 97 of the 100 biggest wireless markets in the country. “Sprint urges the United States government to block this anticompetitive acquisition,” Vonya McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president for government affairs, said back in March. “This transaction will harm consumers and harm competition at a time when this country can least afford it.” Shares of Sprint Nextel ended up nearly 6 percent on the day. Citigroup analysts said Sprint was “a potential beneficiary” of the antitrust action. Still, they said that AT&amp;T’s pursuit of T-Mobile was “a catalyst for eventual wireless consolidation in some form, either through the current proposed transaction or other merger scenarios that would likely form if the pending merger is not completed.” The Justice Department’s complaint noted that while there were smaller telecommunications providers, none of their voice networks “cover even one-third of the U.S. population, and the largest of these smaller carriers has less than one-third the number of wireless connections as T-Mobile.” On Wednesday, AT&amp;T said that “we remain confident that this merger is in the best interest of consumers and our country, and the facts will prevail in court.” The company repeated its arguments that a merger would “help solve our nation’s spectrum exhaust situation and improve wireless service for millions,” would expand 4G mobile broadband and would mean billions in additional investment and tens of thousands of jobs. Deutsche Telekom said it would join with AT&amp;T to defend the deal, saying in a statement that it was “very disappointed” by the Justice Department’s action. U.S. v.

As the hurricane whirls its way up the East Coast, each of the major wireless carriers in the United States is taking steps to minimize outages and damage to its network. T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint say they are placing backup power generators near cellular towers as well as putting extra generators in safe locations to deploy as needed once the storm passes. In addition, they are trucking additional radio equipment into their denser regions to help boost data networks in case the wire line services go down during the storm. Officials at the carriers are advising customers to fully charge their devices before the storm hits and to rely on text messages to communicate instead of trying to make voice calls. Even so, it is not clear whether those precautions will be enough. Earlier this week, when a 5.8-magnitude earthquake shook the East Coast, many people reported difficulty making calls and delays in sending and receiving text messages. It wasn’t clear whether the gaps in service were because of damage to network infrastructure or from the crush of people simultaneously trying to use their phones. The number of people who would be without cell service is extensive. According to the CTIA, the cell industry’s trade group, roughly 96 percent of Americans own cellphones and nearly a third of American households rely entirely on wireless communications, eschewing landlines altogether. There is a strong possibility that the high winds and rains expected to pummel the East Coast during Hurricane Irene could uproot cellular towers and damage lines. Federal officials say that the storm is likely to cause widespread power loss and flash flooding throughout North Carolina, as well as West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, western New York and the interior of New England. Representatives for the wireless companies say that it is difficult to know exactly how service will be affected until the storm is upon us. “Until the storm makes landfall, it’s hard for us to determine the definite impact,” said Crystal Davis, a spokeswoman for Sprint. “There will be power outages and flooding, and we’ve been preparing our networks, engineers and emergency response team members to handle what we believe will be the most probable scenarios.” Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, echoed her sentiments, saying that the company is doing everything possible to avoid any lingering effects for the company’s customers. “As you can imagine, there is just no good way to predict the impact,” he said. “We’re staging equipment and employees to respond as quickly as we are safely able to after Irene makes landfall.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/verizon-buys-cloudswitch/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Buys CloudSwitch<date>August 25, 2011, 1:35 pm</date><text>Deal-making in enterprise technology is certainly heating up.

Union leaders are ending the walkout, they said, because Verizon management had finally agreed to engage in serious bargaining on the contentious issues after the company had originally insisted on negotiating more than 100 proposals for concessions. Officials from the two unions that called the strike — the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — made the announcement on Saturday. The strike was a painful one, forcing thousands of workers and their families to live without paychecks for two weeks and hurting Verizon’s image, as many customers complained of major delays for repairs and installations. The walkout involved workers from Massachusetts to Virginia in Verizon’s traditional landline operations and in its new FiOS Internet and cable operations, but not workers at Verizon Wireless, which is largely nonunion. Union officials said they had originally called the strike because they felt they were not being taken seriously and because Verizon was insisting on so many and such sweeping concessions. Verizon was hardly budging from its original position, the unions said, another point of contention. Verizon is pushing for, among other things, a pension freeze for current workers, fewer sick days, an end to all job security provisions, far larger employee contributions toward health coverage, and freedom to do as much outsourcing as it wants. Larry Cohen, the communications workers’ president, said in an interview Saturday that under an agreement reached Friday, the bargaining was being restructured to focus on major issues, with top Verizon officials indicating that there would be real progress in bargaining. Mr. Cohen said another factor that helped persuade the unions to return to work was that Verizon had agreed to keep the expired contract in force until a settlement is reached. “Everybody knew we faced a long list of management demands and that’s why there was a strike, and we would go back into bargaining when the talks could be meaningful,” Mr. Cohen said. “We don’t consider this a victory in any way. We consider it progress toward a good process at Verizon.” In a statement issued on Saturday, Verizon said the parties had agreed on a process “for moving forward to negotiate the major issues regarding benefits, cost structure, work flexibility and job security.” Marc C. Reed, Verizon’s executive vice president for human resources, said Verizon believed that ending the strike “is in the best interest of our customers and our employees.” “The company hasn’t conceded any of its proposals,” Mr. Reed said in an interview. “At the end of the day we still have health care on the table. We still have proposals on job security and moving work on the table.” Mr. Reed said the unions had ended the strike because of “the pressure of having people not working in this tough economy.” He added, “This is a situation where the purpose of the strike may not have any need.” Mr. Cohen acknowledged that the bargaining ahead might still be lengthy. He said Verizon initially seemed so dismissive of the two unions’ position and so unwilling to budge from its original stance that union negotiators felt the company was seeking in effect to wipe out the unions’ bargaining rights. “The unions have been working with Verizon to restructure bargaining in a way that represents progress for everyone,” he said. “We believe that Verizon management shares the goal of meaningful bargaining.” Jim Spellane, chief spokesman for the electrical workers’ union, said the unions went on strike to get management’s attention and to show that the workers could not be pushed around. “The workers felt very strongly that their whole standard of living was under attack, that everything we’ve worked for for decades was under threat and wasn’t being taken seriously,” Mr. Spellane said. “They felt backed into a corner and so the strike was called.” Verizon officials have repeatedly said they needed major concessions from the landline division employees to keep that business competitive and to increase its lagging profitability. The company said its traditional landline business had declines in profits and in its customer base, even though that division was slowly rebounding thanks to growth of Verizon’s FiOS fiber-optic business. The two unions condemned Verizon’s push for large-scale concessions, saying the demands were inappropriate because the company’s overall profitability had been strong, totaling $22 billion over the last four years. While many C.W.A. members voiced relief that they were returning to work, others posted complaints that their union had knuckled under by ending the walkout without a settlement and with Verizon’s concession demands remaining on the table. Throughout the strike, a big question that union leaders faced was whether Verizon had proposed scores of concessions in the hope of narrowing them down to win just two or three major ones, or whether it was intent on winning dozens of concessions and seriously weakening the two unions. More than any other union leader in the country, Mr. Cohen has sought to promote and preserve bargaining rights, and he often said that Verizon’s truculent approach to negotiations resembled those of state governors who wanted to abolish collective bargaining.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/us/politics/20vineyard.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">On Martha’s Vineyard, Ringing Cellphones Mean Obama’s in Town<date>Published: August 19, 2011</date><text>CHILMARK, Mass. — To the slamming screen door, happy vacation chatter and other noises at the Chilmark General Store, add a less expected one this month: ringing cellphones.Chilmark, a town of gentle hills and wandering stone walls in the outer reaches of Martha’s Vineyard, has spotty cellular service, at best, for most of the year. But when President Obama and his family arrive for what has become a yearly August vacation, something magical happens. “Suddenly my phone starts ringing,” said Rachel Fox, an entertainment lawyer from Manhattan whose family has a home here. “There are people for whom this is a very big deal — not just that the president comes, but that their cellphones work while he’s here.” The better reception is due to two temporary cell towers (known as cell on wheels) that Verizon puts up here and in neighboring West Tisbury, said Timothy R. Carroll, the executive secretary in Chilmark. He said the White House Communications Agency, which handles phone systems for the president and other federal officials, had requested the towers. They went up in early August and will stay until the end of the month, Mr. Carroll said, adding, “I would have been happy if they came in July.” Not everyone benefits from the better signal. James Ford, an AT&amp;T customer from Saranac Lake, N.Y., had no service at the general store on Thursday. But his friend Stefan Martin, a Verizon customer, did. “I have four bars right now,” Mr. Martin said, waving his iPhone triumphantly. While cell service can be iffy across Martha’s Vineyard, the most consistent problems are in Chilmark and Aquinnah, the island’s two outermost towns. Many residents and visitors said they considered the few weeks of better connections a kind of gift from the White House. Some described jumping when their phones went off in the library or post office, unaccustomed as they are to hearing them ring at all. “Today I had one of my employee’s phones going off in her pocketbook,” said Jeanne Taylor, who owns the Outermost Inn in Aquinnah. “She said, ‘Oh my God, I’m getting service!’ ” Jennifer LoRusso, an owner of the Chilmark General Store, said the flurry of ringtones had been disorienting, adding, “Nobody knows what’s going on.” And Paul McIntyre, a lawyer from Philadelphia, recalled his frustration during a vacation here several years ago when he frantically tried to e-mail a work memo from the Aquinnah Cliffs. “It’s surprisingly good,” he said of his BlackBerry reception now. But others — especially those who live or vacation in Chilmark because it is remote — rolled their eyes when asked about the improved connection with the outside world. “A lot of the people who vote here, who live here year-round, couldn’t care less if the people who invade them in the summer get to talk to their Hollywood producers in the middle of the Chilmark store,” Ms. Fox said. Ms. LoRusso said the lack of cell service “keeps things up-island and rural.” Mr. Ford, who has spent the summer working on a farm here, said: “Personally, I like being disconnected. I like the privacy.” Even when the president is not in town, people who know this place well have “sweet spots” where they sometimes, inexplicably, get cell signals. Mrs. Taylor said visitors to her inn could often make calls from the 13th flagstone on the front walkway. Chris Buchanan, a return visitor from Los Angeles, said he could receive texts (but not send them) at the base of the swordfish sculpture in Menemsha, a fishing village that is part of Chilmark. (Service in Menemsha was nearly nonexistent on Thursday, however; perhaps Mr. Obama’s entourage had no wish to venture there.) Chilmark residents have voted down proposals to build cell towers in the past, with some saying they would mar the landscape. Mr. Carroll said he expected “a hue and cry about ‘What is that? Get it out of our face’ ” when the temporary towers were first put up for the Obamas’ visit in 2009. “But I didn’t get a single complaint, and people were eager to have it come back,” he said. “They weren’t necessarily eager to have the president come back because of the traffic. But they were eager to have Verizon bring the cell on wheels early this year.” Laura Williams, a spokeswoman for the White House Communications Agency, said its job was to ensure “that the president has the best communications possible wherever he travels” so that he can “remain informed and connected.” But Ms. Williams would not answer specific questions about the enhanced service, including how much it costs and who pays for it, citing security concerns. Barbara Baldwin, a teacher from Philadelphia and an Obama fan, said she would not mind if taxpayers were footing the bill. “I wouldn’t care even if it was Bush, who I hate,” said Ms. Baldwin, who was at the beach in Menemsha. “I mean, come on. They’re leading a country. They have to be in contact with people.” One of the temporary towers is on a trailer across from the Chilmark General Store; the other is behind Linda Alley’s house in West Tisbury, on her neighbor’s land. Ms. Alley, a Vineyard native, estimated that Blue Heron Farm, where the Obamas are staying, was less than a mile from her shingled house. How did she feel about the improved cell service from the nearby tower? “I’m not attached to my cellphone like a lot of people are,” she said. “I couldn’t care less.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/technology/verizon-strike-slowing-service-and-customers-complain.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Strike Slowing Service, and Customers Complain<date>Published: August 18, 2011</date><text>As a strike by 45,000 Verizon workers approaches the two-week mark, the company’s customers are beginning to feel the impact — and are complaining about it.Verizon acknowledges “minor” disruptions since the strike began on Aug. 7. But some customers of its landline telephone, Internet and cable television service are reporting significant delays getting current lines repaired and new ones installed. Craig Schiffer, chief executive of a boutique investment bank in Midtown Manhattan, said his firm’s telephone service had been down for nine days, and he could not get an estimate from Verizon for when the phones would be working again — a big problem for a business that relies heavily on phone calls with clients. Joey Kreger, a recent college graduate moving from Illinois to Morristown, N.J., said he was stunned when he ordered Verizon’s FiOS television and Internet service for his new apartment — and the company wrote back that it could install the service on Dec. 30, more than four months from now. Competitors like Time Warner Cable and Cablevision have mobilized to take advantage of Verizon’s problems. Time Warner, which operates in some of the East Coast markets affected by the Verizon strike, is running ads promising speedy service, and it has increased the number of field technicians so that it can do cable installations within 48 hours. “When folks are in a time when they might not be able to get service, we are emphasizing not just the price but our high level of service,” said Todd Townsend, chief marketing officer for Time Warner’s eastern region. Officials at the two unions on strike — the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — say they are certain that the walkout is causing delays in repairs and installations, but they acknowledge they do not know by how much. “Historically we know that you can’t pull out of any system 45,000 people who are the hands and minds of the company’s product and expect to provide the same level of service as before,” said George Kohl, special assistant to the president of the C.W.A. “The managers who are replacing them don’t perform these functions nearly as efficiently.” Verizon said that problems for existing customers had been minimal. “We’re seeing some minor delays on a few repairs and installations,” said Christopher M. Creager, Verizon’s senior vice president for consumer and mass business markets. “The vast majority of our customers are not seeing any impact.” Verizon officials acknowledge, however, that they decided not to take any new orders for the first two weeks of the strike so they could focus on serving their current customers. “We are seeing some delays on the installation side if it’s a brand-new installation that requires technicians to come out,” Mr. Creager said. He explained that it was a mistake to tell Mr. Kreger that his installation date would be Dec. 30, saying the date would be well before that. That has upset potential customers like Dylan Marsh, who are complaining about delays in obtaining FiOS service, which offers Internet, cable TV and phone service over high-speed fiber optic lines and competes with the services sold by cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast. Mr. Marsh, who just graduated from Buffalo State College with a degree in urban planning, wanted to order Verizon’s FiOS Internet and television services for his new apartment on West 49th Street in Manhattan. “They let me go through the whole signup and then at the end they said, ‘There are no installation dates available. Someone will contact you,’ ” Mr. Marsh said. “That was probably a week ago. They were trying to make it seem like everything is O.K., like the service is there but it’s not. I thought it would be a couple of weeks, but it might end up being a couple of months. I decided to go with Time Warner instead.” Verizon said the company’s efforts to keep up had also been set back by numerous incidents of sabotage and by the huge rainstorm that struck the East Coast last weekend. Verizon is pushing the unions to accept far-reaching concessions, including a pension freeze and fewer sick days, and asking that workers contribute far more toward their health coverage. Negotiations between the two sides are continuing, but at the same time, both are preparing for a protracted strike. In a recent move, Verizon has sought to step up pressure on the strikers by informing them that the company will cut off their medical, dental and optical benefits on Aug. 31. Since the strike began, union officials have been eager to make the case that the company’s operations were being badly hurt. Meanwhile, the company has sought to bolster its position by asserting that the strike is having little impact on service. “We have been preparing for this for months, and when the strike took place, we deployed thousands of managers from across the country to be able to handle customer service requests,” Mr. Creager said. “We made a commitment to take care of the customers we have.” Mr. Schiffer, the boutique bank’s chief executive, said most phones at his nine-person firm, Sevara Capital Markets, had not been working since Aug. 9. “This is really affecting our business,” he said. “Clients have been telling us they can’t get through.” Asked about the repair delays faced by Sevara, Mr. Creager of Verizon said, “That is not typical of the vast majority of our customers.” Richard Young, a Verizon spokesman, said the company had received hundreds of supportive e-mails from customers. In one e-mail shared by the company, John Ness, a councilman in Townsend, Del., wrote last Sunday to thank two field technicians who repaired his phone, Internet and cable service several days before a scheduled appointment.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/business/verizon-and-strikers-trade-more-accusations.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Accuses Strikers of Equipment Sabotage<date>Published: August 15, 2011</date><text>Verizon said on Monday that there had been 143 acts of sabotage to telephone facilities since 45,000 of its workers went on strike Aug. 7. Verizon officials did not offer definite proof that any particular act was sabotage. But they said it was suspicious that there had been three times the number of incidents in the last eight days as in the previous six months. “It just isn’t feasible that there is not a connection because there’s been such an uptick since the calling of the strike,” Mike Mason, Verizon’s chief security officer, said. “Whoever is doing it, I consider it un-American and unpatriotic to attack critical infrastructure.” Verizon officials said phone lines had been deliberately cut in Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, New York and other places. Washington’s police chief has urged residents to keep an eye out for such acts of sabotage. Among the places affected were a nursing home and two police departments. Verizon officials said the huge storms on the East Coast last weekend also caused some damage and failures, without specifying where or how many, but they said the company was fully focused on repairs. Union officials said they opposed all sabotage and had repeatedly told their members not to engage in such acts. They also said that Verizon was exaggerating the number of incidents. At the same time, the unions have their own complaints about Verizon, saying that several strikers have been struck by managers’ cars. Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, said Verizon was highlighting the sabotage to turn the public against the strikers, who are members of the C.W.A. and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. “This really does take away from what is the big issue in this strike: that Verizon is refusing to bargain and instead is demanding $1 billion in concessions from workers who earn middle-class wages,” she said. Verizon is pushing the unions to accept far-reaching concessions, including a pension freeze, fewer sick days and having workers contribute far more toward their health coverage. With the negotiations barely inching forward, the sides have accused each other of refusing to bargain in good faith. Verizon’s top spokesman, Peter Thonis, said the union’s $1 billion figure for concessions was exaggerated. The communications workers union said a picketer in Massapequa, N.Y., had been hit by a private security guard leaving a Verizon facility, and another striker had been hit in the head by the side mirror of a manager’s van in Howell, N.J. Mr. Mason said he had never asserted that the unions were responsible for the sabotage, suggesting that individual strikers may have acted on their own. “What’s important is the impact isn’t to a faceless company,” he said. “The impact is to the customers we serve, to government facilities, to individuals.” Michael Ward, special agent in charge of F.B.I.’s Newark office, said the agency was “looking at this matter” because “critical infrastructure has been affected.” He said the F.B.I. was not taking sides in the strike. David Zielenziger, whose 88-year-old mother lives in the assisted living facility at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, said he was unable to reach his mother on Friday. Employees there later told him that sabotage had cut off service to many residents, although one suggested it may have been tree- cutters gone awry. Verizon officials later said it had been sabotage, providing photos of a neatly sliced three-inch-thick cable nearby. “There was no service Friday, Saturday or Sunday morning,” Mr. Zielenziger said, “It was really annoying.” Robert Varettoni, a Verizon spokesman, said the company had obtained court injunctions in New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania that set rules for picketing to make it easier and safer for managers and other workers to enter and leave Verizon facilities. Mr. Mason said Verizon had repeatedly told its managers and other employees to respect the strikers and certainly not to hurt them. He said many picketers had banged on employees’ car hoods as they approached Verizon facilities and that some picketers then pretended the vehicles had hit them.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/technology/as-mobile-networks-speed-up-data-gets-capped.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">As Mobile Networks Speed Up, Data Gets Capped<date>Published: August 14, 2011</date><text>The newest smartphones are intended to run on speedy 4G networks that allow people to effortlessly stream music, watch Netflix movies and tune in live to a Mets game, wherever they are.But there’s a catch, of course. Cellphone plans that let people gobble up data as if they were at an all-you-can eat buffet are disappearing, just as new data-gobbling Internet services from Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Apple and the like are hitting the market or catching on with wide audiences. These services use far more data than simply checking e-mail or browsing the Web, so their heaviest users may find themselves running over their plan’s monthly allotment and paying extra. The wireless carriers say their tighter limits will affect only a small percentage of customers. And they say they are simply trying to get ahead of an exploding appetite for data and avoid problems with overburdened networks. Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, said that if current trends continued, the company’s network would carry more data in the first two months of 2015 than in all of 2010. He described the pricing issue as a “balancing act,” adding: “The tiered data plans will meet the needs of the overwhelming majority of consumers. A lot of people think they’re heavy users, but they’re not.” But analysts say that inevitably more people will find themselves in the “heavy user” category, particularly as more of them trade in their lower-end phones for smartphones and move to 4G networks. For most people who use their phones to check e-mail, surf the Web and watch an occasional video, the move toward tiered pricing will not immediately raise their phone bills. Verizon’s monthly plan offering two gigabytes of data for $30, announced last month, costs the same as its old unlimited plan, for example. But even now it doesn’t take much for a media-hungry smartphone user to chew through two gigabytes; watching Netflix video for more than roughly 20 minutes a day will do the trick. And an extra gigabyte will cost Verizon customers an additional $10. “Over time, as you give people faster devices with faster speeds, it’s going to be a lot easier to hit that two-gig mark,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase who follows the telecommunications industry. In addition to worrying about overtaxing their networks, wireless carriers are looking for new ways to make money from mobile data and applications, rather than voice minutes. Over the last three years, the amount of money consumers spent a month on mobile calling declined to $30 from $40, according to Recon Analytics. During the same period, the average amount spent on data nearly doubled, jumping to $13 from $7. “We’ve fallen in love with data and the utility that we get from it,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon. “The usage pattern has changed dramatically.” AT&amp;T and Verizon have both phased out their unlimited data plans in favor of tiered plans. Verizon offers 75-megabyte plans for basic phones, as well as two-, five- and 10-gigabyte plans for smartphones, topping out at $80 a month. Those in the more expensive plans who go over their limit are charged $10 for another gigabyte, as are AT&amp;T customers who exceed the limit on that company’s two-gigabyte plan, which costs $25. T-Mobile, which AT&amp;T is hoping to acquire, offers tiers from 200 megabytes up to 10 gigabytes. Those on the 200-megabyte plan are charged 10 cents for an extra megabyte. And if those with the upper-tier plans exceed their limits, the company slows their data connections until the next billing period. Sprint is the last carrier to hold onto its unlimited data plan, but analysts and industry experts say it is unlikely to last. All of the carriers let customers track their data use through their Web sites and on their phones, and they send alerts when customers are in danger of going over. Of course, those who want to avoid paying more can simply wait until they are connected to a Wi-Fi network to, say, download high-definition videos, since this will not count against the monthly limit. But that doesn’t help someone who wants to stream movies or music on a long evening commute. Terry Hartup, 34, who works as a technology consultant in Clearwater, Fla., said he was frustrated that his connection might be slowed if T-Mobile decided he was using too much data. “These new services are coming out that let us do more, but the pipe is getting smaller and smaller,” he said. “And costing us more.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/technology/in-strike-verizon-and-union-trade-barbs.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">In Strike, Verizon and Union Trade Barbs<date>Published: August 12, 2011</date><text>Ever since 45,000 workers began their strike against Verizon Communications on Sunday, their unions have repeatedly stressed one point: Verizon’s push for concessions would “destroy middle-class jobs” and “push workers out of the middle class.”Verizon officials assert that this is largely a shrewd talking point aimed at wooing public support for the workers. The company insists that the striking employees are handsomely paid and will remain solidly in the middle class even if Verizon wins on some of the disputed issues, like getting the workers to pay at least $1,200 more a year toward health coverage. Throughout this first week of the walkout by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the sides have contradicted each other and talked past each other as they jockey to win public backing and rally their supporters. For instance, union officials say Verizon’s proposed health insurance changes would cost some workers $6,800 more each year, and its overall proposals would cost workers $20,000 on average each year. But Verizon’s top spokesman called the $6,800 health assertion “distorted” and the $20,000 claim “bogus.” In the states stretching from Massachusetts to Virginia, where the unions are on strike, workers picketed on Friday at scores of company facilities, with the communications workers president, Larry Cohen, joining the picketing in Philadelphia. In addition to the health insurance changes, Verizon has called for a pension freeze, reduction of sick days and elimination of all job security provisions — a proposal workers fear will lead to far more layoffs and outsourcing, especially of call center workers. “The package of concessions they’re seeking is so sweeping in terms of wages, benefits, pension, vacation and sick days that it would take what are good union jobs and push people into a very different economic situation,” said Pam Galpern, a Verizon field technician in New York City for 12 years. “We see this as a definite attack on the middle class, and there’s no justification for it from a company that’s so profitable.” Verizon officials show little patience with union talk about imperiled middle-class workers, “This is a well-worn negotiating and communications ploy — it’s not a statement of fact,” said Peter Thonis, Verizon’s chief spokesman. Verizon says its unionized workers average $70,000 a year before overtime and $91,000 with overtime. But union officials say only a small percentage of workers earn that much with overtime, an amount they say would require hundreds of hours of it. Company officials note that the average American worker earns $23 an hour, translating to $48,000 a year for a full-time worker. “The striking workers earn considerably more than many unionized nurses and teachers,” Mr. Thonis said. “We’re at the very top of our industry in terms of compensation.” He said the strikers were part of a rarefied group who contributed nothing toward their health insurance premiums. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, just 1 percent of American workers pay nothing toward their family coverage premiums. The unions say the workers pay 7 percent of their health coverage through copayments and deductibles. Doug Anderson, a Verizon field technician for 15 years, said he was barely in the middle class and would fall out of it if Verizon won concessions. “What we make is just a living wage in the New York area,” said Mr. Anderson, 53, a father of three who lives in Poughkeepsie. “On what I earn, my family can’t even afford to live where I work — Westchester County. And on what we earn, it’s hard to send a child through college.” Warning that the strike might be a long one, Robert Master, a union spokesman, said the workers were angry because the company seemed intent on cutting compensation costs even though it had $22 billion in profits the last four years. But Verizon officials say that nearly all the striking employees work in its landline division, which faces intense competitive pressures. Its customer base and profit margins have shrunk over the last decade, they said. Industry analysts estimate that the Verizon workers earn several dollars more an hour than workers at largely nonunion cable competitors like Cablevision and Time Warner. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/technology/sagging-verizon-landline-division-is-at-the-heart-of-strike.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Sagging Verizon Landline Division Is at the Heart of Strike<date>Published: August 10, 2011</date><text>In the nation’s largest strike in four years, Verizon Communications and its unions are deeply divided over the company’s assertions that its traditional landline business is performing so badly that it needs large-scale concessions.The unions’ refusal to believe Verizon is one reason, labor relations experts say, that the 45,000 workers who went on strike Sunday are already dug in and braced for a lengthy walkout. Heightening the stakes, some industry analysts say Verizon sees the weak economy as a prime opportunity to chop union costs. Verizon has repeatedly stressed that it needs to cut costs in its landline business because that division’s customer base and profit margins have fallen over the last decade. Many consumers have dropped landlines in favor of competing options like mobile phones, cable and Skype. Verizon officials describe its heavily unionized landline division as a laggard, while Verizon Wireless, a largely nonunion joint venture in which Verizon is majority shareholder, is hailed as the shining star, its hefty profits lifting the rest of the company. In the first six months of this year, Verizon Wireless had operating income of $9 billion, the company reported, while its landline business had operating income of $606 million. In defending the company’s push for concessions — including a pension freeze, fewer sick days and far higher employee health contributions — Verizon’s chief executive, Lowell McAdam, said in a letter to employees, “The existing contract provisions, negotiated initially when Verizon was under far less competitive pressure, are not in line with the economic realities of business today.” Officials with the striking unions — the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — insist that the landline division is doing just fine. They note that its profit margins have increased over the last five quarters and that its FiOS TV and Internet service is growing strongly. The unions further argue that members in the landline division should not be pressured to accept concessions just because Verizon Wireless is doing better. Union officials maintain that Verizon is seeking concessions worth $1 billion a year or about $20,000 a year per union member. “It’s true that wireline is losing lines, but many of them are going to Verizon Wireless,” said Robert Master, a spokesman for the communications workers. “And regardless of how many lines they’ve lost, they’re obviously operating as an enormously profitable company. Considering these profit numbers and the huge amount that Verizon’s top executives are being paid, it’s not fair that our members are the ones to have to make sacrifices.” Verizon officials say that FiOS is not — as the unions say— going to be the financial savior for the landline business. Verizon’s chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, said Wednesday at a conference that FiOS’s profitability was increasing. But he said that because of the huge upfront costs involved in laying the fiber optic network, FiOS would never be as profitable as the early telephone business, which had little competition. FiOS, he said, faces a “very fierce competitive environment with the cable companies,” adding, “The legacy core business is a real drag. And we have to fix that cost structure.” George Kohl, a special assistant to the communications workers’ president, said Verizon used billions of dollars in profits from its traditional landline business to finance its expansion into wireless. Verizon Wireless, he noted, just announced a $10 billion dividend to its shareholders, with $5.5 billion going to Verizon. “The wireline guys sweated day by day to make the profits to create wireless,” he said. “And now they want to take away the middle-class life from the wireline employees who made the investment in wireless possible.” Craig Moffett, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said the tables had turned in recent years, and profits from wireless were financing the huge investment in FiOS. Mr. Moffett agreed with Verizon’s arguments that its landline business was hurting. “Verizon FiOS is a very good network, but it hasn’t stopped the bleeding in wireline,” he said. “Wireline is a business that is earning about a 1.6 percent return on investment and it has a 7.5 percent cost of capital. It isn’t coming close to earning enough to cover its cost of financing.” The financials of Verizon’s landline business are not the only set of numbers that company and union are fighting over. Union officials dispute the company’s estimate that each employee receives $50,000 worth of benefits each year. In that number, the company includes $14,700 for medical and dental insurance, $10,900 for retiree health care and life insurance, $10,800 for pension and $7,500 for time off. Union officials say total benefits average $25,000 a year. Mr. Kohl, the union official, disputed the $10,800 yearly figure for pensions, noting that Verizon’s annual report said the company’s 2010 contributions to the union’s defined benefit plans “were not significant.” Verizon officials said the $10,800 was an average annual amount. Mr. Kohl also said the $10,900 retiree health care figure was greatly exaggerated, asserting that many retirees had worked years to pay for that care so the cost should not be attributed to current employees. Mr. Kohl also quarreled with Verizon saying the value of time off — vacation, sick days and personal days — was $7,500. He dismissed that as double-counting because that number was already counted in wages.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/in-verizon-strike-landlines-and-fios.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">In Verizon Strike, Landlines (and FiOS)<date>Published: August 7, 2011</date><text>The decision by 45,000 workers at Verizon Communications businesses to go on strike Sunday over proposed benefit cuts reflects sharp battle lines. On one side is a highly profitable telecommunications company that is eager to trim costs in its declining businesses; on the other are unionized workers who fear that the many concessions demanded by their employer will force them to give up decades of hard-won gains.The walkout is unusual at a time when unemployment is steep and organized labor has lost several big battles. But union leaders are angry that Verizon has budged little from its long list of demands during six weeks of negotiations. The unions have resisted Verizon’s requests for concessions on scores of issues because the company has been very profitable overall, with net income of $6.9 billion in the first six months of this year. Verizon notes that most of its lines of business that deliver services over wires — the part of the company where the striking workers are employed — are in decline. The bulk of the company’s profits come from Verizon Wireless, a thriving, nonunion joint venture that is majority-owned by Verizon. The strike is the largest in the nation since 74,000 General Motors workers walked out for two days in 2007, although some union leaders warned that the Verizon strike could last much longer because the two sides remain far apart. Union leaders and workers said the walkout would inevitably cause significant delays in phone repairs and in installations of its fast-growing FiOS television and Internet services in customers’ homes. But Verizon officials said the company had tens of thousands of managers ready to step in to do the work normally done by the striking workers. Verizon’s chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, took a hard line on Sunday, arguing that workers in Verizon’s heavily unionized wireline businesses must agree to cost reductions. The wireline businesses, which include home and business telephone landlines as well as the FiOS services, have had declines in their customer base and profitability in the last decade, amid growing competition from mobile phones, cable companies and services like Skype and Vonage. “It is clear that some of the existing contract provisions, negotiated initially when Verizon was under far less competitive pressure, are not in line with the economic realities of business today,” Mr. McAdam wrote in a letter on Sunday to the company’s management to discuss the strike. “As the U.S. automobile industry found out a few years ago, failure to make needed adjustments — when the need for change is obvious — can be catastrophic.” The strike involves Verizon repair technicians, FiOS installers and call center workers from Massachusetts to Virginia. The walkout was called by the Communications Workers of America, which represents 35,000 of the strikers, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 10,000. Verizon wants the unionized workers to start contributing to their health care premiums, including $1,300 to $3,000 a year toward family coverage. The company has also called for freezing pension contributions for current employees, eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, limiting sick days to five a year, and eliminating all job security provisions. “What they’re asking is hard for us to swallow because the company had profits of $22 billion over the last four years,” said Joe Iorio, a field technician based in Brooklyn, who has worked for Verizon for 15 years. “They’re crying poverty, they say they can’t afford to pay us. We’re just not going to stand for it anymore.” Several union members said they were insulted that they were being asked to make deep concessions when Verizon’s top five executives received a total of $258 million in compensation, including stock options, over the last four years. Verizon says its unionized employees are well paid, with many field technicians earning more than $90,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. Union officials say the field technicians and call center workers generally earn $60,000 to $77,000 a year before overtime and that benefits come to far less than $50,000 a year. Michael Parker, executive vice president for a communications workers’ local in Annapolis, Md., said it was not easy to go on strike. “It’s a scary thing — we have 45,000 families that don’t have income coming in,” he said. “But we have to draw a line in the sand and defend what we believe in. We bargained for 50 years to gain these things, and we don’t want to give that back.” Jeff Kagan, founder of a telecommunications research firm in Georgia, said the strike would undoubtedly slow construction of Verizon’s FiOS network and installation of FiOS in homes, but the short-term hit was worth it to Verizon. “Their traditional local phone business is shrinking, while the other parts of the business are still growing,” he said. “It’s just a matter of restructuring so they can remain competitive. If they’re not competitive, Verizon will lose business and everyone loses — investors, customers and workers.” Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell, said the two unions felt Verizon was trying to humble them by pushing them to adopt some of the same, less generous benefits that many of the company’s 135,000 nonunion workers have. “When you challenge unions like that, in a sense the company is pushing them into a strike,” he said. In 2000, Verizon had another big strike, when 86,000 workers walked out for two weeks, causing widespread delays in repairs. As recently as Wednesday, union and Verizon officials said they thought a strike was highly unlikely. But several union officials said on Sunday that they were stunned that Verizon still had 100 proposals for concessions on the negotiating table on Saturday, including ones to eliminate Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday and Veterans Day as holidays. “No one expected six weeks of bargaining would produce absolutely no movement or compromise by the company,” said Robert Master, a communications workers spokesman. “This was an unprecedented situation.” Verizon officials have repeatedly said that the two unions broke off talks on Sunday, but union officials said they have asked for new meetings, and Verizon has refused.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/global/across-globe-traders-brace-for-a-downturn.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Across Globe, Traders Brace for a Downturn<date>Published: August 7, 2011</date><text>Traders and bankers are braced for another volatile week in global markets — and the wildest ride is likely to be in stocks, not the Treasury bonds that were downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor’s on Friday. The initial shock waves from the downgrade of the government’s credit rating were felt in stock markets over the weekend. Shares plunged in the Middle East on Sunday and had slipped by midday in Asia. On Wall Street, traders and strategists trekked to their offices on Sunday in scenes reminiscent of the fateful weekend before Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley all hosted conference calls for anxious investors, and traders plotted strategy for what they expected to be a tumultuous day on Monday. In Israel, shares fell 7 percent on Sunday, the worst drop since 2000. Investors placed so many sell orders that the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange delayed the opening of trading. By midday on Monday, Japanese stocks were down almost 2 percent, and in Hong Kong they had fallen nearly 4 percent. Gold prices were soaring, with spot prices approaching $1,700 an ounce, and the dollar weakened in early trading. In futures trading on Sunday night, major United States stock indexes were down more than 2 percent, although futures are not always reliable indicators of how stocks will open the next day in New York. One factor that might bolster stocks is the announcement by European leaders on Sunday that they were planning huge purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds in an attempt to reassure nervous investors. S.&amp; P. — the rating agency that issued a historic downgrade of United States Treasury securities to AA+ from AAA on Friday night — is expected this week to downgrade a host of other securities linked to Treasuries. Those include bonds from insurers as well as debt from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants. Like Treasuries, notes issued by Fannie and Freddie are considered to be among the safest investments, so even a modest downgrade could rattle investors. “What they did on Friday is a big deal,” said Peter Fisher, the head of fixed-income portfolio management at BlackRock, the giant asset manager. “We’re all waiting to see how they follow through in terms of the knock-on effect.” At the Newport Beach, Calif., headquarters of Pimco, the world’s largest bond fund manager, the co-chief investment officer, William H. Gross, met with senior money managers and traders as Asian markets prepared to open, and also gathered a skeleton crew of employees to staff the trading desks. It was the first Sunday that he had gathered his team at the office since Lehman’s collapse in September 2008, Mr. Gross said, adding that he was planning to be back at work at 3:30 Pacific time on Monday morning to gauge the market action in Europe. “It’s a series of events that comes close to Lehman in terms of the anticipation, and the sleeplessness is similar,” Mr. Gross said. While he said he did not expect stocks or bonds to necessarily plunge this time, volatility reminiscent of the days of the financial crisis might be in store. Mr. Gross said he expected that investors in only about 1 percent of his firm’s accounts would sell Treasury securities. At the Manhattan offices of BlackRock, which has $3.6 trillion under management, Mr. Fisher was also at his desk Sunday. He said he did not expect that investors would automatically sell Treasury bonds as a result of the downgrade, but that they might unload riskier assets like stocks and lower-rated bonds. “If you think the world is a risky place, you start at the outer edges, not what’s least risky,” Mr. Fisher said. On both sides of the Atlantic, the twin worries of staggering amounts of government debt and slowing economic growth dominated the broader discussion, prompting European leaders to announce the purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds. For American investors, the downgrade by S.&amp; P. comes at an especially jittery moment. By the time the rating agency acted late Friday, Wall Street had suffered its worst week since the financial crisis, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 5.75 percent, a slide punctuated by a 512-point drop on Thursday. Even more than the standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling, the stock market’s plunge was caused by increasing fears that the economy has lost its momentum and could even be on the verge of another recession. Those worries, compounded by the downgrade, could add up to a one-two punch for stocks. “Investors who are still on the fence may begin to think a recession is more likely,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.&amp; P. Equity Research, which operates independently of S.&amp; P.’s ratings division. “There are a lot of things investors now have to contend with. They have to decide whether the global economy has stepped on a soft patch or on quicksand.” To be sure, not everyone on Wall Street was calling for doom and gloom. In a note on Sunday, Barry Knapp, a strategist at Barclays Capital, said his firm remained bullish. Stock valuations, he insisted, remain appealing. Still, in a sign of the anxiety coursing through Wall Street all weekend, nearly 4,000 investors dialed into a conference call organized by Morgan Stanley’s research team. “That’s the most I’ve ever heard of for a Sunday in August,” said Adam Parker, the firm’s chief United States equity strategist. Echoing Mr. Fisher’s statements, Mr. Parker said that the Morgan Stanley team did not expect Treasuries to take a hit as a result of the downgrade. But, as fear rises, riskier assets like stocks are likely to suffer, he said. He is recommending that investors avoid the consumer discretionary sector, which means companies like restaurants, retailers and apparel sellers, as well as industrial companies. A safer harbor might be health care companies and utilities. “With the market having come down this fast, that in and of itself could increase the probability of a recession,” Mr. Parker said.

Strike at Verizon<date>Published: August 6, 2011</date><text>Two unions representing 45,000 workers at Verizon Communications announced early Sunday that they were calling an immediate strike because of a lack of progress in contract negotiations.The strike involves Verizon telephone field technicians, call center workers and cable installers from Massachusetts to Virginia and is expected to cause some delays in repairing and installing land line phones and Verizon’s FiOS television and Internet service. Officials with the two unions, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said Verizon was demanding far too many concessions — on health coverage, pensions and other matters — and was not backing off many of them. Verizon executives say far-reaching concessions are needed because of a long-term drop in revenue and profit in its land line telephone business and because of intense competition in television and Internet services. The strike involves Verizon’s wire lines division, which include its traditional land lines to homes and business as well as FiOS. Unlike Verizon Wireless, a joint venture in which Verizon is the majority owner, the wire lines division is heavily unionized, with the Communications Workers representing 35,000 employees and the Electrical Workers 10,000. In announcing the strike at 12:20 a.m., the communications workers complained that almost 100 of Verizon’s demands for concessions remained on the negotiating table. “Since bargaining began on June 22, Verizon has refused to move from a long list of concession demands,” the union said in its post-midnight statement. “Even at the 11th hour, as contracts were set to expire, Verizon continued to seek to strip away 50 years of collective bargaining gains for middle class workers and their families.” Early Sunday morning, Verizon issued a statement saying its attempts to reach a construct with the two unions were unsuccessful. The company said, “In anticipation of this development, Verizon has activated a contingency plan to ensure customers experience limited disruption in service during this time.” Mark C. Reed, Verizon’s executive vice president of human resources, said, “It’s regrettable for our employees and our customers” that the two unions “have decided to walk away from the table instead of continuing to work through the issues.” But Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the communications workers, said at 12:30 a.m. that the talks were continuing, emphatically denying that the unions had broken off talks. In its statement, Verizon said it had “trained tens of thousands of management employees, retirees and others to fill the roles and responsibilities of its union-represented wireline workers.” Mr. Reed said, “We are confident that we have the talent and resources in place to meet the needs and demands of our customers.” In the talks that have been held in recent weeks in New York and Philadelphia, Verizon has asked its unionized workers to start contributing to their health care premiums, proposing that workers pay $1,300 to $3,000 for family coverage, depending on the plan. Verizon executives say the contributions would be similar to those already made by its 135,000 nonunion employees. Verizon has also called for freezing pensions for current employees and eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, while making its 401(k) plans somewhat more generous for both. It would also like to limit sick days to five a year, as opposed to the current policy, which company executives say sets no limit. In addition, Verizon wants to make it easier to lay off workers without having to buy them out and wants to tie raises more closely to job performance, denying annual raises to subpar performers. Union officials say these proposals are the most aggressive Verizon has ever made. Verizon called its unionized employees well paid, saying that many field technicians earn more than $100,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. But union officials say that the field technicians and call center workers generally earn $60,000 to $77,000 before overtime and that benefits come to well under $50,000 a year. The crux of the clash is Verizon’s financial health. The company says its traditional wire line division is struggling, while the union says Verizon’s overall business, including Verizon Wireless, is thriving. Verizon earned $6.9 billion in net income for the first six months of this year, amid strong growth in its majority-owned Verizon Wireless cellphone operation. And its hefty investment in FiOS is starting to pay off. But the company has repeatedly said it needs to rein in costs in its wire lines division because it has lost business to wireless companies, to Internet companies like Vonage and Skype and to cable television companies, many of them nonunion, like Comcast and Time Warner.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/windstream-to-buy-paetec-for-891-million/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Windstream to Buy Paetec for $891 Million<date>August 1, 2011, 9:57 am</date><text>The Windstream Corporation announced on Monday that it had agreed to buy the broadband services provider Paetec Holding Corporation for $891 million, in a bid to build out its fiber network and cloud computing services. Under the transaction, Paetec shareholders will get 0.460 of a share of Windstream for each Paetec share, or about $891 million in stock. Windstream will also take on about $1.4 billion of Paetec’s debt. “This transaction significantly advances our strategy to drive top-line revenue growth by expanding our focus on business and broadband services,” Jeffery R. Gardner, the chief executive of Windstream, said in a statement. “The combined company will have a nationwide network with a deep fiber footprint to offer enhanced capabilities in strategic growth areas, including I.P.-based services, data centers, cloud computing and managed services.” Founded in 1998, Paetec provides voice, data and business services to nearly all of the metropolitan areas in the United States. For enterprise clients, Paetec offers cloud computing and data center solutions and a broad range of software and equipment products to help customers manage their communications networks. The deal comes as several telecommunications companies have made acquisitions to build out their broadband and data storage capacity as the shift to cloud computing gathers strength. Earlier this year, Verizon agreed to buy the informational technology services provider Terremark for $1.4 billion. In April, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of the data storage company Savvis for $2.5 billion. The acquisition of Paetec will add seven data centers and a fiber network of 36,700 miles to Windstream’s portfolio and should increase cash flow in the first year, excluding merger costs, according to the press release. The deal, which is expected to close within the next six months, should generate about $100 million in annual cost savings, the company said. Stephens and J.P. Morgan Securities served as financial advisers to Windstream, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank advised Paetec.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/business/media/new-york-cable-channel-to-carry-al-jazeera-english.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">New York Cable Channel to Carry Al Jazeera English<date>Published: August 1, 2011</date><text>Every cable news channel has its moment.CNN had the gulf war. Fox News had the war on terror. And Al Jazeera English had the Arab Spring. But six months after widespread protests erupted in the Middle East, the Qatar-based Al Jazeera has not gained distribution on any major cable or satellite systems in the United States. The channel’s supporters say they feel it has been blacklisted; the distributors say they have to contend with limited channel space. Undeterred, Al Jazeera English executives say they are making headway. On Monday, the channel will be carried in New York City for the first time, though only by subletting space from a channel owner. The channel has a foothold in Washington through a similar arrangement. “We will get on in the U.S.,” Al Anstey, the channel’s managing director, said confidently in an interview in Manhattan, where he came late last week to celebrate the carriage deal. Al Jazeera English was lauded by the United States government and even by a few competitors for its broadcasts from Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries earlier this year. But it is finding out that cable and satellite distributors like Comcast, DirecTV and Dish Network wield an enormous amount of control over the channels that viewers in the United States can and cannot see. “It’s all about leverage in this business, and they don’t have any,” said Paul Maxwell, the head of a cable industry consulting firm. Al Jazeera does not have a parent company with powerful assets, as the News Corporation did when it used the huge popularity of Fox News to gain channel space for a spinoff, Fox Business, a few years ago. Nor does it have proof that millions are clamoring to watch, as most Americans have not been exposed to the channel. Reflecting what some distribution executives said on condition of anonymity, Mr. Maxwell suggested that the dearth of evident demand was the main reason for Al Jazeera’s being shut out. Still, he said, “I think it should be carried; there is a public interest reason for it.” The channel was founded in 2006 as a competitor to CNN International and the BBC. It was an offshoot of Al Jazeera Arabic, the popular Arab satellite news network that was demonized by the Bush administration as a platform for anti-American propaganda, in part because it broadcast Al Qaeda videotapes. Furthering the tensions, American missiles struck Al Jazeera offices in Afghanistan in 2001 and in Iraq in 2003 during the wars in those countries. In both cases United States officials said the strikes were mistakes. The tensions began to ease toward the end of the Bush administration. But Al Jazeera officials say they believe that American impressions of both the Arabic and the English channels were harmed. Early meetings with distributors were about correcting “myths and misperceptions” of the English channel, Mr. Anstey said. Now, he added, those myths never come up. The channel and its lobbyists have worked hard to change perceptions in Washington and in the media out of a conviction, Mr. Anstey said, that once people watch Al Jazeera English, they come to recognize that “what we’re putting out is high-quality information, well told.” The lobbying effort was helped by the channel’s exhaustive and in some cases exclusive coverage of the protests in Tunisia, Egypt and elsewhere this year. Al Jazeera immediately began an advertising campaign and encouraged viewers to write to United States distributors to demand carriage, and Mr. Anstey traveled to the United States to meet with distributors like Comcast and DirecTV. “We had some very fruitful meetings,” he said over a double espresso at the Grand Hyatt in Midtown Manhattan last week. “We’re making some very good headway.” He disputed the suggestion that the channel was not in demand, citing 70,000 supporter letters that were sent to distributors via the Al Jazeera Web site. He and others at the channel were electrified in March when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton labeled Al Jazeera “real news” and contrasted it with the commercials and “arguments between talking heads” on United States-based channels. Ms. Clinton’s comments raised the ire of some conservatives, but overall criticism of the channel has been limited. The country’s biggest cable and satellite companies each declined requests for interviews about Al Jazeera last week; most cited policies against talking about any specific carriage decisions. But they expressed no public concerns about Al Jazeera’s content. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/business/verizon-workers-vote-to-support-strike.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon’s Union Workers Vote to Authorize Strike<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>Verizon Communications is seeking major concessions from 45,000 unionized workers in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, as it copes with a long-term drop in revenue and profits in its old-fashioned telephone business and intense competition in television and Internet services.But the union leaders are resisting any suggestion of givebacks, saying the overall company is making plenty of money. The company earned $6.9 billion in net income for the first six months of this year, amid strong growth in its majority-owned Verizon Wireless cellphone operation. And Verizon’s hefty investment in its FiOS TV and Internet services is starting to pay off. The battle lines between the sides were drawn more sharply on Thursday, when the Communication Workers of America announced that in balloting by 35,000 of its members at Verizon, 91 percent had authorized their leaders to call a strike as soon as Aug. 7, after the contract expires. Verizon officials were quick to note that such a vote did not necessarily mean a strike would occur. Such votes are routine in contentious contract discussions, and negotiators usually reach a settlement before the strike deadline. However, Verizon and union officials agree that the company’s demands are far more sweeping than in previous years. Verizon says it is pushing hard for flexibility and to hold down costs because its wireline business — which, unlike its wireless operation, is heavily unionized — faces such intense competition, much of it nonunion. “We’re looking to make meaningful changes in the contract, which reflect the state of the wireline business as well as the economy,” said Lawrence Marcus, Verizon’s senior vice president for labor relations. “The wireline business is basically fighting to reverse a 10-year decline in our profitability.” Verizon is pressing its unionized workers to begin contributing to their health care premiums, proposing that workers pay $1,300 to $3,000 for family coverage, depending on the plan. The company says the contributions are similar to those made by its 135,000 nonunion employees. Verizon also wants to make it easier to lay off workers without having to buy them out and wants to tie raises more closely to job performance, denying annual raises to subpar performers. The company also has called for freezing pensions for current employees and eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, while making its 401(k) plans somewhat more generous for both groups. It would also like to limit sick days to five a year, as opposed to the current policy, which company officials say sets no limit. “Verizon has put on the table the most aggressive set of contract demands we’ve ever seen,” said Robert Master, a spokesman for the communications workers. “From our perspective, this hugely profitable company that made $20 billion over the last four years, despite the worst economy in 75 years, seems determined to turn tens of thousands of secure middle-class jobs into lower-wage, much less secure jobs.” The union has sought to put Verizon on the defensive, repeatedly highlighting that its top five executives received a total of $258 million, including stock options, over the last four years. The union is planning a big protest Saturday outside Verizon’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan. “I’m not a financial wizard, but if you can afford to pay a C.E.O. millions a year, then how can you ask workers to slash their benefits?” said Paula M. Vinciguerra, president of the communications’ workers’ local on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. “I was raised with the idea of shared sacrifice.” Verizon said many field technicians earned $95,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. But union officials said the field technicians and call center workers generally earned $29 to $37 an hour, translating to $60,000 to $77,000 for a full-time worker, with benefits worth an additional $25,000 a year. The Verizon contracts that expire at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 7 cover nearly 45,000 workers, from Massachusetts to Virginia, including thousands of Verizon employees in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. That union is holding a separate strike authorization vote. Jim Spillane, a spokesman for the electrical workers, declined to comment on Verizon’s proposals or the contract talks. The crux of the clash is Verizon’s financial health. The company says the wireline division is struggling, while the union says Verizon’s overall business is thriving. Craig Moffett, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said: “It’s hard to argue with Verizon’s basic premise that the wireline business is a troubled business. They are going to have to find ways to shrink that business to maintain any semblance of viability.” Last year, Verizon’s wireline division trimmed its work force by buying out 11,900 workers. Its wireline operations — which include home phones and FiOS — had revenues of $41.2 billion last year, down 2.9 percent from the previous year. At Verizon Wireless, a joint venture with Vodafone Group, a British company, revenue was $63.4 billion, a 5.1 percent increase over the previous year. Verizon reported that its wireline operating income was $606 million for the first six months of this year, compared with $9.0 billion at Verizon Wireless. Jeff Kagan, founder of a telecommunications research company in Atlanta, said Verizon’s landline division had no competition until the last decade. Verizon has lost business to wireless companies, to companies like Vonage and Skype and to cable television companies, many of them nonunion like Comcast and Time Warner, Mr. Kagan said. “When you have competition with companies that are not unionized, it’s a different world,” he said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/business/testing-iphone-buying-the-android.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Testing iPhone, Buying the Android<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>First sold to the public just four years ago, the Apple iPhone melded the vast potential of the Internet with a multimedia player, a still and video camera, e-mail, texting, instant messaging, social networking and other applications — now 425,000 and counting — into one elegant, easy-to-use touch-screen package. And it makes voice calls. Rarely has one device so upended a market.This week Apple said it sold 20.3 million in the quarter that ended June 30, 142 percent more than it sold during the same quarter a year ago and two million more than the previous record for a quarter. Apple shares hit a record high of $400 after its quarterly profit of $7.31 billion soared past estimates, giving the company a market value of $360 billion. It is America’s second-most-valuable company, surpassed only by Exxon Mobil. Is Apple’s dominance insurmountable? Just over two years ago, when I was shopping for a new phone, nothing seemed close to rivaling the iPhone. It was available exclusively to AT&amp;T customers, so I reluctantly settled on a BlackBerry model (the Pearl) available to Verizon subscribers like me. A few weeks ago, I had to ask directions to a restaurant from a young woman I spotted on the street using an iPhone. She quickly obliged by producing an easy-to-read Google map while the Pearl, whose tiny screen made it all but useless for Web browsing and navigation, languished in my pocket. Apple ended AT&amp;T’s exclusivity earlier this year, and this month I was eligible for an upgrade to a new device. During the years since I’d bought the Pearl, an array of new devices using the Google Android operating system had appeared, and Research in Motion had introduced several new BlackBerry models. Limiting the original iPhone to AT&amp;T subscribers brought Apple lucrative payments from AT&amp;T and heightened the device’s aura of exclusivity. But I wondered: had Apple waited too long, given the pace of change in the industry, allowing Android and RIM devices to catch up, or even move ahead? I decided to compare three rival mobile devices: the iPhone 4, and Android and BlackBerry models. The stakes are enormous. For all Apple’s recent success, a titanic battle is now under way among Apple, Google, RIM and a recent alliance between Nokia and Microsoft, with Amazon, Twitter and Facebook waiting in the wings. Even as iPhone sales soar, sales of Android devices are rising faster. The consulting firm Millennial Media estimated last month that Android devices accounted for 54 percent of the global market for smartphones, followed by Apple with 26 percent, RIM with 15 percent and all others with less than 4 percent. This battle is only partly about the devices themselves. Google doesn’t make or sell them, instead licensing its operating system to pretty much anyone who wants to use it, including HTC, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and most of the world’s manufacturers. Google makes money from advertising, and wants to use the Android platform to dominate search and display advertising on mobile devices. Apple makes a lot of money selling iPhones, but the devices are inextricably linked to applications and content sold by Apple, like products from the Apple App Store. As John Jackson, an analyst who specializes in mobile and wireless technologies at CSS Insight put it, “At the end of the day, this is a battle between Internet giants for control of what you do and consume on your mobile device and beyond. It will all turn on the ecosystem.” For my experiment, Verizon lent me an iPhone 4, a Samsung Droid Charge and a BlackBerry Bold. I immediately unwrapped the iPhone. Like all Apple products, the packaging was as elegant as the device. It fit comfortably in my hand and pocket. Voice calls were clear, with none of the antenna problems I’d read about when the iPhone 4 was introduced. Web browsing was a pleasure, with fast download speeds even at 3G levels. As an iPad and Mac user, I felt instantly at home, with familiar apps already installed and easy to use. My only complaint was the relatively cramped touch keyboard. I was spewing out typos and often fighting the aggressive auto-correction feature. I suppose none of this is news to the millions already using iPhones, but to someone like me, the device was a revelation. After several days, I realized that I had to stop using the iPhone or this wasn’t going to pass muster as an objective test. So I turned to the Samsung Droid Charge. Who designed the packaging and marketing? Samsung takes the Android imagery to absurd lengths, with vaguely Star Wars packaging and sound effects that seem aimed at teenage gamers. My first impression was that it was an embarrassment to anyone over 30. But then I took a closer look at the device itself. It’s big (5.1” x 2.7”) but surprisingly light (5 ounces compared to the iPhone’s 4.8 ounces). Its curved edges made it comfortable to hold and it slipped easily into my pocket. The large screen is amazing. Even though I wasn’t familiar with the operating system, I found the instructions clear, the device easy to use and intuitive. I found life in the Google ecosystem surprisingly congenial, with seamless Gmail, Google search, calendar, mapping and navigation. The 4G Charge did everything the 3G iPhone did, only faster (in areas with 4G coverage) and bigger. Photos and video were especially impressive. And the touch keyboard was so big and tactile that my typos all but vanished. I can’t say it was flawless — searching for restaurant recommendations in Old Saybrook, Conn., I kept getting results for Old Seabrook, N.H. —but I don’t think I can blame the phone. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/technology/iphone-bolsters-verizon-results.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">iPhone Bolsters Verizon Results<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>When Verizon began selling a version of Apple’s iPhone, analysts and industry experts alike expected that customers, weary of congestion on AT&amp;T’s network, the only carrier then selling the sleek device, would flee to Verizon in droves.That has not quite happened, at least not yet. On Friday, while reporting its quarterly earnings results, Verizon said it activated 2.3 million iPhones during the company’s second quarter. That is a hefty figure, because the device has been available on Verizon for only a few months, but it paled in comparison to AT&amp;T’s iPhone activations for the same quarter. On Thursday, AT&amp;T reported that it had activated 3.6 million iPhones on its network, and that nearly a quarter of them were for new customers to AT&amp;T. And activations on AT&amp;T’s network have held steady over the last three months, surprising analysts who thought that most customers would wait for the fifth-generation iPhone, widely rumored to be released sometime later this year. “People overestimated the potential for customers to jump ship for Verizon,” said Phil Cusick, a wireless industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “It’s just not at that level.” Verizon has been selling the iPhone since February, but the second-quarter reports reflect the first full financial period during which the two companies were selling the device in direct competition with one another. Analysts say several factors favor AT&amp;T, including the company’s decision to begin selling a low-cost version of the iPhone, the 3GS, for $50 earlier this year. In addition, AT&amp;T was able to successfully lock customers into one- or two-year contract plans before it lost exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in the United States earlier this year. Still, analysts said, Verizon is outpacing the entire wireless industry in terms of adding subscribers, even compared with AT&amp;T. Craig Moffett, a wireless analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said, “Verizon’s wireless business has pretty good momentum right now.” Over all, Verizon’s earnings were solid, beating Wall Street’s expectations for the company. The company reported net income of $1.61 billion, or 57 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $1.19 billion during the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the company to report a profit of 55 cents a share. Revenue rose 2.8 percent, to $27.54 billion, up from $26.77 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $27.4 billion. Verizon was betting heavily on the arrival of an iPhone in early summer, executives said in a conference call with analysts and investors on Friday. The company had hoped it would nudge the number of subscribers that had smartphones closer to 50 percent. Historically, Verizon has lagged behind its rivals in pushing its customers toward mobile devices like smartphones, wireless modems and tablets, and the lucrative data packages that come with them. This push will become especially crucial as Verizon, along with its competitors, move from the decaying landline and voice business and increasingly look toward data services for the bulk of their revenue. Already, Verizon’s wireless business accounts for 60 percent of the company’s total revenue. Money generated from selling mobile data services is close to 40 percent of Verizon’s wireless revenue. Lowell McAdam, the chief executive of Verizon Wireless, who will succeed Ivan Seidenberg as chief executive of the parent company on Aug. 1, acknowledged that the company was “maybe a quarter behind what we talked about in January.” But he expressed confidence that the outlook would sharply improve over the coming months, particularly when the next version of the iPhone was released. “We don’t know when the next one is going to come out,” Mr. McAdams said. “But we expect that probably sometime in the fall, and I think you will see a significant jump there when we get to that point.” Investors may not have been as optimistic. Shares of the company dipped slightly, down 83 cents, or 2.21 percent, to $36.74. One issue with the introduction of the iPhone to Verizon was whether the carrier would buckle under the crush of the new data-intensive users. It has not, which analysts attributed to the fact that Verizon had several years to upgrade its network and infrastructure while watching AT&amp;T struggle with this problem. “Verizon was better prepared thanks to AT&amp;T,” said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. But even AT&amp;T’s network, long the source of complaints from beleaguered users who said they got poor cellular reception and suffered from dropped calls, has improved over all, Mr. Sharma said. Verizon’s results were lifted by strong growth in the company’s wireless arm, which is 45 percent owned by Vodafone. The company reported a sharp increase — 1.3 million — in net new subscribers in the quarter. Smartphones accounted for 36 percent of Verizon Wireless’s postpaid subscriber phone base, up from 32 percent in the first quarter of the year. Verizon recently began rolling out its fourth-generation wireless network, which uses a fast wireless technology called LTE, and is heavily marketing tablets and smartphones that are compatible with that new technology. Verizon’s earnings might also shed some light into the brewing rivalry between Apple and Google and both look to dominate the smartphone and tablet industry. Although Verizon continued to achieve sales from its catalog of Android and 4G devices, the company sold far fewer of those devices than they did iPhones. For the quarter, the company reported sales of 1.2 million LTE and Android devices, which includes tablets, smartphones and wireless modems. “Verizon’s had Android for a long time,” said Mr. Sharma, who keeps a close eye on the industry. “This was the first real test between an iPhone and Android and consumers still gravitate towards the iPhone.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/opinion/22fri2.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">To Cap Broadband, or Not<date>Published: July 21, 2011</date><text>As people do more with their broadband connections — streaming movies, downloading music, moving files to and from the cloud — it might seem natural for Internet service providers to impose data caps on users to manage their networks and deal with congestion. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, set a cap of 250 gigabytes a month in 2008, disconnecting users who exceeded the limit twice in a six-month period. In May, AT&amp;T introduced a limit of 150 gigabytes a month for DSL customers and 250 gigabytes for those on the extra-fast U-verse network it deployed in several cities. It will charge an extra $10 for every 50 gigabytes beyond the cap. This strategy follows closely the path of wireless broadband, where both Verizon and AT&amp;T have replaced unlimited data plans with tiered offerings. But wireline data caps warrant a close look by federal regulators. They are billed as a way to manage traffic, but they could also hamstring the user’s experience, blunt competition online and stymie innovation on the Internet. This problem is of particular concern because there is hardly any competition in high-speed broadband services (speeds above 10 megabits per second). Some users have a choice between a cable company and a phone company. In many areas they have no choice. Caps should not just be a way for Internet providers to extract monopoly rents. Data caps are a blunt way of managing broadband. Moving an extra gigabyte of data at off-peak times costs virtually nothing. Peak demand is the problem. Yet caps make no allowance for this. Moreover, there is no crunch in wireline broadband capacity, as there is in wireless. Internet providers must recoup substantial investments in their networks, but adding capacity is cheaper than putting up a network, and becoming cheaper all the time. Caps can be used anticompetitively — to discourage the use of services that rival an Internet service provider’s in-house offerings. For instance, AT&amp;T points out that Netflix hogs 30 percent of peak-hour Internet traffic in North America. Netflix also competes with television offerings on AT&amp;T’s U-verse network. Watching TV on U-verse does not count against the data cap. Streaming Netflix does. Caps are not universal in wireline broadband. Verizon and Time Warner Cable do not have them yet. (Time Warner Cable tried caps in 2008, but customers rebelled.) Experts expect them to become more popular, and as they do, the Federal Communications Commission should seek to understand how effective they are at relieving congestion and what effect they have on services that rival Internet providers’ in-house offerings, like video. And it should keep an eye on whether caps respond to network efficiency gains and capacity increases. Caps must not impede development of broadband.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/verizon-to-drop-its-unlimited-mobile-data-plan-july-7/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon to Drop Its Unlimited Mobile-Data Plan<date>July 5, 2011, 5:41 pm</date><text>On July 7, Verizon will become the third major mobile phone carrier to ditch its unlimited-data plan and go to tiered pricing, following AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. You could see it as a simple supply-and-demand issue. The use of data by smartphone users has grown 89 percent, from 230 megabytes (MB) in the first quarter of 2010 to 435 MB in the first quarter of 2011, according to a Nielsen study. Data capacity — the supply — is not growing at that rate. And growth costs money. Tiers put the onus on consumers to either use less data or pay more for the data they use (or both). A study by Validas, a company that analyses its customers’ bills to match them with an efficient phone plan, said that the upcharge on Verizon smartphone users was steep. Under the current plan, Verizon’s unlimited data plan is $30. Under the new tiered service, the lowest priced plan, 2GB per month, will be $30. Other tiers will be 5GB for $50 and 10GB for $80. Overage is $10 per 1 GB. Validas said it studied 11,000 Verizon Wireless bills that had been submitted for analysis and found that 96 percent of Verizon smartphone users consumed less than the 2GB of the minimum tier each month. In fact, 36 percent used less than 75MB of data. And less than 1 percent of the Verizon Wireless users consumed more than 5GB of data. That means that most consumers won’t have to spend any more than they did for the unlimited plan. But that might be cold comfort to people who buy the unlimited plan as a kind of insurance policy — they overpay so they never have worry about going over, even if in actuality they use nowhere near the limit. I’m not sure Validas’s suggestion of more tiers of service so that people can be more closely matched to their actual usage is the answer either. For one, mobile contracts are confusing enough as it is, adding more tiers won’t make it any easier. “It is a fine line between giving the consumer too many options so it’s confusing, and too few so it doesn’t fit,” said Dylan Breslin-Barnhart, a Validas spokesperson. The second reason more tiers might not make sense is that with the rapid increase of data use, Verizon may have built in reasonable room for growth — their lowest-end users might be burning up close to 2GB of data by the time their contracts run out in two years. In the meantime, you have just a day to sign a new contract under the old unlimited plan.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/the-casio-commando-is-tough-and-complex/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Like All Good Action Heroes, Casio's Commando Is Tough — but Complex<date>June 22, 2011, 5:36 am</date><text>The people who make phone cases are going to be very unhappy with the Casio G’zOne Commando phone. So are people who like simplicity. The case makers won’t like the Commando because its case is reinforced with built-in bumpers, is rated to withstand a drop from four feet and is water resistant. It meets “military standards 810G” in a number of tests, which are nearly meaningless, like being resistant to damage from solar radiation. In any event, you won’t need an additional protective case. People who like simplicity won’t like it because the phone has so many features that the learning curve is quite steep. The operating system is Android-based, so you could just use the most obvious features and you’d be fine. But Casio has added its own features as well, like the “snap out menu” that makes your most-used apps available on all five start screens. While proposing that the phone is useful to business people who work in harsh environments, Casio clearly has outdoorsmen in mind, with features like built-in adventure-training apps, trip memory, a tide tracker and a prominent “Earth compass” (so named, I can only assume, so you don’t get confused if you are using the phone on another planet). Digging into the compass, you’ll find maps that show your relation to America’s national parks, world mountains and natural landmarks, or you can build your own map with landmarks of your choice. It also has an app comparable to Swype called T9 Trace, which lets you drag your finger around the keypad to type quickly, and it has an app that reads incoming text messages out loud — in fact, really loud; its front-facing speakers achieve the highest volume I’ve heard from a phone. The phone works on 3G and can connect to Wi-Fi. It can work as a hotspot to connect up to five gadgets to the Internet. It includes a 5-megapixel camera with an LED flash and a stereo Bluetooth connection. For all of its rugged sophistication, the phone is running an 800-MHz processor, which is a bit sluggish by current standards. The Commando phone is available through Verizon for $200 with a two-year contract.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/dracula-lurks-in-your-set-top-box/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Dracula Lurks in Your Set-Top Box<date>June 15, 2011, 6:23 pm</date><text>Natural Resources Defense Council Imagine pulling into your parking space and just hopping out, leaving the car idling all day while you’re at the office. As ludicrous as this may sound, most Americans are guilty of a similar if less costly squandering of energy when it comes to their cable or satellite TV boxes. A new study released on Tuesday by the Natural Resources Defense Council shows that set-top boxes in the United States consume nearly as much energy when not in use as when they are on, costing a cumulative $2 billion a year. Noah Horowitz, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency at the council, said that while most Americans have been guilted into unplugging their cellphone chargers when they’re not attached to the phone itself, those energy savings pale by comparison with what would be recouped by unplugging set-top boxes. The problem is that the set-top boxes installed by Cablevision, Time Warner or Verizon when you sign up for service have no such thing as an on-off switch. Turning the power off on the remote may dim the display lights, but it makes no substantial difference in terms of the energy consumed. Unless you squeeze behind the TV to unplug everything after your show ends, the little black box will end up racking up an average two-thirds of its energy consumption when you’re not using it. With 160 million such set-top boxes in use in the country today, the power wasted is equivalent to what is produced annually by six coal burning power plants and is responsible for the release of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. Meanwhile, with more and more Americans demanding to watch what they want, when they want, DVRs, which consume 40 percent more energy than a standard cable box, are becoming increasingly prevalent. Because the cable, satellite or phone company doesn’t pay your energy bill, Mr. Horowitz said, it has little incentive to provide its customers with more energy-efficient boxes. In fact, some of the DVR devices provided by the companies could be set to a more energy-efficient mode, he said, but the TV service providers don’t take the time to do so. The good news is that solutions already exist. Europe’s Sky TV offers its customers a DVR box that uses 22.5 watts when fully on, 13.2 watts when in light sleep mode and less than one watt when in deep sleep mode, which you can set to coordinate with your own deep sleep mode. If you’re not ready to pack up for Europe, though, Mr. Horowitz said, you can still pick up your phone and tell your TV service provider that you want modern devices on this side of the Atlantic.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/googles-new-chromebook-explained/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Google's New Chromebook Explained<date>June 5, 2011, 7:40 am</date><text>The Samsung Series 5 Chromebook (starting at $429), on sale June 15. Update Sunday, June 5 7:52 p.m.: Clarified that, while Chromebooks do have a hard drive, that drive is used by the OS, not for a user’s data storage. Also changed wording to indicate that data is not in Google’s possession, necessarily, but whichever cloud-based service a user is using. So Google’s made a new laptop? Not exactly. Samsung and Acer have made new laptops called Chromebooks that run on Google’s Chrome OS. They’ll be available starting June 15 at Amazon.com and Best Buy. Chrome OS? So, not Windows or Mac. Not Windows or Mac. Chrome OS is a new operating system. How does Chrome OS work? Is it majorly different from the other major operating systems? Chrome OS is actually pretty different. It is basically a browser — and nothing more than a browser. Everything happens in the browser. There’s no “desktop,” and there’s no hard drive for you to use. This makes no sense to me. It is pretty radical. Try thinking of it this way: If you use the Web not just for browsing sites but also for your e-mail, and your word processor (think Google Docs), and your photos, and your banking and a whole host of other things, then do you really need all the extra stuff that an OS like Windows and Mac has? O.K. I mean, I’m sort of with you here, but walk me through this. What happens when I turn on a Chromebook? And what happens after that? When you turn on a Chromebook, it very quickly (more so than traditional-OS-based PCs) brings you to a login screen. From there, you can enter your username and password for your Google account (if you have Gmail, it is the same account). If you do not have a Google account, you can log in as a guest. Once you do that, you’ll see a browser. The browser is Google’s own Chrome browser, which Windows and Mac users have been able to use for about two and a half years. There are no other programs or applications to use. The browser is it. So where are my files? Well, Chromebooks do have a slot for an optional memory card, and a rudimentary file manager to access saved data there, but the Chromebook’s hard drive is for the OS, not for storing your files. The assumption is that your files will be stored in the cloud. If you have word-processing documents, you can store those in, say, Google Docs, or Microsoft’s SkyDrive. Your e-mail messages no longer live in an Outlook or Mail application, but on Gmail or Yahoo Mail. Photos are on Picasa or Shutterfly or Flickr. But there are no other programs? Not really, no. What there are Chrome Apps, which are kind of like jazzed-up Web sites. So, for example, there is a Google Docs Chrome App, but it is not very different than simply accessing the Google Docs site. There are also games as Chrome Apps, so you can play Angry Birds or Missile Command, but don’t expect heavyweight gaming experiences like Call of Duty. So all this assumes I have an Internet connection. Yes. Chromebooks will be sold either with Wi-Fi only, or with Wi-Fi and wireless-data from Verizon. Wait. So if I’m in a situation where I don’t have an Internet connection, is the Chromebook useless? Not exactly. Some Chrome apps work offline. Google is saying that Google Docs and Gmail will work offline as well. All games that are Chrome Apps work offline. But make no mistake about it, without a (good) Internet connection, Chromebooks are pretty hobbled. That seems like it could be a pretty significant downside. It very well could be. There are some advantages to this model, however. Like with any cloud-based system, your data is not tied to one machine. You can access it from any computer that is online. Your Chromebook will be updated automatically, in the background, so you will always have the latest version of the OS. Chromebooks are faster to start up than traditional PCs, and if your Chromebook should become damaged or go missing, your data is safe, since it was never on the machine itself, but stored by Google on a server farm somewhere. Yes, but still: No Internet connection means a really compromised computing environment. Absolutely. It will most likely give many people pause before buying one. And my files — I am never actually in possession of them, right? The Cloud has them? Yes. Should I be nervous about that? Not really, but some people may not like the idea that all their data is being maintained by someone else. Tell me about the hardware. Initially, there will be two Chromebooks. The Acer Chromebook will have an 11.6-inch display, weigh 2.95 pounds and start at $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model (3G pricing has not been announced yet). Samsung’s Chromebook (called the Series 5) has a 12.1-inch display, will weigh 3.26 pounds and will cost $429 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $499 for the Wi-Fi and 3G model. But with the 3G models, I’ll have to buy a data plan, right? Actually, no. Buyers of 3G Chromebooks will get 100 megabytes of data a month free for two years from Verizon Wireless. If you want, you will be able to buy additional data packets on a month-by-month basis for $10 to $50, depending on the amount of data. That’s nice of them. But let me understand something: Chromebooks are going to cost between $350 and $500, right? Yes. And how much do netbooks cost? Well, just as an example, Best Buy is selling 15 netbooks from $200 to $530 right now. And those netbooks, what are they running on? Windows 7. Do they have hard drives? Yes. They range in capacity from 160 to 320 gigabytes. Are they heavy? Not really. They weigh between 2.4 and 3.1 pounds. Do they have really small screens? Kind of — 10.1 inches is pretty common. Though there are some 11.6 models out there. If you move into the “laptop” category, you can find models with 14-inch screens in the same price range as netbooks. So, with these netbooks and laptops that cost the same or less, and weigh the same or less, and come with screens bigger and smaller than Chromebooks, I could still do all those cloud-based things you were talking about, but I could also have a full-fledged computer as well? Yes. So I would want a Chromebook because …? Good question.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/opinion/l04verizon.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Setting Data-Roaming Rates: The View From Verizon<date>Published: June 3, 2011</date><text>To the Editor: Your May 31 editorial “Making Data Roam” implied that Verizon Wireless hurriedly signed data-roaming agreements with small or rural wireless carriers after April 2010 ahead of federal regulation. This was simply not the case. Long before the Federal Communications Commission sought to impose its data-roaming price regulations, Verizon had a number of data-roaming agreements in place. You missed an opportunity to note the positive impact that network investments by companies like Verizon create for businesses and consumers. Verizon in the past six years has invested tens of billions of dollars to upgrade its networks. In many cases small and rural providers were slow to invest in 3G technologies, but were encouraged to do so to meet their customers’ demands. Not only did data-roaming agreements grow out of those deployments, but also a host of new products and services and applications for those consumers. The current data-roaming process, which allows rates to be set through good-faith negotiations, works for consumers, as well as wireless companies large and small. Government mandates dictating the outcome of negotiations would discourage wireless companies from investing in upgrading their own networks to meet their customers’ needs. Less investment means less innovation and fewer jobs. PETER W.

The manager asked a colleague if this was proper, according to a report by the office of the special investigator for city schools. The colleague said others at I.B.M. were also concerned, with one saying he “did not trust Lanham.” But Mr. Lanham, known as Ross, assured I.B.M. that he had spoken with a supervisor at the Education Department, who “was O.K. with it,” and the matter was taken no further. The supervisor would later tell investigators he did not recall such a conversation. It was the first of several warning signs about Mr. Lanham, whom investigators have accused of stealing $3.6 million from the city through marked-up billings using a complex scheme of contractors and subcontractors, including I.B.M. and Verizon. But because of Mr. Lanham’s unchecked power over the project, which the city was paying him $200,000 a year to oversee, virtually all of the suspicions came to naught. The companies assumed that if Mr. Lanham said it was fine, the city had approved it. The case, which comes on the heels of an $80 million fraud prosecution involving consultants on another city project, the CityTime automated payroll system, illustrates again the vast amounts of money the city is spending on technology, and the trust it was putting in independent consultants. The Education Department said that once Mr. Lanham’s activities came to light, it added controls to prevent a recurrence. On his weekly radio show on Friday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the alleged theft “unconscionable.” “Whenever there’s fraud, you can look back and say, ‘We should have looked there,’ ” he said. “But keep in mind the city has a budget of $65 billion a year, with lots and lots of contracts and lots of opportunities.” The Department of Education has vowed to recover the money, Verizon and I.B.M. have pledged to cooperate with the investigation and Mr. Lanham, through his lawyer, professed his innocence after he surrendered to federal authorities on Thursday on charges of theft and fraud. Mr. Lanham’s lawyer, Joseph W. Ryan Jr., said Friday that the time it took the city to fire him “should be interpreted as a sign that he acted in good faith and within the law.” During the six-year period when the authorities say he stole the money, Mr. Lanham was apparently left to operate on his own. “It is difficult to understand how the D.O.E. could allow so much power to reside in a consultant, even an honest one, which Mr. Lanham was not,” the city’s investigative report said. The authorities said Mr. Lanham eventually hired five workers, including his brother Robert, to do data entry and billing analysis on the project, paying them $30 to $70 as consultants through Lanham Enterprises. Lanham Enterprises would then submit highly marked-up bills to another company, which in turn submitted marked-up bills to Verizon or I.B.M. Those companies then marked the bills up further when they submitted them to the department at rates as high as $290 an hour, according to investigators. The city’s report suggests that the companies marked up the bills with Mr. Lanham’s approval. None of the companies have been accused of any crime. As the invoices traveled from one company to the next, the actual work performed by the five employees became more muddled and harder to discern. Lanham Enterprises described them as “telecommunications consultants” on its bills. The companies that paid Lanham often billed Verizon or I.B.M for “consulting services,” but Verizon’s bills to the department did not refer consultants. According to the report, the bills mentioned things like “installations-integration services” and referred to the consultants as “multiple” or “various” on the spreadsheets that were supposed to have detailed the nature of the work. Still, the city paid the bills. A Verizon manager acknowledged to investigators that Mr. Lanham had threatened to steer its work to I.B.M. if Verizon did not agree to use one of the intermediary companies, Custom Computer Specialists of Hauppauge, that Mr. Lanham wanted them to use. In 2006, the president of a company that had managed the project before Mr. Lanham called the Education Department and accused him of receiving kickbacks from the companies with which he worked. Mr. Lanham was dismissed in 2008, but it took more than two years to build a criminal case against him.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/nyregion/consultant-to-schools-stole-millions-officials-say.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Consultant to Schools Stole Millions, Officials Say<date>Published: April 28, 2011</date><text>Aided by lax oversight and by corporations that profited from his scheme, a former technology consultant stole $3.6 million over six years from the Department of Education to finance flashy cars and real estate speculation, federal authorities said on Thursday.The investigation revealed another embarrassing lack of supervision in one of the city’s technology projects, just four months after federal authorities charged seven people in what they called an $80 million scheme to steal from CityTime, an automated payroll system that ballooned in cost to more than $700 million, nearly 10 times over budget. It also comes as the Education Department plans to invest more than half a billion dollars next year to upgrade Internet access in every school. As in the CityTime case, the charges revealed on Thursday revealed the enormous responsibilities and power given to technology consultants working on city projects. The former consultant, Willard Lanham, 58, surrendered to federal authorities on Thursday on charges of mail fraud and theft from a billion-dollar school-wiring and Internet-access project financed partly by the federal government. Mr. Lanham, who was being paid $200,000 a year by the city, used layers of contractors and subcontractors to hide his scheme, and each of them profited a little from it, according to the federal complaint. He hired several people, including a brother, to work on the city contract, then billed another company for those hires, marking up the invoices. The company, for its part, charged Verizon or I.B.M., the two major vendors, more than what it had paid Mr. Lanham. According to a report by Richard J. Condon, a special investigator for the city schools, Verizon and I.B.M., in turn, billed the Education Department, also marking up the amounts. Verizon marked up the bills by $800,000, and I.B.M. by $400,000, said Mr. Condon’s report, which he had forwarded to the federal authorities. “I.B.M. and Verizon, by their silence, facilitated this fraud,” the report said. The companies have not been implicated in the criminal case, and none of their employees have been charged. In statements, both Verizon and I.B.M. said they had been cooperating with the authorities. Verizon went a step further, saying it was “prepared to return any inappropriate profits” to the Education Department. A lawyer for Mr. Lanham, Joseph W. Ryan, said in a statement that his client “denies that he is guilty of any wrongdoing,” calling him a “problem-solver extraordinaire” for the projects he managed for the department. Mr. Lanham, known as Ross, was hired as a consultant for the Education Department in 2000, part of a team charged with handling the installation of Internet cables and connections in city schools, as well as a cost-savings system to centralize the department’s telephone bill payments. By 2002, he had become the projects’ manager, in charge of a costly contract and many people, with seemingly no oversight. Just around that time, leadership of the schools’ technology team was shifting and, according to Mr. Condon, Mr. Lanham set out to operate freely, putting in motion a scheme that would go undetected for years, though some people began having suspicions about him. He often met vendors alone and e-mailed them without giving copies to anyone at the Education Department. In all, he hired five consultants, including his brother, who worked from home and made $60 to $70 an hour. Mr. Lanham billed a cabling subcontractor, Custom Design Communications, an hourly rate of $225, pocketing the difference. That company billed Verizon roughly $250 an hour, then Verizon billed the Education Department $290, all for the same work, Mr. Condon’s report says. The scheme developed in much the same way with every consultant Mr. Lanham hired and every subcontractor and vendor he coaxed into playing along, including I.B.M., the report said. The federal complaint says that with the money he made, Mr. Lanham and his wife bought a Corvette, a Porsche and other equally expensive cars, and he tried his hand at real estate, building luxurious homes on a piece of land he owned on eastern Long Island. Mr. Condon’s report said that Verizon officials questioned Mr. Lanham’s demand to bring in Custom Design Communications as a subcontractor, but acquiesced after he threatened to give their work to I.B.M. (Two phone numbers are listed for Custom Design Communications, but neither line was in service Thursday, and the company’s Web site was disabled.) Mr. Lanham was fired in 2008, roughly two years after Mr. Condon’s office received anonymous complaints that he was getting kickbacks from vendors. The investigators could not find evidence of kickbacks, but while checking the accusations, they discovered that I.B.M. had been billing the Education Department for work performed by consultants hired by Mr. Lanham without authorization. The case broadened in 2008, after a senior director at the department’s Division of Instructional and Information Technology accused Mr. Lanham of hiring consultants and having their work billed by Verizon. The schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, said in a statement, “We are entrusted with the public’s money, and should have been more vigilant in our oversight of this project.” After Mr. Lanham was fired, the department said, it rolled out new safeguards against rogue consultants, including an in-house contract manager responsible for approving and monitoring purchases and payments and a unit charged with carrying out price and cost analyses for contracted services. Mr. Lanham surrendered at 10 a.m. Thursday and appeared in court for a few minutes later in the day. United States Magistrate Judge Theodore H. Katz set bond at $250,000 and ordered Mr. Lanham to surrender his passport, get a job and not incur any new lines of credit.

With subscriber growth barely beating Wall Street estimates, some analysts complained about profit margins and others said revenue growth was lower than they had hoped at Verizon Wireless, the mobile venture of Verizon and the Vodafone Group. Verizon Wireless posted net additions of 906,000 subscribers, just slightly ahead of expectations from analysts contacted by Reuters, who had predicted more than 888,000 subscribers. While Verizon Wireless, the top mobile service, added only slightly more subscribers than it did in the fourth quarter, it was well ahead of its archrival, AT&amp;T, which added 62,000 net subscribers in the quarter. But a crucial point for investors when comparing the two was that AT&amp;T, even though it no longer had exclusive rights to the iPhone, won more new iPhone customers in the quarter than Verizon. The expectation had been that hordes of customers would flee AT&amp;T when the Verizon iPhone arrived because popular phones typically experience a surge in sales during the quarter when they are introduced. “It was a stronger new customer driver for AT&amp;T,” Steve Clement, an analyst at Pacific Crest, said. Verizon, which put the iPhone on store shelves on Feb. 10, said it sold 2.2 million iPhones by the end of the quarter, compared with the 3.6 million iPhone sales at AT&amp;T, which had the phone for the entire quarter. About 22 percent of Verizon’s iPhone customers switched from rival carriers, but about 23 percent of AT&amp;T’s were also new to that company. This implies that Verizon won fewer than 500,000 new customers through the iPhone, while AT&amp;T added more than 800,000 iPhone customers from other carriers. In addition, higher sales of advanced devices like the iPhone came at a high cost for Verizon as its profit margin dipped, Michael Nelson, a Mizuho analyst, said. Its margin was 43.7 percent, compared with the 46 percent it posted a year earlier, based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. While the iPhone helped Verizon raise subscriber numbers, its sales were not significantly better than analyst expectations, as some investors had hoped. “Over all it was a solid quarter, not necessarily a blowout quarter,” Mr. Nelson said. Verizon earnings rose to $1.44 billion, or 51 cents a share, from $443 million, or 16 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago, when it shouldered hefty one-time charges. Revenue rose to $26.99 billion, from $26.9 billion in the year-earlier period; the average analyst expectation was $26.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Shares of Verizon fell 88 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $36.91.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/technology/05net.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Court Rejects Suit on Net Neutrality Rules as Premature<date>Published: April 4, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Monday rejected as “premature” a lawsuit by Verizon and MetroPCS challenging the Federal Communications Commission’s pending rules aimed at keeping Internet service providers from blocking access to certain Web sites or applications. While the decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, is a first-round victory for the F.C.C. and its chairman, Julius Genachowski, the real battle over the agency’s attempt to regulate broadband providers has barely begun. Several broadband companies, and some consumer advocacy and public interest groups, are likely to return to court this year to challenge aspects of the rules. Edward S. McFadden, a Verizon spokesman, said Monday that the company intended to refile its lawsuit this year. The House will take up a joint resolution condemning the new Internet access rules this week. Though the House is likely to pass the resolution prohibiting the F.C.C. from putting the new rules into effect, it is doubtful that the resolution will go much further because many Senate Democrats and the Obama administration support the rules. The Verizon lawsuit was dismissed as premature, the court said, because federal regulations dictate that a challenge to new F.C.C. rules must come within 10 days after a new rule is published in the Federal Register. That publication has not taken place, although the F.C.C. approved its rules in December, because the regulations must be reviewed for compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. That F.C.C. review, which includes a 60-day public comment period, will be completed this month. Then, the Office of Management and Budget will conduct a review, with a 30-day comment period, before the rules are published. A commission spokesman, Robert Kenny, said the agency was pleased by the court’s decision and believed its policy “preserves Internet freedom and openness and strikes the right balance for consumers and businesses across America.” The new regulations, which the commission calls its Open Internet Order, are commonly known as net neutrality rules. They prohibit companies providing broadband Internet service to consumers from discriminating in granting access by customers to content providers. Once the regulations are published in the Federal Register, any legal challenge filed in 10 days is entered in a lottery to determine the legal venue. Verizon and MetroPCS tried to sidestep that provision by contending that the rules modified their licenses to operate wireless broadband networks. So, they said, the dispute was a licensing issue, not an appeal of a new rule, a position the court rejected.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/obama-pushes-energy-savings-from-clean-fleets/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Obama Pushes Energy Savings From 'Clean Fleets'<date>April 1, 2011, 10:41 am</date><text>President Obama is joining with FedEx, U.P.S. and several other major companies whose vehicles are familiar sights on America’s roadways to promote a new administration initiative encouraging businesses to operate commercial fleets that burn less gasoline and diesel fuel. Two days after Mr. Obama set a national goal of cutting oil imports by one-third by 2025, in a speech at Georgetown University, he was scheduled to travel on Friday to a shipping center in Landover, Md., just outside Washington, to view new “clean fleets” belonging to the two delivery giants and to AT&amp;T, PepsiCo and Verizon. The president’s focus on clean energy this week comes at a time when Americans are paying gasoline prices that now average about $4 a gallon, close to the high levels just before he won election in 2008. According to the White House, the five corporations have commercial fleets that are among the 10 largest in the country; together they own more than 275,000 cars and trucks. They have joined the administration’s new public-private partnership to encourage a switch to vehicles that are more fuel-efficient or run on electric power or alternative fuels. In the near term, the five companies will deploy more than 20,000 advanced-technology vehicles, saving more than 7 million gallons of oil, the administration estimated. The National Clean Fleets Partnership would be open to companies of all sizes, according to the White House. Through the Department of Energy, which already has a Clean Cities vehicle technology program, participants would get up-to-date technical information and purchasing assistance. For example, smaller companies could piggy-back on larger corporations’ bulk purchases, enjoying the same cost savings on advanced vehicles that use electric batteries, natural gas, biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen or propane.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/htcs-thunderbolt-is-as-fast-as-lightning/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">HTC's Thunderbolt Is as Fast as Lightning<date>March 30, 2011, 5:47 pm</date><text>Finally, a credible 4G phone. The term 4G has been conveniently applied to half-step measures that speed up phone networks, but the HTC Thunderbolt in tandem with Verizon’s LTE network finally provides the ripping speeds we have been promised. How fast is it? At my desk in Baltimore, without having to travel to any special location, downloads averaged 12.28 megabits per second, which is — by today’s standards — lightning fast. To compare, have a look at my test of the T-Mobile HSPA+ network, which it calls 4G and the Sprint WiMax network. When I drove my car to an “optimal location,” as directed by T-Mobile, the average download speed was 5.7 megabits per second. At that speed a two-hour movie would load in about 20 minutes. With the HTC EVO, Sprint’s WiMax 4G phone, I got an average speed of 3.7 megabits per second (Sprint said it should have been faster). The Thunderbolt has a 4.3 inch touch screen in a case that is slightly larger, thicker and heavier than I’ve come to expect from 3G phones. It comes with 8 gigabytes of memory built in and a 32-GB microSD card installed. The phone incorporates an 8-megapixel camera with a dual-LED flash and photo effects software as well as geotagging and face recognition features. It also has a front-facing camera for video chats. The operating system is Android 2.2, so it includes Flash, which means you can see a majority of Web content. And it has a mobile hot spot feature, so your computer can use it as a Wi-Fi hot spot to get to the Internet. It can play a variety of music formats, including MP3 and AAC, as well as supporting video. It even has a built-in FM radio. Like many Android phones, its ability to multitask means that it burns battery power at a prodigious rate, especially if you are downloading lots of data and using the features like the GPS. It is also a bit pricey, at $250 with a two-year Verizon contract. That contract will require a $30-a-month data package on top of voice and text. But that is the way of the world. Ask any sports car fan: the faster you want to go, the more you have to spend.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/business/27phone.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">AT&amp;T Lobbyist Faces Beltway Test in T-Mobile Deal<date>Published: March 26, 2011</date><text>WashingtonIN this covetous town, the delicacies of the Georgetown Cupcake shop stand alone as symbols of wish fulfillment — heaping swirls of luscious confection atop rich, creamy pastry. Therefore: Operation Cupcake. As the Federal Communications Commission debated final rules last December on how Internet service providers should manage their traffic,  AT&amp;T delivered 1,500 of these opulent desserts to the F.C.C.’s headquarters here. Like many other big corporations, AT&amp;T annually blankets power brokers with token holiday gifts, but the cupcake campaign was notable for its military precision. A three-page spreadsheet, stamped “AT&amp;T Proprietary (Internal Use Only),” detailed how the desserts were to be deployed to each of the 63 commission offices: four dozen were assigned to the enforcement bureau, 10 dozen to the wireless divisions, 12 cupcakes to each of four commissioners, and 18 to the chairman, and so on. As it turns out,  AT&amp;T had begun its $39 billion courting of T-Mobile about the same time. The resulting deal, announced a week ago, would transform the industry if approved. It would narrow the field of major wireless providers to three and vault AT&amp;T into the No. 1 spot, ahead of Verizon; consumer advocates say the combination will lead to higher prices. As interested parties lobby for and against the merger, one person will be pulling at the levers of power more often and with more influence than anyone else, according to both friends and foes: AT&amp;T’s chief lobbyist, James W. Cicconi. A master strategist, Mr. Cicconi (pronounced si-CONE-ee) internalizes the art of regulatory and legislative war — and Operation Cupcake is but one of the efforts to come out of his shop. Tutored by James A. Baker III in the ways of politics in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Mr. Cicconi, 58, plays hardball — literally, as a pitcher in an adult baseball league, flinging fastballs toward batters more than a decade younger. His roots are in Texas, and he never forgets the lesson of the Alamo: the Texans lost. Other battles have different lessons for him. He once took his staff on an overnight retreat to Gettysburg, Pa., where it toured Cemetery Ridge and Little Round Top and absorbed lessons on battlefield tactics. In 13 years at AT&amp;T, Mr. Cicconi has helped guide the company through roughly a dozen mergers, large and small, and he has made his share of enemies in Washington. As a testament to his power, however, few of them will criticize him on the record. “He’s smart, he’s savvy, he’s strategic,” says Gigi B. Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, a media and consumer advocacy group that has often wrestled with him. “I don’t think there’s a lobbyist in town who I disagree with more on the issues, but I have the utmost respect and admiration for the way he does his job. He’s always thinking three steps ahead of the competition.” MR. CICCONI, senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, is not alone, of course, in spreading AT&amp;T’s corporate message. Five other executives rate a similar rank, and four more are group presidents or chief executives, all under AT&amp;T’s chairman and C.E.O., Randall L. Stephenson. Nor is Mr. Cicconi’s lobbying effort a one-man show. He oversees a division that spent $115 million on lobbying over the last six years, putting it among the top five corporate spenders in the country, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying and campaign spending. AT&amp;T employs an army of outside lobbyists, including at least six prominent former members of Congress, including the former Senate majority leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, and former Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. Over the last two decades, AT&amp;T employees and its political action committees have pumped more campaign contributions into federal politics than any other American corporation, the Center for Responsive Politics reports. In the last election cycle, AT&amp;T contributions found their way to 390 representatives and 70 senators. “They are a behemoth,” says Dave Levinthal, editor of Opensecrets.org, the center’s online lobbying database. “When you have dozens of former federal officials doing your bidding in Washington with a detailed knowledge of how Washington works, it is exponentially easier to grease the skids of government.” As Congress discusses the merger, Republicans and Democrats will duel over the balance of market forces and regulatory intervention. The White House will strive to balance the president’s campaign promises to get tough on antitrust issues while trying to prove he is not anti-business. In advocating for the T-Mobile merger, AT&amp;T and Mr. Cicconi have their work cut out for them. The Justice Department’s antitrust unit will aim to determine whether the deal will substantially limit consumers’ choices. After the merger, AT&amp;T and Verizon would together control nearly 80 percent of the cellular market, with Sprint a distant third. (Verizon declined to comment on Mr. Cicconi or on AT&amp;T’s deal to acquire T-Mobile.) And the F.C.C., which along with Justice must approve the merger, wants to reapportion the scarce broadcast wavelengths on which wireless broadband operates. The T-mobile deal would result in fewer potential bidders in its airwave auctions. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EEDE113AF931A15750C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">DEALBOOK; AT&amp;T's Cost For Getting T-Mobile<date>Published: March 22, 2011</date><text>''We have never seen a deal with more regulatory risk be attempted in the U.S.'' That was the initial assessment of AT&amp;T's $39 billion agreement to acquire T-Mobile, from Jonathan Chaplin, one of the most thoughtful telecommunications analysts on Wall Street. ''It is unlikely that AT&amp;T would attempt a deal that they knew would fail,'' he said. ''However, we can't see how they would get this through without massive divestitures and concessions.'' In Washington, though, the question is whether the deal should get through at all. And if it is approved, how much will AT&amp;T ultimately have to give up? The deal is a classic duopoly case study: if AT&amp;T and T-Mobile combined, it would set up a match-up like Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi, with AT&amp;T pitted against Verizon. The other rivals become almost irrelevant. AT&amp;T and Verizon would control roughly 80 percent of the national market. The next biggest is not that big at all: Sprint is just cracking double digits, at about 12 percent. After that is the bottom tier - MetroPCS, Leap and the like - all in single digits, though their numbers have been growing. Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&amp;T, would say this is the wrong way to look at the marketplace. For the last 24 hours, he has been telling anyone who will listen that the Justice Department should and will judge the transaction on a local market-by-market basis. He says on a local level, his company is often competing against at least five players - and in some cities, like Detroit and Miami, T-Mobile is not even in the top tier. Technically, Mr. Stephenson is correct. The government will evaluate the deal on a market-by-market basis, and he does have multiple ''competitors'' in each market. But let's be honest for a moment: MetroPCS and Leap, his supposed competitors, do not offer like-for-like products that can replace AT&amp;T's offering. One of the reasons MetroPCS has been able to offer lower prices than AT&amp;T is that it does not offer true national service. (It would dispute this assessment because it uses roaming agreements and other companies' networks - namely Verizon's and Sprint's - to extend its reach.) The iPhone? Forget about it. When you think about innovation in the cellular industry - whether it be technology, price plans or service - it has not come from the third-tier companies; instead, the third-tier companies have played copycat to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. The big question is whether an AT&amp;T-Verizon duopoly will create enough competition to further drive competition and keep prices low. ''This is a significant horizontal consolidation by all the traditional measurements. This level of concentration, two-thirds of the time, has been rejected by the Department of Justice,'' Reed E. Hundt, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said on a segment with me on CNBC on Monday. Michael J. Copps, an F.C.C. commissioner, said last year that the amount of concentration in the cellular industry should be considered ''a bright caution light for this commission as we go about the business of advancing competition and consumer well-being in the broadband age.'' ''We are going to need an extra dose of vigilance going forward and use whatever policy levers we have available to ensure good outcomes for American consumers,'' he said. On that score, in the short term at least, the facts may be on AT&amp;T's side. A deal with T-Mobile should improve its service and coverage area, while allowing it to upgrade its systems with enough spectrum to keep up with the insatiable demand of consumers for more data and video over hand-held devices. Rick Kaplan, senior adviser to the F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, said on Monday that the industry was desperately in need of more spectrum. ''The spectrum crunch is real,'' he said. ''We're going to have to get more spectrum online for broadband.'' AT&amp;T hopes to leverage that sentiment by arguing that without the deal, the company will be hobbled to support its customers. The company is also playing the patriotic card by contending that the deal will ''strengthen and expand critical infrastructure for our nation's future'' and will ''help achieve the president's goals for a high-speed, wirelessly connected America.'' All of that may be true. And perhaps the government should approach deals in this context, but if so, it would be a complete shift in policy. So what will AT&amp;T have to give up to get the thumbs up? That's the $3 billion question - the amount of money it would have to pay T-Mobile's parent, Deutsche Telekom, if the deal were blocked. That huge breakup fee should provide a powerful incentive to compromise. But then the question becomes what ''remedy'' the government could come up with to ensure competitiveness and innovation. AT&amp;T would have to give up an awful lot of spectrum to ever create a true national competitor to it or Verizon. Lesser concessions could include commitments to make their networks open to competitors through roaming agreements and reseller agreements, allowing other carriers to sell service on At&amp;T's network under another brand. (That's what Verizon had to do in 2008.) Whatever the outcome, it's going to be long, drawn-out battle. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Mead, chief executive officer of Verizon Wireless. 7:39 p.m. | Updated As AT&amp;T seeks to become the nation’s biggest cellphone service provider by buying T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, many eyes are now turned to the company that currently holds that title, Verizon Wireless. For now, it appears that Verizon’s strategy is simple: Do nothing drastic. With 101.1 million customers, Verizon Wireless already holds considerable market share, and its network is regularly praised by subscribers and analysts alike for its strength and broad reach. Even if the T-Mobile deal is approved sometime in the next 12 months, vaulting AT&amp;T to the top of the industry, analysts say that Verizon is well-positioned for at least the short term. “I don’t think they need to do anything right now except stay focused on their core message and superior experience,” Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research, said in a telephone interview. While rivals — specifically Sprint Wireless, already in third place and facing the prospect of falling further behind — plan to lobby against the merger, Verizon has so far adopted a nonchalant attitude. Its chief executive, Daniel S. Mead, has signaled that he will not oppose the AT&amp;T merger as it begins a yearlong process of tough antitrust approval. When asked at a wireless industry conference if the company would be interested in a potential deal for Sprint as a counter to AT&amp;T’s deal, Mr. Mead was terse in his dismissal. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “We’re not interested in Sprint,” he said on Monday evening, according to Reuters. “We don’t need them.” While Verizon would most likely be unable to pursue a deal for Sprint in any case, and especially not if AT&amp;T’s T-Mobile deal is approved, Mr. Golvin of Forrester said that Verizon could still look at smaller acquisitions to buy additional wireless bandwidth, known as spectrum. Among the potential candidates are smaller carriers like MetroPCS or Leap Wireless, though any deal for either would probably be far off in the future. Unlike AT&amp;T, which has said that its deal for T-Mobile was in large part an effort to gain extra bandwidth for next-generation data services, Verizon already has plenty of spectrum. The carrier recently introduced its newest mobile broadband network, based on a standard called LTE, while AT&amp;T will not have until this summer. Verizon could also benefit from its biggest competitor being distracted by the huge effort needed to win approval for its deal, let alone the even more intensive effort of meshing AT&amp;T’s operations with T-Mobile’s. AT&amp;T will also most likely be forced to divest parts of its business to satisfy government regulators. Verizon’s business is also among the healthiest among the major carriers, having generated $16.1 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $63.4 billion for all of last year. The company also lays claim to the lowest rate of customer defections, or churn, among the big four carriers at 1.34 percent. By contrast, Sprint has 49.9 million subscribers and lost $3.5 billion last year. Verizon also has other strong advantages over its rivals. It has a robust selection of attractive smartphones, including those using Google’s Android system, and most recently, the Apple iPhone.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/shares-of-sprint-down-on-att-deal-with-t-mobile/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Shares of Sprint Down on AT&amp;T Deal with T-Mobile<date>March 21, 2011, 2:10 pm</date><text>With AT&amp;T moving to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, investors are fretting about the fate of Sprint-Nextel. On Monday afternoon, shares of Sprint — the nation’s third-largest cellular carrier — were down 16.5 percent, to $4.22. Their concerns are understandable. If the AT&amp;T deal is successful, the combined company would have 129.2 million customers. Verizon has 95.5 million. And Sprint trails significantly, with 49.9 million. Meanwhile, its financial situation looks precarious. The company’s loss increased to $3.5 billion last year, with revenue falling modestly. The AT&amp;T has deal has only made Sprint’s future more uncertain. Sprint itself had been pursuing T-Mobile. But the talks got bogged down over issues of price and technology. T-Mobile and Sprint operate on different standards. Sprint uses CDMA, while T-Mobile operates on GSM — the same as AT&amp;T. With speculation of such a tie-up heating up, AT&amp;T moved quickly to hash out a deal with Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s parent.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4D6123AF932A15750C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">AT&amp;T Makes Deal To Buy T-Mobile For $39 Billion<date>Published: March 21, 2011</date><text>12:16 a.m. | Updated AT&amp;T announced on Sunday that it had agreed to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion, in a deal that would create the largest carrier in the nation and promised to reshape the industry. The transaction - one of the largest since the onset of the financial crisis - is expected to start a fierce battle in Washington as regulators scrutinize the impact of the deal on competition and consumers. The deal would leave just three major cellular companies in the country: AT&amp;T, Verizon and the much smaller Sprint Nextel. Some critics denounced the merger within hours of its announcement, saying it would most likely lead to higher prices. T-Mobile had offered some of the lowest rates in the country, keeping pressure on competitors. While AT&amp;T is expected to honor current contracts, T-Mobile customers may have to pay higher rates once those contracts expire. Still, AT&amp;T pointed on Sunday to a recent report from the federal Government Accountability Office that said cellular subscription costs fell 50 percent from 1999 and 2009, a period in which the industry has consolidated. ''Consumers have borne the brunt of the increasingly concentrated market for mobile phone service,'' Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumers rights, said in a statement. ''The explosion of cellphone usage - especially smartphones - makes competition in this market more important than ever as a check on prices, consumer choice and service.'' AT&amp;T customers, though, could benefit in one notable area: service. Both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile operate on the same technology, known as GSM, so the combination should provide better coverage. That has been a sore point for AT&amp;T, which has been ridiculed over dropped calls and slow data services, especially on Apple's iPhone. ''The carriers' network technology fits nicely together so AT&amp;T could redeploy some of T-Mobile's spectrum in short order, helping relieve some of the pressures on its network,'' said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. The acquisition would give AT&amp;T additional leverage against its main rival, Verizon. The newly combined company - bringing together AT&amp;T's 95.5 million wireless subscribers with T-Mobile's 33.7 million customers - would account for roughly 42 percent of all wireless subscribers in the United States. Verizon has around 31 percent, said Charles Golvin, a telecom analyst at Forrester Research. T-Mobile customers would have the option to buy an iPhone, helping AT&amp;T combat the migration of the popular device to Verizon. The deal would also provide significant cost savings, roughly $3 billion a year for the new company. Those savings, however, could have a huge effect on both the local and national economy, from real estate to media. The combined company is expected to close hundreds of retail outlets in areas where they overlap, as well as eliminate overlapping back office, technical and call center staff. It may also slash advertising spending. Last year, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile spent $2.7 billion combined on advertising, according to Kantar Media. ''From AT&amp;T's perspective, this is a huge win,'' said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. ''It's about being No. 1 and having economy of scale.'' Scale will be critical as AT&amp;T continues its aggressive rollout of the next generation wireless network, known as 4G. The carrier has been slower than rivals to deploy the 4G technology, LTE, than competitors. T-Mobile does not have a 4G technology in place. Meanwhile, Verizon has already started to sell LTE-enabled devices. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Verizon announced at least a dozen new smartphones and tablet computers that will be compatible with the technology. Deutsche Telekom had been weighing options for T-Mobile for more than a year. It had considered an initial public offering for the company, but shelved the plans. More recently, Deutsche Telekom had held talks about selling the unit to Sprint.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/atts-full-cost-for-getting-t-mobile/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">AT&amp;T's Full Cost for Getting T-Mobile<date>March 21, 2011, 9:04 pm</date><text>Mark Dye/Newscast, via Associated PressRené Obermann, left, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, which has agreed to sell T-Mobile, and Randall L.

Whatever the outcome, it is going to be a long, drawn-out battle.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/t-mobile-deal-leaves-sprints-future-unclear/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">T-Mobile Deal Leaves Sprint's Future Unclear<date>March 20, 2011, 10:09 pm</date><text>With AT&amp;T agreeing to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, the future of Sprint Nextel just got fuzzier. Over the past several months, Sprint had held its own talks with Deutsche Telekom, the owner of T-Mobile, over a potential deal, as part of an effort to gain sorely needed scale and wireless spectrum, according to people with knowledge of the talks, which were intended to be private. But Deutsche Telekom’s discussions with AT&amp;T moved more quickly this month, and the two reached a preliminary agreement last week, one of these people said. If the deal is approved, AT&amp;T would again leapfrog Verizon Wireless to become the country’s biggest cellphone service provider, and Sprint’s strategic options would become more limited. Sprint Nextel, the product of an ill-fated merger in 2005, risks being further eclipsed by Verizon and the new AT&amp;T, which together would boast 230.3 million customers in the United States. By contrast, Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kan., has just under 50 million customers. “That means three out of every four wireless subscriptions belongs to those two companies,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “That is going to be very challenging for Sprint.” Under its current chief executive, Dan Hesse, Sprint has managed to lower its customer defection rate, in large part through improving its customer service and its product lineup. But the company has struggled to translate that into a healthier financial picture: Its annual loss widened to about $3.5 billion last year, as revenue declined slightly. The idea behind combining Sprint and T-Mobile was to add much-needed scale. Both have competed against their larger rivals on price, cutting into revenue. Underpinning the interest for T-Mobile is concern by the major service providers about limited wireless spectrum. As more and more Americans adopt devices like the iPhone, Android smartphones and tablets like the iPad, cellphone carriers are urgently seeking to add more and more capacity to handle customers’ data use. But the talks were weighed down by several major issues, including Sprint’s and Deutsche Telekom’s differing valuations of T-Mobile. Another, more technical issue revolved around the two companies’ use of different cellphone technologies. Sprint currently uses a standard known as CDMA, which is limited mainly to the United States and a handful of other countries. T-Mobile relied on the more common GSM technology. In the race to set up the next generation of wireless networks, Sprint is also increasingly alone in its reliance on the WiMax standard. AT&amp;T and Verizon have both chosen an alternative called LTE. For its part, T-Mobile lacked the spectrum necessary to develop its own next-generation network, a major driver behind its search for a merger partner. With AT&amp;T now adding T-Mobile’s 33.7 million subscribers to its fold, hardware makers could lose interest in creating products for companies other than the biggest players. Sprint may find it difficult to add cutting-edge new handsets. A larger AT&amp;T could also strike better prices for the handsets it sells, which would allow it to expand its profit margins or reduce the prices on its products. Sprint is likely to be forced to compete more aggressively on price to differentiate itself and attract new subscribers. “This puts them into a much weaker No. 3 position,” Mr. Golvin said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/opinion/l08verizon.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">What Verizon Offers<date>Published: March 7, 2011</date><text>To the Editor: “Cheap, Ultrafast Broadband? At Least Hong Kong Has It,” by Randall Stross (Digital Domain column, Sunday Business, March 6), did not mention what Verizon offers consumers and businesses that Hong Kong Broadband Network — along with our cable competitors — does not. Unlike Hong Kong Broadband, which serves one city, Verizon delivers advanced broadband, wireless voice and data, and interactive television to thousands of markets from coast to coast. While we offer the fastest consumer broadband speeds in America with our 150-megabit service, we also deliver integrated broadband and first-of-a-kind, interactive television services that provide customers with benefits that go far beyond just “speed.” Mr. Stross’s focus on a single price point for a single service overlooks the fact that a bundle of Verizon services delivers high-value experiences that American consumers demand. Verizon has invested more than $50 billion over the past three years in 4G LTE wireless, all-fiber-optic and global IP networks. Artificially bringing “multiple competitors into the picture” and “regulatory changes,” as suggested by Mr. Stross, would discourage future investments by us and by our competitors.

Still, the lawsuits filed by Verizon and MetroPCS earlier this year against the F.C.C.’s net neutrality rules are disappointing. The suits fall into a swirl of antiregulatory fervor among Republicans on Capitol Hill. The continuing resolution passed by the House last week forbids the F.C.C. from using any money to put the new rules into effect. That bill, and the lawsuits, risk stripping away the F.C.C.’s light-touch attempt to ensure that the Internet remains open — an approach carefully crafted in months of negotiations with Verizon and other companies. The suits could potentially free Internet service providers from regulation — allowing them to treat their own content better than that of rivals, and block content that they didn’t like or competed with. Verizon and AT&amp;T have about 60 percent of wireless subscribers. And 80 percent of Americans live in areas with only two wireline broadband providers. In a market with such slender competition, consumers are likely to lose out. Verizon’s argument is simple: it doesn’t want the F.C.C. to write rules for the Internet. This is especially true when it comes to wireless, which it views as virgin territory. The question is, should Verizon be allowed to, say, block Web sites that compete with its own services and discriminate at will to pursue its business interests? To us, that should be an area of federal intervention. Both lawsuits take advantage of a weakness in the F.C.C.’s approach: in proposing new rules for the Internet, it decided to stick to the Bush administration’s definition of the Internet as an “information service” rather than reclassify it as a telecom service. The F.C.C. has limited regulatory power over information services, and much more over telecommunications. In April 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the F.C.C.’s authority over information services was so limited that past efforts to ensure network neutrality exceeded its authority. While the commission believes its new rules will survive the court challenge, we fear that its strategy is legally vulnerable. Verizon and MetroPCS are bringing their cases in the D.C. Circuit. The choice for American consumers is between the open broadband they have come to expect — in which they can view any content from sources big and small — and a walled garden somewhat like cable TV, where providers can decide what we can see, and at what price.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/business/06digi.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Hong Kong Company Moves Swiftly on Ultrafast Broadband<date>Published: March 5, 2011</date><text>HONG KONG residents can enjoy astoundingly fast broadband at an astoundingly low price. It became available last year, when a scrappy company called Hong Kong Broadband Network introduced a new option for its fiber-to-the-home service: a speed of 1,000 megabits a second — known as a “gig” — for less than $26 a month.In the United States, we don’t have anything close to that. But we could. And we should. Verizon, the nation’s leading provider of fiber-to-the-home service, doesn’t offer a gig, or even half that speed. Instead, it markets a “fastest” service that is only 50 megabits a second for downloading and 20 megabits a second for uploading. It costs $144.99 a month. That’s one-twentieth the speed of Hong Kong Broadband’s service for downloading, for more than five times the price. One thing working in Hong Kong’s favor, of course, is its greater population density, enabling broadband companies to reach multiuser dwellings at a much lower cost. But density is only part of the explanation. The personality of Hong Kong Broadband should be noted, too. A wholly owned subsidiary of City Telecom, it is an aggressive newcomer. It was willing to suffer seven years of losses while building out its fiber network before it turned profitable. Hong Kong Broadband’s principal competitor is an older company, PCCW, which has several other lines of business, including phone, television and mobile. PCCW also offers gigabit service to the home and benefits from the same population density. But PCCW’s price is more than twice as much as Hong Kong Broadband’s. Despite its low prices, Hong Kong Broadband now operates in the black. Inexpensive pricing of gigabit broadband is practical in American cities, too. “This is an eminently replicable model,” says Benoit Felten, a co-founder of Diffraction Analysis, a consulting business based in Paris. “But not by someone who already owns a network — unless they’re willing to scrap the network.” In the United States, costs would come down if several companies shared the financial burden of putting fiber into the ground and then competed on the basis of services built on top of the shared assets. That would bring multiple competitors into the picture, pushing down prices. But it would also require regulatory changes that the Federal Communications Commission has yet to show an appetite for. Dane Jasper, the chief executive of Sonic.net, an Internet provider based in Santa Rosa, Calif., says that most broadband markets in the United States today are dominated by one phone company and one cable company. “Why doesn’t Verizon offer gigabit service?” Mr. Jasper asks. “Because it doesn’t have to.” In its earnings report for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Verizon said its fiber-based Internet service, which serves 12 states and the District of Columbia, was available to 12.8 million premises, an increase of 10 percent from the previous year. When I asked about its lack of gig service, C. Lincoln Hoewing, Verizon’s assistant vice president for Internet and technology issues, said, “We already offer 150 megabits,” referring to a tier of fiber-based service that is marketed for $195 a month to small businesses in many of its markets. It “seems to be satisfying demand,” he said. In a follow-up e-mail, a Verizon spokeswoman addressed the company’s lack of a gig service by saying that it offers “speeds that exceed what customers can and do use.” As long as a gig is expensive, a lack of customer interest shouldn’t be surprising. In October, EPB, the municipal electric utility in Chattanooga, Tenn., introduced a gig option in its fiber-to-the-home Internet services. A spokeswoman said the option, which costs $349.99 a month, currently has only about 20 customers. It is true that residential customers would now be hard-pressed to fully use anything close to a gig. Compressed, broadcast-quality HD video, for example, uses bandwidth in a range of 5 to 20 megabits a second, depending on the compression used. But it is possible to imagine situations — a doctor’s office consultation, say, involving specialists scattered around the country, poring over the patient and her cerebral angiogram simultaneously — where multiple, two-way video feeds could chew up a lot of bandwidth. All parties would need the ultrafast connections. But that level of capacity seems distant because each party needed to make it happen — customers, software developers and Internet providers — is waiting for the others to show up first. GOOGLE doesn’t want to wait. It and Sonic.net are preparing an experimental deployment of gigabit service to 850 faculty and staff homes in a Stanford University subdivision. Separately, Google plans to select one or several cities where it will offer gigabit service at what it calls “a competitive price” to at least 50,000, and potentially 500,000, people. In a post on the company blog titled “Think Big With a Gig,” it says, “We want to see what developers and users can do with ultra-high speeds, whether it’s creating new bandwidth-intensive ‘killer apps’ and services, or other uses we can’t yet imagine.” Mr. Jasper of Sonic.net says the history of computing shows us that “no matter how much storage we have or how fast the computing processing speed or network connection speed, applications arise to utilize them.” While companies like Verizon don’t seem to be in a rush, that little Hong Kong business is saying: A gig? Sure. Join this grand experiment early. At $26 a month, it’s a low-cost ticket to the future.

E-mail: stross@nytimes.com This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: March 13, 2011 The Digital Domain column last Sunday, about ultrafast broadband, referred incorrectly to two aspects of broadcast-quality, high-definition video delivered to the home. That video is compressed, not uncompressed, and the bandwidth it needs is generally in a range of 5 to 20 gigabits a second, depending on the compression used; it is not specifically 23 megabits a second.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/verzion-demonstrates-voice-over-lte-service/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Demonstrates Voice-Over-LTE Service<date>February 14, 2011, 9:42 am</date><text>BARCELONA, Spain — One important weapon in AT&amp;T’s arsenal against Verizon in the iPhone arms race is that Verizon’s wireless network does not allow smartphone owners to make voice calls and surf the Web at the same time. That limitation is because of the technical constraints of Verizon’s third-generation wireless network, which uses a technology known as CDMA. But with the next version of its wireless network, using LTE, users will be able to talk and surf simultaneously. And on Monday at the Mobile World Congress, a week-long phone industry event here, Verizon demonstrated how it will work. In addition to allowing people to make calls and use applications at the same time, Verizon says the service, called voice over LTE, or VoLTE, also features better sound quality than traditional landline and cellphone calls. Verizon plans to show off the new technology using the LG Revolution, a smartphone announced earlier this year during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It will be the company’s first smartphone with VoLTE capablity when it goes on sale later this year, although the actual service will not be available until 2012. “Adding VoLTE capabilities represents one of the most significant transformations our network will undergo since it was built,” said Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless. Verizon isn’t abandoning its current CDMA technology anytime soon. A widespread rollout of the new technology is at least another year away. It’s also not clear how much the new voice service would cost. But Verizon’s announcement is yet another strong push away from traditional phone service and an increased focus on the mobile side of the telecommunications industry. When voice becomes yet another data application, like e-mail or surfing the Web, carriers can move toward a data-centric revenue model, where customers may not be billed for voice minutes and data, but simply for the amount of data they consume.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/opening-day-verizon-iphone-4/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Opening Day: Verizon iPhone 4<date>February 10, 2011, 8:13 am</date><text>Mike Segar/Reuters Customers waited outside a Verizon store in New York to buy the iPhone 4 on Thursday. 12:03 p.m. | Updated Adding accounts from Twitter and eyewitness reports from Bits commenters. Despite icy temperatures in New York on Thursday morning, people eager to buy an iPhone that is compatible with Verizon’s wireless network filed into Apple and Verizon stores. Thursday is the first day that the iPhone is widely available for sale from a wireless carrier other than AT&amp;T in the United States. Verizon and Apple started selling the Verizon version of the iPhone in their stores around the country at 7 a.m., as well as in their online stores. Best Buy and several hundred Wal-Mart stores also planned to have the phone. Photos on Twitter showed modest lines at some stores; here is a roundup. Damon Darlin, The Times’s technology editor, reports that in downtown San Francisco, nearly two dozen anxious iPhone customers were queued up outside of a Verizon store as early as 6:45 a.m. Only two people were sitting outside the city’s flagship Apple store half a block away. At that location, the camera crews outnumbered iPhone buyers. Many people have noted, both on Twitter and in our comments section, that many Apple and Verizon stores seemed to have prepared for a much larger crush of customers than they received. On Twitter, Julio Ojeda-Zapata posted a picture of an empty Apple store in Minneapolis, with the caption, “What if Apple threw a party and no one came?” He added: “At Mall of America NO ONE is lined up at Apple store for Verizon iPhone.” A Bits commenter, “Romy,” relayed an account of purchasing an iPhone in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan “The store was filled with many extra employees who had apparently been ordered to applaud customers as they entered,” he or she wrote. “We were the only ones there.” It could be that some are simply choosing to order online, or perhaps many are waiting to see whether or not a new iPhone will be announced this summer. Either way, the muted enthusiasm is in sharp contrast to the initial introduction of the iPhone 4 on AT&amp;T’s network in June, when stores were selling out and hundreds of people waited in lines at Apple stores across the country. At least one area of the country is expecting unusually high interest in the phone. North and South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, which are not serviced by AT&amp;T, will now be able to purchase an iPhone from Verizon. If you pursued a Verizon iPhone 4 this morning, what was your experience like? Let us know in the comments.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/us/10iphone.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Dead Zone for iPhones No More<date>Published: February 9, 2011</date><text>Four years and a few upgrades ago, the first iPhones were sold in the United States.Well, not all the states. The people of North and South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming — as if they needed a reminder that they live off the beaten path — had to watch the rest of the nation fawn over their must-have gadgets. Those states are not served by AT&amp;T, which was the exclusive carrier, making the sparsely populated region essentially one big iPhone dead zone. But on Thursday, Verizon Wireless starts selling the iPhone in the region. And despite some lingering resentment about being left behind, stores have stocked up on hand warmers and hot drinks for the crowds expected to line up for their chance to buy into the hype. “I remember vividly the first time I saw one at an airport,” said Greg LaFollette, 64, an accountant and technology consultant from Sioux Falls, S.D., who plans to buy the phone. “My heart was bleeding because I knew I wouldn’t be able to get one.” In an era of instant access to seemingly everything — thanks in no small part to the proliferation of smart phones — it has been hard for many to believe that entire states could be walled off for years from such a mainstream product. “Why do I live in South Dakota?” was the hopeless response in an online forum from a would-be customer after being advised of the geographical restrictions of the AT&amp;T iPhone. AT&amp;T, which is expanding its network to include the upper Midwest after buying a smaller carrier, did not respond to a message seeking comment. Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, dished some mild corporate trash talk. “We value our customers regardless of where they live,” she said. “We think North Dakota is just as important as New York.” Tony Clark, chairman of the North Dakota Public Service Commission, said he expected sales of the iPhone to be significant, but not as high as they would have been a few years back. “While it’s a pretty big deal, the emergence of Android phones has mitigated some of that demand because they do a lot of the same things,” he said. Remarkably, for a place with no iPhones, there are already a large number of Dakotas-related iPhone apps, including maps of major cities, local weather, public records and local noxious weeds of the region. The Bismarck Tribune is one of several local newspapers with an app. “Downloads have been pretty slow up until now,” Terry Alveshere, the paper’s online manager, said in an e-mail. That is because few people went as far as Joel Broveleit, 37, of Sioux Falls, who drove to Nebraska and lied about his address to get an iPhone. “So I’ve had one probably longer than anyone in South Dakota,” he said. He also discovered the downside of being the first on the block with the new toy: everyone wanted to play with it (he eventually disguised it in a special case to avoid attention). But now, at least, the griping can end. David Miller, 20, who is studying computer network security at Dakota State University in Madison, S.D., said he had heard the occasional person threatening to move to a place where iPhones were not such foreign objects. But, he added, “I don’t think anyone I knew followed through.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/just-got-an-iphone-here-are-the-best-apps/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Just Got a Verizon iPhone?

For those new to the iPhone ecosystem, you may want to check out our many guides to the various apps available for your new smartphone. We have dueling iPhone app choices from technology columnist David Pogue and App Smart columnist Bob Tedeschi’s favorite apps, picks from former tech reporter and longtime Apple watcher John Markoff and selections from media columnist David Carr. Check back often, as our Apps Index is continually updated with apps coverage from all corners of nytimes.com. For example, Mr. Tedeschi likes: SOUNDHOUND (FREE AND $5) You’ve probably heard of Shazam, the app that identifies songs. SoundHound is faster, and it offers a broader range of ancillary features. You can hum a tune into the phone and it’ll find the song, look up lyrics and run YouTube videos of song performances. The $5 version lets you identify an unlimited number of songs. Users of the free version get five tags monthly. HIPSTAMATIC ($2) Scores of photography titles are in the App Store. Many are terrific, but not one matches Hipstamatic’s blend of simplicity, serendipity and art. At heart, the app is a filter that will unpredictably saturate, blur or discolor your images, among other things. The results are always surprising and often stunning. Add packs of lenses and film effects for $1 apiece. EVERNOTE (FREE) The company advertises this as a personal digital assistant, and it’s an apt description. Evernote is a traveling notepad that synchronizes with desktop and browser software (also free). Use your iPhone to copy an image, take a photo, record a voice memo or jot down a note, and it appears on your computer (and vice versa). It also recognizes your written text, within limits. The free version stores a fair amount of information, but for $45 a year, you needn’t sweat the data limits. ANGRY BIRDS ($1) A runaway favorite among the iPhone crowd, the app tests your ability to break down the barricades that protect green pigs. The weapon: flightless birds, launched by catapult. No wonder they’re angry. The game is easy to learn, yet challenging to play, with witty touches throughout. You can try a limited free version, but if you do, good luck resisting the paid version, with more than 800 possible scenes.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/technology/10phone.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon iPhone Sales Raise Questions About AT&amp;T<date>Published: February 9, 2011</date><text>The race between AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless kicks into hyperdrive on Thursday as Verizon begins selling the iPhone 4 to new customers, ending AT&amp;T’s exclusive hold on the phone in the United States. AT&amp;T has benefited tremendously from its partnership with Apple, lifting its subscriber numbers and buoying its wireless revenue. But many in the wireless industry wonder how AT&amp;T will fare now that customers have a choice of carriers for the phone. “There aren’t many handsets that can change the landscape of the wireless industry and the value of a hundred-billion-dollar communications company,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company who follows the industry. “But this is one of those incredibly rare times where the exception proves the rule.” Reviews of the Verizon iPhone have generally found that it drops fewer calls than the AT&amp;T version. And early demand has been strong. Last Thursday, in less than a day, the company sold all of the iPhone4s it had set aside for current customers. Verizon said the sales surpassed all of its previous smartphone debuts, including prominent releases like the Motorola Droid and Droid X. Although Verizon declined to share specific numbers, Phil Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, estimated that the company had sold as many as 500,000 iPhones. Analysts say Verizon could sell as many as nine million iPhones this year, although most of those could go to existing customers. A recent report from the Yankee Group, a research firm, estimated that 1.9 million AT&amp;T iPhone owners could switch to Verizon this year. That is just 2 percent of AT&amp;T’s wireless subscriber base of about 93 million people. Where the battle for customers will truly roar, analysts say, is in the last untapped frontier: cellphone users who are looking to trade in their creaky feature phones for more expensive smartphones and the costly data plans that support them. By the end of the year, one in two Americans will own a smartphone, compared with just one in 10 during the summer of 2008, according to a recent report from the research firm Nielsen. That means that for the first time in the United States, there will be more smartphones than feature phones in use. At stake for the wireless carriers is no small amount of revenue. Each iPhone owner pays an average of more than $90 a month to AT&amp;T, according to Mr. Moffett’s estimates, while other subscribers bring in closer to $50 a month. In 2010 alone, AT&amp;T activated 15.2 million iPhones on its network, of which 3.9 million went to new subscribers, accounting for the bulk of the company’s growth in subscribers with contracts, Mr. Moffett estimated. To get a sense for the escalating tension between the two carriers, one need look no further than their recent television commercials. During the Super Bowl, Verizon released a commercial for the iPhone that played up its much-lauded network strength. It seemed to take a swipe at AT&amp;T’s overloaded network, ending with the line, “Yes, I can hear you now.” To bite back, AT&amp;T has been promoting advantages like its international coverage. Phones that run on AT&amp;T’s network are compatible with networks in more foreign countries than Verizon phones. And Verizon’s technology does not allow use of its data network during phone calls. In one AT&amp;T commercial, a man scrambles to find a restaurant on the Web when his wife calls to remind him of their plans for an anniversary dinner. A voiceover says: “Only AT&amp;T’s network lets your iPhone talk and surf at the same time.” The fierce competition underscores the growing importance of retaining and attracting new smartphone customers as the telecommunications industry shifts away from traditional phone lines and focuses more heavily on mobile. During AT&amp;T’s most recent earnings announcement, it revealed that its revenue from the company’s mobile division had outpaced revenue from its wire line business for the first time. Now it would seem as if Verizon and AT&amp;T are planning to deploy every weapon in their arsenals to try to capture as many of those new subscribers as they can. Verizon is offering a number of incentives to sweeten the deal for new customers, including offering an unlimited data plan for $30 a month — in sharp contrast to AT&amp;T, which offers two gigabytes of data a month for $25. In response, AT&amp;T has taken steps to punch up its own data offerings. It recently began allowing some of its smartphone customers to use their data connection to supply Internet access to other mobile devices, using a special hot spot application that costs $20 a month. AT&amp;T also doubled the data cap for those who sign up for that feature to four gigabytes a month, at no additional cost. “AT&amp;T is not going to just roll over,” said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. “They will entice customers through other pricing offers.” Verizon also has a buyback program that will let AT&amp;T iPhone owners offset some of the penalties they will pay for early termination of their contracts. The money is put on a gift card that can be used toward the purchase of a Verizon phone. Despite the heightened competition, AT&amp;T says it is unconcerned. “We’ve been planning for life after exclusivity since we signed the first contract,” said David Christopher, the chief marketing officer for mobility and consumer business at AT&amp;T. “That playbook still includes selling tons of iPhones. They are an incredibly important part of our go-forward plan.” Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, shrugged off its rival’s jabs at the technical quirks that impose some limits on its version of the iPhone. “We’re very comfortable with our network technology,” she said. “The ability to simultaneously use voice and data might matter to some people, but the majority of customers would prefer to be able to make a phone call.” Verizon’s marketing and advertising strategy, she said, would continue to focus on what the company views as its main advantage: call quality. “The same technology our competitor is touting as their strength is the same technology that is causing people to drop calls,” she added.

This model, from Case-Mate, works with both models. Those counting down the moments until they get their Verizon iPhone 4 may be savoring the anticipation by picking out accessories — much the way people buy baby outfits in advance of a birth. But be aware that before you grab that whimsical iPhone case featuring Paul Frank’s monkey character Julius, the covers aren’t always one size fits all. Because the antennas in the Verizon iPhones are different than those in the AT&amp;T model, Verizon phones have control buttons in a slightly different place than the prior AT&amp;T phone. That means you have to make sure you are getting a Verizon-specific cover if you want access to all of your phone’s controls. Apple said it will produce an agnostic bumper that fits both, and some manufacturers say that the access slots in their existing cases will accommodate either model of iPhone. Here are some companies that say their products were either specifically built for, or will fit the Verzion iPhone. If you are a fan of film covers, Wrapsol has a cover ready for $30. If you want a battery case ExoGear makes a very trim cover for $90. A kickstand case called the iChair is $34. Casemate has a selection of 20 cases (three more are on the way) in various materials, colors and patterns ranging from $20 for plain film to $100 for a battery case. If you can’t find a case you like, give it a week, options increase every day.

Verizon said demand for the iPhone 4 surpassed all of its previous smartphone debuts, including high-profile phone releases like the Motorola Droid and Droid X. “In just our first two hours, we had already sold more phones than any first day launch in our history,” said Dan Mead, the president and chief executive of Verizon Wireless, in a statement. “When you consider these initial orders were placed between the hours of 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., it is an incredible success story.” The company did not offer specific sales figures, but Mr. Mead said the speedy sell-out sets “the pace for next week when we open up sales to everyone.” Some customers are already reporting that they have received notifications from Verizon that their iPhone orders have been processed and will be shipping soon. Apple and Verizon’s online shops show that the version of the iPhone 4 tailored to run on Verizon’s network is no longer available for order. Both Web sites urge customers who want to buy a Verizon iPhone to return at 3 a.m. on Feb. 9 to place an order. Apple and Verizon will also sell the iPhone in their retail locations, as well as at Best Buy and some Wal-Mart stores. The Verizon iPhone has received largely positive reviews from multiple technology and gadget reviewers. David Pogue of The New York Times said “the Verizon iPhone is nearly the same as AT&amp;T’s iPhone 4 — but it doesn’t drop calls,” a problem that has long frustrated many AT&amp;T customers. In addition, on Thursday Verizon released a new 30-second commercial that played up the company’s much-touted network strength. The commercial seems to take a swipe at AT&amp;T’s beleaguered network, ending with a voiceover that says, “Yes, I can hear you now.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/technology/personaltech/03pogue.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon’s iPhone Doesn’t Drop Calls<date>Published: February 2, 2011</date><text>It’s here. After almost four years of speculation, the iPhone will finally come to Verizon’s network on Feb. 10.And to answer everyone’s question, the Verizon iPhone is nearly the same as AT&amp;T’s iPhone 4 — but it doesn’t drop calls. For several million Americans, that makes it the holy grail. I took the Verizon iPhone to five cities, including the two Bermuda Triangles of AT&amp;T reception: San Francisco and New York. Holding AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhones side by side in the passenger seat of a car, I dialed 777-FILM simultaneously, and then rode around until a call dropped. (Why that number? Because I wanted to call a landline, eliminating the other person’s cell reception from the equation. Also, Mr. Moviefone can carry the entire conversation by himself, so I could concentrate on the testing.) In San Francisco, the AT&amp;T phone dropped the call four times in 30 minutes of driving; the Verizon phone never did. The Verizon iPhone also held its line in several Manhattan intersections where the AT&amp;T call died. At a Kennedy airport gate, the AT&amp;T phone couldn’t even find a signal; the Verizon dialed with a smug yawn. Most impressively, the Verizon iPhone effortlessly made calls in the Cellphone Signal Torture Chamber of Doom: my house. The Verizon iPhone did drop one call — in baggage claim at the Los Angeles airport. And, of course, there are regions where AT&amp;T coverage is better than Verizon’s. But in general, my testing matches the conclusions of Consumer Reports and RootMetrics.com: the Verizon iPhone has more bars in more places. (Hey, that might make a good slogan! Oh, wait...) In general, the Verizon and AT&amp;T iPhones are identical. Same sleek, thin, satisfying, plastic-free body — all glass and metal. Same gorgeous, high-resolution screen — 960 by 640 pixels. Same battery life — you’ll need a recharge every night. Same camera on the back, which can take 5-megapixel stills or excellent hi-def video — the flash doubles as a video light. Same low-resolution camera on the front, suitable for Wi-Fi videochats, using Apple’s FaceTime software for iPhone or Mac. Even the prices are about the same. The 16-gigabyte phone costs $200 with two-year contract. The monthly service costs, for example, $70 for unlimited voice calls, plus $20 for 5,000 text messages, plus $30 a month for unlimited Internet use. (Verizon says that it will soon eliminate that unlimited plan, just as AT&amp;T recently did. Instead, you’ll pay something like $25 a month for 2 gigabytes of Internet data. Good luck figuring out how much that is.) The single new feature in Verizon’s iPhone is Personal Hotspot, where the iPhone becomes a Wi-Fi base station. Up to five laptops, iPod Touches or other gadgets can get online, using the phone as a glorified Internet antenna. That’s incredibly convenient. Many other app phones have it — AT&amp;T says its iPhone will get it soon — but Apple’s execution is especially nice. For example, the hot spot shuts itself off 90 seconds after the last laptop disconnects. That’s hugely important, because these personal hot spot features are merciless battery drains. The hot spot feature costs $20 a month extra, and buys only 2 gigabytes of data for all of those laptops. Think e-mail, not YouTube. (AT&amp;T will charge $45 a month for 4 gigabytes of data.) Now, there are two kinds of cellphone networks in this country. They’re known as C.D.M.A. (Verizon and Sprint use this technology) and G.S.M. (the system for AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). Making an iPhone that works on a C.D.M.A. network entailed four adjustments, some of which you won’t like. First, Apple moved the volume and Ringer Off switches a fraction of an inch to accommodate the C.D.M.A. antenna inside. It’s not a big deal, but those buttons no longer fit existing AT&amp;T iPhone cases. (Contrary to blogger belief, the redesign doesn’t help with the famous Death Grip issue, in which holding the phone in a certain way makes your signal bars drop. Then again, the problem emerges only when you’re in a very weak signal area, so you’ll see it less often on Verizon. I couldn’t reproduce it at all.) A second C.D.M.A. difference: When you exchange long text messages with non-Verizon phones, they get split up into 160-character chunks. G.S.M. phones are smart enough to reconstitute those chunks into one more readable, consolidated message. Third: You can’t talk on an C.D.M.A. phone while you’re online. That is, if you’re on a call, you can’t simultaneously check a Web site or send e-mail over the cellular network — and, annoyingly, the Personal Hotspot feature cuts off. (It reconnects when you hang up.) If the top of your screen says “3G,” an indication that you’re in a high-speed Internet area of Verizon’s network, incoming calls take priority and interrupt your online connection. If you’re online in an older, 2G area, you stay online and the call goes directly to voice mail. It’s not such a big deal. Continuing processes like downloads, Personal Hotspot and GPS navigation resume automatically when you end your call. You can still send text and get messages when you’re on a call. And none of this applies when you’re in a Wi-Fi hot spot; in that case, you can call and surf simultaneously, no problem. For business travelers, the fourth C.D.M.A. difference is the most disappointing: not many other countries use C.D.M.A. The Verizon iPhone works in about 40 countries, including Mexico, Canada and China; AT&amp;T phones, on the other hand, work in 220 countries. (In both cases, you pay through the nose if you use them overseas.) Still interested? Here are a few final points to ponder before you plunge. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com</text></article><article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/verizon-customers-report-glitches-with-iphone-orders/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Customers Report Glitches With iPhone Orders<date>February 3, 2011, 11:00 am</date><text>3:23 p.m. | Updated Included details from a colleague on their experiences ordering an iPhone from Verizon. When Verizon announced it would begin selling a version of the iPhone for its network, its executives seemed confident that they could sidestep the difficulties that AT&amp;T has had in dealing with the popularity of the device. But beginning early Thursday morning, reports surfaced on Twitter and on technology blogs that some Verizon customers, who were given early access to preorder the iPhone, were experiencing various hiccups and difficulties in placing their orders online. A Verizon spokeswoman, Brenda Raney, said the Verizon site did not crash, but acknowledged that some customers were seeing glitches. “We’ve been processing orders all morning with no problem,” Ms. Raney said. “Some people are experiencing some error messages, but based on personal circumstances. When we have issues, we’re working with those customers directly.” On Thursday afternoon, a New York Times colleague said she had no difficulties logging onto the Verizon site and ordering two iPhone 4s for her family. Glitches in processing orders are not uncommon on the first day of sales for any hot new device. AT&amp;T experienced similar difficulties when it began taking orders for the iPhone 4. Demand for the Verizon iPhone is expected to be high: Executives at Verizon say they think as many as 11 million devices could be sold within the first year. GizmoCrunch, a technology blog, has suggested several potential workarounds, such as switching Web browsers. It appears that people are having fewer problems ordering the phone through Apple’s site. Readers, share your experiences in the comments. Have you been able to order a Verizon iPhone online?</text></article><article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/att-sweetens-data-plans-before-verizon-iphone/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">AT&amp;T Sweetens Data Plans Before Verizon iPhone<date>February 2, 2011, 4:59 pm</date><text>After Verizon announced it would begin selling the iPhone on its network, the company introduced several data plan offerings to help strengthen its position against AT&amp;T, the exclusive carrier of the iPhone in the United States for the last several years. In particular, Verizon offered an unlimited data plan for $30 a month — a sharp contrast to AT&amp;T, which currently provides a 2-gigabytes of data a month plan for $25 a month. Verizon also said its phone would allow customers to supply Wi-Fi to as many as five different devices using the iPhone’s 3G data connection. AT&amp;T only allows its customers to tether a single device. Verizon’s C.D.M.A-network iPhone But just as Verizon is set to start taking iPhone orders from existing customers beginning at 3 a.m. Thursday, AT&amp;T is upping its ante. On Wednesday, AT&amp;T announced it would being allowing some of its smartphone customers to use their phone’s data connections to supply an Internet connection to other mobile devices with a special mobile hotspot application. The company did not clarify whether this offer would extend to iPhone owners but did note in a press release that the application coincides with the release of the HTC Inspire 4G on Feb. 13. AT&amp;T also said it would double the data cap for smartphone customers who sign up for the tethering feature to 4-gigabytes per month, at no additional monthly cost. The news is yet another move by AT&amp;T to sharpen its offerings in preparation for the release of Verizon’s  iPhone. AT&amp;T has also been reminding customers of other features unique to its network, including its extensive international coverage and ability to place calls while using data services such as surfing the Web, something that Verizon’s C.D.M.A. technology is not yet able to do. It remains to be seen whether either network’s  data plans will persuade people to switch, but it won’t be long before we find out: Verizon begins widely accepting orders for the iPhone in one week, on Feb. 10.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/technology/28phone.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">AT&amp;T Shifts Focus to Android Phones<date>Published: January 27, 2011</date><text>The chief executive of AT&amp;T on Thursday said the company would begin “very aggressively” marketing smartphones based on Google’s Android software now that AT&amp;T would no longer be the exclusive carrier for the iPhone in the United States.So far, Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T’s chief competitor, has been the biggest supporter of Android. But it will start selling the iPhone on Feb. 10, and is likely to shift resources away from Android. Motorola on Wednesday said it was already seeing a drop-off in sales of its Android phones in Verizon stores because customers were waiting for the iPhone. In effect, AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T’s chief competitor, are set to swap strategies in the high-stakes smartphone market, with AT&amp;T turning to Android and Verizon to the iPhone. “We’re going to be a heavy participant in the Android market this year, so you’re going to see a significant shift in mix” of the phones, AT&amp;T’s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, told analysts on a conference call. Motorola Mobility Holdings, Samsung Electronics and HTC are all major makers of Android phones. AT&amp;T also provided an earnings forecast for the year that disappointed analysts. It said it had signed up just 400,000 new customers on contract-based wireless plans in the last three months of last year. It was AT&amp;T’s lowest quarterly number in at least five years. Shares of AT&amp;T, which are part of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 60 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $28.13. The low number of new contracts demonstrated that even though AT&amp;T had activated 4.1 million iPhones, the phone has lost much of its power to attract customers from other carriers. Since it was introduced in 2007, the iPhone has been driving millions of high-paying subscribers to AT&amp;T, and it now earns more per subscriber than any other carrier. If its per-subscriber revenue were in line with Verizon’s, AT&amp;T would pull in $7.7 billion less every year. Subscribers signing two-year contracts are the most lucrative for wireless carriers and are an important measure of their performance. Verizon Wireless on Tuesday reported adding more than twice as many subscribers under contract. However, the difference is exaggerated by the fact that Verizon sells tablets with contracts, while AT&amp;T does not. In the fourth quarter, AT&amp;T added large numbers of other subscribers. It added a record 1.5 million “connected devices,” a category that includes nonphone devices like Kindle e-book readers and Internet-enabled GPS units. AT&amp;T is taking a lead in this area, but it earns much less for each device than it does for each phone. All told, AT&amp;T added a record 2.8 million wireless subscribers, to reach 95.5 million. Verizon has 102.2 million subscribers, including “connected devices.” AT&amp;T posted net income of $1.1 billion, or 18 cents a share, for the October to December period. That was down 60 percent from $2.8 billion, or 46 cents a share, in the same period of 2009. Excluding items, chiefly related to the performance of its pension and health care plans for retirees, earnings were 55 cents a share, a penny above the average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet. Revenue was $31.4 billion, up 2.1 percent from a year ago. It was slightly short of analyst expectations at $31.5 billion. For 2011, AT&amp;T said it expected earnings to grow in by a “mid-single digit” percentage or more from 2010 adjusted earnings of $2.22 a share. That points to earnings of at least $2.33 a share. Analysts had been expecting $2.48 a share.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/verizon-to-buy-terremark-for-1-4-billion/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon to Buy Terremark for $1.4 Billion<date>January 27, 2011, 6:23 pm</date><text>Peter Morgan/Associated Press Verizon Communications on Thursday announced it would buy I.T. services provider Terremark Worldwide for $19 a share, in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. The offer represents a 35 percent premium to Terremark’s closing price on Thursday. The board of Terremark unanimously approved the deal. The deal for Verizon is a play on the rapid growth in remote, or cloud computing, an area where the company has been lagging behind competitors like AT&amp;T. Terremark, provides data storage services for big companies and government agencies. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Press release “For Verizon, $1.4 billion is a drop in the bucket and it provides a lot of strategic value,” said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen And Company. Verizon knows Terremark’s work firsthand. Last year, Verizon signed a deal for 25,000 square feet in Terremark’s data centers. The company also started selling Terremark’s hosting services. “Cloud computing continues to fundamentally alter the way enterprises procure, deploy and manage IT resources, and this combination helps create a tipping point for ‘everything-as-a-service,’” Lowell McAdam, president and chief operating officer of Verizon, said in a statement. “Our collective vision will foster innovation, enhance business processes and dynamically deliver business intelligence and collaboration services to anyone, anywhere and on any device.” Revenue at Terremark increased 22 percent to $84.9 million in the latest quarter — although the company posted a loss of 12 cents a share. Cloud computing has been a hot area for deal-making. In recent months several technology giants, including Hewlett-Packard, EMC, Dell and I.B.M., have bought a slew of data storage companies. In mid-December, Dell announced plans to buy Compellent Technologies, an acquisition that valued the company at nearly $1 billion. After Terremark, Mr. Synesael figures more deals could follow. Among the potential targets: Savvis, Rackspace Hosting, Internap Network Service and NaviSite. Verizon was represented by Goldman Sachs and Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in the deal, while Terremark worked with Credit Suisse Securities and Greenberg Traurig.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/technology/26verizon.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Reports a 2.6% Decline in Quarterly Revenue<date>Published: January 25, 2011</date><text>Verizon Communications reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that fell slightly below Wall Street’s expectations, as it continued to shift its focus to its wireless business, which had strong subscriber growth, from landlines.The company’s net income was $2.64 billion, or 93 cents a share, compared with $617 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier. The increase was largely a result of adjustments to the value of the company’s retirement and pension plans. Without them, earnings would have been 54 cents a share, a penny less than the average of analysts’ forecast. Revenue fell 2.6 percent to $26.4 billion, from $27.1 billion a year earlier, largely because of declining income from voice services. Verizon has lagged behind its peers in moving toward mobile devices and their lucrative wireless data services, said Harry Wang, director of mobile research at Parks Associates, a research organization. But he said it appeared to have picked up the pace in the fourth quarter. “Verizon has been adjusting its business and offerings over the last few years to respond to the changing market,” Mr. Wang said. “That dynamic is captured more so in these results than ever before.” Verizon Wireless, a venture with Vodafone of Britain, reported a sharp rise in subscribers, adding 872,000 contract customers in the quarter. Although that is fewer new subscribers than were added in fourth quarter of the previous year, analysts had not expected so many. Almost 75 percent of the company’s new subscribers bought smartphones, primarily because of its strong portfolio of sleek new phones powered by Android, Google’s operating system. Smartphone users account for roughly a quarter of Verizon Wireless’s contract subscriber base. That is a smaller share than for its rivals, AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile, which each hover closer to 40 percent, Mr. Wang said. In a presentation to analysts and investors, Lowell McAdam, chief operating officer of Verizon, said the company expected half of its mobile customers to own a smartphone by year’s end. “It may be even higher,” he said. “We’re excited to kick-start another vibrant cycle in this growth area.” Mr. McAdam said Verizon would focus on promoting its fourth-generation wireless network, which uses a technology known as LTE, and would heavily market several mobile devices that can run on it. “We’re going to get that penetration up, which will get profitability up,” Mr. McAdam said. Verizon executives said the appetite for LTE-compatible devices had already increased since it started introducing the network late last year. More than 65,000 LTE laptop modems were sold in their first month on the market, he said. The early response to tablet computers and their accompanying data plans was positive, with more than 86,000 iPads and Samsung Galaxy Tabs sold in the quarter, he said. During the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month, Verizon showed off a dozen smartphones and tablets capable of running on the new network. For the quarter, wireless revenue rose nearly 6 percent, to $16.1 billion, from a year earlier. Wireless data revenues, which increased by 25 percent, accounted for more than $5 billion of total wireless revenue, Verizon said. Mr. McAdam predicted that data consumption would increase more than 40 times by the end of the decade. Verizon’s stock rose 55 cents to $35.79 after the earnings announcement. The quarter may offer a preview of heightened interest in Verizon, which announced two weeks ago that it would soon begin offering a version of the iPhone running on its network. The company declined to offer a specific forecast for how the release of the iPhone might affect revenue and profitability. But it said it would begin offering several incentives, including trade-in options and unlimited data plans for the device, to entice current customers to upgrade and lure customers from rival carriers. It cautioned that it may drop unlimited data plans at some point. Verizon said it expected to sell as many as 11 million iPhones in the coming year, but would not bank entirely on a partnership with Apple to help buoy the company. “We worked very hard to get here so we would have a balanced approach,” said Ivan Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive of Verizon. “We’ve always said we won’t be one-business focused, and we certainly won’t be one-device focused.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DB133EF937A15752C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">BITS; Weighing Value Of iPhone Cachet<date>Published: January 24, 2011</date><text>Apple sold more than 16 million iPhones in the last quarter, according to its earnings report. Next month sales will surely continue to rise as Apple starts selling the iPhone on the Verizon network. But if Apple wants to fend off the iPhone's rivals, will it have to sell its signature mobile device on other networks as well? Some analysts say yes. The iPhone's fiercest competitor is Google's Android platform, in phones that are available on all the major United States carriers. Nearly half the active Android devices in the United States are operated on Sprint and T-Mobile. ''I think Apple is realizing that AT&amp;T exclusivity is not to their advantage at this point,'' said Harry Wang, director of mobile research at the research firm Parks Associates. ''Verizon will provide fertile ground to gain new iPhone customers, but if Apple feels Android is gaining on other networks then they may start to look at other subscribers to compete there too.'' But Charles Golvin, an analyst specializing in mobile technology for Forrester Research, doesn't believe Apple has to offer the iPhone on all the major carriers. He said in a phone interview that keeping the iPhone to a few select carriers could offer a competitive advantage through a ''feeling of exclusivity.'' ''When you look at other markets in the United Kingdom and Germany, where Apple does have relationships to distribute the iPhone on multiple networks, they usually have some sort of exclusivity and don't make it available everywhere,'' Mr. Golvin said. Katie Cotton, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether Apple planned to put the iPhone on Sprint or T-Mobile. But, she said, ''The Verizon deal is a multiyear, nonexclusive agreement.'' It would be technically feasible -- though it would require some work -- for Apple to supply an iPhone to, say, Sprint or MetroPCS, the county's fifth largest carrier, because their networks run on the same technology as Verizon's. Further adjustments would be needed to put the phone on T-Mobile. Michelle Mermelstein, public relations manager for Sprint's Wireless division, declined to comment about coming ''products and services that are in our lineup.'' Erica Gordon, a spokeswoman for T-Mobile, said, ''We would be interested in offering the iPhone, but ultimately it is Apple's decision.'' But Apple may not want to divert its attention to other carriers until the Verizon iPhone is available, and any problems have been worked out. ''I think there is enormous pent-up demand for an iPhone on Verizon, and I expect that Apple will focus this year on making that relationship a success,'' said Mark Donovan, a senior mobile analyst for comScore, which monitors mobile phone use. NICK BILTON</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/business/media/21fcc.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Sues F.C.C. over Order on Blocking Web Sites<date>Published: January 20, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Less than a month after the Federal Communications Commission adopted an order aimed at keeping Internet service providers from blocking access to certain Web content or applications, Verizon asked a federal appeals court on Thursday to overturn the new rule.Verizon is arguing that the F.C.C. exceeded its authority, and violated the company’s constitutional rights. Verizon filed its suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the same court that in April ruled that the F.C.C. had overstepped itself when it sanctioned Comcast in 2008 for blocking users of its broadband Internet service from BitTorrent, a file-sharing application. The challenge, which was widely expected to come from at least one of the big Internet service providers, sets up what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle over the rights of broadband companies to run their networks without government interference. “We are deeply concerned by the F.C.C.’s assertion of broad authority for sweeping new regulation of broadband networks and the Internet itself,” Michael E. Glover, a senior vice president and deputy general counsel for Verizon, said in a statement. “We believe this assertion of authority goes well beyond any authority provided by Congress, and creates uncertainty for the communications industry, innovators, investors and consumers,” Mr. Glover added. The F.C.C. declined to comment on the appeal. But a senior commission official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agency was confident its order was legally sound and said the commission would most likely challenge Verizon’s appeal on grounds that the lawsuit itself violated F.C.C. rules. Those require that once a new order is published in the Federal Register, which in this case has not yet occurred, any challenge filed within 10 days is entered into a lottery to determine the legal venue. Consumer groups attacked Verizon’s suit, saying it constituted venue-shopping because it relied on a legal theory that the F.C.C.’s order modified the company’s licenses for wireless phone spectrum. License modifications, as opposed to general F.C.C. rules, are required to be decided in the District of Columbia circuit. Verizon also asked the appeals court for the same panel of judges who decided the Comcast case. Aparna Sridhar, policy counsel for Free Press, a group that thought the F.C.C. order did not go far enough, said Verizon’s decision “demonstrates that even the most weak and watered-down rules aren’t enough to appease giant phone companies.”</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/weekinreview/16brustein.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Why Europe’s Cellphone System is Looser Than Ours<date>Published: January 15, 2011</date><text>Americans were liberated from AT&amp;T last week.The news that Apple was ending its exclusive relationship with AT&amp;T and would begin selling the iPhone 4 on Verizon’s network in the United States was not a surprise, but the excitement was palpable nonetheless. “Freedom!” bellowed Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show,” in a segment in which people described their relationship to AT&amp;T as that of slaves to their masters, subjects to their tyrants. Given the dissatisfaction with AT&amp;T, it is easy to look at other parts of the world and wonder why this didn’t happen sooner. After all, the iPhone is available on multiple carriers in many European markets. France even has a law that would have made AT&amp;T’s exclusive agreement with Apple illegal. Almost half of mobile phone customers in the largest European countries do not have contracts with wireless carriers, and can switch phones from one network to another with ease. The continent’s system is looser in part because Europe settled on a single technological standard for wireless carriers 20 years ago. Countries there wanted to ensure that their citizens’ phones would work as they traveled throughout the Continent. No such agreement was reached in the United States, which had recently deregulated its telephone industry, and carriers built their networks on separate technologies. “I’d call it the culture of competition,” said Alex Hills, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon, explaining why a single standard was not set in the United States. “There was interest in allowing the standards to compete with one another, and let the market decide who would win.” That’s not to say that American policymakers have been hands off; cellphone users have been gaining more freedom. In 2003, wireless customers were given the right to move their phone number from one network to another, for instance. And the federal government ruled in July that users could legally bypass Apple’s software restrictions for the iPhone, a process known as jailbreaking. This decision reduced Apple’s control, but its iPhones were still not able to connect to other 3G wireless networks. “In a European country, for a government to say you cannot have exclusive relationships with phone manufacturers, that’s a very simple thing,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. “However, in the U.S. it’s a more complex technical problem.” Such technical barriers, of course, are not insurmountable. When Apple decided to work with Verizon, it built a new version of the iPhone to work on the Verizon network. But the new device comes with some tradeoffs — for instance, the phone cannot handle a phone call at the same time it is being used to access the Internet. Phone manufacturers and wireless carriers both have incentives to restrict the choices available to consumers, through the sorts of agreements that Apple has had with AT&amp;T and now Verizon. For carriers, being able to sell desirable phones allows them to lure consumers to their networks, and they are willing to subsidize the cost of the phone significantly in exchange. This gives phone manufacturers a reliable way to distribute their phones, and brings the price of increasingly sophisticated devices down to a level that seems reasonable to the mainstream market. This tradeoff benefits consumers, as well. By agreeing to bind themselves to AT&amp;T for two years, iPhone owners paid for only about a third of their phones; AT&amp;T put up the rest. Europeans may be able to leave their carriers the minute they think another company can do better, but they pay significantly more upfront for that added choice. This doesn’t necessarily make them happier than the Americans raging against AT&amp;T. In November, ComScore, a marketing research firm, asked mobile phone users to rank how satisfied they were with their carriers, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most satisfied. Only 11 percent of Americans gave their carriers a five or below. By contrast, 16 percent of Europeans ranked their carriers with a five or lower. The only question, then, is why don’t they switch?</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/business/15nocera.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">With Verizon, iPhone’s Flaws May Become More Apparent<date>Published: January 14, 2011</date><text>With this week’s announcement that Verizon Wireless is going to begin selling the iPhone — something its customers have been panting for ever since AT&amp;T got that first, exclusive iPhone contract four years ago — it’s time for me to face the music. Nobody really cares that the iPhone is flawed. After this column, I’m going to stop caring too. I swear it.Its design is undeniably elegant; both the iPhone and its sister device, the iPad, stand at the pinnacle of modern industrial design. The iPhone offers some 300,000 apps that delight its users. Photographs look gorgeous on an iPhone. “It is the first and best implementation of a highly mobile computer,” said Roger L. Kay, the president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, a market intelligence firm. Yet for all that it offers, the iPhone has always been plagued by serious drawbacks. The “phone” part of the iPhone has never worked very well, dropping calls with annoying regularity. Even when the phone works, the sound quality is often substandard. You would think in an age when fewer people are using landlines this would matter. Apparently not. Meanwhile, the iPhone’s lack of a raised keyboard makes it next to impossible to do serious e-mailing. And users have to worry constantly about battery life; if they’re not judicious, the iPhone’s battery can be drained by noon. At the Verizon Wireless-iPhone extravaganza on Tuesday — in which the two companies announced that the iPhone 4 would run on Verizon Wireless’s 3G network — Apple’s chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, was asked why Apple wasn’t going with the carrier’s faster, newer 4G LTE network. Mr. Cook replied that doing so required “design compromises” that Apple was unwilling to make. They never make design compromises at Apple. They make consumer compromises. Yet consumers have always been willing to overlook those compromises so they can claim they own some of the coolest products on the planet. “People so love their devices from Apple that they are willing to put up with the stupidities,” said Larry Keeley, president of the innovation and design firm Doblin. “For many users,” he added, “especially the ones Apple loves the most, the fact that the battery gets balky is how you convince yourself to get a new one.” My oldest son, Amato, who is on my Verizon Wireless plan, told me recently that even though he was perfectly happy with his Android phone, if given the chance to switch to an iPhone, he would probably do it. “I can’t even say why,” he said. “I don’t even know if there is any real rationale behind that desire.” Is Steve Jobs a business genius or what?  On the other hand, the fact that my son owns an Android phone — and finds it to be a fine smartphone, thank you very much — suggests that the Apple chief executive’s fetish for form over function has its downside. Not everybody, it turns out, is indifferent to whether their smartphones can actually make phone calls. For proof, all you have to do is look at the recent performance of Verizon Wireless, which has been, by far, the country’s most profitable wireless carrier, despite not having the iPhone in its arsenal. Verizon Wireless could have snagged the original iPhone contract four years ago, but it passed. It did so not because of the iPhone’s flaws, which were then unknown, but because Apple was insisting on terms that it could not accept. These included a guaranteed subsidy for the phone (cellphone carriers use subsidies as important marketing tools), no say in the software design and loss of control of the customer to Apple. A Verizon Wireless spokesman told me back then that with the iPhone deal, AT&amp;T had handed over “the ability to insure customer service” to Apple, which, he added, “is something we would never have agreed to.” AT&amp;T, which was struggling, felt it had no choice but to agree to Apple’s onerous terms. The Apple-AT&amp;T marriage has been a public relations disaster — for AT&amp;T. Its network was quickly overwhelmed, in part because it was subpar, and in part because iPhone owners — with a mobile computer at their fingertips — used astonishing amounts of data: 15 times more than the average smartphone user, and “50 percent more than AT&amp;T itself had projected,” according to Fred Vogelstein, who wrote about the problems for Wired magazine. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/how-wireless-networks-fared-at-ces/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">How Wireless Networks Fared at CES<date>January 13, 2011, 6:36 pm</date><text>As my colleague Jenna Wortham’s article pointed out on Monday, the success of Verizon’s iPhone offering will depend largely on the Verizon network ability to deliver where AT&amp;T has sputtered, which is reliability. So just how do they stack up? RootMetrics, a firm that measures wireless network performance, kept tabs on network performance at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. CES is a torture test for any network, with 140,000 or so technophiles—most presumed to be high data users—adding to the Vegas wireless traffic. A cursory look at the results is favorable for Verizon. “Verizon had middling data speeds, but the reliability, the ability to actually get on the network, was spectacularly good,” said Paul Griff, chief executive of RootMetrics. “The really staggering statistic, on Thursday, the busiest day of the event, Verizon had a zero failure rate, and AT&amp;T had an 89 percent failure rate getting on.” That is just for data, but in my personal experience from the show, there was also a frequent inability to make a voice call on the AT&amp;T network. Of course AT&amp;T and Verizon aren’t the only two networks in Las Vegas. RootMetrics tested the four major carriers on 3G and 4G networks. RootMetrics conducted its tests from the first day of the show, Thursday, Jan. 6, through the last day, Sunday, Jan. 9. It tested 3G and 4G services using unaltered consumer smartphones running a program that continuously tests the network. The results are then sent to a server that compiles the results. The test found that overall, T-Mobile was the fastest 3G network. On Saturday and Sunday, when congestion was slackening, it was consistently two- to three-times faster than the other networks. Verizon came in second, AT&amp;T third, Sprint fourth. Verizon was the most reliable 3G network, with overall 2 percent dropped downloads, followed by T-mobile with 8 percent, Sprint with 16 percent and AT&amp;T with 19 percent. For uploads Sprint lead, with 2.8 percent failures to Verizon’s 3 percent, followed by T-Mobile with 6 percent and AT&amp;T with 11 percent. Two 4G networks were tested, T-Mobile’s HSPA+ network and Sprint’s WiMax network. Sprint was the winner both in speed and reliability. Sprint 4G failed on 2 percent of downloads and 1 percent of uploads. T-Mobile failed on 15 percent of downloads and 11 percent of uploads. It is worth noting that Sprint’s 4G offering is a completely different network (and charges a premium to use it). T-Mobile’s 4G is a part of it’s 3G network, there is no extra charge to use it, but you need a 4G phone. While the test is certainly a good representation of what people experienced when trying to phone during CES, there are a couple of factors that make it less than definitive. One is that it doesn’t take into account what special steps a network may have taken to bolster performance for the higher traffic. Although Mr. Griff said it’s a fair assumption that they were equally prepared. “I would expect they all made their best efforts. They knew this was coming,” said Mr. Griff. Another unknown is if the demand on one network was higher than another – in other words, would Verizon have performed as well if the same number of iPhones that were trying to get on AT&amp;T were trying to get on Verizon? But Mr. Griff said that the results from the show looked similar overall to the way the networks have behaved nationwide. The final caveat is that no matter what a network does nationally, the only thing that really matters is how a network performs where you are. You may be able to check your area using a RootMetrics map, which includes data from phones of people who have added the RootMetrics app. “I’ve said it so much it’s becoming a slogan,” said Mr. Griff. “There is no best network, there is a best network for you.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/first-the-bad-news/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">First, the Bad News<date>January 13, 2011, 2:21 pm</date><text>Two announcements this week. Two big bummers. Two good things gone. First, there’s the news about Virgin’s MiFi. It’s a slim, credit-card-size, personal Wi-Fi hot spot. Wherever you go, you can keep it in your pocket or purse and get online with your laptop, iPad, iPod Touch or whatever. The MiFi is available from various cellphone carriers, but Virgin’s plan was different. As I wrote in September: The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. Sign up | See Sample “Three things about the Virgin MiFi are very different. First, Virgin’s plan is unlimited. You don’t have to sweat through the month, hoping you don’t exceed the standard 5-gigabyte data limit, as you do with the cellular-modem products from Verizon, Sprint, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. “If you hadn’t noticed, unlimited-data plans are fast disappearing — but here’s Virgin, offering up an unlimited Internet plan as though it never got the memo. “Second, Virgin requires no contract. You can sign up for service only when you need it. In other words, it’s totally O.K. with Virgin if you leave the thing in your drawer all year, and activate it only for, say, the two summer months when you’ll be away. That’s a huge, huge deal in this era when every flavor of Internet service, portable or not, requires a two-year commitment. “Third, the service price for this no-commitment, unlimited, portable hot spot is — are you sitting down? — $40 a month.” Well, this week, Virgin apparently got the memo after all. No more unlimited data. Well, O.K., you still get unlimited data. But if you exceed 5 gigabytes of data transfer in a month, Virgin slows down your connection until the next month begins. The second big takeaway — and I mean that in the sense of loss — is that Verizon Wireless will end its “New every two” program on Jan. 16. That’s the program that lets you upgrade to a new phone, for the new-customer price, every two years. (The company says that instead, it will e-mail you “special offers” after 20 months of your contract.) Why would it end this popular, heavily advertised program NOW, after so many years? Hmmmm. It wouldn’t have anything to do with the fact that Verizon gets the iPhone two weeks later, would it? Well, that’s what the bloggers are saying. Verizon, however, says it’s not true. If you’ve had your current phone beyond its contract time (usually two years), you can get the iPhone at the $200 new-customer price. (The sticky part comes if you’re not done with your two years. Then you’ll pay a lot more.) Well, I suppose Verizon can do what it wants. It knows its network is what we all want. And we’ll put up with endless greed and shenanigans to get it. But before you bum out completely, here are two pieces of good news. First, Apple has redesigned the Verizon iPhone slightly, shifting around the antennas so the “death grip” problem (hold the phone a certain way, lose bars) no longer exists. The downside is that the Ringer Off switch is now slightly askew in existing iPhone cases, but you can’t have everything. Second, in the last 18 months, I’ve occasionally written about my adventures as host of a new PBS NOVA miniseries called “Making Stuff.” It’s a gorgeously filmed, hi-def, funny, enlightening trip through the wild new science of materials. I traveled the world to interview the most amazing scientists. I went hang gliding, landed on an aircraft carrier, rode in a demolition derby, swam with sharks, fired an AK-47, got an MRI, endured crawling spiders — anything to illustrate our scientific points. (You can see the trailer here.) I’m happy to announce that the series premieres this Wednesday, Jan. 19, at 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time. (It will also be on the Web, but it’s better on TV.) Speaking of which: To promote the series, PBS is sponsoring two contests. The first is called “What’s This Stuff?” Be the first to identify 10 mystery materials, and you win a MacBook Air and a videochat or — if you’re in New York City — a dinner with me. Ten runners-up get iPod Touches. The second contest is on Facebook. Submit your idea for a better material; the winner gets an iPad stocked with apps that I’ve chosen myself. O.K., enough promotion. Tune in Wednesday. I think you’ll learn something!</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/business/12views.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Adding Up Parts at Goldman Sachs - Breaking Views<date>Published: January 11, 2011</date><text>Public opprobrium played a hand in Goldman Sachs’s decision to disclose more about its trading and investments for its own account, the first fruits of which emerged in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. But the Wall Street firm’s reorganization of how it reports earnings also serves its own purposes. It makes valuing the firm a bit easier by enabling a better sum-of-the-parts analysis than was previously possible.Let’s start with institutional client services, the segment that houses all Goldman’s trading and market-making for clients and accounts for about 60 percent of the firm’s revenue. Being newly scrubbed of any outright proprietary or prop trading means it’s reasonable to compare this with a firm like Knight Capital. Sure, Goldman’s business is larger, but it also probably takes more risk. On Knight’s valuation multiple of around 11.5 times estimated 2010 earnings Goldman’s unit is worth an eye-popping $59 billion. Now for investment management. The division is worth about $9.5 billion if ascribed BlackRock’s price-to-estimated earnings ratio of just under 19 times. Goldman’s investment bank group, meanwhile, is arguably comparable to the financial sector specialist Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, and on that firm’s valuation multiple Goldman’s market-leading franchise is worth about $21.5 billion. All in, that’s $90 billion, or $3.5 billion more than Goldman’s market value on Tuesday. On this back-of-the-envelope analysis, which annualizes Goldman’s pretax earnings for the first nine months of last year and assumes a flat 33 percent tax rate, that suggests shareholders are ascribing no value to the firm’s prop businesses, which are now collected under the investing and lending heading. That’s despite commanding the highest pretax margin of any business line at the firm — almost 50 percent. This valuation also ignores a collection of investments that Goldman reckons are currently worth about $15 billion. It’s reasonable for investors to be cautious of proprietary risk-taking. And client trading can cause losses, too. Being deemed worthless may be a blow to the unit’s ego. But it serves Goldman’s purpose well. Even if the new regulation known as the Volcker Rule were to kill off all its prop activities, the firm’s stock shouldn’t take a hit: it’s already trading at around fair value. That’s fodder for a bullish view of Goldman’s shares. The iPhone Winner Apple has again turned iPhone buzz into gold. Despite all the talk of possible bells and whistles, Verizon Wireless so far looks to be offering the smartphone on terms roughly similar to AT&amp;T’s. The only clear winners will be Apple’s masters of hype. Some AT&amp;T customers might want to switch to Verizon Wireless. But that could cost them. Only a third of AT&amp;T’s iPhone customers have contracts that expire this year, according to UBS. Others would have to pay up to $325 in termination fees and least $199 for a new iPhone from Verizon Wireless, because the two networks run on different standards. As for Verizon Wireless’s customers, they will now get a chance to carry an Apple device. But they will pay much the same as AT&amp;T users. And for Verizon Wireless itself, mass adoption of the iPhone wouldn’t come cheap. Like AT&amp;T, it will subsidize every iPhone to the tune of perhaps $400 upfront for customers with a two-year contract. Furthermore, the handset encourages heavy data use, which in turn demands investment in cell towers and other infrastructure. Add up the burden, and the operators may not even cover their cost of capital. AT&amp;T’s newer customers pay more for downloading more data, which can change this calculus. Yet Verizon Wireless may swallow the cost of sticking with all-you-can-eat plans, at least for a while, to win over customers. Apple is therefore the most obvious beneficiary. Verizon Wireless brings it more than 90 million possible new iPhone users — potentially at the expense of rival smartphone makers. And both AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless will now have to spend heavily to advertise the iPhone. Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, and his cohorts have already benefited from the chatter surrounding something that, for any other company, would be a routine product line extension. Investors, at least, may have caught on. With the much anticipated announcement now out in the open, Apple’s stock dipped just a fraction on Tuesday. But shares in both AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications, the wireless unit’s controlling shareholder, were down approaching 2 percent.

But on Tuesday, Verizon suffered its own slowdown. No, it was not its mobile phone network. Rather it was the Verizon Wireless Web site. It slowed noticeably just as Verizon executives said at a press conference in New York that they would begin offering the iPhone next month. Hordes of people apparently tried to access the site to get details. The site, which usually downloads in around 3.5 seconds, took nearly twice as long to appear, according to Keynote Systems, a mobile and Internet monitoring firm. The slowdown lasted up to 30 minutes, starting at around 12:05 p.m. Another spike in traffic slowed the site for around 15 minutes starting at 2:30 p.m., Keynote said. “There wasn’t any significant outage; it just slowed down,” said Shawn White, senior director of external operations for Keynote. Many people are waiting to see if Verizon’s mobile network suffers the same problems as AT&amp;T’s has after it introduces the iPhone. Who knows whether Verizon’s Web site slowdown is a precursor of things to come?</text></article><article index="7" href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/the-arrival-of-the-verizon-iphone/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">The Arrival of the Verizon iPhone<date>January 12, 2011, 4:46 pm</date><text>So. Wow. After all these years, after all the pundits cried wolf year after year, Verizon is finally going to offer the iPhone, starting next month. It’s not going to be quite the same thing as the AT&amp;T iPhone. For example, you won’t be able to use the Internet while you’re on a call, and you won’t be able to use the phone overseas. Those are two limitations of the network type (CDMA) that Verizon — and Sprint — use. On the other hand, the Verizon iPhone will do something the AT&amp;T phone doesn’t: maintain a call until you’re ready to hang up. I know, I know — harsh. But true. Maybe it’s because I live in the Northeast, a Verizon stronghold and an AT&amp;T weak point. But in my experience — and Consumer Reports’ — Verizon’s network is simply better, even though Verizon itself is far more consumer-hostile. Frankly, I’m sort of tempted to ditch my AT&amp;T iPhone and go for Verizon. I frequently commute from my home in Connecticut into New York City, and there are at least three spots where I lose the AT&amp;T call every single time. I would be delighted to make that a thing of the past. There are two caveats. First, Verizon’s network may become just as congested and overloaded as AT&amp;T’s did when the iPhone hit. Nobody knows yet; Verizon itself says it’s ready. Second, for millions of us who want to switch to Verizon, we’ll have to deal with early-termination fees — the price you pay for leaving a cellphone contract before the two years are up. I’ll be looking into Gazelle.com, a company that pays you for old gadgets and then resells them to keep them out of the landfill. They’re paying $430 for a 32-gig AT&amp;T iPhone 4, which is more than enough to pay your early-cancellation fees. One thing is for sure: it’s going to be a wild, fascinating ride.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/technology/12phone.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon to Offer the iPhone Next Month<date>Published: January 11, 2011</date><text>Ending months of speculation, Verizon announced on Tuesday that it would begin selling Apple’s iPhone 4 early next month.But for those who have been clamoring to use the phone on Verizon’s popular network, there were a few caveats. For starters, the Verizon model will not be the same iPhone 4 that is sold by AT&amp;T, which until now has had the exclusive right to sell the iPhone in the United States. They are nearly identical on the outside, apart from some small changes to the metal antenna around the edge, but their innards are quite different. Apple had to create a new version of the iPhone 4 for Verizon because its network uses a different technology. “This is a whole new device,” said Daniel S. Mead, chief executive of Verizon Wireless. Networks like Verizon’s that use the CDMA technology cannot transmit voice and data simultaneously, so Verizon iPhone users will not be able to look up directions or check e-mail while on a call, for example, as they can with AT&amp;T. Timothy D. Cook, chief operating officer for Apple, said at a news conference in Manhattan that he did not think most consumers would mind. “I think people place emphasis on different things,” he said. The Verizon phone will also not work in nearly as many countries as AT&amp;T’s version, which uses GSM technology. But in other respects, they will function much the same. Mr. Cook took the stage at the event with Lowell McAdam, president and chief operating officer of Verizon, to announce the new partnership. “Today, two industry innovators are coming together to deliver something consumers have been hungry for years,” Mr. McAdam said. “We are bringing to market the fruit of our strategic partnership with a giant in the market, and that is Apple.” Existing Verizon customers will be able to preorder the phone on Feb. 3, and others can preorder beginning Feb. 10. Verizon executives said the iPhone with 16 gigabytes of storage would cost $199 with a two-year contract, while the 32-gigabyte version would cost $299 — the same as AT&amp;T. Verizon said pricing for data plans had not yet been determined. One big question is whether the phone will put the same kind of strain on Verizon that it has on AT&amp;T, which has suffered from millions of data-guzzling iPhone owners weighing on its wireless network, and has struggled to address customer complaints. If it can handle the load, Verizon stands to gain millions of new wireless subscribers and the resulting revenue from device sales and data services. If not, the company could suffer a colossal blow to its reputation as a reliable carrier. “Verizon has had the advantage of seeing the challenges and problems AT&amp;T has faced,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “If they haven’t tested and prepared for this in an adequate fashion to deliver on that promise, they will have damaged something they have invested hundreds of millions in.” That brand perception, Mr. Golvin said, will matter more in the coming months as AT&amp;T and Verizon battle it out for the dominant portion of carrier market share and try to lure subscribers away from one another. An AT&amp;T spokeswoman said, “For iPhone users who want the fastest speeds, the ability to talk and use apps at the same time, and unsurpassed global coverage, the only choice is AT&amp;T.” Verizon executives seemed highly confident. They said they had spent a year testing CDMA technology with the iPhone 4, and monitored the data habits of the millions of smartphones already running on their network to accurately predict the volume of traffic that a wave of new iPhones would generate. Mr. Mead said Verizon had added enough capacity to serve the needs of subscribers eager to begin using the iPhone as soon as possible. “We were very diligent in making sure that our network would work from the ground up,” he said, adding that the company had had “thousands of iPhones running on our network for some time.” Perhaps as a sign of its confidence, Verizon is offering something that AT&amp;T does not provide: the ability to supply a Wi-Fi connection to as many as five laptops and other devices by piggybacking on the iPhone’s cellular data connection. Verizon said this would cost an additional, unspecified monthly amount. Verizon’s iPhone will operate on the company’s 3G or third-generation wireless network, rather than the new, faster 4G LTE network that it is introducing. Making the iPhone run on the new network with current chip technology would have “forced design changes we wouldn’t make,” said Mr. Cook of Apple. Rather than tweak the phone and potentially delay its arrival further, he said, the company forged ahead with a 3G version. Company executives would not say when a version of the iPhone that could run on the LTE network might appear. That means the iPhone 4 will be in direct competition with the handful of sleek new LTE smartphones Verizon introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. Analysts say the Apple and Verizon partnership could seriously hinder the rise of smartphones running Google’s Android software in the United States. Although Android phones have moved past the iPhone recently in terms of market share, that may not last. In countries where the iPhone has been available on multiple networks, it has tended to take most of the market. Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said the iPhone’s move to Verizon was an “opportunity to see the iPhone compete with Android on a level playing field.” Apple could sell as many as nine million iPhones for Verizon’s network this year; it sold 15 million for AT&amp;T’s network last year.

He suggested that Verizon’s version of the iPhone would not be as fast because of the network technology the company uses. Verizon offered its own jabs in response, pointing out the stress and strain placed on AT&amp;T’s network since 2007, the year the first iPhone was introduced. “AT&amp;T is known for a lot of things, but network quality is not one of them,” said Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless. “Typically companies try to call attention to their strongest suit.” Mr. Nelson added something that had the ring of a playground taunt: “It must be backwards day at AT&amp;T.” Verizon’s impending announcement is cranking up the tension between AT&amp;T and Verizon, which has watched from the sidelines as AT&amp;T reaped the benefits of its partnership with Apple. The fight now heating up underscores the growing importance of the gravitational pull of popular devices like the iPhone, which for wireless companies can mean millions of dollars in revenue in sales of the devices and data plans. “Historically, these companies have not been direct competitors. They share the same gene pool, going back to Ma Bell,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. “But it speaks to the fact that the wireless business is now the majority of their growth, and it’s not far from the majority of their business.” The competition between AT&amp;T and Verizon, he said, recalls some of the great brand battles of the past, in which rivals duked it out in advertising campaigns on television and billboards. “It’s reminiscent of the days when you couldn’t say the word ‘Pepsi’ in Atlanta,” Mr. Moffett said. The stakes for AT&amp;T are high. The company has suffered from the strain placed on its network by millions of data-guzzling iPhone owners, and has struggled to address customer complaints. Its reputation may suffer further damage if Verizon does not have the same problems with its network. “There’s no comparison between the two carriers when it comes to consumer satisfaction,” said Paul Reynolds, an electronics editor at Consumer Reports, who keeps a close eye on wireless companies. Mr. Reynolds said the magazine had found that in the last few years, Verizon was consistently ranked highest in satisfaction among its users. AT&amp;T, he said, is a different story. Its customers “are consistently the least satisfied,” Mr. Reynolds said. “AT&amp;T used to have company in the lower rung, but Sprint pulled itself up and moved into the top-tier carriers.” Millions of wireless subscribers may hang in the balance. Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, estimates that Verizon could activate as many as nine million iPhones in the coming year, or as much as 40 percent of its total smartphone sales for the year. Up to 6.5 million of those subscribers could be defectors from AT&amp;T, he said. The back-and-forth between the two companies has been going on for a while. Last year, Verizon ran a series of commercials showing purported dead zones in AT&amp;T’s national coverage. They were accompanied by the tagline, “Before you pick a phone, pick a network.” Analysts and experts expect the clash between the carriers to continue to play out in the public arena, most likely through similar barbed statements and ad campaigns, as each criticizes the other’s capabilities and services. Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that given Apple’s resistance to allowing carriers to put their brands on the iPhone, it was likely that phones from AT&amp;T and Verizon would be indistinguishable on the outside. “It’s crucial that they have a message that emphasizes the quality of the network,” he said. Verizon’s network could suffer from the same hiccups and traffic burdens that AT&amp;T has struggled with — unless it has learned from AT&amp;T’s mistakes. “Verizon is awfully confident they won’t have any problems,” Mr. Moffett said. “But they’ve had a long time to prepare for this.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/with-verizon-will-apple-take-a-bite-of-more-enterprise/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">With Verizon, Will Apple Take a Bite of More Enterprise?<date>January 11, 2011, 3:35 pm</date><text>Jonathan Gainer/Bloomberg NewsDoes the BlackBerry face a challenge for Wall Street’s hearts and minds? Few companies could command as much attention for bringing an existing phone to a new telephone network as Apple, whose iPhone is coming to Verizon Wireless. Introducing the wildly popular smartphone to Big Red is sure to add more users; analysts say the move could double Apple’s smartphone market share, according to an article in The New York Times. But will adding Verizon to Apple’s stable of phone network partners bolster its acceptance in banking and other enterprise areas? At least a few analysts think Verizon’s partnership can only brighten Apple’s prospects. “Today’s events with Verizon, which is arguably the best network in the U.S., is another tipping point for Apple,” Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company, told DealBook. Already, financial firms have begun loosening restrictions on devices supported by their I.T. departments, signaling a potential shift away from that warhorse of corporate mobility, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry. Last year, Standard Chartered offered employees the opportunity to add iPhones to their corporate cellphone plans.

Representatives for several major banks declined to comment specifically on their plans to offer employees iPhones in addition to BlackBerry devices. Mr. Marshall estimated that about 10 percent of iPhones sold today go to enterprise customers. He also pointed to comments by Apple’s chief operating officer, Tim Cook, in June, claiming that 80 percent of Fortune 100 companies have deployed or are piloting the iPhone. Still, the Verizon iPhone (the VeriPhone?) may not exactly be a game changer. Among the primary obstacles for iPhone adoption by big companies are concerns about security, connectivity with systems like Microsoft Exchange and cost. Apple has addressed several of those matters already, including adding Exchange support to link users to their Outlook mail and calendars and enabling tougher hardware and software security on the iPhone. But don’t expect a majority of corporate road warriors to be slinging iPhones from their hips anytime soon. “It’s going to slowly ramp up over time,” said Todd Rethemeier of Hudson Square Research. “The enterprise market is still predominantly a BlackBerry world.”</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/the-verizon-iphone-announcement/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">The Buzz on the Verizon iPhone Announcement<date>January 10, 2011, 2:25 pm</date><text>Illustration by Nick Bilton/The New York Times The Verizon iPhone frenzy kicked into full gear over the weekend as bloggers and technology pundits picked over crumbs of information online like famished shoppers discussing a free food sample they just got at a fancy grocery store. So what do we know? There are only a couple of facts so far. First, there is going to be a significant announcement by Verizon on Tuesday  in New York City (which we will be live-blogging here on Bits). And according to The Times and other outlets, Verizon will be announcing the iPhone’s availability on Verizon’s network. Then there are some other bits of information circulating. Reuters, citing an unnamed source, said the Verizon iPhone will be available with with the mobile carrier’s “existing wireless service price plans,” which include all-you-can-eat data options. In comparison, AT&amp;T puts a cap on data usage for new iPhone customers. One of the more interesting rumors comes from John Paczkowski at All Things D, who believes Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, could be in attendance for the Tuesday announcement. Mr. Paczkowski said he got this information from a person “in a position to know.” John Gruber, author of the Daring Fireball blog, doesn’t believe Mr. Jobs will make it to the event but that Apple will instead send Phil Schiller or Greg Joswiak, both senior executives at the company. The timing of the device’s release is still up for debate, with The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reporting that it will be available by the end of January. But earlier reports said it would not be available until early February. Now the discussion online is moving to questions surrounding Verizon’s ability to handle the iPhone on its network. Many wonder if a mass exodus from the AT&amp;T network to this new carrier could cripple Verizon too. Late last year I wrote about the possibility of the iPhone crushing Verizon’s network and cited Jeffrey Nelson, executive director for corporate communications at Verizon Wireless, who said the company’s network was “tried and true.” Mr. Nelson also noted that Verizon has ”built our network for reliability. It is our DNA, it is our brand — anything we do, or don’t do, in the future, will ensure a good customer experience.” I guess we’ll find out soon enough.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/is-it-finally-time-for-the-verizon-iphone/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Is It Finally Time for the Verizon iPhone?<date>January 7, 2011, 4:38 pm</date><text>Just yesterday, Verizon’s top executives had the attention of the world’s technology press during a keynote speech and news conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The events left some disappointed: Verizon had little new to announce, and in particular, there was no announcement about an iPhone running on Verizon Wireless. Now Verizon has invited reporters to an unexpected red carpet event at Lincoln Center in New York on Tuesday. Speculation is rampant across the Web that this time Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s president, will finally announce that the iPhone is coming to Verizon. And all signs suggest it is. A reporter for The Loop, a Web site dedicated to Apple news, was invited. Another Apple news site reports that employees of Verizon stores have been told to attend mandatory training sessions later this month for “an iconic pre-order.” And BoyGeniusReport, a gadget site, reports that Apple retail store employees have been barred from taking vacation in early February. So the consensus is that Mr. McAdam will announce the iPhone on Verizon on Tuesday and that the device will go on sale in a few weeks. A representative for Verizon did not immediately return a call for comment. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. We have known for some time that early this year Apple planned to make the iPhone available on Verizon, ending AT&amp;T’s exclusivity on the coveted smartphone in the United States. But another question is whether Apple executives will be on stage at the New York event. Don’t count on Steven P. Jobs, the company’s chief executive, to be there. Apple typically announces new iPhone carriers through press releases. Then again, Verizon is not just another carrier. So perhaps another Apple executive will make the trip. Whatever the case, whenever the iPhone comes to Verizon, demand from customers is expected to be huge.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/technology/08verizon.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon iPhone 4 on CDMA Network Set to Be Announced<date>Published: January 7, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Verizon Wireless plans to announce on Tuesday that it will soon begin selling Apple’s iPhone 4, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plans.The long-expected arrival of the iPhone on Verizon will end years of exclusivity for AT&amp;T and is likely to upend the smartphone market in the United States. It is not clear how soon after the announcement, which will be made in New York, the phone will be available for sale. On Friday afternoon, Verizon invited reporters to a news conference on Tuesday morning at Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The company did not say what it planned to announce, but given the timing less than a week after top Verizon executives gave a keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, speculation in tech circles was rampant that Verizon would announce that it would begin selling the iPhone. Verizon’s intentions to unveil an iPhone running on the company’s CDMA network early this year have long been known. The person with direct knowledge of the event, who declined to be named because plans for it were supposed to be confidential, said the company would do so at the Tuesday event, which will be headlined by Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s president. A spokesman for Verizon Wireless declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. While the iPhone remains the best-selling smartphone in the United States, many handset makers sell devices running Google’s Android software. Collectively, those devices outsell the iPhone. Consumer surveys suggest that demand for a Verizon iPhone would be large, as many people have held off from buying an iPhone simply to avoid AT&amp;T’s much-publicized network problems, which include spotty coverage and dropped calls. A Verizon iPhone could help sell millions of new devices, continuing the iPhone’s strong momentum. It may also become an obstacle to the rapid rise of Android devices, most of which are sold by Verizon Wireless. “It will significantly shift the power again toward Apple,” said Roger Entner, a telecommunications industry analyst with Recon Analytics. Mr. Entner said that in other countries where the iPhone added new carriers, including Britain, Apple’s market share rose sharply. “Apple will significantly blunt the growth of Android,” he said. Any shift toward the iPhone could be slowed by long-term contracts that may keep some customers from switching. Customers “will not switch the first day,” said Charles Wolf, an analyst with Needham &amp; Company. “It is going to take two years before everyone is out of a contract, but the shift will be dramatic,” Mr. Wolf said.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/no-iphone-but-star-trek-future-from-verizon/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">No iPhone, but 'Star Trek' Future From Verizon<date>January 6, 2011, 2:12 pm</date><text>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Ivan Seidenberg, the chairman and chief executive of Verizon, on Thursday. LAS VEGAS — Those expecting Ivan Seidenberg, the chairman and chief executive of Verizon Communications, to pull out a gleaming iPhone from his pocket during the opening keynote of the Consumer Electronics Show can stop holding their breath. Mr. Seidenberg did not introduce a new version on Apple‘s flagship smartphone compatible with the company’s wireless network. And although Sanjay Jha, the chief executive of Motorola Mobility, sat on stage with Verizon for a portion of the speech, no new Verizon devices were introduced other than what was shown during Motorola’s press event the previous night. Rather, he sketched out details of the rapidly expanding smartphone industry and skyrocketing data demands of consumers, subtly nodding towards the company’s position against its rivals. “The network experience not only changes what we can do but what you can do,” he said. Analysts say that in the coming months, as popular smartphones like the iPhone begin to migrate to other carriers, wireless carriers will have to rely on pushing their network as a key way to lure new subscribers and retain the ones they have. Verizon’s early roll-out of its fourth-generation wireless network, said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst, “gives them a lot of bragging rights.” “They will continue to hammer that in 2011,” he added. Lowell McAdams, the chief operating officer of Verizon Wireless, also drummed home the networks advantages, noting “all 4G is not created equal.” Verizon’s 4G network “is a game-changer because it speeds up the innovation cycle meaning consumers will benefit much sooner than anyone expects,” he added. Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, also appeared on stage to talk about collaborating with Verizon, describing the emergence of streaming television on mobile devices “a second golden era of television.” Mr. Bewkes appearance helped underscore the notion that C.E.S. is increasingly becoming a media summit for entertainment companies as well as electronics companies. “It is an explosion of vitality that is moving from the TV screen to every other screen that you have,” he said. Mr. Seidenberg talked about the future of capabilities coming from Verizon Wireless, saying the network’s move to a faster network would enable advancements in health care technology, smarter homes and networked cities. “The sheer scale of connection of this new world will be truly mind-boggling,” Mr. Seidenberg said. Before closing out the session, he advised attendees that when thinking about the future of Verizon Wireless to “think Star Trek.” This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: January 7, 2011 Fixing reference to Mr. Seidenberg, who is head of Verizon Communications, not Verizon Wireless.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/technology/07verizon.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Is in Position to Gain Lost Ground With Android<date>Published: January 6, 2011</date><text>LAS VEGAS — Five years ago, Verizon passed on the chance to be the exclusive carrier of the iPhone in the United States because it could not agree on the terms of a deal with Apple.The iPhone, of course, went on to be a smartphone phenomenon, drawing new customers for AT&amp;T, as Verizon looked on in envy. Verizon is still the largest wireless carrier in the United States with 101 million subscribers, versus 93 million for AT&amp;T at No. 2. But each quarter since the iPhone was introduced, AT&amp;T added an average of 380,000 subscribers compared with Verizon, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. Now Verizon is making its biggest push yet to regain lost ground. The company will soon add the iPhone to its lineup, according to people with direct knowledge of Apple’s plans. But Verizon is not putting all of its eggs into Apple’s basket. It is deepening its ties with Google, which makes the popular Android software for mobile devices, and with handset makers like Motorola Mobility, HTC and Samsung. “Verizon realized their mistake, and their best option was to embrace Android,” said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray who follows the telecommunications industry. “They’re covering all their bases.” Another major part of the company’s strategy is its faster fourth-generation network, which is already available in many cities and uses technology known as long-term evolution, or LTE. Analysts say this technology is shaping up to be the world’s choice for the next phase of wireless expansion. AT&amp;T’s LTE network will not be ready until the end of the year. At the Consumer Electronics Show here, Verizon announced a series of partnerships with hardware makers for no less than 10 tablets, phones and mobile hot spots that run on 4G, which until now has been available only on laptop cards and modems. Lowell McAdam, the chief operating officer of Verizon Wireless, which is 45 percent owned by Vodafone of Britain, called the rollout of the LTE network a “game changer” for the company because of its speed. A high-definition full-length movie that might have taken 4.5 hours to download on a 3G network will take less than 4.5 minutes on 4G, he said. Analysts say that Verizon’s lack of a deal with Apple may have been a benefit in one respect. AT&amp;T has been plagued with comments from customers who complain about slow download speeds and spotty service. While AT&amp;T poured billions into strengthening its creaking network, Verizon was working to invest billions in 4G. “The perception was that Verizon needed the iPhone to survive,” said James Brehm, an analyst with Frost &amp; Sullivan. “But they’ve proved over the years that they did not need it to stay on top in terms of customers and what they’ve done without the iPhone.” Tony Melone, chief technology officer for Verizon Wireless, said that not entering into a tight-knit relationship with Apple gave the company the freedom to pursue other alliances. “It forced us to be creative and look for alternatives,” he said. As a result, he said, “we have a healthy new portfolio and we ended up in a good spot.” Now phone makers are eager to align themselves with Verizon so they can appear to be on the cutting edge of speed. Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon’s chairman, in a presentation at C.E.S. on Thursday, talked about coming 4G devices with Michael Cleron, one of the chief architects of Android at Google, and Sanjay Jha, chief of Motorola Mobility. Earlier at the show, Motorola unveiled a 4G smartphone called the Droid Bionic that will be one of the first phones running on the LTE network. It also showed off a Google-powered LTE tablet computer that is to arrive in late 2011. “The vast majority of our products in the second half of 2011 will have 4G capabilities,” Mr. Jha said. “The data demands of multimedia capabilities and more socially connected applications demand it.” But will customers be as excited about 4G as the wireless industry is? Some analysts are skeptical about how many smartphone purchases will actually be swayed by the speed of a company’s data network. “Regular consumers think more about the handset than the network,” said Elisabeth Rainge, an analyst at the research firm IDC. “If they build LTE, will they come?” Verizon, Ms. Rainge said, has “good traction with customers, and subscribers have a sense that the signal is strong, but is that enough?” At the least, said Mr. Sharma, the 4G network will give Verizon a strong marketing ace up its sleeve for the coming year. “It gives them a lot of bragging rights,” he said. “They’ll continue to hammer it big time in 2011.” AT&amp;T executives sound unconcerned. “Customers don’t care about G’s,” said Glenn Lurie, the company’s head of emerging devices. “They care about experience and devices, and we still have the best overall portfolio.” Mr. Lurie said he was not concerned about any imminent loss of iPhone exclusivity. Even so, in a turn toward Android, AT&amp;T said at C.E.S. that it would introduce at least a dozen Google-powered smartphones in the coming year, more than triple the number it offered previously. “We’re working with Google and will have an impressive innovation cycle of devices this year,” Mr. Lurie said. Google is a big part of Verizon’s strategy too — and Verizon’s partnerships with Google and others will give it an impressive portfolio of tablets and phones for the first time in recent memory, Mr. Munster said. “Verizon has a better relationship with handset makers, which gives them the ability to offer better phones,” he said. “Even with Android, they were late to the game, after they had no choice. Now they are being aggressive about LTE and their network performance.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: January 10, 2011 An earlier version of this article erroneously gave Mr. Brehm's business affiliation as Forrester Research, rather than Frost &amp; Sullivan.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/is-it-finally-time-for-the-verizon-iphone/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Is It Finally Time for the Verizon iPhone?<date>January 7, 2011, 4:38 pm</date><text>Just yesterday, Verizon’s top executives had the attention of the world’s technology press during a keynote speech and news conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

One frigid day, workmen from FiOS, the Verizon service renowned for providing home Internet service at the speed of light, showed up with ear protectors and jackhammers. Then, as workmen have done regularly for more than a century in Brooklyn, they tore up the road. Like miners in reverse, they laid down pure telecommunications ore, threading strands of silver-black fiber-optic cable under Hicks Street, a lopsided, part-cobblestone thoroughfare down which chugged the Hicks Street Line, a railroad that ran at the turn of the 20th century.Now the FiOS trucks are gone; the road is sealed up. Hicks Street, which is still lined with carriage houses, looks Victorian again. But somewhere under the ground — in the snarled archaeology of cables, lines, tunnels, tubes, co-ax, copper and pipes — there are now pliable, beautiful, clear fused-silica tubes guiding light waves from communications centers right to our houses. FiOS is available to more than 15 million homes in the United States. Another fiber-optic service, AT&amp;T U-verse, is available to about 26 million residences. These services are known generally as fiber-to-the-X because they bring fiber optics directly to the home, the node, the basement; someone got tired of all the FTT acronyms and made it all FTTx. Consumer Reports has repeatedly rated these services as preferable to nonfiber services. Inside my apartment building, then, there are now many more cables, installed by nail-gun men, also from FiOS, who mounted ladders in the stairwell and told me they were putting up molding. It’s not molding. The building’s common spaces are now defined by braids of insulated wire, thinly disguised by flimsy vinyl strips. The strip over my apartment door came loose the day it was nailed in. Laid bare is a tangle of ropy cable that looks much meatier than I expected from the light-fantastic phrase “fiber optic.” Staring at the exposed cables, I had a gnawing sense that our media-critic forefathers of the 1960s would dislike them and the way they slither up to our front doors from some central-information regime. But maybe not. Maybe they would see FiOS as a new way for regular people to have efficient access to the all-important open Internet. You can never tell what ’60s people would have thought of the digital world, had they foreseen it. So I asked my neighbors — in person and on Brooklyn message boards — what they think of FiOS. They’re excited. Many of them are ready to quit Time Warner Cable, an imperfect provider that some of them believe is tyrannical. It is commonly held that Time Warner Cable and other telecom companies will never be truly speedy because they continue to use old copper pathways unsuited to Internet signals. FiOS is the first company to use fiber optics for “the last mile,” as the final stretch of connectivity between communications provider and customer is called (though it’s almost never an actual mile). Some 3.9 million people across the United States use FiOS now for Internet service; about 3.3 million use the TV service, many of whom purchase it in a bundle with their Internet and phone service. Two or three days after FiOS finished work on my block, the Federal Communications Commission proposed a set of incendiary new rules about the distribution of the Internet. These rules, while they would restrain telecom companies from gross oligopoly, would enable them to block, at their discretion, apps and services for wireless Internet users. The companies would also be able to charge fees for smooth-flowing broadband over fixed lines, which might strand people who don’t pay in “slow lanes” on the Internet. (The phrase alone triggers road rage.) The F.C.C.’s critics say that the rules violate the ideal of net neutrality — equal access to the Web. Some have even suggested the new rules open the door to First Amendment violations. As Senator Al Franken of Minnesota put it, “If corporations are allowed to prioritize content on the Internet, or they are allowed to block applications you access on your iPhone, there is nothing to prevent those same corporations from censoring political speech.” America’s wires are not just a metaphor. Protected pathways, from roads to optical fiber, have been integral to the nation’s political development. Our technological world evolves every day, incrementally — and then, suddenly, in lurches. Is this one of those times? It’s hard to grasp each shift’s ideological implications; things are moving too fast. Whether the fiber optics newly at our front doors mean more government surveillance, more democratic access, more corporate power, more entrepreneurial innovation or more inhibitions on speech — we can’t know yet. To me, the strands of filament now buried in Brooklyn seem to represent the culmination, for now, of the historic changeover from industrial America and its railroads to digital America and its fiber optics. That alone seems momentous. POINTS OF ENTRY: THIS WEEK'S RECOMMENDATIONS MORE FIBER Check out FiOS yourself, at Verizon.com. The site’s coyness about where FiOS is available and how far its reach is might drive you crazy. But evangelically satisfied FiOS customers will tell you that, after you sign upfor FiOS, you’ll never need customer service again. Worth investigating.

Looking ahead to 2011, I’ve got some predictions: TWITTER WILL BE ACQUIRED BY GOOGLE The logic of this combination is just too obvious. Google needs a big play in the social media arena, and Google’s engineering horsepower and ability to provide full search integration would have big benefits for Twitter. While Twitter has done an excellent job lately in morphing into a platform and servicing the big personalities that drive a lot of buzz, Google has the ability to make an offer — $10 billion? — that the company won’t be able to refuse. Twitter, in San Francisco, is just far enough away from Google, in Mountain View, to retain its own identity while still working closely with its Big Brother. And antitrust authorities may not have much to grab onto with this combination. FACEBOOK WILL FILE FOR AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING This is an easy one in light of all the activity in the secondary market for Facebook shares. Like Google and Microsoft in their day, Facebook doesn’t really want to be public, but pressure from employees wanting to cash out, and from regulators who are looking carefully at the 500-shareholder limit on unregistered stock will almost certainly force the issue. Ferrari dealers of Palo Alto, start your engines! THE TABLET WARS WILL GO CRAZY, AND YIELD NO CLEAR WINNER The success of the iPad is attracting all the big guns of the business — Sony, Microsoft, H.P. among others. Amazon is still holding its own with the Kindle, and Apple is said to be prepping several new iPad models. Content providers are all over the map, with some doing big, iPad-specific projects, while others continue to wrestle with Apple and other device vendors over business terms and technology. Lots of cool new tablets will mean lots of sales. But the real money will be in the software — a good thing for Silicon Valley, which still has the best engineers but has long since moved the machine-making to Asia. And the shakeout that defines the contours of this new industry niche is still a couple of years off. THE IPHONE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE ON THE VERIZON NETWORK And lots of people will be unhappy. The Verizon iPhone rumor has been around a while, and there is every reason to think that this will be the year. Apple needs to counter the rise of Android smartphones with broader distribution, and a lot of people who aren’t willing to sacrifice Verizon’s superior connectivity are waiting — especially in the cell-reception-challenged Bay Area. But, AT&amp;T is probably correct in suggesting that Verizon doesn’t realize what it’s getting into with those data-hogging iPhoners, and when the Verizon iPhone confronts some of the capacity issues that have bedeviled AT&amp;T, customers will howl. REGULATORY BATTLES OVER PRIVACY AND NET NEUTRALITY WILL LOOM LARGE In the United States, privacy is one of those things that people say they worry about, but act as if they don’t. But that is changing with the advent of highly intrusive services like Google Street View and behaviorally targeted advertising — not to mention the near-requirement that you now share at least some personal information on social networks. In Europe, it’s an even bigger issue. But some of the privacy rules now being contemplated in Washington would literally kill some business models, and the industry will fight them. Some of the same tensions apply regarding net neutrality. The rules recently promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission to assure that the owners of information “pipes” can’t discriminate among the services that use those pipes were an elegant compromise that pleased no one. With all of this, Silicon Valley companies will be hiring — for their legal and lobbying teams in Washington. GREEN ENERGY WILL RIDE A ROLLER-COASTER, BUT END THE YEAR ON TOP In early 2010, venture capital was pouring into green energy ventures, especially solar power. By year-end the enthusiasm was distinctly more muted. The failure of the federal government to pass cap-and-trade legislation is one factor. The declining price of natural gas is another. Competition from China is yet another. And wind power is running into problems, mainly related to building the transmission systems needed to serve remote wind farms (environmentalists are increasingly sour on wind as well). The good news is that California has a new governor, Jerry Brown, who in one key respect is just like the old governor Jerry Brown: he’s a true believer in alternative energy, and made green job creation a central plank of his election campaign. My bet is that Mr. Brown will use the various tools at his disposal to boost the renewable energy industry through its soft spot. Entrepreneurs never like to be seen as dependent on the government, but in the energy business that’s the reality — and in 2011, it may be a happy one for Silicon Valley.

Faces Challenges To Net Rules<date>Published: December 22, 2010</date><text>8:52 p.m. | Updated Want to watch hours of YouTube videos or sort through Facebook photos on the computer? Your Internet providers would be forbidden from blocking you under rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday. But if you want to do the same on your cellphone, you may not have the same protections. The debate over the rules, intended to preserve open access to the Internet, seems to have resulted in a classic Washington solution - the kind that pleases no one on either side of the issue. Verizon and other service providers would prefer no government involvement. Public interest advocates think the rules stop far short of ensuring free speech. Some Republicans believe the rules are another instance of government overreach. At the commission meeting in Washington, Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said the steps were historic. ''For the first time,'' he said, ''we'll have enforceable rules of the road to preserve Internet freedom and openness.'' The rules, which address some of the principles of so-called network neutrality, will be tested in the courts in the months ahead, and Republicans said Tuesday that they would challenge the rules in Congress as well. The new rules are, at best, net semi-neutrality. They ban any outright blocking and any ''unreasonable discrimination'' of Web sites or applications by fixed-line broadband providers, but they afford more wiggle room to wireless providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon. They require all providers to disclose what steps they take to manage their networks. In a philosophical break with open Internet advocates, the rules do not explicitly forbid ''paid prioritization,'' which would allow a company to pay for faster transmission of data. Nonetheless, supporters said the 3-2 vote by the commission represented significant progress toward fulfilling a campaign promise by President Obama to preserve a level playing field for Web developers. In a statement, Mr. Obama congratulated the F.C.C. and said that the government would ''remain vigilant and see to it that innovation is allowed to flourish, that consumers are protected from abuse, and that the democratic spirit of the Internet remains intact.'' The rules are set to take effect early in 2011. The media mogul Barry Diller, chairman of the IAC/InterActive Corporation, said in an interview Tuesday that he thought the F.C.C. had achieved ''as much as could be done.'' The rules of the road, he said, are ''going to deter the bad behavior that I think was coming closer and closer.'' That ''bad behavior'' is largely theoretical to date, but as the Internet becomes the pipeline for all the world's text, audio and video, clashes are likely to occur between the owners of the pipe and the people who want to supply innovative services through it. Mr. Genachowski reiterated on Tuesday that the F.C.C. would ''fulfill its historic role as a cop on the beat.'' But there was considerable disagreement on Tuesday about whether the F.C.C. had the legal authority to go forward with the rules under Title II of the Communications Act. Hinting that it has doubts about that, Verizon said the F.C.C. order ''appears to assert broad authority for sweeping new regulation of broadband wireline and wireless networks and the Internet itself'' without ''solid statutory underpinnings.'' In the long term, Verizon said, ''that is harmful to consumers and the nation.'' Many others sounded more satisfied by Tuesday's decision. Comcast and Time Warner Cable each separately said the F.C.C. had struck a ''workable balance,'' and AT&amp;T said the compromise appeared ''to balance major differences.'' The fact that the rules received support - even the lukewarm kind - from big businesses should worry consumers, some public interest groups said Tuesday. ''There is a reason that so many giant phone and cable companies are happy, and we are not. These rules are riddled with loopholes,'' Andrew Jay Schwartzman, the policy director for the nonprofit Media Access Project, said in one representative statement. ''They foreshadow years of uncertainty and regulatory confusion, which those carriers will use to their advantage.'' Other groups warned that the rules would smooth the way for fast and slow lanes on the Internet. They objected especially loudly to the looser rules for wireless devices, which are becoming important on-ramps to the Internet. But wireless was treated differently, Mr. Genachowski said, because it has ''unique technical issues'' and is at a more nascent stage of growth. He added, ''Any reduction in Internet openness would be a cause for concern, as would any reduction in innovation and investment in mobile broadband applications, devices or networks that depend on Internet openness.'' While wireless carriers will be able to block various apps and services, they won't be able to block basic Web sites or any apps that compete with their own voice and video products. That represents a win for Skype, the Internet phone service, which praised the F.C.C. rules on Tuesday. The vote on the rules split along party lines, with two Democratic commissioners joining Mr. Genachowski to gain passage. Those commissioners, Michael J. Copps and Mignon Clyburn, both indicated that they wished the rules were tougher, but that, as Mr. Copps put it, ''without some action today, the wheels of network neutrality would grind to a screeching halt for at least the next two years.'' The two Republican commissioners, Robert M. McDowell and Meredith Baker, vocally opposed the rules as unnecessary and unjustified. ''The F.C.C. has provocatively chartered a collision course with the legislative branch,'' Mr. McDowell said, alluding to the complaints of Republicans in Congress. Before the F.C.C. meeting even began on Tuesday, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said in a statement that the Internet ''should be left alone,'' and that his colleagues would ''push back against new rules and regulations'' next year. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. head, center, with Michael Copps, left, and Robert McDowell.

Initially, only laptop users will be able to take advantage of the higher data speeds offered by the network, compared with Verizon’s 3G network. The speeds are somewhat higher than those offered by T-Mobile USA and AT&amp;T in places where their 3G networks have been upgraded to the highest speeds. Verizon is charging less for 4G than for 3G. One data plan will cost $50 a month for 5 gigabytes of data, compared with $60 for 3G. Another plan will provide 10 gigabytes of data for $80 a month. The Verizon Wireless chief technology officer, Tony Melone, said he expected many customers would find 5 gigabytes was not enough. When downloading at top 4G speeds, it takes about an hour to exhaust a monthly allotment of 5 gigabytes of data. Mr. Melone said Verizon should have 4G smartphones available by next summer. The 4G coverage areas include the cities on the Boston-to-Washington stretch as well as in California, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Seattle. A Sprint Nextel subsidiary, Clearwire, already has an active 4G network that uses a different standard than Verizon’s.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/technology/personaltech/18basics.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Cellphone Signal Boosters Under Siege by Carriers<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>When Sean Kirkland, an executive vice president for sales and marketing for a company that plans corporate meetings and events, moved into a new house in San Diego last year, he loved everything about the place.Everything except the poor reception he got on his cellphone. It was worst in his home office. When a dropped call caused him to spend several minutes talking to dead air instead of to an important client, “I wanted to bang my head against the wall,” said Mr. Kirkland, 42. So he installed a cellular signal booster, or repeater. The devices, which cost from $250 to $1,000, depending on how much they increase a signal, work by first capturing cell signals through an external antenna, ideally affixed to the roof of a dwelling. A coaxial cable then transmits the signal inside the house to an amplifier and internal antenna, which strengthen and retransmit it to cellphones. Before, Mr. Kirkland said, he might have had one or two bars indicating signal strength. “I can walk around my whole home now with full strength reception,” he said. “I couldn’t be happier.” But will Mr. Kirkland’s solution remain legal? In March, CTIA-The Wireless Association, which represents cellular service providers, filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission demanding stricter regulation of signal boosters. The commission is considering whether to let Mr. Kirkland and an estimated one million other homeowners continue to use them. Boosters have been around for about a decade, but they have not been widely used. And when they were used, it was mostly in commercial settings. But the popularity of bandwidth-hogging smartphones and poor reception in urban and rural areas have prompted homeowners to fill their homes with the electronics needed to pull in a reliable signal. Supported by separate filings by AT&amp;T and Verizon, the CTIA claims that boosters interfere with cellular networks and disrupt service to customers. As a result, CTIA has asked the F.C.C. to require that “the use of signal boosters be coordinated with and controlled by commission licensees and the sale and marketing of such devices be limited to authorized parties.” In other words, CTIA wants cellular service providers to control who makes boosters, who sells them and to whom. Not surprisingly, the leading manufacturers of cell signal boosters like Wilson Electronics of St. George, Utah, and Wireless Extenders of Norcross, Ga., do not like this idea. They grumble that the wireless carriers want to shut them out of a market that is rapidly expanding as more people forgo landlines to rely on their cellphones, which may not work so well inside their homes. Common construction materials like concrete and foil-lined insulation can make good reception difficult without a booster. “You used to run inside to take a call, but now you run outside to take a call,” said Joe Baños, chief operating officer for Wilson Electronics. Mr. Baños does not dispute that poorly made boosters can sometimes cause network disruptions, but he said the solution was for the F.C.C. to tighten up manufacturing specifications. “As it stands, the F.C.C. criteria is useless,” he said, because it does not require boosters to have automatic shut-off features if they detect interference. Wilson’s $250 DeskTop Signal Booster, which transmits a signal up to 2,000 square feet, and Wi-Ex’s $399 zBoost SOHO YX545, which increases an indoor signal over 3,000 square feet, are popular models that can support multiple phones. The devices are available from electronics stores and online retailers like Amazon. Both Wilson and Wireless Extenders say their products are designed to prevent interference and do not affect cellular networks. Mr. Kirkland’s booster, a $375 Clearstream Microsite, was made by Antennas Direct, a new entrant to the market. While the company said the device was still in a public testing phase, it also had built-in safeguards against interference. But Christopher Guttman-McCabe, CTIA’s vice president for regulatory affairs, said that with the proliferation of tablet computers, smartphones and personal mobile hot spots, “The wireless environment is always changing and represents a complicated interaction of signals.” Adding boosters to the mix without carrier coordination and approval, he said, “can cause overload and serious confusion in the network.” Moreover, Mr. Guttman-McCabe said boosters sometimes interfered with the closed wireless networks that public safety officials use to communicate. Indeed, the Association of Public-Safety Communications Professionals International supports CTIA’s efforts to restrict who can operate boosters. And yet, Wilson and Wireless Extenders combined have provided hundreds of boosters to federal, state and local government offices nationwide including police, fire and public transportation departments. Examples include New York City Transit and several offices of the Department of Homeland Security. CTIA’s objection to boosters comes at a time when cellular service providers have begun offering their own products to cope with weak or intermittent reception. Called femtocells, these devices essentially push wireless signals onto the Internet to transmit voice and data. The signal travels via a customer’s broadband connection into and out of the house rather than on radio waves, which might get weakened traveling through say, trees or thick walls. Robert Plamondon, 51, a technical writer who lives on a rural farm in Blodgett, Ore., bought a femtocell last year — the Verizon Wireless 3G Network Extender. “Before I got it, I had to go out to the mailbox to take a call,” he said. “That wouldn’t be so bad except it rains a lot here.” The femtocell looks like a wireless router and plugs into his broadband connection to provide cell coverage throughout his house. “The only thing that takes some getting used to is the delay when you’re talking,” he said, referring to the lag time he experiences between when he speaks and when he is heard by the person on the other end of the call and vice versa. Verizon’s femtocell costs $250, whereas AT&amp;T’s competing product, the 3G Microcell, costs $150. Sprint’s femtocell, known as the Airave Access Point 3G, is free on a case-by-case basis to customers who have proven signal problems. T-Mobile takes a different approach by offering calling via any wireless hot spot at no additional charge to customers who buy phones that have so-called Wi-Fi calling. Unlike AT&amp;T and Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile have not told the F.C.C. of any concerns about boosters. Paul Kolodzy, a wireless consultant in Centreville, Va., said the booster debate obscured a more fundamental problem, which was that the number of cellphone users had outgrown network capacity. “Cell service providers either have to build more towers to handle the load or drive cell traffic onto the Internet.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/technology/05alcatel.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Alcatel Lucent Sees 'Turning Point' After Deals in U.S. and China<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>BERLIN — Alcatel Lucent, which has struggled in the wake of its 2006 merger, said Thursday that it had reached a “turning point” after clinching $5.7 billion in deals to build high-speed wireless networks and supply other gear for the biggest mobile operators in the United States and China. The company, based in Paris, announced the contracts at the same time it reported its first profitable quarter of the year, posting €25 million, or $35.3 million, in earnings compared to a €182 million loss in the third quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 10.5 percent to €4.1 billion. The results missed forecasts of analysts surveyed by Reuters and Bloomberg News and shares were down more than 3 percent in Paris at midday, however. Ben Verwaayen, the Alcatel Lucent chief executive, described the agreements with Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile operator, and the three biggest mobile carriers in China as “massive” for the company, which had struggled to reorganize and streamline in a weak global market following the merger of the French company Alcatel with Lucent Technologies, which was formerly part of AT&amp;T, the U.S. phone giant. Although the quarterly profit was attributed primarily to tax benefits associated with ongoing adjustments from the merger, Mr. Verwaayen said he did not think it would be “a one-time event.” “I think this is a significant turning point in the transformation of the company,” he said in an interview. “We are experiencing good demand for our products.” Without one-time items, the company reported an operating loss of €11 million for the quarter, compared with a €76 million loss a year earlier. But Jouni Forsman, an analyst at Gartner in Nice, France, said that Alcatel Lucent had repositioned itself to become more competitive in the fastest-growing segments of the wireless equipment industry, where demand for network software upgrades, services and applications is strong among mobile operators. “The company is executing on the turnaround story,” Mr. Forsman said. “They are in a much better position than they were a couple of years ago. They are controlling costs and executing in a difficult market.” The agreement with Verizon Wireless will generate $4 billion in sales over four years, Alcatel Lucent said. Under the pact, Alcatel Lucent will upgrade the operator’s third-generation wireless network and build a faster network based on a technology called Long Term Evolution. LTE networks, which can download wireless data at speeds much more rapidly than existing systems, are helping operators meet the surge in data traffic from streaming video and social networking services. Alcatel Lucent said it planned on Friday to sign agreements worth a total €1.18 billion with China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom during a visit to France by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao. Mr. Verwaayen, the Alcatel Lucent chief executive, said “a large chunk” of the sales to the Chinese carriers was new business, with the rest being a reaffirmation of existing sales arrangements. The Verizon sales, Mr. Verwaayen said, was all new business for his company. Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon and Vodafone, the British global mobile operator, is upgrading its 3G networks to LTE through 2013 as it sells more data-intensive smartphones and other devices. Some analysts expect Verizon later this year to announce that it will become the second U.S. operator to sell the iPhone, which has only been sold by AT&amp;T.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/will-the-verizon-iphone-cripple-verizon/?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Will the Verizon iPhone Cripple Verizon?<date>November 3, 2010, 4:15 pm</date><text>Illustration by Nick Bilton/The New York Times We’ve all heard that adage “be careful what you wish for,” but could this be the case with the highly anticipated Verizon iPhone? People have been waiting for this “dream phone” since the iPhone was introduced in 2007. Now it seems likely to arrive early next year. But what if mobile customers’ dreams come true and this fabled device appears? Could an influx of AT&amp;T refugees and new customers cripple the robust Verizon network? Verizon might not think so. Although the company emphatically declined to comment about the possibility of a Verizon iPhone, Jeffrey Nelson, executive director for corporate communications at Verizon Wireless, said the company’s network was “tried and true.” “Some analysts suggest that we already carry significantly more data on our network than AT&amp;T,” he said, noting that Verizon Wireless has a high number of wireless data cards for laptops on its network. “We built our network for reliability. It is our DNA, it is our brand — anything we do, or don’t do, in the future, will ensure a good customer experience.” “Many people wonder if customers will be disappointed. Time will tell.” — AT&amp;T representative When asked if AT&amp;T worries that customers will leave in droves for the Verizon network, a spokesman said: “We expect when Verizon’s network finally improves on speeds and critical capabilities customers want — like talk and surf — their network will be tested.” “Many people wonder if customers will be disappointed. Time will tell,” he said. Charles Golvin, principal mobile analyst at Forrester Research, doesn’t believe the Verizon network will crumble under the weight of the iPhone. But he said this wasn’t because Verizon had a better infrastructure or service. Instead, he said, it’s a matter of timing. “If Verizon were the first mobile company to carry the iPhone several years ago, they would have suffered the same problems as AT&amp;T,” Mr. Golvin said, adding that no one in the mobile industry knew how customers would use the Apple phone. “Now both companies have learned about the habits of smartphone customers, and Verizon will be ready to allocate their resources accordingly.” AT&amp;T might not see a mass exodus of its customers deserting its network, as some may take a wait-and-see approach, and a number of customers are locked in to long contracts. According to the the company’s latest 10-Q filings, AT&amp;T has 11.1 million active iPhone customers, 5.2 million of whom signed new two-year contracts in the third quarter of this year. Mr. Golvin also pointed out that it might not be AT&amp;T that should worry about mass abandonment, but other wireless carriers like Sprint and T-Mobile. “There will probably be a pretty hefty migration from Sprint and T-Mobile from customers who have not wanted to switch to AT&amp;T in the past due to service problems, but will happily switch to Verizon because it has such good record,” he said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/technology/29fcc.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon Settles Complaint Over Bogus Data Fees<date>Published: October 28, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Verizon Wireless, the nation’s largest mobile phone carrier, will pay $25 million to end an investigation into complaints that it had charged 15 million cellphone customers unauthorized data fees over the last three years, the Federal Communications Commission announced Thursday. Verizon announced this month that it intended to refund money to its customers for the unauthorized charges. Under a consent decree with the F.C.C. announced Thursday, the company also will pay a minimum of $52.8 million in refunds. The $25 million settlement is the largest payment under a consent decree in the F.C.C’s history, said Michele Ellison, chief of the agency’s enforcement bureau. “Today’s settlement requires Verizon Wireless to make meaningful business reforms, prevent future overcharges and provide consumers clear, easy-to-understand information about their choices,” Ms. Ellison said. “I am gratified by the cooperation of the Verizon Wireless team in the face of these issues and pleased they are taking the high road.” In a statement, Verizon said: “We are a company that listens to its customers and in this case we got to the bottom of a problem and resolved the errors. We have taken this action because it is the right thing to do.” The long road to the settlement began in November 2007, when customers first started experiencing and then complaining about mysterious $1.99 charges on their monthly phone bills for data sessions that they had not initiated. The F.C.C. said it started investigating last January after a large number of customer complaints about the charges and after reports in 2009 in The Plain Dealer of Cleveland and The New York Times. The charges affected customers with a “pay as you go” plan for data or Internet access. Verizon said the “vast majority” of the erroneous charges were incurred when software that was preloaded on some phones automatically contacted Verizon’s data service in what the company called an “acknowledgment” session. Verizon said that in September 2009 it put in place a feature to limit those inadvertent charges. In addition, the company said it had sometimes accidentally charged customers for access to Web sites through links that were not supposed to lead to data charges. Many customers complained that if they had accidentally hit a wrong button on their flip phones, they would be connected to the Internet and charged a $1.99 fee. The F.C.C. required and Verizon agreed to take steps to prevent such charges in the future. The company said those steps included software changes to remove automatic acknowledgments between Verizon data centers and phones, and new internal controls that would prevent charges when customers accessed free Web site links. In addition, the company will put in place a data charge task force to monitor and resolve complaints. The task force must report regularly to the F.C.C. The F.C.C. and Verizon also agreed that the company would initiate customer service improvements, including clearer explanations of its pay-as-you-go data charges and ways for customers to avoid extra charges; an online video tutorial to help consumers understand their bills; and additional training for Verizon customer representatives on pay-as-you-go plans. Verizon has begun notifying customers eligible for refunds, and it will apply credits or, in the case of former customers, mail checks for the refund amounts in October and November. Most of the credits range from $2 to $6, Verizon said. About 77 million of its customers, or roughly five out of six, are unaffected, the company said. Customers who do not receive a refund but believe they had unauthorized data charges can appeal and receive a resolution within 30 days, the F.C.C. said. Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said the settlement “will serve as a significant deterrent to others in the future.” Mr. Genachowski added: “Today’s consent decree sends a clear message to American consumers — the F.C.C. has got your back. People shouldn’t find mystery fees when they open their phone bills, and they certainly shouldn’t have to pay for services they didn’t want and didn’t use. In these rough economic times, every $1.99 counts.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7DB1339F936A15753C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">BITS; Unlimited Data As Selling Point<date>Published: October 25, 2010</date><text>While Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, and Andy Rubin, the vice president of engineering at Google, fire pot shots at one another over their rival cellphone platforms, the wireless carriers are engaging in their own snipefest behind the scenes. Several media outlets, including Engadget, a technology blog, are reporting that Verizon Wireless is preparing to introduce tiered data plans for its smartphone subscribers. It's similar to the one AT&amp;Tintroduced in June to choke the heaviest guzzlers of the network's capacity. But while AT&amp;T eliminated the phone plan that allowed subscribers to pay a flat fee for unlimited data usage, Verizon, the reports say, will leave that option intact for consumers. The company will simply also introduce the option to pay $15 a month for 150 megabytes of data. Customers who exceed that amount will be charged an additional fee. The news -- even though it has yet to be confirmed by Verzion Wireless -- prompted AT&amp;T to release a statement. ''We can't comment on our competitors' prices, but we announced our new smartphone data plans months ago,'' said Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&amp;T. ''They give our customers a great value. For $15 a month you get 200MB of data. For $25, you get 2 Gigs, which is more than 98 percent of our customers use, on average.'' For the last year, rumors have been swirling that Verizon will soon announce an iPhone on its network. In addition, the news that Verizon would begin selling the iPad in its stores is a signal that relations between Apple and Verizon has warmed enough to garner a mobile partnership. Is AT&amp;T worried about the coming competition? If so, is the option of an unlimited data plan enough to lure away AT&amp;T customers? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/technology/23verizon.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Verizon’s Profit Drops 25% in Quarter as Growth Slows<date>Published: October 22, 2010</date><text>Despite a strong lineup of smartphones powered by Google’s operating system, Verizon Communications on Friday reported a 25 percent drop in profit and a slowing growth of new customers in the third quarter. The company cited pension settlements resulting from layoffs and voluntary departures as the main reason for the smaller profit. Net income dipped to $881 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or 41 cents a share, reported a year ago. Excluding the pension-related charges and acquisitions, including the sale of four million phone lines to Frontier Communications, Verizon’s earnings were 56 cents a share — beating the expectations of Wall Street analysts by 2 cents. Verizon Wireless also struggled to appeal to new customers in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, adding fewer than its main competitor, AT&amp;T, which is still luring subscribers to its service with the iPhone. Verizon reported a net addition of 584,000 contract customers in the quarter, while AT&amp;T added 745,000. Still, Verizon managed to hold on to its place as the nation’s largest wireless carrier, if only by a fraction. Its total subscriber pool increased by nearly 5 percent, to 93.2 million wireless customers. By comparison, AT&amp;T now has 92.8 million consumers. Verizon, based in New York, has suffered from the impact of a steadily declining landline business, the result of more people giving up home phones in favor of cellphones. John F. Killian, Verizon’s chief financial officer, said there was “tremendous opportunity” in the number of customers purchasing smartphones and the lucrative data plans that accompanied them. More than 40 percent of the company’s device sales are now attributed to smartphones, he said. “We’re performing very well in this very competitive marketplace,” he said in a call with investors and analysts. Mr. Killian said Verizon’s portfolio of smartphones, including several that use Google’s Android operating system, were helping to spur sales. “The Droid franchise has gone from nothing a year ago to having a lot of buzz and momentum in the marketplace now,” he said. Mr. Killian also said he expected earnings in the final quarter of the year to improve by 5 to 10 percent. He did not discuss reports that the iPhone was coming to Verizon’s network. But he said he expected the company to gain a competitive edge against rivals with the introduction of its next-generation wireless network, LTE, which will improve the speed of data-heavy functions like video streaming.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/technology/15ipad.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Apple Says Verizon Wireless Will Sell iPads<date>Published: October 14, 2010</date><text>Apple said Thursday that Verizon Wireless would begin selling the iPad at its stores on Oct. 28. The announcement is the latest sign that the relationship between Apple and Verizon is warming up. Verizon is expected to begin selling Apple’s iPhone early next year.

Instead, it will sell bundles that include the iPad’s Wi-Fi models and its own mobile hot spot device, which essentially allows users to connect to the Internet in any place that has 3G service. The bundles will cost $630 for a 16-gigabyte model, $730 for a 32-gigabyte model and $830 for 64 gigabytes. Verizon will offer a monthly $20 plan to customers for up to 1 gigabyte of data.

We find the prospect of a non-AT&amp;T iPhone tantalizing. Could it mean that wireless service providers will finally have to accept real competition? It looked as if that might happen seven years ago when the Federal Communications Commission said that consumers could switch providers and keep their cellphone numbers. The sense of liberation didn’t last. Cellphone companies had too many other ways to lock in customers. Those include hundreds of dollars in fees for early contract termination, which the networks say are meant to recover their subsidy of pricey handsets. Then there are those exclusive deals to ensure the coolest devices can be used only on their networks. According to the F.C.C., about half the smartphones unveiled in 2008 and 2009 by the four big wireless companies came to market under exclusive contracts with one or another of them. This week, AT&amp;T introduced several smartphones based on Windows Phone 7 mobile operating system — on an exclusive basis. Verizon and AT&amp;T already have 60 percent of the American market and continue to gain share despite being generally more expensive than rivals T-Mobile and Sprint. One of the biggest drivers of wireless competition today is Google’s Android operating system. Google decided to provide it to all phone makers for use on any network. Today, Android phones are outselling iPhones. That could be why — if the reports are true — Apple decided to end its exclusive deal with AT&amp;T. We hope that the next announcement will be that Apple will offer iPhones not only for use on Verizon but also on T-Mobile, Sprint and, indeed, any wireless provider. That could be the real start of liberation.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/technology/09phone.html?ref=verizoncommunicationsinc">Apple to Offer iPhone on Verizon, Ending Exclusivity with AT&amp;T<date>Published: October 8, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Facing intense competition from phone makers wedded to Google’s Android software, Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, finally plans to make the iPhone available on Verizon Wireless, the largest wireless carrier in the United States. After more than three years of using only AT&amp;T cellphone networks, Apple is now making a version of the iPhone 4 for Verizon’s network, according to a person who is in direct contact with Apple. Apple and Verizon will begin selling the phone early next year, said the person, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because the plans were supposed to be confidential and he did not want to alienate his contacts at Apple. Apple and Verizon Wireless declined to comment. The arrival of the iPhone on Verizon, which has long been expected and frequently rumored, could sharply alter the dynamics of the smartphone market in the United States. The iPhone remains the best-selling smartphone. But around the world, many carriers, especially those that do not have access to the iPhone, have been promoting an array of handset models running on Google’s Android software. Collectively, those phones now outsell the iPhone. This week, Nielsen reported that Android accounted for 32 percent of the new smartphones sold in the United States in last six months. By comparison, the iPhone accounted for 25 percent. The numbers confirm those of other research organizations. The Android’s rapid ascent threatens to blunt Apple’s lead in the market for high-end smartphones. No other Apple product brings as much revenue for the company as the iPhone, and analysts say that seeing that lucrative market imperiled may have finally pushed Apple into ending its exclusivity with AT&amp;T. “Android has tremendous momentum,” said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Mr. Sacconaghi said that the growth of Android was in large part because the iPhone was not available on Verizon and some major carriers overseas. “Apple moving to sign up these carriers is very important to help mitigate Android momentum,” he said. A Verizon iPhone could quickly tilt the marketplace back in Apple’s favor. For all its success, the iPhone on AT&amp;T has been plagued by complaints of poor network coverage, especially in some major cities like New York and San Francisco. Many potential customers have chosen to buy Android handsets from other carriers to avoid problems with dropped calls and dead zones. But many surveys show that many owners of Android handsets would buy an iPhone, if it were available on Verizon. At the same time, AT&amp;T iPhone customers may switch to Verizon as their contracts expire, even though they would have to buy a new phone to do so. Apple’s AT&amp;T phone, which uses G.S.M. networking technology, would not work on Verizon’s network, which uses a different networking technology called C.D.M.A. “It is going to have a fairly disruptive impact when it lands,” said Charles Wolf, an analyst with Needham &amp; Company. Another factor that could be pushing Apple to end its AT&amp;T exclusivity is the impending arrival of phones running Microsoft’s new Windows Phone 7 software. The two companies are making a joint announcement about its phones Monday. Early reviews of the devices have been positive, and Microsoft, which has faltered repeatedly in the phone business, plans to spend heavily to market the new handsets. “Windows phones should not be dismissed,” Mr. Wolf said. “They will be a major player in the market.” While the arrival of the iPhone on Verizon had long been expected, some industry insiders doubted that Apple would bring the iPhone to Verizon before the carrier deployed its next-generation network, known as L.T.E., or Long-Term Evolution. But in an interview this week, Tony Melone, the chief technology officer of Verizon Wireless, suggested that those doubters could be wrong. Mr. Melone did not comment on the iPhone, but he said that while Verizon would begin introducing its new network in 38 American cities by the end of the year, the company’s older 3G network would continue to grow for several years. He also said that Verizon would continue “selling 3G devices well into the decade, possibly through the end of the decade.” However, while L.T.E. phones will be backward-compatible so they can run on Verizon’s older 3G network, those 3G phones won’t run on the new, faster L.T.E. network. The arrival of the iPhone to Verizon could further increase Apple’s bottom line, with some analysts predicting the company could sell an additional 10 million devices per year. But analysts say that investors have long expected Apple and Verizon to come to terms eventually, and Apple’s stock price already reflects that. Indeed, over the last year, a flurry of reports have predicted a Verizon iPhone was imminent. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the iPhone would be available on Verizon early next year.</text></article></page></root>
