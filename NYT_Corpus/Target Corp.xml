Next Stop: eBay.<date>Published: October 12, 2011</date><text>IT’S been a month since Target released its Missoni for Target line and scrums of shoppers cleared the discount retailer’s shelves and crashed its Web site. But as with some earlier limited-edition “masstige” collections, the frenzy has continued in the secondary market, with sold-out items going for breathtakingly inflated prices on eBay and Craigslist and in consignment shops.“It’s been pure craziness trying to keep up with the orders,” said Susan Mayorga, 47, an eBay seller in Shadow Hills, Calif., better known as Deals818. She was lucky to score a cartful of Missoni for Target dresses and jumpers at an undertrafficked store in her area and has been reselling them for $100 to $200 more than retail price. “Then I look at what other sellers are getting and I kick myself that I’m not asking for more,” she said. One optimistic eBay seller is asking $31,000 for a pair of Missoni for Target rain boots that originally cost $34.99, saying she needs the money for her daughter’s college tuition. But completed transactions over the last month reveal markups more realistically in the 25 percent to 400 percent range. The highest paid price on eBay for the coveted Missoni for Target multicolored bicycle, retail value $399.99, was $1,279.95. “It’s the limited availability that’s the secret” to the steep resale prices, said Linda Lightman of Horsham, Pa., owner of Linda’s Stuff, an eBay store specializing in women’s designer clothing. “It keeps up the demand, whereas discount diffusion lines that are ongoing like Vera Wang at Kohl’s aren’t great sellers for us.” Top designers have been creating masstige lines, also known as diffusion and bridge brands, for decades. But since Karl Lagerfeld created his one-off line for H &amp; M in 2004, exclusive and short-lived collaborations between top designers and discount stores have become fashion events breathlessly anticipated and promoted on social media. The countdown has already begun for the Jason Wu for Target collection, which will be in stores in February. And while certain collectors may sniff, many of these limited-edition lines, because of their calculated sense of urgency, have not only prompted stampedes despite the struggling economy but have also held or exceeded their original value even years after their introduction. In August, Ms. Lightman sold a limited edition Mulberry for Target handbag for $219 (it cost $49 during the six weeks it was available in stores last year). “The opening bid on eBay was $29, so the sale price really tells you what the market will bear,” she said. “Many of my customers are in Europe or Asia where they don’t have Target stores.” By contrast, costlier diffusion lines that are always available in department stores from Hackensack, N.J., to Hanoi — like DKNY (Donna Karan), CK (Calvin Klein) and Marc by Marc Jacobs — usually resell for 30 to 75 percent less than the original price depending on the age and condition of the garment, Ms. Lightman said. And some initially splashy collaborations, like Isaac Mizrahi and Target, lasted so long that the market seems to be saturated; indeed, some eBay listings for Mizrahi items take care to specify “not Target.” (Good luck finding any of the designs he oversaw during his brief tenure at Liz Claiborne.) That’s not to say all limited-edition lines fetch high prices at resale. The collections that Matthew Williamson created for H &amp; M in 2009, Erin Fetherston designed for Target in 2007 and Tara Jarmon designed for Target in 2006 don’t create much excitement at resale, with items usually selling at prices comparable with nondesigner used clothing. But lines by more widely known and recognizable designers (like Liberty of London for Target with its easily identifiable floral prints, and Missoni for Target with its distinctive zigzag patterns) tend to sell for significantly more than they cost when available in stores. 1 2 Next Page »IT’S been a month since Target released its Missoni for Target line and scrums of shoppers cleared the discount retailer’s shelves and crashed its Web site.

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/business/demand-at-target-for-fashion-line-crashes-web-site.html?ref=targetcorporation">Demand at Target For Fashion Line Crashes Web Site<date>Published: September 13, 2011</date><text>Target’s Web site came crashing down on Tuesday as Missoni-loving fashion devotées invaded, scrambling to buy the high-end Italian designer’s clothes for a song.With its limited-edition Missoni for Target line, introduced on Tuesday, and other low-price designer collections, Target has been trying to position itself as the chicest of the discount stores. Missoni’s clothing usually costs in the hundreds or thousands of dollars, but it had designed a number of cheaper items for Target, like a $40 skirt in its signature zigzag design and a $600 patio set. However, the limited-edition fashions were more limited than Target might have wanted. In an unusual fumble for the large retailer, Target was unprepared for online shoppers’ hunger for the items. The Target.com site was wiped out for most of the day; the company said that demand for items was higher than it was on a typical day after Thanksgiving, and that is usually the biggest shopping day of the year. “The excitement for this limited-time designer collection is unprecedented,” said Morgan O’Murray, a spokeswoman for Target, in an e-mail. Target’s Web site was working properly again at about 11 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday. But on Twitter and other social media sites, thwarted shoppers posted furious messages and commiserated about the site’s failure, with a few bragging that they had made it through in the brief periods that Target.com was working. Marketing experts said the blunder was amateurish, although they said it should not have any lasting effect on Target’s reputation. “It’s a little bit embarrassing for one of the nation’s largest retailers to have a Web site that can’t support a rush — it’s not like they’re any strangers to rushes,” said Ian Schafer, chief executive of the digital marketing firm Deep Focus. “It’s saying, ‘We’re so popular we had to turn people away at the door.’ Then get a bigger place.” The problems came just three weeks after Target, which had been relying on Amazon’s back end for its Web site, switched to its own platform. But Ms. O’Murray said the crashing of the site was caused solely by demand for the products. The Missoni line was the latest in a series of low-price designer collections for Target. Past collaborators have included Calypso St. Barth, Liberty of London, Rodarte and Zac Posen. All the collections have been available both online and in stores, said a Target spokesman, Joshua Thomas, and many items from the collections have sold out quickly. In the Missoni case, he said, the magnitude and immediacy of the demand was unprecedented.  The collaborations tend to bring in regular Target shoppers who are eager for a piece of glamour at a fraction of the price, along with fashion fans who like the novelty of wearing a cheap-chic piece made by a favored designer. The Missoni pieces at Target are mostly under $40, for instance, while Missoni items at Bergdorf Goodman cost up to $12,000. Target drummed up heavy publicity for the Missoni line before Tuesday, releasing photos of the products to fashion bloggers, holding a party with celebrities and fashion editors, and setting up a pop-up shop last week in New York City, where the merchandise sold out in six hours. Even Vogue gave the collection several pages of coverage in its August issue, perhaps the first and last time that a $30 rug made it into that magazine. By last week, the excitement was so high that the actresses Jessica Alba and Jessica Simpson, both of whom can no doubt afford full-price Missoni, were talking on Twitter about the line. “I dreamt about the Missoni 4 Target bike last night,” Ms. Alba posted, referring to a $400 bike covered with zigzags. “I want that bike too!!! So cute!” Ms. Simpson responded. On Tuesday, Target made the Missoni products available online at 6 a.m. By 7:47 a.m., the home page was down, with a “connection timeout” error, according to AlertSite, a company that monitors Web performance. By 8 a.m., Target had put up a courtesy page that said the site problems were being worked on. Other than a few minutes here and there, the problems continued through late afternoon. By then, Target had put people in sort of a queue, automatically refreshing the page so those who were patient could reach the site. Even when shoppers did get through, many complained that items were disappearing from their baskets or that they were not able to check out. Alex Gagne, 23, a marketing executive in Mission Viejo, Calif., said she had stopped at her Target store in the early morning to buy some Missoni vases and shoes and spent much of the rest of the morning trying to get on the site. “That was a nightmare,” she said. When she finally got onto the site, “at one point I was entering payment information, and it was gone.” “Their site was absolutely, 100 percent not prepared for it,” she said. While Target recently stopped using Amazon’s e-commerce platform to make its Web site work, analysts said Tuesday’s problems were probably caused more by unexpected demand for the Missoni products. “It’s hard to attribute the site being down to the Amazon separation, although Amazon Web Services offers elastic computing power that would have helped with this surge in demand,” said Matthew Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities who covers e-commerce, in an e-mail. Target’s physical stores had long lines on Tuesday, and many sold out of their Missoni assortments in minutes. But it was the Web site’s problems that drew continued ire from shoppers. The actress Mindy Kaling posted on Twitter that “@target broke my heart today when I could not access their site once in 9 hours for Missoni.” Another shopper posted: “Seriously so mad at @TargetStyle. Why did you not prepare for the Missoni for Target line?” There were other ways to get the merchandise. Racked, a shopping blog, advised readers to call Target’s toll-free number to order items by phone. Some posters on Twitter suggested using the mobile site. And by 5 p.m., after the products had been available for only 11 hours, eBay was listing 6,600 items for Missoni by Target.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/targets-new-missoni-collection-brings-down-site/?ref=targetcorporation">Target's New Missoni Collection Brings Down Site<date>September 13, 2011, 11:33 am</date><text>Demand for Target’s Missoni collection, on sale Tuesday, overwhelmed the site and led to a shutdown for two hours. 2:31 p.m. | Updated to reflect that as of 2:30 p.m., the site was still down. Sometimes, a store can create too much buzz. Target started selling a capsule collection from Missoni, the Italian brand known for its zigzag knits and bright patterns, Tuesday morning. Priced at a fraction of what Missoni usually costs, the line had created enormous interest among fashion editors and regular Target shoppers alike. And it brought down all of Target.com. The Missoni items became available around 6 a.m. Tuesday. Target.com went down around 9 a.m. and stayed down until approximately 11 a.m., but even then, it has worked for only minutes at a time during the day. At 2:30 p.m. it was still down. “Due to an overwhelming amount of traffic to Target.com as a result of the Missoni launch this morning, guests are unable to access the site,” Target said in a statement. “Providing a positive shopping experience to our guests is important to us and we are working to get the site back up as soon as possible. We apologize for the inconvenience.” Twitterers were furious. Some reported they had finally gotten onto the site, only to have the error page load when they got to checkout. Shopping sites were offering workarounds, including loading Target’s mobile site, which, too, was crashing intermittently, or just calling its toll-free number. Target also took to Twitter to offer apologies, but its last message was at roughly 11:30 a.m. Target has done a number of collaborations with expensive designers, including Calypso St. Barth and Jean-Paul Gaultier, selling lower-priced designs by them in cheaper fabrics. The Missoni for Target line includes accessories like flats and barrettes, clothes, and a $599.99 patio set in the signature zigzag pattern. The Missoni line seems to have created outsized demand. When Target set up a pop-up shop in New York City last week with the Missoni items, the clothes and accessories sold out in a night. At a shopping preview last week for fashion editors, the shelves were in “mid-ravage” condition moments after editors were let inside, reported shopping site Racked NY.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/business/at-colleges-the-marketers-are-everywhere.html?ref=targetcorporation">At Colleges, the Marketers Are Everywhere<date>Published: September 10, 2011</date><text>CHAPEL HILL, N.C.IT’S move-in day here at the University of North Carolina, and Leila Ismail, stuffed animals in tow, is feeling some freshman angst. A few friendly upperclassmen spring into action. But wait: there is something odd, or at least oddly corporate, about this welcome wagon. These U.N.C. students are all wearing identical T-shirts from American Eagle Outfitters. Turns out three of them are working for that youth clothing chain on this late August morning, as what are known in the trade as “brand ambassadors” or “campus evangelists” — and they have recruited several dozen friends as a volunteer move-in crew. Even before Ms. Ismail can find her dorm or meet her roommate, they cheerily unload her family’s car. Then they lug her belongings to her dorm. Along the way, they dole out American Eagle coupons, American Eagle water canisters and American Eagle pens. Ms. Ismail, 18, of Charlotte, welcomes the help. “I’ll probably always remember it,” she says. American Eagle Outfitters certainly hopes so, as do a growing number of companies that are hiring college students to represent brands on campuses across the nation. This fall, an estimated 10,000 American college students will be working on hundreds of campuses — for cash, swag, job experience or all three — marketing everything from Red Bull to Hewlett-Packard PCs. For the companies hiring them, the motivation is clear: college students spent about $36 billion on things like clothing, computers and cellphones during the 2010-11 school year alone, according to projections from Re:Fuel, a media and promotions firm specializing in the youth market. And who knows the students at, say, U.N.C., better than the students at U.N.C.? Corporations have been pitching college students for decades on products from cars to credit cards. But what is happening on campuses today is without rival, in terms of commercializing everyday college life. Companies from Microsoft on down are increasingly seeking out the big men and women on campus to influence their peers. The students most in demand are those who are popular — ones involved in athletics, music, fraternities or sororities. Thousands of Facebook friends help, too. What companies want are students with inside knowledge of school traditions and campus hotspots. In short, they want students with the cred to make brands seem cool, in ways that a TV or magazine ad never could. “We are the people who understand what kinds of things the students will be open to,” says Alex Stegall, a Carolina junior who recruited about 20 members of her sorority for the American Eagle promotion. “It’s marketing for the students, by the students.” It’s a good deal for the student marketers, who can earn several hundred to several thousand dollars a semester in salary, perks, products and services, depending on the company. But the trend poses challenges for university officials, especially at a time when many schools are themselves embracing corporate sponsorships to help stage events for students. Just how far one big company — Target — has permeated this university was evident at freshmen welcome week in late August, at what students and administrators alike characterized as a touchstone party for the class of 2015. As part of the official university program, Target sponsored a welcome dinner on a Friday. Then, on Saturday, for the first real social event for freshmen, it hired buses to ferry students to a Target superstore in Durham for late-night shopping, says Winston B. Crisp, the university’s vice chancellor for student affairs. From the school’s point of view, Mr. Crisp says, the excursion is both social and practical. It’s a convenient way for freshmen to pick up last-minute items. Equally important, he says, is that shopping at midnight keeps freshmen away from alcohol-fueled parties on their first weekend. University administrators supervise the event, he says, and control the marketing messages. But Mr. Crisp says he was unaware of the American Eagle effort on his campus. He worried aloud that students and parents might mistake such promotions as having the university’s imprimatur. “They are not supposed to be using the opportunity to help people move in as a way of forwarding commercial ventures,” he said, standing near the cash registers at Target that evening, as upperclassmen handed out free VitaminWater, Combos and packages of macaroni and cheese. He added: “So it’s a bit of a dilemma.” 1 2 3 4 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/business/target-and-other-retailers-report-higher-earnings.html?ref=targetcorporation">Target and Other Retailers Report Higher Earnings<date>Published: August 17, 2011</date><text>The Target Corporation reported a bigger-than-expected increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday and forecast a more profitable year than analysts had been anticipating, as its credit card business continued to grow and sales heated up with the summer weather.Retail results were highlighting a split between middle- and upper-income shoppers, who might be waiting a bit before they buy, versus the unemployed and low-income workers struggling to make ends meet. “While optimism at all income levels has improved since the recession, wealthy households continue to be the most optimistic,” Kathryn Tesija, Target’s executive vice president for merchandising, said during a conference call. “The 20 percent of households with the highest incomes are shopping more often and spending more, while the other 80 percent have been cutting trips and spending less,” Ms. Tesija said about retailers’ experience in general. Target’s shoppers are buying closer to when they need things, so the company said it was a bit too early to fully judge August sales, which include back-to-school purchases. August sales have been within Target’s forecast for an increase of about 5 percent, though slightly below the increases in June and July, the chief financial officer, Douglas Scovanner said. Target’s same-store sales rose 4.5 percent in June, 4.1 percent in July and 3.9 percent in the second quarter. Target was not the only retailer reporting better-than-expected results. Wal-Mart Stores said Tuesday that its profit rose more than expected. On Wednesday, retailers such as BJ’s Wholesale Club and the office-supply store Staples also reported results that surpassed expectations. Staples’ chief executive, Ronald L. Sargent, said he did not see a double-dip recession in the nation’s economy, though the country is “probably more likely to stay in economic purgatory for a while longer.” Stock in Staples, which is based in Framingham, Mass., was flat, as was BJ’s Wholesale, which is based in Westborough, Mass. The Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company’s quarter was also better than anticipated, but it warned of troubles as it enters “a period of greater uncertainty,” and its shares tumbled. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, based in New Albany, Ohio, fell $6.15, to $64.87. Target’s move to add groceries to more stores has raised sales but pressured profitability because food carries lower margins than merchandise like apparel. Still, the second-quarter gross margin decline was not too steep. Gross margin dipped to 31.6 percent from 32 percent. Target earned $704 million, or $1.03 a share, up from $679 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected Target to earn 97 cents a share. Sales in the period, which ended July 30 and was the second quarter of Target’s fiscal year, increased 5.1 percent to $15.9 billion. Stock in Target, which is based in Minneapolis, rose $1.18, to $50.55 a share.</text></article>

Those vignettes are the inspiration for a new ad campaign highlighting the latest high fashion brand to market its line for a limited run at Target.Missoni, long famous for its family heritage and bold, graphic knits, is the latest brand to join with the retail giant to promote a line of more than 400 products including clothing for men, women and children; home accessories; footwear; and even luggage. Prices for the products range from about $3 to $600, but most will be under $40. “In the ’50s and ’60s, the Missoni brand really developed a voice that transported it out of Italy and into the United States,” said Will Setliff, the vice president for marketing at Target, “and that is what the aesthetic is inspired by in the campaign.” Representatives from Target traveled to Milan to collaborate with the Missoni family, including Angela Missoni, the daughter of the company’s founders, Ottavio and Rosita Missoni, and her daughter, Margherita Maccapani Missoni, who is the face of the campaign and stars in the print and video ads. “It’s certainly been one of the most collaborative partnerships we’ve had with any of our designers,” Mr. Setliff said. “We really wanted to reach a large audience,” Angela Missoni said. “As Missoni, we have a big name but we are not a huge company, so there’s not much product around.” The goal of the campaign and product line was to expand the Missoni image in the United States and to promote the brand as being young and fresh.  Some Americans may be confused about how to mix and match the brand’s bold colors — bright hues of green, blue, fuchsia and orange — and patterns, including the company’s trademark jagged lines, against other prints. So the campaign includes video for the Web, television and mobile phones starring. Ms. Maccapani Missoni, giving customers tips on how to incorporate prints and color into their lives. “If you don’t feel comfortable, it’s going to show,” she says in the video. Online viewers will find a selection of items called “Margherita’s Must Haves.” As they click through the products they like, they will see recommendations on how to combine those items with others. The Missoni for Target collection will be in Target stores from Sept. 13 through Oct. 22. Other elements of the campaign include ads for television and the Web that feature soundtracks reminiscent of the 1960s. In the ads, directed by Alex Prager, Ms. Maccapani Missoni is carrying a postcard with a secret message that is revealed after she is seen talking on a rotary telephone, having cappuccinos at a cafe with a friend and walking into a dining room decorated with Missoni products. (The secret message is “Missoni for Target.”) Ms. Maccapani Missoni will also be featured in some of the print ads. “Family is as important to us as zigzags and colors,” she said of her role in the campaign. “It makes sense that someone within the family will be the face of the brand.” Those who watch the video online will be able to buy directly by clicking on items that are highlighted. When a viewer clicks on a product, a pop-up window will appear with more details. The viewer can then add the item to an online shopping cart at Target.com without leaving the video. Target worked with the advertising agency Olson on the “shoppable” video, which Dennis Ryan, the agency’s chief creative officer, described as “a new way to understand the Missoni look.” The interactive videos offer an experience that Mr. Ryan described as “far less disruptive — you just follow your bliss.” The agency also produced other digital ads and a mobile Web site where users will be able to watch the video ads and download their favorite Missoni for Target prints to use as wallpaper on their phones’ home screens.  Print ads will run in magazines including Elle, Elle Décor, Harper’s Bazaar, House Beautiful and Interview. Target will also run a 20-page insert in the September issue of Vogue. For the first time, Target ads will also run in a foreign publication, Vogue Italia. Target will participate in events like Fashion’s Night Out during Fashion Week in New York and will open a pop-up store near Bryant Park, featuring items from the collection. Target declined to say how much it spent on advertising the Missoni collaboration, but according to Kantar Media, part of WPP, the company spent $640 million on advertising in 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, the company spent $107 million. Jeffrey Buchman, a professor of advertising and marketing communications at the Fashion Institute of Technology, said that in order to reach new consumers, brands are taking advantage of the reach that mass retailers like Target can offer, while retailers are enjoying the bump in cachet of carrying limited editions of brand name products. “It’s become O.K. for the ‘Vogue customer’ to shop at Target, to brag about the fact that they saved money,” Mr. Buchman said. Retailers are also hoping that a customer who is lured to a store for one item ends up leaving with more. “The retailer wants to cross-sell,” he said; in Target’s case, to “the person who comes in for a Missoni sweater and ends up walking out with six shopping bags full of other Missoni stuff.”</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/business/18target.html?ref=targetcorporation">Workers Reject Union at Target Store<date>Published: June 18, 2011</date><text>The nation’s main union for retail workers lost a unionization vote on Friday at a Target store in Valley Stream, N.Y., in what was an effort to make it the first of Target’s 1,750 stores in the United States to be unionized.A spokeswoman for Target said early Saturday morning that 137 workers had voted against joining the union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, while 85 workers voted for it. In a statement, the union’s president, Bruce W. Both, said that the workers at the Valley Stream store endured a “campaign of threats, intimidation and illegal acts by Target management,” and that the union would contest the results. “Target did everything they could to deny these workers a chance at the American dream,” he said. “However, the workers’ pursuit of a better life and the ability to house and feed their families is proving more powerful. These workers are not backing down from this fight. They are demanding another election. They are demanding a fair election. They are demanding justice and they are prepared to fight for it.”  In the days before the vote, union officials said a victory would be a coup that would create momentum for organizing drives at retail stores not just in New York, but in other states. Target executives repeatedly told the store’s 250 hourly employees that no union was needed and that the union would make work rules more rigid and make it harder for Target to compete. During the organizing drive, pro-union workers said the main issues included low wages and work assignments that often totaled just 10 or 20 hours a week — not enough, they said, to support themselves or their children. In meetings and fliers, Target officials told employees that a union could not guarantee better pay or benefits and only wanted their dues. In a move that worried numerous workers, the company said there were no guarantees that the store would remain open if the workers unionized. The union filed a complaint with the labor board last month asserting that Target had unlawfully prohibited employees from wearing pro-union buttons and from discussing working conditions on online sites. It also said Target had unlawfully threatened employees with dismissal if they spoke about the union and had threatened to close the store if it unionized. Target officials said that they carefully complied with labor laws during their campaign against the union. Anahad OâConnor contributed reporting.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/business/economy/24target.html?ref=targetcorporation">Union Effort Turns Its Focus to Target<date>Published: May 23, 2011</date><text>In the world of big-box discounters, Target enjoys a reputation as a model corporate citizen that sells the latest in cheap chic. That’s a sharp contrast to the image of Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, which labor unions have pilloried for years, accusing it of providing skimpy wages and benefits and skirting various labor laws.But the arrows are about to come flying at Target’s famous bull’s-eye logo. The nation’s largest union for retail workers has embarked on its first broad campaign to unionize Target workers. The union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, is trying to organize 5,000 workers at 27 Target stores in the New York City area. A majority of workers at the Target store in Valley Stream, N.Y., have already signed cards supporting unionization, and a government-supervised election there on June 17 will be the first time in more than two decades that Target workers will vote on whether to join a union. “A lot of people are going to be shocked that Target workers would consider unionizing because of its very good image and because it’s known as such a fantastic philanthropic organization,” said Burt Flickinger, a retailing consultant who has worked on projects for both the union and Target suppliers. The union decided to focus on Target after employees in Valley Stream, on Long Island, asked for help in unionizing. Echoing longstanding complaints by some Wal-Mart workers, the store’s employees complained that many of them earned too little to support a family or afford health insurance, forcing some to rely on food stamps and Medicaid for their children. “What we want from Target is simply this: we need a living wage where we can get by,” said Sonia Williams, a logistics employee in Valley Stream who said she earns $11.71 an hour, plus a $1-an-hour night differential. Target says its wages are competitive and its employees do not need a union. Interviews with 10 of the store’s employees suggest that an important issue behind the unionization drive is frustration about being assigned too few hours of work, sometimes just one or two days a week. Retailers are increasingly assigning such short workweeks as they seek to build an extensive roster of workers to fill their ever-changing scheduling needs. But some Target workers say that means they are offered too few hours to qualify for the company’s health plan. Ms. Williams, who receives $200 a month in food stamps to help her and her 18-year-old son, complained that she was often assigned just three days of work each week, down from full time when she started nearly nine years ago. So far, the union’s organizing efforts have not turned belligerent as it hopes to convince Target employees that it wants to work with the company, not hurt it. In contrast, the union has never been shy about attacking Wal-Mart — hurling invective, organizing protests and lobbying officials to block the retailer’s plans to expand in New York, Chicago and other cities unless it agrees to improve wages and benefits. Union officials assert that Target’s wages and benefits are only slightly better than Wal-Mart’s. Jim Rowader, Target’s vice president for employee and labor relations, said the company provided “great benefits, flexible scheduling and great career opportunities for workers in all stages of life.” He said Target emphasized building trust between managers and employees. “When you talk about bringing a union into that mix, certainly based on the culture we have and the one we’re trying to build, we don’t think a union or any third party will improve on anything,” he said. None of Target’s 1,755 stores in the United States are unionized, nor are any of Wal-Mart’s 4,420 American stores. The union has tried over the last decade to unionize Wal-Marts in Minnesota and Las Vegas and a Target in Minnesota, but fierce antiunion campaigns by the retailers deflated the efforts before they even came to a vote. Mr. Flickinger said unions had been loath to undertake large-scale organizing drives against retailers, like the new one against Target in New York, because of obstacles like high employee turnover, the fear of some workers that they would be fired for supporting a union and the aggressive opposition by many companies toward unionization. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

The results suggest discretionary spending, and therefore retailers’ margins, may remain under pressure this year.Investors were most concerned about Target’s prospects, as its shoppers continued to buy food and other basics and shunned less essential items. The economic recovery will continue to be slow and uneven, particularly for more moderate-income households, Gregg W. Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said during a conference call. Target also said it planned to close on some Canadian leases earlier than expected, leading to higher costs this year. In January, Target announced plans to buy leases on up to 220 Zellers discount stores from Hudson’s Bay Company, and is set to open its first Canadian stores in 2013. Getting some leases earlier than expected will push more of the costs associated with its plans into the current fiscal year. At Target, more shoppers have signed up for the chain’s credit and debit cards, which offer a 5 percent discount. While that leads people to shop more often, they are using those cards to buy basics like food, which carry lower margins than clothing and other items. Target’s earnings were 5 cents a share above Wall Street’s expectations, but some of the gains came from soaring profitability in its credit card business. Target’s profit rose 2.7 percent, to $689 million, or 99 cents a share, in the first quarter ended April 30. Earnings in the credit card business jumped nearly 75 percent, to $194 million. Sales increased 2.8 percent, to $15.58 billion. Selling more fresh produce and signing up more shoppers for its credit cards have reduced gross margin, which slipped to 30.4 percent from 31.3 percent in the quarter. Target also said prices of apparel and home goods could rise in double-digit percentages this fall as costs increase. Target’s results came two days after the hedge fund manager William Ackman, who had unsuccessfully pushed for changes at the chain, disclosed that he had sold his shares in the company. At BJ’s Wholesale Club, shoppers traded down in both brands and package sizes, Robert W. Eddy, its chief financial officer, said during a conference call. BJ’s posted a bigger-than-expected rise in profit and raised its annual earnings forecast as people shopped its stores more often for food and gasoline. BJ’s sold more food, but sales of items like apparel, books, cigarettes, diapers and televisions fell. As gas prices rise, BJ’s and rivals Costco Wholesale and the Sam’s Club unit of Wal-Mart get increased business at their pumps. Still, about 1 percent of BJ’s customers are not renewing their memberships after the annual fee rose by $5, to $50. BJ’s did not give any update on its current review of its options, including a potential sale. BJ’s reported first-quarter net income rose 19 percent, to $33.7 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with $26.1 million or 49 cents a share. Sales rose 10 percent, to $2.77 billion. Shares of Target were down 1.6 percent, to $49.96, while BJ’s shares rose 1.75 percent, to $52.19.</text></article>

The Indianapolis native founded Michael Graves &amp; Associates in Princeton, N.J., in 1964, and has designed more than 350 buildings around the world since. Through Michael Graves Design Group, he has also created more than 2,000 products for companies like Alessi, Steuben, Dansk and Disney. But when it comes to product design, he is probably best known for the work he has done for Target. Mr. Graves was the first well-known designer to create a line for the mass market chain, a relationship that began 15 years ago.And although he has been paralyzed from the waist down and in a wheelchair since 2003, the 76-year-old architect shows no signs of stopping. His most recent products for Target, cleaning tools and kitchen accessories, reached stores last week. What was your impression of Target before you designed for the store? I had never been in a Target before. They really weren’t in the East. They were a Midwest company based in Minneapolis and had stores all over Minnesota and Wisconsin, and some in Chicago or Illinois. So when they called me, it wasn’t for design of objects for the store. It was, in fact, for the design of the scaffolding for the Washington Monument. They were paying for the restoration. How did scaffolding lead to a line of products? They asked me to lunch and said, “We’ve been knocking you off for 20 years,” and said, “Maybe you’d like to come and try designing for us, if we can keep the price at a Target range.” So we designed half a dozen things for them, and they liked it so much they said, “Well, let’s keep going.” Were you worried it would hurt your reputation? Just the opposite. It was my hope to do that. I had been designing for Alessi and Swid Powell and Steuben and high-end people, and people always complained, “Michael, we’d love to buy your stuff, but it’s too expensive.” I always wanted to do what Josef Hoffmann, Wiener Werkstätte and the Bauhaus wanted to do, which they never got to do because they designed in a craft mode. We have behind us all this mass production, so why not take advantage and bring the price down for everybody? It was Target who called it the “democratization of design.” I figured, if it’s going to get designed, let’s do it well. So that’s what we did, and I’m happy about it. The other part implied in your question is, Would you take a certain buffeting from the press or colleagues? And at the beginning there were snide remarks. I remember being at a black-tie dinner, which was a roast for someone else, and my designing for Target came up. I laughed, but I thought to myself, “It won’t be long until you’re doing that, too.” Do you live with your own stuff? I do. My kitchen looks like Target and Alessi. So now you must have a consumer relationship with Target. You mean do I buy stuff there? Oh yeah. We’ve got one on either side of Princeton. When it first opened, I’d tell the people in Minneapolis that I can’t get out of there without spending $200. But I was buying my own things then. You had to buy your own things? Yeah, I got a discount, but I bought my own things. I got 10 percent off. But now we have things that we have to go to Target for. Like Legos: I have an 8-year-old son, so it’s off to Target to get the new Lego. I heard cleaning products were tested in your home. That’s true, it’s not a ploy. I came home to change clothes and get ready for a meeting in New York, and there were about a dozen people in my kitchen scrubbing my floor. Do you clean? I don’t clean now, because I’m paralyzed. But let me tell you, I would clean. I cleaned and I ironed. It’s my inner femininity. I remember bringing guests through my house, and Alex Lee, who used to work with me but is now with Oxo, was there. He said: “Michael, your bed is made. Did your maid come in this morning?” And I said, “Alex, I make my own bed.” Was cleaning a Zen thing for you? No, I’m neat, but I’m not like Richard Meier, who is really tidy. I don’t think I’ve ever met a messy architect. It’s in our DNA to keep it clean. Can you talk a little about why you use certain colors in your products? It’s nothing new. It’s from the Renaissance. I lived in Rome for a couple years, so all that stuff affected me. We use blue on the handle of the Alessi kettle. Blue is cool, so you’re supposed to think that it’s not hot. And the bird is red: you’re supposed to think to be careful to remove the bird. And the new cleaning products are blue. That’s an interesting story. When we started with Target we had a blue box that all our decorative accessories were packaged in, and buyers from Target would say, “Blue is a killer, it will never sell.” And if you look at Target now, there is so much blue it makes me smile. What is it about blue? I like it. I also like green. In fact, I used a kind of gray-green early on in my practice for painting steel, to make it look more like it had a kind of patina to it, like copper and bronze and so on. The color I used was a Benjamin Moore color called 2012. My then-young daughter started calling me 2012 — it was my nickname. Is there anything positive about being in a wheelchair? Two things for me: One, that I realize how bad the health-care situation is for people, and being a designer I can do what I can do relative to that industry to make it better. So that wouldn’t have happened if this hadn’t happened. I don’t think I’d be in health care unless someone had asked me to do a hospital or a clinic or something. That, and I have more time to paint now. You’ve also designed products for Stryker medical. They’re just wonderful. We’re going from one project, to the next, to the next. We’re cleaning up the patient room and ultimately everything you’d expect someone like me to do in a hospital besides technical equipment, as well as the room itself. Patient rooms are pretty awful — shades of mauve and bad wood. And beige and beige and beige. I had a woman come to me — she’s a Zen freak and likes rocks — and wants to color my hospital rooms. She said, “I will make it seem like motherhood.” And I kept listening to her, and I said, “What color would you use?” She showed me a palette and asked what I thought. I said, “I think my mother’s womb was not beige.” That said, I use color. It’s not there to get you well, but make you smile and make you think life is not as bad as that operation you had. </text></article>

The Breslin restaurant held a private dinner for about 85 guests, including past collaborators like Thakoon Panichgul, Richard Chai, Sophie Albou of Paul &amp; Joe, and Tracy Feith. Partway through the Caesar salad portion of the four-course menu, Ms. Albou declared it a Franco-American moment. “New York City is so exciting for a French person,” said Ms. Albou, who was staying at the hotel. “This place is so cool. Usually when it’s spring or summer I stay at the Soho House for its pool.” Chloë Sevigny sat at a table with Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, the founders of Opening Ceremony, alongside Spike Jonze, Terry Richardson and a late-arriving Liv Tyler. “I loved that Stephen Sprouse collection at Target,” Ms. Sevigny said, who looked like a very stylish drag king in a black blazer, bow tie and slicked wetted-down hair. “I bought a beach ball and a skateboard from that line, and I have no idea what happened to them.” After dessert, the dinner guests drifted into the hotel’s lobby, which had been transformed into a temporary nightclub complete with center stage. A young crowd that included fashion bloggers and minor celebrities took advantage of an open bar. A little after 10 p.m., Santigold took to the stage dressed in a demure peach tulle dress by Rodarte for Target, lace-patterned tights and flat lace-up booties. “This is probably the last time you’ll ever see me in a dress,” she said after her mini-concert. “I originally had heels on, but I switched into these boots last minute. How else are you supposed to dance?” She was followed by a surprise musical guest, Sheila E., whose lively drumming set had the audience hoping for another collaboration — with Prince. But the crowd’s attention was divided. For the occasion, Target took over the Opening Ceremony boutique at the hotel and stocked it with 34 reissued dresses from previous Go International collections, including those by Proenza Schouler, Behnaz Sarafpour, Jonathan Saunders, Zac Posen and Erin Fetherston. “It’s kind of amazing,” Ms. Fetherston said, taking in the shopping frenzy. “Target came to me very early on. I was still in Paris, and I was literally a one-woman show. No one really knew who I was, maybe least expectedly, your Midwest store.”IF the fashion industry is like high school, then the Ace Hotel felt like a reunion last Thursday night, when Target gathered alums from its Go International program, which features collaborations with emerging fashion designers.</text></article>

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/25/business/economy/25shop.html?ref=targetcorporation">Profits Rise at Kohl’s, Target and Gap<date>Published: February 24, 2011</date><text>Several major retailers on Thursday posted increases in profit during the quarter that included the holiday shopping season, and even Sears Holdings, which reported a 13 percent decline, topped Wall Street’s forecasts.But three stores reporting profits, the clothing retailer Gap, the discount chain Target and the family department store operator Kohl’s, warned that stubborn unemployment and rising costs for commodities like cotton and fuel were combining to make consumers cautious about discretionary spending. The retailing market “is not enjoying robust growth,” said Douglas A. Scovanner, Target’s chief financial officer, adding that the economy is a “wild card” for the months ahead. Target said its fourth-quarter profit was helped by a promotion that provided discounts to shoppers using its branded credit card and by an expanded grocery selection. For the quarter, Target reported net income of $1.03 billion, or $1.45 a share, up 10.5 percent from $936 million, or $1.24 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Jan. 29 and was the fourth quarter of Target’s fiscal year, rose 2.4 percent, to $20.66 billion. Analysts expected earnings of $1.39 a share on revenue of $20.7 billion, according to FactSet. Shares of Target, which is based in Minneapolis, rose $1.74, to $52. Kohl’s said sales of shoes and men’s clothing increased during its fourth quarter. The company said profit rose to $493 million, or $1.66 a share, from $431 million, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 6 percent, to $6.04 billion from $5.68 billion. Kohl’s chief executive, Kevin Mansell, said that in the second half of this year, Kohl’s plans to introduce two exclusive brands: Jennifer Lopez women’s clothing and accessories and a Marc Anthony men’s line. “The combination of the two brands is the largest brand initiative in terms of scope and investment we will have ever made,” Mr. Mansell said. He hopes “newness” of the brands will generate customer enthusiasm in the face of price increases that begin this spring. Kohl’s announced its first-ever dividend Wednesday, and it said Thursday that it was increasing its stock repurchase program to $3.5 billion. Shares of Kohl’s, which is based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., rose $1.78, to $53.80. Sears Holdings said it earned $374 million, or $3.43 a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $430 million, or $3.74 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell 1 percent, to $13.14 billion. Excluding one-time items, the profit topped the $3.67 expected by analysts, and sales beat the Wall Street forecast for $13.02 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year fell 1.2 percent, pulled down by a 4.5 percent decline at its Sears stores. More than half of the decline was because of consumer electronics, which has had a sharp drop in prices. Results were mostly hurt by weakness in its hardline categories, which include hardware, housewares, automotive, electronics, sporting goods, toys and health and beauty items. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 2.5 percent at the Kmart division of Sears. The chain reported strong sales of jewelry, clothing, toys, footwear and sporting goods but experienced weakness in its foods, consumables and pharmacy categories. The investor Edward S. Lampert, who controls Sears, called the results unacceptable. On Wednesday, the company named Louis J. D’Ambrosio, who worked at Avaya, a telecommunications company, and at I.B.M., as its new chief executive. Mr. D’Ambrosio has worked as a consultant to the board of Sears for the last six months. Shares of Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., fell $4.83, to $82.40. Gap said its fourth-quarter income rose nearly 4 percent as improving business at both the higher-priced Banana Republic and lower-priced Old Navy chains made up for weakness in its namesake division. The company also said it was buying back $2 billion in shares, on top of recent share repurchases totaling $2.6 billion, and it was raising its dividend by 5 cents, to 45 cents a year. It said its net income rose to $365 million, or 60 cents a share, from $352 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3 percent, to $4.36 billion. For the fourth quarter, revenue at stores open at least a year was the same as a year earlier. In the company’s Gap division in North America, that measure fell 2 percent for the quarter, capping another declining year. The figure has been falling on an annual basis for the Gap brand since 2005, and that has analysts wondering how long it will take to turn the division around. At both Banana Republic’s and Old Navy’s domestic divisions, the comparison rose 1 percent for the fourth quarter. Gap, which is based in San Francisco, released its results after the close of market trading and in the after-hours session its stock rose about 1 percent. It ended regular trading at $22.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article>

Futurists have long predicted that one day, shoppers will swipe cellphones instead of credit cards to make purchases. At Starbucks stores nationwide, that is becoming a reality. On Wednesday, Starbucks announced that customers of the 6,800 stores the company operates in the United States and the 1,000 that are in Target stores will be able to pay for their lattes with their cellphones instead of pulling out cash or a credit card. Various technology and payments companies, including PayPal, Bling Nation, Square, Venmo and now-deceased dot-com start-ups have been experimenting with ways to wean Americans off cash, credit cards or both. But the introduction of mobile payments in Starbucks stores may be the most mainstream example yet. Owners of BlackBerrys, iPhones or iPod Touches can use them to pay by downloading the free Starbucks Card app and holding their phones in front of a scanner at Starbucks cash registers. There is no Starbucks app for Android phones, although the company said it was working on one. The money is subtracted from their Starbucks account, which they can load with credit cards or, on iPhones, with PayPal funds. Previous mobile payment efforts have been stymied largely because it is expensive for retailers to install scanners that read shiny cellphone screens and because Americans have been just as content to reach into their pockets and purses for a credit card as for a phone. Starbucks says that more than one-third of its customers use smartphones. “We’re providing them with the fastest way to pay,” Brady Brewer, vice president for the Starbucks card and brand loyalty, said in a statement. Customers can also use the app to reload their cards, check their balances, find nearby stores and earn stars for purchases to trade in for free drinks. Starbucks has tested mobile payments at some stores in Seattle, New York, Northern California and in Target stores. This is the first time the program will be nationwide.</text></article>

Or maybe some Target chicken.Reflecting a major shift in the way Americans shop for food, retailers better known for selling clothes or aspirin, including Walgreens, CVS/Pharmacy and Target, are expanding in a big way into the grocery business, with fresh produce, frozen meats and, yes, even sushi. Target invested $500 million last year alone in a new push on groceries, retrofitting some of its general merchandise stores with full-blown food sections. Sales and traffic at stores with the new grocery areas are about 6 percent higher than at similar stores without them, the company says. Walgreens began making over some stores in Chicago and New York a year ago, and added up to 500 food items. CVS/Pharmacy last year redesigned about 200 of its stores in urban areas like Boston, Detroit and New York, and expects to make over about 20 percent of its 7,100 stores in all. As a result, people who typically went to the grocery store once a week to stock up are instead stopping by places whose food items used to be limited to a bag of chips or a can of soup. And retailers are viewing it as an opportunity to increase sales by getting people in their stores more frequently. “It’s going to be a big food fight in the sense that you’re going to have so many people going after this sector,” said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst with Deutsche Bank. The changes have hit the traditional grocery businesses, stores like Supervalu and Safeway, whose profits had already been declining because of rising food prices, fixed real estate and labor costs, and more competition. Like the grocers, the convenience stores and discount stores are not making a lot of money on their groceries. Instead, the goal is to draw more customers. People shop for food on average about 2.5 times a week, Mr. Dreher said, compared with once a month or so for a drugstore or Target. So if the stores can entice shoppers to pick up some groceries on the way home from work, marketing data shows they are likely to add some paper towels or nail polish or a DVD to their carts, spending around the same amount each time they visit. “Instead of having you stop at a supermarket or a fast-food place,” said Bryan Pugh, vice president for merchandising for Walgreens, “could I potentially entice our shoppers with a better range, better assortment?” So far, the drugstore sales of grocery items are too small to be statistically significant, but they are growing, according to Janney Capital Markets, which estimates that Wal-Mart has about 33 percent of the grocery market, and Target about 3 percent; Kroger, Safeway and Supervalu each represent 4 to 9 percent. “Stomachs haven’t gotten significantly larger, yet you have, probably, at least 10 percent per capita more square footage than you did in the ’80s” devoted to grocery, said Jonathan P. Feeney, an analyst with Janney. Target began opening stores primarily devoted to groceries, called SuperTargets, in the 1990s. But two years ago, seeking to lure customers during the economic downturn, it began trying out grocery areas in its traditional multipurpose stores. It now has groceries in about 450 of its 1,750 stores. Another 400 are planned for 2011, and Annette Miller, Target’s senior vice president for grocery, said she expected an expanded food department to move into most Target stores eventually. The grocery section is laid out with islands stacked with fresh vegetables and bakery items, surrounded by refrigerated cases carrying items like pizza, burritos and chicken. Target also carries sandwiches and quick lunches in stores near office buildings. “What we’re finding with this new layout is the number of trips is really increasing,” said Ms. Miller, adding that when customers come in, they are “still shopping the entire store.” Mr. Dreher of Deutsche Bank estimated that shoppers go to Targets with groceries almost twice as often as patrons visit regular Targets. While the gross margins of the grocery business are about 18 percent, well below those of retail, which are about 30.5 percent, groceries both drive visits and make existing stores more profitable, said Colin McGranahan, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. At drugstores, the emphasis on food goes beyond increasing foot traffic, to the broader goal of selling more items outside the pharmacy. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/business/global/14target.html?ref=targetcorporation">Target to Acquire Up to 220 Zellers Stores<date>Published: January 13, 2011</date><text>OTTAWA — The Target Corporation said on Thursday that it would make its first move outside of the United States by acquiring up to 220 Zellers department store locations from the Hudson’s Bay Company for $1.8 billion.The deal promises to transform Canadian retailing much like the arrival of Wal-Mart in Canada 17 years ago. It will likely lead to the eventual disappearance of Zellers, the last major discount chain based in Canada, which has struggled against competition from Wal-Mart. Thursday’s transaction allows Target to overcome the general lack of available retail space in prime locations, a problem facing any large retailer trying to enter the Canadian market. Target will also gain access to a market that is less competitive and was far less affected by the recession than the United States. For the Hudson’s Bay Company, whose founding in 1670 makes it the oldest corporation in North America, the deal will allow it to reduce its debt and focus on renovating a nationwide chain of full-line department stores to attract more affluent shoppers. The chain, along with its Zellers subsidiary, was acquired in 2008 by NRDC Equity Partners, a private equity firm whose holdings include Lord &amp; Taylor. “This transaction is spectacular for the balance of our companies,” Richard A. Baker, the chief executive of NRDC Equity and the governor of Hudson’s Bay, said in an interview. The deal also provides NRDC Equity with a substantial financial gain. The firm paid an estimated $1.1 billion for both Hudson’s Bay and Zellers. Mr. Baker said that about $500 million would be invested into the Hudson’s Bay stores as well as Lord &amp; Taylor, which NRDC operates through its Hudson’s Bay Trading Company subsidiary. Unlike Lord &amp; Taylor, Target is well known to Canadians. Michael R. Francis, the chief marketing officer at Target and the executive overseeing the expansion, estimated that the brand was known to 70 percent of Canadians and that 10 percent of Canadians had shopped at one of its stores while visiting the United States in the last year. “The Canadian market has been something of interest to us for a very long time,” Gregg W. Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said in an interview. The terms of the transaction give Target considerable time to select which of the 276 Zellers locations it wants to acquire and to deal with issues like Canadian laws that require all packaging be in French and English. It will not begin converting the 220 Zellers locations until 2013. Until 2014, Hudson’s Bay will sublet the stores from Target and continue to operate them as Zellers outlets. Target will invest about $1 billion in renovations and have up to 150 stores under its own name in Canada within three years. Mr. Francis said that both Target and Hudson’s Bay were likely to sell the leases on the unwanted locations to other retailers or trade them for concessions from landlords. To fend off Wal-Mart, Hudson’s Bay had tried to reposition Zellers as a Canadian version of Target. David A. Soberman, a professor of marketing with the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, said that effort was largely unsuccessful. “When I go into Zellers, I don’t find in any way the experience to be similar to Target,” Professor Soberman said. “Zellers looks like a store from the last century.” Target is following Wal-Mart’s lead in its approach to the Canadian market. Wal-Mart started with a base of 100 Woolco stores it bought from Woolworth and now has 323 outlets. Mr. Baker said the sale of Zellers would enable him to press ahead with plans to list Hudson’s Bay Trading on the Toronto exchange. A new management team brought in by Mr. Baker has revitalized Hudson Bay’s private clothing labels and brought in several high-end designer lines. Merchandise produced in connection with the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, last year was exceptionally successful.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/business/07shop.html?ref=targetcorporation">December Sales Are Weaker Than Expected<date>Published: January 6, 2011</date><text>Retailers did not get all that they wanted for Christmas, with December sales coming in lower than expected. But the holiday season altogether was still the strongest since 2006, and several categories including luxury continued their growth.Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.1 percent in December compared with the same month a year ago, according to a tally of 28 retailers by Thomson Reuters. That was below analysts’ expectations of 3.4 percent, a prediction buoyed by reports of rising foot traffic, online spending and early holiday sales. Though December was weaker than expected, the overall holiday season was relatively strong, analysts said, especially when November’s 6 percent increase in sales is taken into account. The two months together posted an increase of 4.4 percent, the biggest holiday-season increase since 2006, Thomson Reuters said. “A lot of companies and sectors out there did well, better than analysts expected,” particularly the more exclusive retailers, said Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in the retail practice at Accenture, the consulting firm. The mixed results among specialty retailers suggested that stores with tepid sales had problems with merchandise or operations, he said, since other stores were doing fine. “You’ll see folks with good numbers that are in the same malls as those companies and are catering to, relatively, the same customer base,” Mr. Donnelly said. “It’s not that customers forsook the specialty apparel space — they went in the same malls, they just happened to walk by some stores.” Since specialty stores all designed and sold exclusive clothing, the problem was probably in the clothes, he said. But “for most customers out there, the fundamentals of the economic situation haven’t changed substantially,” Mr. Donnelly said. Customers might be saving a bit less or earning a bit more in the stock market, and small shifts in how consumers felt could push sales higher. “Instead of spending $100, people spent $103,” he said, referring to the December 3.1 percent increase. “It doesn’t take much.” The International Council of Shopping Centers, which tracks sales at chain stores, said on Thursday that December sales rose 3.1 percent for stores open at least a year, compared to December 2009. For the November-December holiday period, same-store sales rose 3.8 percent, which was the biggest holiday increase since 2006. While concerns were rampant about how the post-Christmas snowstorm on the East Coast would affect December results, only a handful of retailers cited that as a factor. BJ’s Wholesale Club, for instance, said that comparable sales rose in every region except the New York City area, where results were hurt by the storm. On the other hand, J. C. Penney said its Manhattan store outperformed the company average for the month, and that the Northeast was one of the best-performing regions in December. The day after Christmas tends to account for only 2 to 2.5 percent of sales for the month, making it one of the lower-ranked spending days in December, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which estimates overall spending. Luxury items continued to rise, even more so than analysts had expected, with the two higher-end stores reporting results — Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue — beating estimates by the biggest amounts. At Saks, sales at stores open at least a year, a measure called same-store sales, rose 11.8 percent, beating estimates of 3.9 percent. And Nordstrom’s rose 8.4 percent, versus estimates of 3.4 percent. Other data showed strength in luxury. Even at a middle-market store like J. C. Penney, more expensive items like fine jewelry were among the top performers for the month. December jewelry sales rose 10.4 percent compared with the month a year ago, according to SpendingPulse. And luxury sales outside of jewelry rose 8.5 percent. Some apparel stores were among the worst performers for December, missing estimates by big margins, including — American Eagle Outfitters (down 11 percent), Aéropostale (down 5 percent) and Gap-owned stores (down 3 percent). But that seemed to be more a store-specific problem than a mark of a troubled sector. Other apparel stores did well, like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, where sales rose 15 percent; Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works, up 5 percent; and stores aimed at teenagers, like the Buckle, which was up 6.1 percent. Overall apparel sales rose 10.9 percent in December from a year earlier, according to SpendingPulse, which measures consumer spending. That was the biggest increase since March 2007, and the teen apparel category increased 12.2 percent. For stores with wide arrays of merchandise, a good performance in apparel did not totally offset lackluster categories elsewhere, particularly in electronics. SpendingPulse said that the consumer electronics category was up just 1.5 percent from a year ago, one of the weaker results among the sectors it measures. At Costco Wholesale, for instance, same-store sales rose 6 percent, just a bit below analyst expectations of 6.2 percent. There, the category that includes apparel, jewelry and housewares rose in the high single digits compared to a year ago, but electronics was weak, declining in the high single digits versus a year ago. Costco said that a big reason for that was declining television prices — while the number of TVs sold rose, revenue from TVs dropped in stores open at least a year. Target saw a similar pattern. It posted a same-store sales increase of 0.9 percent for the month, which was 3.1 percent lower than what analysts had predicted and "below expectations," Target said in a press release. Though apparel was up for the month, electronics and some other categories decreased compared to a year ago. "Target saw a weakness in consumer electronics, and we saw that coming from a number of different chains, including, of course, Best Buy," said Michael B. Koskuba, a senior portfolio manager at Victory Capital Management, which owns shares in Target, referring to Best Buy’s lackluster earnings report from last month. "It’s difficult to get that incremental buyer to buy another flat-screen television, and I also think consumers in general have been looking for greater bargains. The prices of consumer electronics should continue to come down, so maybe they’re waiting." Measuring double-digit increases over last December in categories like jewelry, apparel and e-commerce (up 17.6 percent, the highest increase since December 2007), SpendingPulse had a brighter take on the holiday season than the Thomson Reuters numbers. Categories including apparel, auto parts and services, e-commerce and grocery are now above 2007 levels in terms of dollars spent (though electronics, jewelry, luxury and home furnishings still lag behind), said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis at SpendingPulse. “This is the longest sustained period of improvement, from a consumer-spending standpoint, that we’ve seen since the recession,” Mr. McNamara said. “It’s really strong growth across a number of retail categories.”</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/business/22sears.html?ref=targetcorporation">Sears Struggles 5 Years After Kmart Merger<date>Published: December 21, 2010</date><text>This holiday season, Sears and Kmart, which merged in 2005, are pushing a single message: Buy with layaway, buy with coupons, buy now and pay later, buy with loyalty rewards points — but please, just buy.Five years after the merger, Sears Holdings is beleaguered, with sales markedly worse than its competitors’. The company’s revenue dropped more than 10 percent from 2005 through 2009, the most recent full fiscal year. In the same time period, Wal-Mart’s sales rose almost 31 percent, Target’s more than 24 percent and Macy’s about 5 percent. Sales at J. C. Penney’s declined by about 6 percent. Recently, too, as shoppers seem to be cautiously loading their carts again, Sears Holdings has not benefited. In the first three-quarters of this year, Sears Holdings’ sales are down about 1.9 percent compared to the same period last year, while the competition moved into positive territory. Edward S. Lampert, the billionaire hedge fund manager who engineered the merger and is chairman of the company, has promised that Sears Holdings will be “unrecognizable” in 30 years. To drive sales, it is emphasizing online shopping, mobile apps and an Amazon.com-like marketplace with other vendors, along with heavy promotions in stores. Still, its long-term strategy remains murky, analysts say. Sears Holdings is primarily a physical retailer, and many of its 2,200 stores in the United States are run-down and in undesirable locations. Among discount stores, Kmart lags Wal-Mart and Target. Sears is trying to edge out Lowes and Home Depot in appliances on the one hand, and Macy’s and J. C. Penney in apparel on the other. “People assume that Eddie’s got some magic formula,” said Gary Balter, an analyst with Credit Suisse. “If you’re Sears, you’ve got a problem because you’re trying to sell a product in a dilapidated building,” he said. And Kmart stores are “about a quarter the sales productivity of Wal-Mart,” he said. “How do you compete?” When Mr. Lampert combined Kmart and Sears in an $11.9 billion deal that went through in 2005, many of the same analysts considered it a smart move. Mr. Lampert, who became the majority owner of Kmart after it went into bankruptcy, said then that he wanted to combine the best of both, putting brands like Kenmore and Craftsman into Kmarts, and building Sears’s presence outside of malls by turning some stand-alone Kmart stores into Sears stores. Some attractive store locations, particularly in urban areas, led analysts to believe he could sell those to competitors for premium prices. But the sudden consumer pullback in 2008 led to lots of empty retail space, at less expensive prices than Mr. Lampert’s. Today, Mr. Balter said, Sears Holdings still has some showcase spots, in high-end, high-traffic areas like Bergen County, N.J.; South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Calif.; and in Manhattan and Bridgehampton, N.Y. But much of the remaining real estate in older, decrepit malls is a problem, Mr. Balter said. “Of the 2000, there’s 1,500 that you don’t want to be in, that nobody’s going to buy,” he said. (It also has a growing division of about 1,600 specialty stores, like small hardware stores and outlets. ) The better locations “are where Sears and Kmart are making their money — if you sell those, what are you going to be left with?” Mr. Balter said. Mr. Lampert has also not invested much in the stores themselves, analysts said. In 2009, capital spending only amounted to 0.82 percent of sales. That is about half of Macy’s spending, at 1.51 percent of sales, and a fraction of the spending at Target, Wal-Mart, J. C. Penney and even publicly traded dollar stores, all of which are at 2 percent and above. In an interview, David Friedman, Sears Holdings’s new senior vice president and president of marketing, played down the importance of appearance. “The customer’s experience is made up of lots of pieces,” he said. “The in-store experience is one of those that matters a lot, and we believe that the physical plant is one piece of it, but we believe the associates and the products drive the in-store experience.” Sears Holdings is experimenting with new layouts and fixtures and will introduce those more widely if they are shown to improve sales. And Tom Aiello, a Sears spokesman, said in an e-mail that brightness and cleanliness were priorities, and noted that customer-satisfaction scores had risen this year. The stores’ products pose another challenge. Sears has long commanded the appliance world, but Home Depot and Lowes are formidable up-and-comers. In 2009, Sears still led the group with a little more than $7.1 billion in major appliance sales, according to This Week in Consumer Electronics magazine and the Stevenson Company. But its appliance sales fell 8.2 percent that year. Lowes came in second, with $4.5 billion, up 3.8 percent, and Home Depot was in third with $3.4 billion, a 4.3 percent decline.</text></article>

While Target has carried snack foods like potato chips and soft drinks for years, the company has expanded to include fresh groceries like steak, chicken, eggs and apples. So far, 350 of the 1,752 Target stores nationwide have been reformatted to include the new food layout, and the company expects to add the arrangement to additional stores at the rate of about 400 a year. The campaign to market fresh food includes direct mail, billboards, television, radio and vehicle wraps, among other elements. The ads focus in part on the three daily meals that could be put together with a trip to the store, and the company hopes its efforts will resonate with mothers, who are a prime target of the campaign. “We focus on mom,” said Tim Murray, the creative director at Target. “She’s quite busy, dinner is ticking in the back of her mind every day. We can also offer her things to plan ahead for that next day as well.” While the fresh food offerings will include items similar to what a customer can find in a grocery store, “The concept is built around the notion of fill-in trips and convenience trips,” added Will Setliff, the vice president for marketing at Target. “There’s a real need for convenient and affordable grocery options.”  Target began experimenting with the campaign in 2008 in Minnesota and followed that with a full-scale campaign in more than 30 Target stores in the Philadelphia area in fall 2009. The campaign continued in 2010 with large-scale marketing efforts in Chicago, Washington, Tampa and Denver. Messages for many of the outdoor elements were tailored to each city. A billboard in Washington promoted a “Vote Fresh” message, and in Chicago “Fill with Fresh” was the message. The Philadelphia trial helped Target with the goal of getting customers to associate the brand with fresh food, Mr. Setliff said. “It was a unique crucible to not only refine the format itself but also to test all manners of marketing,” he said. Target stocked fresh food items alongside local products like Turkey Hill ice cream, Ellio’s Pizza and Herr’s potato chips. To market the concept, the company ran ads in local newspapers, used direct mail and placed door hangers on homes. It also used what Mr. Setliff called “guerrilla tactics,” like distributing 10,000 samples of produce on the streets of Philadelphia using branded bicycles and trucks with the Target bull’s-eye logo and “Get Fresh Philadelphia!” messages. The look of the campaign incorporates Target’s bold red lettering against a white background with fruits and vegetables splashed across the layout. The images were shot by Erwan Frotin, a French photographer, who created sculptures of the produce and lighted them brightly for the effect. “Since fruits and vegetables have such bright, poppy colors, we wanted to emphasize that,” Mr. Murray said. Target is working with a number of agencies on the creative aspects of the campaign. In addition to using an internal team for the television spots, the company partnered with Olson on radio and outdoor advertising, Little &amp; Company for strategic planning and the Philadelphia campaign, Knock for in-store signs and marketing and David Stark Design and Production for a food truck promotion.  The Chicago campaign included a food truck parked on Michigan Avenue giving away gift bags of groceries and recipes that visitors could make with the ingredients in the bag. In front of the truck, which was decorated to look like an enormous shopping bag filled with larger-than-life bananas, broccoli spears and tomatoes, Giada De Laurentiis, the celebrity chef, gave live cooking demonstrations and handed out signed copies of her book “Giada at Home.” Target also distributed 500 free copies of Ms. De Laurentiis’s book. The campaign was also featured on buses and trains nationwide. “If there weren’t trucks, we were wrapping anything that moved,” said Kevin DiLorenzo, the president and chief executive officer of Olson. Target, which declined to say how much it was spending on the fresh food campaign, spent $644 million on advertising in 2009, compared with $760 million in 2008, and $223 million from January through June 2010, according to data from Kantar Media.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/business/18retail.html?ref=targetcorporation">Target Says It Expects Better Holiday Sales<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>The Target Corporation said it expected to post its best same-store sales in three years during the holiday season, sending its shares up.The discount chain benefited from the strong performance of its credit card business in its third quarter. It said it believed that it would lure more shoppers during the holidays with a new credit card program that offers 5 percent off all purchases and a bigger array of fresh food. Wal-Mart said Tuesday that it expected to break a six-quarter streak of same-store sales declines in the United States during the holiday shopping season in the fourth quarter. “Target has more catalysts behind it right now (for a) better holiday season than Wal-Mart,” said Brian Sozzi, an analyst at Wall Street Strategies. He has a rating of neutral on both chains. Separately, BJ’s Wholesale Club posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost cuts, and raised its full-year forecast, which sent its shares up more than 3 percent. Target’s sales in the United States have grown as consumers who feel more secure in their jobs trade up to its stores from rivals like Wal-Mart for trendier clothing and home furnishings. Traffic at its stores rose more than 2 percent in the third quarter and the company forecast a same-store sales rise of 2 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter. “While consumers remain conservative in their purchasing behavior, we’re encouraged by recent signs in the broader economy that may signal somewhat stronger and more stable sales in the coming months,” Gregg W. Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said in a call, citing a slightly improved job market. He expects the company’s merchandising plans and credit card discounts will drive fourth-quarter same-store sales to be the “best of any quarter in the last three years.” Target is also betting on its store credit cards and has said that shoppers who use them typically spend 50 percent more at its stores over the course of a year. Many retail investors are betting on discounters this year as shoppers search for bargains in a slowly recovering economy. Target’s earnings for the third quarter, which ended Oct. 30, rose to $535 million, or 74 cents a share, from $436 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit, that matched the analysts’ average estimate. Target previously said sales rose 3 percent, to $15.23 billion in the third quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.6 percent. BJ’s results reflected increased membership income and share buybacks. BJ’s said net income rose to $23 million, or 43 cents a share, in its third quarter, which ended in October, from $17.4 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 36 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Excluding a charge for a legal settlement, the year-earlier profit was 45 cents a share. Earlier this month, the company said sales rose 4.8 percent, to $2.57 billion. The company now expects full-year earnings of $2.48 to $2.52 a share, compared with its previous outlook of $2.40 to $2.50. Analysts on average forecast $2.45. Shares of BJ’s rose $1.37, or 3 percent, to $47.54. Shares of Target rose $2.08, or 3.8 percent, to $55.62.</text></article>

Stocks traded lower this week as finance ministers from the 16 countries that use the euro met in Brussels to discuss aid for Ireland. Investors have worried that Ireland’s debt problems could spread to other countries that use the euro, primarily to Portugal and to Spain. But on Wednesday, the British government signaled that it could offer Ireland direct financial aid. Officials from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are due in Ireland on Thursday to discuss its financial problems. “I think it is a pretty significant issue from a standpoint of potential contagion from the sovereign or banking issues,” said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at First American Funds. “It has served within the markets as a proxy for risk appetite,” he said. The Dow Jones industrial average, which briefly fell below 11,000 on Tuesday for the first time since mid-October, lost 15.62 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 11,007.88. The S.&amp; P. rose 0.25 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,178.59 while the Nasdaq composite index was up 6.17 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,476.01. The market wavered, then rose slightly in afternoon trading after the United States government released reports on inflation and the housing sector. The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in October, compared with 0.1 percent in September. The core inflation rate — the measure of consumer prices excluding food and energy prices — was flat, or marginally lower, while the annual rate of core prices was up 0.6 percent, the smallest increase since the government started keeping the records in 1957. A Commerce Department report showed that housing starts fell in October to the lowest level in more than a year. David Kelly, the chief market strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds, also referring to a new report on Wednesday on a decline in mortgage applications, said the recent economic indicators justified declines in the equity market. “Longer-term, however, we continue to expect a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy and a gradual pullback from quantitative easing, leading to higher stock prices and interest rates,” Mr. Kelly said, referring, in part, to the Federal Reserve’s program to buy government debt and increase the amount of cash in the economy. “The economic numbers this week are a little on the disappointing side,” Mr. Kelly added. “The fears of deflation can’t quite be put to bed. It is reasonable to be a little glum that we are not seeing any acceleration in the economy.” But Mr. Kelly said he believed that the markets had generally overreacted to the debt problems in Europe, partly because Ireland is determined to reduce its budget. The dollar was slightly lower, and the euro was up slightly, at $1.3523. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 97 26/32, and the yield rose to 2.88 percent, from 2.84 percent late on Tuesday. Retail shares led the broader market. Target rose nearly 4 percent, or $2.08, to $55.62 after reporting a 23 percent increase in third-quarter profit and an upbeat outlook for same-store sales in the fourth quarter. After the housing report, shares of home builders fell. D. R. Horton fell 34 cents, or 3.09 percent, to $10.68. PulteGroup declined more than 2 percent, or 15 cents, to $6.74. The financial sector declined, pulled down by Citigroup, which closed down 3 cents, to $4.19, and Bank of America shares, which fell 32 cents, to $11.62. Human Genome Sciences, one of the most actively traded shares on the Nasdaq, fell more than 5 percent, or $1.37, to $24.51. The company’s lupus drug, Benlysta, moved a step closer to the market on Tuesday by winning an endorsement from a committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration. But analysts from Citi said the process had raised criticism about the drug’s benefits, and the analysts were concerned about long-term sales.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/business/28friday.html?ref=targetcorporation">Black Friday Will Start in October, Stores Say<date>Published: October 28, 2010</date><text>Attention bargain shoppers! It is October — and Black Friday specials are here.The year’s most popular discount shopping event, referring to the Friday after Thanksgiving, is arriving ahead of Halloween this year, with some promotions beginning this week and others throughout November. Both retailers who have had tepid sales lately (Wal-Mart Stores, Sears) and those with rising sales (Amazon, Target) are pushing the tradition forward in a bid to snag shoppers’ limited money. Recession-trained customers are also pushing the stores to offer big deals now or risk losing out to competitors, though there is some skepticism about how significant some of the early discounts are. The first “Black Friday Now” deals at Sears will be available beginning Friday and Saturday. Amazon’s electronics department will offer sales on items like Blu-ray players and high-definition TVs on Friday, and Toys “R” Us is putting all the items in its 80-page Christmas toy book on sale on Sunday. Black Friday creep has been around for a while, but analysts say this year breaks new ground: the range of stores offering early discounts is wider, the discounts are steeper and the sale periods longer — in some instances, a full month before the real thing. Sears, for example, offered early promotions last year but expanded the hours and days this year, while Amazon is beginning earlier than ever. “Consumers have been trained to buy merchandise only ‘on sale,’ ” Sherif Mityas, a partner in the retail practice at the consulting firm A. T. Kearney, said in an e-mail. “Given a limited budget, if retailers don’t capture that first or second purchase, they may find themselves with a lot of inventory the week before Christmas and the need for massive discounting to save the holiday.” Some shoppers asked for a longer sale period, both for convenience and out of nervousness over crowds, said Barbara Schrantz, executive vice president of marketing and sales promotion at Bon-Ton Stores. After a Wal-Mart employee was trampled and killed on Black Friday in 2008, stores increased their crowd-control measures, but they do not want safety concerns to keep shoppers away from stores. In some instances, deal hunters say, stores are just hijacking the Black Friday label. Mike Riddle, who started the site Black-Friday.net in 2006 to track deals, said shoppers should not believe that “special” prices for the Friday were necessarily lower than the usual price. “Retailers are taking advantage of the term,” he said, citing the first Sears “Black Friday Now” circular as “nothing more than their weekly ad rebranded.” Tom Aiello, a spokesman for Sears Holdings, said the prices were not standard discounts; so far, customer response has been positive about this weekend’s deals, he said. Traditionally, stores used low prices on the Friday after Thanksgiving to attract shoppers, who, they hoped, would put full-price items in their carts alongside the bargains. In 2008, as the economy sank, the offers became more intense. “Retailers had to go even further in the breadth and depth of their sales post-Black Friday in attempts to salvage some degree of revenue,” Mr. Mityas said. Last year, with consumers trained to look for deals, “sales growth improved, but at the cost of profitability — retailers were essentially buying their foot traffic,” he said. This year, the pre-Friday deals are expanding more than ever. And consumers and retailers are more evenly matched, Mr. Mityas said, as shoppers demand early and frequent sales, and retailers “aim to drive foot traffic without resorting to ‘70 percent off everything’ signs in the windows.” For the first time, Target will run a four-day sale starting the Sunday before Thanksgiving in which more than 170 gift items will be discounted as much as 50 percent. While in the past Target has issued a standard circular before Thanksgiving, this year the discounts are deeper, more items will be discounted and the focus will be on gift-ready items in toys, electronics and entertainment, said Kathee Tesija, Target’s executive vice president of merchandising. “The economy does play into it a little bit — this is always a very competitive time of year,” Ms. Tesija said. “We want them to come to us first, middle, last.” She said discounts had to be good because shoppers had gotten smarter. “Throughout the recession, I think they’ve been very thoughtful about how they spend their money,” she said. “They know when they’re getting a good deal.” Some stores are holding out until Thanksgiving week, like Bon-Ton Stores, which will put most of its merchandise on sale the Sunday before Thanksgiving. J. C. Penney will run a one-day sale on Nov. 17, adding to the “Biggest Sale of Them All” on Nov. 6, a “Huge Sale” on Nov. 20 and a “Day Before Thanksgiving” sale on Nov. 24. The early sales extend to the Web. At Amazon.com, beyond the electronics sales beginning this week, the Black Friday deal page will go live sometime around the week of Thanksgiving, offering big discounts on popular products. Wal-Mart’s Web site will also run discounts starting in early November, offering up to 30 percent off 200 items a week in categories like toys, electronics, home and other gifts. And Staples.com will offer discounts of more than 50 percent on some items like laptops, cameras and printers on the Sunday through Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Even with the effort to capture more sales through early promotions, there is no guarantee that retailers will see a bounce in their bottom lines. In the three years before the financial crisis, there was accelerated spending in early November, said Mike Berry, director of industry research for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which estimates total retail sales. But in 2008 and 2009, as shopping creep took hold, spending was weaker. One explanation is that retailers cut prices too steeply, leading perhaps to increased traffic but low revenue over all. And customers simply refused to buy anything at full price. Brad Wilson, who runs BlackFriday2010.com, said he expected consumers to have the upper hand again this year. “After an exhilarating late 2008 and full-year 2009, this year has been boring in the ‘great deals’ corner of retail,” he said in an e-mail. “October has started to pick that up, and I think November and December could break it wide open.” Robert Buchanan, a finance professor who specializes in retail at the John Cook School of Business at Saint Louis University, said shoppers had become smart enough to sidestep the regularly priced goods. “My guess is that the majority are just cherry-picking the special items,” he said. “They’re looking for the $6 toaster and they’re on their way.”</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/fashion/14Scavenger.html?ref=targetcorporation">An International Hunt for a Fast-Fashion Knockoff<date>Published: October 13, 2010</date><text>IT happens every season: the knockoff that sends me scrambling; the capsule collection that leads me on a treasure hunt, online and off; the bargain that I’m willing to fly overseas for. Logic has nothing to do with it. I’m a pretty loyal shopper, favoring a handful of labels and getting my purchase(s) out of the way early in the season. Typically, I’d rather pay more for one good thing than a dozen lower-priced approximations, and I try not to spend much time in stores. But something about the wave of you-snooze-you-lose collaborations between great designers and megastores has unleashed my competitive-shopping side. By selling limited editions, chains like Gap, Target and Wal-Mart have transformed something mass and inexpensive into a fashion badge of honor. I totally took the bait. I stood in line for Karl Lagerfeld’s collection for H&amp;M, clawing my way toward a pair of men’s jeans (not my size, nor that of anyone I know) and a weird choker. I don’t even like Karl Lagerfeld. I’ve organized SWAT teams to buy white Gap shirts by the likes of Phillip Lim. While on assignment to interview a man who sells heirloom beans in Napa, Calif., for the farming column I write, I went out of my way to visit Target in search of the Thakoon collection, the New York area having been wiped out. (Best score ever; I bought a second dress on eBay.) Going far afield doesn’t always pan out. When I asked a clerk at a Wal-Mart in upstate New York where to find the Norma Kamali section, she squinted hard and said, “Guacamole?” “NOR-ma Ka-MA-li,” I moaned. “Let me see if she’s working today,” the woman said, reaching for her walkie-talkie. And then there is the goose chase triggered when a fast-fashion chain climbs into your brain and reproduces the item you wanted for 90 percent less. Make that the item that everyone wanted. It can drive a woman to the most embarrassing distraction. In March, I was biking the wrong way up Fifth Avenue, late to meet a friend for a birthday drink at the King Cole Bar, when the windows at Zara made me brake hard. The toffee-colored leather shorts. The wide pants. The silk tuxedo shirt that I was in the process of talking myself toward, even though the real one was $990 in the Barneys ad. (It would go on sale by July, I figured — what better time to wear a long-sleeve white silk blouse?) Last spring, Phoebe Philo’s debut collection for Céline was that exciting. And, what was this? The knockout knockoffs were already in stores, like Pixar bootlegs being hawked opening week. I considered popping in, but I was already on borrowed time. “Mind if I tweet?” I asked my friend before I’d sat down. “They’re knocking off Céline at Zara.” Her eyes bulged. “That was fast.” After drinks — which ended up being so expensive that the birthday girl insisted on paying — I zipped around the corner to the store, just before closing. “Sold out,” the saleswoman told me, shaking her head. Not a five-inch platform clog sandal to be found. Be calm. Think this through. So began the shopping math: which Zaras would carry it, minus those that wouldn’t be shopped over by fashion-smart customers. The chase was on. The next morning I was at the lower Fifth Avenue store as they were unlocking the doors. They hadn’t gotten it yet. Before dinner the next night, I tried the SoHo location — the craziest — anyway. So busy! So gone. Lexington and 57th. Nope. I wished that I was in Paris, where the selection at Zara is so on trend (what career basics?), the location on the Rue Saint-Honoré — somewhere between the Lanvin men’s store and Colette — fits right in. Then I got so busy that I had to pull back: why was I chasing down clothes that would end up in my yard sale within two summers? But when my husband and I finished plans for a belated honeymoon in Spain at the end of April, the drums of the hunt began beating again. Zara is a Spanish company. (Its owner, Amancio Ortega, is the ninth richest person in the world, according to Forbes. Tadashi Yanai, the founder of Uniqlo, is the richest person in Japan. So stop snickering at fast fashion.) We would be in Madrid for 18 hours. The Prado could wait: I was going to the mother ship. In Seville, I pressed my face to the store’s glass during a midnight tapas crawl. In Granada, I did a pre-Alhambra drive-through. In the delightfully dated city of Córdoba, I dispatched my husband to the men’s floor while I hunted in vain. (And how cute are their children’s clothes?) Bring on Madrid. By the time we arrived in the capital, I was flu-y and dizzy. I wasn’t sure how I was going to make it through the Prado, which my husband and I had been looking forward to all week. When I woke up from my nap, he presented a map of the city, on which the concierge had marked all of the nearby Zaras, including the biggie. (Thank you Hotel AC Santo Mauro.) “If I’m not back in two hours, send the police,” I said, rousing myself to look for a subway map. Sick and unable to speak Spanish, I was gone before I could be stopped. I tried the closest location first. As soon as I walked in, I could see the tuxedo shirt glowing from the wall. I began to sweat. They had it a size up and a size down, but not in my size. Neither was quite right. But the cut was indeed good, and the silk looked almost luxurious. I think it was 89 euros, about $115. Not exactly a whim. Everything else in the store looked kind of trashy and cheap, tight and bedazzled; nothing like I imagined based on my Parisian experiences. There was only one thing to do. Somehow I made it to the megastore on the Gran Vía, which is kind of like Times Square crossed with 34th Street. Even though it was siesta time — wait! Would it be open? — I was crowd-surfed to the front door. The lights were bright, the music 2,000 beats per minute. The layout was completely different than that of American Zaras, which meant that the “prestige” area wasn’t where I expected it to be. In a nauseated haze, I covered two floors before I found the “Céline.” They had everything. The leather shorts, the leather skirts, the shoes, the jackets and jumpsuits, not to mention a take on that great black-and-white sharp-shouldered Balmain jacket. I could buy it all and make my friends so happy. I could sell it on eBay and pay for my trip. I could do lots of things, except find that tuxedo shirt in my size. I tried the other sizes again, wishing I could speak enough Spanish to ask for an opinion. And then, dear reader, I turned around and left. By the time I returned to the hotel, I’d gone through the cycle of emotions brought on by this kind of episode: shame, embarrassment. And relief. The Prado was the real catch. My husband and I stood in front of John Singer Sargent’s “Daughters of Edward Darley Boit” for 10 minutes at a stretch, circling back to experience the awe anew. The white pinafores the little girls were wearing almost glowed, reminding me, for just a moment, of the real Céline shirt. But then the thought was mercifully gone.</text></article>

But a controversial political donation has stirred the nationwide wrath of gay and lesbian groups that previously had praised the retail chain. Target apologized after its $150,000 contribution to an organization supporting Tom Emmer, the aggressively antigay Republican candidate for governor of Minnesota, was publicly disclosed, as required by Minnesota law.Public disclosure of campaign financing is an absolute necessity for healthy politics, and Minnesota is to be praised for requiring full sunshine. Of course, campaign gurus in Washington are pointing to Target’s troubles as another reason for corporations, unions and special interests to cling to the shadows. The professionals are counting on full employment from the Supreme Court’s disastrous decision to overturn decades of law and allow unlimited corporate spending on federal candidates. There is no mandate for disclosing this spending, and legislation to enact one is hanging by a thread in Congress. Lawmakers should take note that the same Supreme Court decision also prescribed public disclosure of that spending to help voters “make informed choices in the political marketplace.” The Target experience should be a lesson in the value of disclosure. The company, which insisted it supported Mr. Emmer solely for his pro-business views, discovered that it is bad business to back a candidate so out of step with the rest of its values. Presumably, it will be more alert now, knowing that customers are watching. The House has passed a worthy transparency measure, but Republicans in the Senate are blocking it. It is crucial that Republican moderates who have objections — Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Scott Brown of Massachusetts — negotiate to improve it. They hold the key to protecting voters in the ever-slicker and money-laden political marketplace.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/business/19retail.html?ref=targetcorporation">Profits Rise for Target and BJ’s Wholesale Club<date>Published: August 18, 2010</date><text>The retail chain Target posted uninspiring results while BJ’s Wholesale Club missed Wall Street profit estimates and cut its forecast for the year.A slow economic recovery has put pressure on retailers. After cutting costs and jobs in the depths of the recession, some are struggling to shore up profits as sales remain sluggish. Target’s quarterly profit met Wall Street expectations, helped by reduced costs and strength in its credit card business. But the chain did not match the performance of much larger rival Wal-Mart Stores, whose results exceeded analysts’ forecasts. Target’s gross margins were about flat although its apparel sales were stronger than Wal-Mart’s. Target also expanded sales of fresh foods, which carry lower margins. “Over time, that gross margin will come down,” Brian Sozzi, an analyst at Wall Street Strategies, said. But Mr. Sozzi noted that Target’s inventory was down from a year ago, while Wal-Mart’s rose, and that analysts’ expectations for Target had risen more than for Wal-Mart before earnings reports. As the economy has slowly pulled out of the depths of the recession, Target has attracted customers from Wal-Mart with apparel and home furnishings. Target shares, which slumped early, rose 2.5 percent to close at $51.95. BJ’s shares were down 2.7 percent, at $42.14. Target said its second-quarter profit rose to $679 million from $594 million a year earlier, or to 92 cents a share, from 79 cents, meeting analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters. Earlier this month, Target reported sales of $15.13 billion for the quarter at its retail business, up 3.8 percent from a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.7 percent, below the company’s forecast for an increase of 2 to 4 percent. Total revenue, which includes credit card revenue, rose 3.1 percent, to $15.53 billion. BJ’s Wholesale Club said Wednesday that full-year earnings would fall below analysts’ estimates as it expected merchandise sales to be less than it previously forecast. Profit for the warehouse club operator was $35.8 million, or 67 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $35.1 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 73 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The weak forecast and disappointing earnings were reported as BJ’s faced pressure from an investor who said its shares were undervalued. In July, a fund run by the private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners said it had taken a 9.5 percent stake in BJ’s and might propose taking it private. BJ’s cut its earnings forecast for the year to a range of $2.40 to $2.50 a share from $2.58 to $2.68. Analysts’ average forecast is $2.67.</text></article>

The chain’s mascot, a miniature bull terrier, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Miss New York, Doug E. Fresh and Jerry Seinfeld attended a pre-party. Crowds lined up outside the store, the largest single investment the company has made in any of its retail properties.The opening, like most corporate debuts, left little to chance. But in this case, the preparations were extreme: nearly 10 years of calculated philanthropy and schmoozing across Harlem, an effort that Minneapolis-based Target has characterized as smart community relations but critics suggested was akin to bribery. Long before the ribbon-cutting, Target had wooed notable Harlem residents with dinner parties, struck deals to carry exclusive gear designed by neighborhood luminaries, and sponsored prominent charitable projects and events, including the refurbishing of a school library and the sprucing up of a rundown lot near the store on 117th Street. The goal was to avoid the pitfalls of Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers, which have run into stiff community opposition as they expand into big cities, considered the last frontier for growth for many of the largely suburban chains. Lately, Wal-Mart has also seen the value of community outreach: it announced a $20 million donation to Chicago-area charities three days before a critical vote this summer that cleared the way for a store on Chicago’s South Side. Eric Dezenhall, a public relations consultant, said that while community work like Target’s in Harlem was a relatively safe bet, its long-term impact was not guaranteed. He pointed to the mixed success of other major outreach efforts by big corporations. In March 2000, for instance, Microsoft announced a $50 million donation to the United Negro College Fund, but still was sued for discrimination that June by an African-American former employee, a suit that was subsequently amended to include other plaintiffs in a $5 billion claim against the company. (The suit was later dismissed.) In the case of McDonald’s, by contrast, its presence in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles helped ensure that the restaurants were not singled out during the 1992 riots after the Rodney King verdict, Mr. Dezenhall said. “As for Target and Wal-Mart,” he said in an e-mail, “their efforts fall somewhere between ‘it couldn’t hurt’ and ‘it might actually help, we’re just not sure how.’ ” Either way, Target’s plans for the Harlem store are ambitious — and the company decided long ago it would go to great lengths to ensure its success. Target expects the store to have sales of more than $90 million in its first year, compared with $25 million for an average suburban store’s first year, said John D. Griffith, executive vice president for property development. Eventually, the company expects the Harlem store to be among its five top performers. Target declined to provide a price tag for its near decade of community work in Harlem; companywide, it donated more than $187 million to communities in 2009. But the contributions have not silenced some critics. “All these big-box stores who come in try to bribe the community, and they end up spending pennies, for them, which has a big impact for a community,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents workers at stores and factories but not any Target employees. “But it’s a disproportionate price that the community ends up paying.” Mr. Appelbaum and similar union groups say that the chain stores knock out mom-and-pop businesses and that their wages and health care practices are unfair to workers. Target officials declined to comment on wages, but said they were competitive. “They’re hurting the community,” Mr. Appelbaum said. “They’re bringing down standards, they’re lowering wages, they’re institutionalizing poverty — why is that good?” In general, though, Mr. Appelbaum said that his group focused its organizing efforts and protests more on Wal-Mart, simply because it was bigger. For instance, his group expects Wal-Mart to try to open its first New York store at the Gateway II mall in Brooklyn, and, along with politicians and community groups, is already mobilizing to oppose that. (Wal-Mart said that it continued to evaluate spaces.) As Wal-Mart and Target try to win over city dwellers, philanthropy is now a standard part of their plans, said Dan Otero, a partner at Launch Collective, a fashion and retail consulting firm. “Whether they’re effective or not, at least there is change taking place in how big businesses like Target are approaching their consumers,” he said. Target began laying the groundwork for the Harlem store in the early 2000s, and as the opening day drew closer, it stepped up its efforts. It financed a refurbishment of the library at P.S. 155 on East 117th Street in 2008, repainting and relighting the library and donating books, furniture and equipment. It donated money to design and redevelop a rundown lot on East 117th Street that is now known as the Target East Harlem Community Garden. In 2008, it began sponsoring free admission at the Studio Museum in Harlem on Sundays, and free admission every third Saturday to El Museo del Barrio. “As they were planning the Harlem store, they made a big and very admirable effort to get to know the community on all levels,” said Thelma Golden, director of the studio museum. Target also courted notable local residents and community leaders.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/fashion/05Skin.html?ref=targetcorporation">Manhattan’s Target Store Brings Cosmetic Delights<date>Published: August 3, 2010</date><text>Correction Appended NOW that Target has come to Manhattan, savvy beauty shoppers no longer have to brave the weekend crowds at the chain’s Atlantic Terminal outpost in Brooklyn to score exclusive products, like the Boots No. 7 skin-care line. They can just take the No. 6 train to Harlem.Target’s fashion collaborations with designers like Mossimo and (formerly) with Isaac Mizrahi have made a bigger impression than its beauty collaborations. But the store’s beauty exclusives do inspire feverish enthusiasm among women who want designer makeup and skin care at prices that don’t hit Sephora highs. Like the chic bargain hunters who shop at Ulta, they want to stay on trend and gorgeous without breaking the bank. And Target is the only American store that sells products from Boots, the British pharmacy, including its cult favorite, the No. 7 serums that aim to soften unsightly lines. This comes as a big relief to transplants like Pam Spellman of Marietta, Ga., who wrote recently on Facebook: “As an ex-Brit I love that I can now buy my fave No. 7 over here instead of having family members send it to me ... Have used it since I was 15 years old and I’m now 66!!” I, too, fell for Boots, back in the carefree 1990s when I was living in England and could drink pints nightly without gaining an ounce. The face creams and masks fit my graduate-school budget, and the minimalist packaging had a certain charm. Buying Boots never made me feel as if I were slumming. Boots came to the United States through the Target chain in 2007. And business has been brisk: in July 2009, for example, a $22.99 bottle of No. 7 Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Beauty Serum was sold nationwide every eight seconds, according to the company. This month, the likelihood of a satisfying haul of Boots No. 7 as well as Target’s solid roster of beauty exclusives is worth a visit to the Harlem store, especially since your college-bound teenager’s dormitory room isn’t going to outfit itself. From Times Square, it took 35 minutes to get to 517 East 117th Street with one train change. Target now has nine stores in New York City (who knew?), as well as beloved staples like Sonia Kashuk’s inexpensive makeup brushes. Their growing roster of limited-edition products also keep shoppers coming back. From Remington, exclusively for Target, there are flat irons and hair dryers available now in girlish flirty patterns ($19.99). Nicole by OPI has a dozen nail polish hues ($6.99) for Tarzhay (to use the colloquial term), including a dark blue that strikes a modern note when paired with an all-black outfit. Herbal Essences ($2.50), the drugstore staple now promoted by Leighton Meester, enlisted a student from Rhode Island School of Design to gussy-up the bottles of shampoo-conditioner pairs in its Love line for Target. On my midday trip to Harlem last week, I found those products as well as plenty of trendy bargain-priced cosmetics. I bagged Boots’s High Lights, an illuminating lotion ($12.99 for one ounce) with mica, which supposedly reflects light to disguise fine lines. It was a good way to test the waters before buying a luxury product with mica, like Perricone MD’s No Foundation Foundation, a light-diffusing makeup that is $50 an ounce at Sephora.com. I also went in search of products to cure a problem that — of late — I have grown accustomed to calling Subway Face. As this summer’s heat and humidity drag on, the symptoms have grown alarmingly widespread on subway platforms: greasy forehead, shiny cheeks and a mask of quiet resolve. It will not come as a surprise that most blotting papers were sold out last week, not only at the new Harlem Target but also at the older one at Atlantic Terminal. In this heat, trying to mop an oily forehead with blotting papers is a bit like plugging a hole in a dam with a finger. Good luck with that. One sensible solution is Boots’s instant matte liquid, for $5.99. I applied it to oily trouble spots before my luminous foundation. Voilà, my face no longer looked freakishly slick. Apparently, this anti-shine liquid can be used over makeup, too, making it an ideal on-the-go helper. I fully expected to find designer makeup collections that are sold at many of Target’s other 1,743 stores, but I was disappointed. In the Harlem store, popular brands like JK Jemma Kidd, Napoleon Perdis’ NP Set and Petra Strand’s Pixi were all conspicuously absent. Why? According to Katie Heinze, a Target spokeswoman, the company did market research and then tailored the beauty assortment “to best respond to the needs and wants of our guests.” For the same reason, she said by e-mail, the Harlem Target is selling “multicultural collections” like CoverGirl Queen (as in Latifah) and Iman Cosmetics for women of color. Are there no hip young things in Harlem, be they black, Hispanic or white, who would fall for these designer makeup lines at reasonable prices? I’d argue there are. I’m a Haitian-Canadian, half black and half white, and I find that lip gloss is lip gloss — choosing one is just a matter of finding a hue du jour to go with my medium tone. But for now they’ll have to do what women living in Target-free zones do: buy at Target.com, sight unseen. Later this month, Target will be stocking four new makeup kits from JK Jemma Kidd, a sister line to the more expensive Jemma Kidd Make Up School. And from what I’ve seen, the kits are all right. One of them is a $35 workhorse called the Backstage Kit, which crams in a startling range of products: four color correctors (yellow tames purplish under-eye circles, for example), a bronzer, blushes, lip glosses and an eye primer, all in a case not too big for a purse, and a must-have for vacation. “The eye primer is unreal,” Ms. Kidd said in an interview. “It enhances the eye shadow color, so you can get that smoky eye so easy. You need less color with eye primer.” Next week, the latest offerings from two other exclusive Target lines will hit shelves. One is NP Set, the brainchild of the Australian makeup artist Napoleon Perdis, who is known for his foundations and primers (which are used to prepare skin for makeup). The other is Pixi, which aims to demystify makeup for women ages 30 to 100. Both brands are also available online (at pixibeauty.com and npsetcosmetics.com). Finish off summer shimmery with either $15 duo pack of Mr. Perdis’s crème highlighters. Use on brow bones to give the illusion of being well rested. NP Set’s $29 anti-aging serum uses rare flowers and a hyssop extract from the Swiss Alps, a stab at keeping the clock turning back naturally. The line’s 98-percent paraben-free lip shines hydrate with shea butter and jojoba seed oil (crucial in this heat) and come in sleek tapered tubes for $15. Pixi’s $18 pairs of lipstick and lip liner may seem overpriced at first. But any woman who’s been through the trouble of having to match a beloved lip color with a separate liner knows that the convenience of an already matched duo makes the price fair. A bonus? Knowing that applying dark liner with lighter lipstick is one common faux pas that there’s no need to fret about.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/nyregion/01critic.html?ref=targetcorporation">One-Stop Shopping at Manhattan’s First Target<date>Published: July 30, 2010</date><text>On the second story of East River Plaza, at 116th Street, wide sliding doors open onto an evenly lighted, color-coordinated, climate-controlled space and then slide shut again, cutting off the waft of 95-degree air plaguing the sidewalks of East Harlem.Suddenly all is calm: Street sounds are gone. Heat wave is gone. Sidewalk vendors are gone. Everything else — every household need that could ever be anticipated, every consumer object you might not yet know you want — is present. Row after cheerful, brightly colored row; aisle after generously proportioned aisle; 147,000 square feet of merchandise. You are not in a rush. You are not in a city. You are in a Target. Specifically, you are in Manhattan’s first Target, which made its debut last Sunday after much fanfare. East Harlem is not an obvious location for retail prestige, so Target’s investment in the area has taken on the air of civic virtue, a contribution not just to shoppers who might patronize it but to the city as a whole. “We feel that Harlem embodies our values of community, diversity and being a good neighbor,” a company spokeswoman said. Celebrities showed up to lend their support. Politicians applauded. And Target — which had plastered whole trains on the No. 6 line with advertisements — announced a number of initiatives, including local hiring programs, partnerships with nearby cultural institutions and neighborhood-specific merchandise. That means an array of “Hispanic” products in the grocery section. It means dish towels by Marcus Samuelsson. And it means Ebony Inspirations greeting cards, with pictures of Halle Berry and inscriptions about beauty. All these items are indeed specific to their neighborhood. But that neighborhood is Targetland, located anywhere, or perhaps everywhere, in America. Roz Safdari, a tattooed hairstylist with an angular blond cut, said the store reminded her of a Target in Atlanta. Kathy Cocca-Bates, who was shopping the day after moving to New York, thought of the Target she had left behind in New Haven. “My expectations were it would be like any Target anywhere,” said Deirdre O’Brien, a lawyer who had made the trip from Midtown. In Targetland the forecast is sunny with only a mild chance of panic attack. A day after the opening-Sunday crush, everything was in its place, fully stocked and neatly stacked — a far cry from Target’s earlier experiment at the Atlantic Terminal in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. Retail consultants from the Doneger Group were taking it all in, excitedly calling attention to the lighting, which in turn called attention to the floor-to-ceiling displays, which called attention to the “end-capped” aisles, which called attention to the name of the featured product and the price. Look, there’s a video of Allstar Weekend, in which the members of that chirpy boy band chirpily discuss ... their favorite departments of Target. In Targetland all the signposts point inward. It is a sharp contrast to hopping from store to store for kitchen tools here, socks there, electronics in yet another place, and I wonder if there’s a hardware store somewhere nearby. That dominant New York shopping model has its charms, but really, remind me what they are. I like local merchants as much as the next New York nostalgist, but on a torpid summer day there is much to be said for the suburban efficiency of one-stop shopping. And for air-conditioning. Plus Bob’s Discount Furniture, just up the escalator from the new Target, has free candy and ice cream and cookies. Free! Is this what we’ve been missing out on all along? It all seems so convenient (and cheap) that you start to think you should just buy everything then and there, to have on hand when you need it. But what did I need? A Five Star college-ruled Advance notebook ($5.24)? A 40-pound bag of Pedigree Small Crunchy Bites dog food ($17.09)? A $149.99 Kelty Getaway four-person all-weather tent? A Gabriel Iglesias “I’m Not Fat ... I’m Fluffy” DVD ($9.99)? Four Riedel wine glasses ($39.99)? (When the same brand is available at Target and Tiffany, it’s time to re-evaluate the distinction between mass and class.) And how would I ever get it all home? After several hours, I found myself wandering through the aisles with my shopping cart, glassy-eyed from the sheer glut of choices, idly reaching for things that I felt no special connection to. It was time to go. At most of Target’s 1,743 American stores, I would make the long walk through the parking lot, trying to pick my car out from the thousands like it. But East River Plaza is an anomaly, a shopping mall in a subway city. It does have a parking lot, but the lot doesn’t seem very busy, so attendants instead ask shoppers if they need a taxi. I walked back through the clamorous outdoor market known as East 116th Street, past a dozen vendors whose displays were neither end-capped nor color-coordinated. On the subway home, I opened my bags to see what, in my shopping-induced fugue state, I had actually purchased. Luckily not the macho-looking Brinkman four-burner stainless steel grill that was going for $329.99. Instead I found a red Stephen Burrows dress, six dark gray hand towels, some conditioner, sunglasses and underwear. Somehow I’d spent more than $100. Out on the street a whippet-thin woman was carrying the same red-and-white bags I was. She had made the pilgrimage to buy products by Boots, the English beauty line. I asked her which of those items she scored, but she shook her head: none. “I kept putting things in my cart and taking them out,” she said. “I get overwhelmed by choice.”</text></article>

His clothes were covered in mud. His skull had been fractured, his throat cut. The stab wound was of such force that it penetrated to the spinal column. The police believed the man was a peddler who was the victim of a robbery, for there was nothing of value found in his pockets.It was one of the first grim acts to be documented on Pleasant Avenue, a street that once had trouble living up to its name. Two years later, in 1884, a day-old newborn was abandoned on the avenue, wrapped up in newspapers, his throat cut. In 1935, Thomas D’Auria, 20, attempted to intervene during an argument between his parents at their house on Pleasant Avenue. His father killed him, stabbing him with a bread knife. In 1949, Candido Perry made the mistake of reducing the price of a beer to five cents a glass at his Pleasant Avenue bar and grill. Some men with an apparent interest in competitive pricing assaulted Mr. Perry and smashed up the place. Over the next few decades, Pleasant Avenue would become known as one of the most famous gangland stretches in the history of the mob. It was where Anthony Salerno, known as Fat Tony, ran the Genovese crime family before he was convicted of racketeering in 1986. It was where Francis Ford Coppola filmed the scene in “The Godfather” when Sonny Corleone beats up his brother-in-law. On Sunday afternoon, a city’s focus once again returned to Pleasant Avenue, for entirely different reasons. A new Target store was opening. Fifty years after a teenager who lived on Pleasant Avenue was pulled from the East River with 124 stab wounds on his body in 1960, nearly seven years after a man was shot at Rao’s restaurant at Pleasant Avenue and 114th Street for heckling a Broadway soprano in 2003, crowds of shoppers packed the neighborhood. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes cereal was on sale, two for $4. The Target’s grand opening represents a new era in the life of one of New York City’s most misnamed thoroughfares. Target’s advertisements for the new store, at the East River Plaza at 517 East 117th Street, featured a drawing of a little gray bird resting on a Pleasant Avenue street sign. The soundtrack of the day came not from police sirens but from the jingle-jangle of the Soft Sensations ice cream truck parked outside Rao’s. A bodega owner fiddled with his iPhone. The only Tony people knew was the one on the cereal boxes. A 14-year-old boy who lives on the avenue said he heard something about the street being a mob stronghold years ago, but he did not know the particulars. “The Mafia is no more,” he said. “No gangs. Just regular people.” He could not talk for long. He was on his way to Target. New York City’s streets and the residents who live on them have at least one thing in common: Their reputations can change, for good or bad. There were three homicides reported last year in the 25th Precinct, down from 35 in 1990. Pleasant Avenue is no longer an Italian enclave, but a black, Puerto Rican and Mexican one. It is home to the Love Café, a laundromat, bodegas, apartment buildings, community gardens and a halal food cart. It is a short street, spanning just six blocks from 114th Street to 120th Street near Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. At the southern end is Jefferson Park, and at the north are the red-brick buildings of the Wagner Houses public housing complex. John Vitale, 51, grew up on Pleasant Avenue. He remembers when there were five Italian social clubs on the avenue, when even the car thieves stayed away out of fear of stealing a mob man’s vehicle. “I’ve seen guys leave cars running, brand-new Caddies,” said Mr. Vitale, who now lives in the Bronx but still visits the old neighborhood. “Nobody’s touching it.” Though the mob influence in the neighborhood has faded, that old reputation lingers in small ways. One 56-year-old Puerto Rican man recalled the bad old days of the Mafia, and the dividing lines that kept East Harlem’s blacks, Puerto Ricans and Italians separated. Asked his name, he declined to give it, worried about the consequences all these years later. It was shortly before 2 p.m. as shoppers strolled past a 68-year-old man sitting in the shade of the trees along Pleasant Avenue. He is one of the few Italian-Americans who still lives on the avenue, and he remembered the street’s Italian past fondly. “It was just like any other old Italian neighborhood,” he said. “People had respect for each other.

Stores like Sam’s Club, Target, Toys “R” Us, Staples and Office Depot are offering unconventional promotions meant not only to attract visitors to stores, but also to get them feeling profligate.Sam’s Club is introducing a program in which it facilitates loans for shoppers of up to $25,000, backed by the Small Business Administration. Target will give its credit card holders 5 percent discounts. Toys “R” Us is instituting a holiday fund program where it adds to shoppers’ savings, and Staples and Office Depot are giving away office products for a penny or at no cost. “A lot of the government programs have come to an end,” said David Bassuk, a managing director in the global retail practice at AlixPartners, a financial consultancy. “So retailers are taking it upon themselves to do everything they can to get the consumer to spend, even opening up their own wallets to give money back to the consumer.” Persistent unemployment nationwide is threatening to inhibit consumer spending. The latest figures from the government on Friday underscored the depth of the problem, with the economy adding only 83,000 private sector jobs. There was no relief in sight from Washington, either. Congress left on recess Friday having failed to pass legislation that would have extended unemployment benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans. On the small-business side, credit concerns are keeping some companies from spending. And on the consumer side, while spending and confidence numbers continue to be weak, personal income has risen for three months straight and savings rates are relatively high. That suggests people now have cash but are just sitting on it. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, retailers are taking bold steps. Of the over-the-counter stimulus plans, the one at Sam’s Club is the most unusual. Sam’s began testing the program in May and will soon start marketing S.B.A. loans of $5,000 to $25,000 for its members nationwide. Superior Financial Group, which is managing the loans, gives Sam’s members a $100 discount on the application fee, and lower interest rates, because of how much business it expects through the arrangement. The company says it does not expect the program to be a big moneymaker, though it earns $50 for each financed loan. The point is to get customers spending more freely — and, it hopes, spending at Sam’s Club. Michael Golata had been watching his spending carefully. As a contractor in Louisville, Ky., for United Parcel Service, he drives emergency medical equipment to hospitals when M.R.I. or CT scan machines break down. When he asked U.P.S. if more routes were available, the company told him there was so much work that he should bring on as many drivers as he could afford. There was just one problem: Mr. Golata owned one truck, and he was driving it all the time. Online, he had found a used white Dodge Sprinter for $12,500. With just a few thousand dollars in cash, he tried to get a bank loan but was denied by two local banks because the truck was too old and had too much mileage. He decided an S.B.A. loan would be too much trouble, and he rejected as absurd a loan from a commercial finance company with a 21 percent interest rate and payments of $450 a month. About a month ago, Mr. Golata, a Sam’s Club member, clicked through the retailer’s Web site and found a page describing S.B.A. loans offered by the retailer. He filled out an online application, and, by the next day, got a phone call from Superior Financial telling him he was approved for a $10,000 loan, with an interest rate of 7.25 percent over 10 years. “It made the payment, like, $118 a month. I thought I was dreaming,” Mr. Golata said. Mr. Golata immediately bought the Dodge, and hired three drivers. He went from billing U.P.S. $3,000 a week to $8,000, he said. A little under half of Sam’s members are small-business customers, and they account for a little more than half of the revenue at the retailer. As its net sales began to slip last fall, Sam’s surveyed small-business customers and found that tight credit was partly to blame. In the survey, said Catherine Corley, vice president for member services at Sam’s, a division of Wal-Mart, “fully one-third said ‘I didn’t buy what I needed to buy at Sam’s Club because I didn’t have the money.’ It really motivated us to say, ‘We’ve got to find some solutions.’ ” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

It will be the first brick-and-mortar store to sell the Kindle, which had been available only through the Amazon Web site. Mark Schindele, a senior vice president for Target, said in a statement that the discount chain's customers had an ''overwhelmingly positive'' response to the Kindle during a test run at 104 stores. ''We are thrilled to bring guests nationwide this incredibly light, portable, easy-to-read product that allows them to get all the news and books they want,'' Mr. Schindele said. Target plans to sell the Kindle for $259 in all of its stores, the same price as on Amazon.com. Amazon, which manufactures the device and sells e-books for it, has encountered more competition in the e-book market in recent months. Apple began selling its iPad this spring, and Barnes &amp; Noble now sells its own e-reader, the Nook, in its stores and on its Web site. Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of Idea Logical, which helps publishers develop digital strategies, said he thought that Amazon was feeling vulnerable. ''They're trying to spread their wings and reach people they haven't reached through Amazon,'' Mr. Shatzkin said. ''Once Kindle started, they pretty much were alone. And in the last three to six months, that's changing.'' On Wednesday, Barnes &amp; Noble said it would offer a free $50 gift card with any purchase of the Nook.</text></article>

The Target Corporation's net income climbed almost 29 percent in the first quarter, helped by an improvement in its credit card business and higher sales of more profitable items. BJ's Wholesale Club said its profit rose 7 percent. The chief executive of Target, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said Wednesday that the results came in a ''stronger-than-expected economic environment.'' The company, based in Minneapolis, said it had net income of $671 million, or 90 cents a share, up from $522 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended May 1, rose 5 percent, to $15.59 billion from $14.83 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 86 cents on sales of $15.58 billion. Target's revenue at stores open at least a year rose 2.8 percent for the period. The measure is a crucial indicator of a retailer's health because it excludes the effect of expansion. That offered a contrast to Wal-Mart Stores, which reported on Tuesday that its same-store sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. To turn around sales after the downturn, Target has emphasized its low prices in advertising and expanded its food offerings. BJ's Wholesale Club said its first-quarter income rose 7 percent, partly helped by gasoline sales. Its shares rose 4 percent to end at $38.95. BJ's, which operates warehouse stores, also lifted its full-year earnings forecast. BJ's net income rose to $26.1 million, or 49 cents a share, for the three months ended May 1. That compares with a profit of $24.3 million, or 45 cents a share, reported a year earlier. The performance topped the 43 cents forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $2.61 billion, from $2.31 billion. Revenue at warehouse clubs open at least a year climbed 7.8 percent including gasoline sales.</text></article>

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/business/24retail.html?ref=targetcorporation">Major Retailers Post Profits, but Forecasts Are Cautious<date>Published: February 23, 2010</date><text>For retailers, 2010 may be more about winning sales from competitors than tempting consumers to buy more. Discounters like Target and Kmart posted improved sales performances on Tuesday, while the department store chain Macy’s also forecast better sales in 2010. Demand picked up for items that sat out the recession on store shelves. But executives at stores cautioned investors that they did not expect a huge improvement in sales trends this year while unemployment remained high. At Sears, which owns Kmart stores, net income more than doubled, to $430 million, or $3.74 a share, from $190 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier. Excluding store-closing costs and hedge fund gains or losses, earnings in the fourth quarter, ended on Jan. 30, were $3.99 a share. The company’s forecast on Jan. 7 was $3.36 to $4.06. Analyst estimates were $2.62 to $4.05, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue slipped 0.2 percent, or $33 million, to $13.25 billion, affected by 62 fewer stores. The company also had a 2.5 percent decline at stores in the United States open at least a year, a measure of retail health. Macy’s said it expected a 1 to 2 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year for the current fiscal year, in contrast to a 5.3 percent decline last year. “While we still see little meaningful near-term improvement in macroeconomic conditions, we do believe there is opportunity to gain market share by increasing same-store sales,” said Macy’s chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren. But consumer caution was also evident in weekly sales numbers. Research from the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs found the same-store sales index rose 0.9 percent in the week ended Saturday, compared with a year earlier. Council research forecasts a 2 percent rise in February same-store sales over all. Macy’s reported net income, of $466 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.77 billion, or $11.33 a share. In the fourth quarter, ended on Jan. 30, sales fell 1.1 percent, to $7.85 billion, compared with sales of $7.93 billion in the same period last year. That was above the $7.84 billion that analysts had expected. Excluding one-time items, Macy’s earned $1.40 a share, 3 cents more than analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected. Some analysts, however, said even that might not have been enough. “After what we’ve seen, where companies were blowing through consensus numbers and offering guidance that was dimes, not pennies, above” forecasts, said Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones, “it has the implication that there’s not as much potential for these big earnings surprises to the upside.” Mr. Arnold has a hold rating on Macy’s shares. Target said its customers were not buying just essentials, like food, but had added a few more home improvement and apparel items to their baskets. It expects sales of such discretionary merchandise to improve. At Target, net income was, $936 million, or $1.24 a share, compared with $609 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a lower provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, earnings were $1.17 a share. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 3.7 percent, to $19.72 billion, from $19.0 billion in 2008. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.6 percent. Its gross margin rate increased 1.8 percentage points, to 29.1 percent. Target also said it was on track to post its third consecutive gain in same-store sales in February. Target’s stock slipped 1.2 percent, falling 58 cents, to $50.06. Sears fell 1.9 percent, dropping $1.86, to $93.80. And Macy’s rose 1.1 percent, up 20 cents, to $18.67.

The recall by Graco Children’s Products includes certain model numbers of its Passage, Alano and Spree Strollers and Travel Systems. The company, based in Exton, Pa., received seven reports of injury to children who had placed their fingers in a stroller’s canopy hinge as the canopy was being opened or closed. Five children suffered severed fingertips, and two children received cuts on their fingertips. The strollers were made in China by Graco and sold at AAFES, Burlington Coat Factory, Babies “R” Us, Toys “R” Us, Kmart, Fred Meyer, Meijer, Navy Exchange, Sears, Target, Wal-Mart and other retailers from October 2004 to December 2009. In announcing the recall Wednesday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said the strollers posed an amputation and laceration hazard to children when the canopy was opened or closed. The government advised consumers to stop using the strollers and contact Graco to receive a free repair kit. The recall involves strollers made between October 2004 and February 2008. The model numbers and manufacture dates are on the lower inside portion of the rear frame, just above the rear wheels. Last November, about a million Maclaren strollers were recalled after there were 12 reports of children’s fingertips being amputated by a hinge mechanism.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times At Target in the Atlantic Terminal mall in Brooklyn, several shoppers said that they were still trying to carve out some small pocket of festivity in a bleak year. On Sales Undaunted in Brooklyn This is the third article in a series checking in on shoppers and merchants in New York during the second holiday season of the recession. Related On Sales: Shoppers Fill Streets, if Not Their Bags (November 30, 2009) On Sales: Tight Times, Tiny Niche: Opening a Store Anyway (December 11, 2009) Enlarge This Image Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times Some shoppers at Target bought staples, but Lyndon DeRiggs of Brooklyn and his son, Trent, 5, went for a luxury: a new, $700 television. For hours the wait was only about 10 or 15 minutes  not bad during the holiday crunch in a store that bloggers regularly deride for chaotic lines and scattered merchandise. Around 6:30, Tiffany Wright, 23, a Long Island University student with gold streaks in her hair and a sequined pouch clipped to her Deréon jeans, went through without a hitch, reloading her cart with bags holding $200 worth of toys, food, shoes and clothes, much of it presents for her family and friends. Then everything came to a halt. Close behind Ms. Wright came her brother Angelo and another relative, Tanya Smith, a high-spirited 30-year-old buying housewares. “My child is 15, so I don’t have to buy none of that,” Ms. Smith said, referring to the holiday treats that were among the goods they had unloaded onto the conveyor belt. Then, for a full half an hour, the line grew and Ms. Wright waited, as her brother and Ms. Smith sorted and resorted their items, the cashier ringing them up in batches to be paid for with cash and what appeared to be personal checks. It was a complicated, tedious set of transactions  one even required intervention from a manager  but the two were determined, in their obstreperous way, to get through it. “It’s about the kids,” Mr. Wright said later, giving his age only as “somewhere in the 20s” and the reason for the confusion at the cash register as, “It’s Christmas and my sisters and I, we’re cheap.” Still, Mr. Wright, who was clutching a Baby Einstein play gym, is planning to have a real Christmas tree this year  “from Canada,” he said  although he worried about setting it up because his three children, 2 months to 4 years old, might climb on it or set it on fire. “His kids are bad!” Ms. Wright exclaimed. Mr. Wright works in maintenance and food service, and is considering becoming a backup dancer to supplement his income. “I’m tired  two jobs, nonstop, I’m very tired,” he said. But he wants to teach his children the spirit of generosity, he said. “I’m trying to instill some type of values in the kids.” It was a refrain heard over and over from the shoppers coming through Line 19, where many of those with the largest purchases were not those with the largest means. The store, near the affluent neighborhoods of Fort Greene, Park Slope and Boerum Hill, nonetheless draws customers from less rarefied areas like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Prospect Lefferts Gardens. And no matter the economic circumstances, several shoppers said, they were still trying to carve out some small pocket of festivity in an otherwise bleak year. Carla Hector, 30, and her boyfriend, James Gaynor, bought about $200 worth of movies and clothes for Ms. Hector’s 5-year-old daughter, Aaliyah, even though Ms. Hector lost her job as a teacher in April and has not been able to find work since. “It’s just the basics, nothing too extravagant  that’s all you can do in this economy,” said Mr. Gaynor, a computer technician, as he zipped Aaliyah into her puffy pink jacket. “It’s all for her.” Even customers whose red plastic shopping carts brimmed with staples were slipping in a holiday item or two. Nadia Reid-Christie, 41, and her husband, Hubert, 44, had driven to the store from Bedford-Stuyvesant for groceries, mostly cereal and juice. The selection and prices are better at Target than at her neighborhood grocery stores, Ms. Reid-Christie said, adding that the $300 bill would have been much lower had they not picked up one “big-ticket item,” a Braun shaver her husband had been eyeing for several months that had been reduced to $150 from $200. Asked if that meant Christmas had come early for him, she rolled her eyes and laughed in the manner of tolerant spouses everywhere, saying, “I guess so.” As the action at Line 19 began to wind down, a young man walked by, heading for the exit and singing softly to himself, “I hate this place, I hate this place.” At the store cafe a few feet away, an elderly man sitting alone slowly consumed a pint of Häagen-Dazs. Among the patrons drinking Starbucks and eating pizza, a woman went from table to table, handing out a card saying she was deaf and asking for money. A little after 8 p.m., the store was still busy with customers buying Candy Land board games, shiny Christmas ornaments and rolls of wrapping paper, but the cashier at Line 19 had finished, declining to speak to a reporter for fear she might get in trouble with the bosses. She made her way through the store to leave, chatting with the other workers, most of them, like her, black and young. Outside, some of the car service drivers who rely on customers from the mall were complaining of lean times, saying business had never been so slow in the many years they had worked there. “There is no money, and it’s hard to pay the bills,” said Habibou Salami, 30, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant. “But nobody has the money to pay.” More Articles in New York Region » A version of this article appeared in print on December 19, 2009, on page A17 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News Shoppers at the Toys “R” Us flagship store in Manhattan the Friday after Thanksgiving, when the chain’s doors opened at 12 a.m. Related A Hamster Is the Seasons Hottest Toy (November 21, 2009) Enlarge This Image Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News The Ferris wheel in the Toy “R” Us flagship store in Manhattan. Analysts say the chain is on the verge of a turnaround. It was early summer, and Gerald L. Storch had a fake hamster on his desk. His buyers, the executives who study and order merchandise, were predicting it would be a holiday hit. Mr. Storch laughed as the rodent scurried around and plopped off a table, then he turned serious: “How big can we make it?” So big, it turned out, that mothers are now lying in wait in Toys “R” Us parking lots all over the nation, desperately hoping to score fake hamsters for Christmas. Mr. Storch’s big order for Zhu Zhu Pets was the latest achievement for a man who, in the midst of a recession, has begun to pull off a retailing turnaround. Only five years ago, Toys “R” Us was in grave trouble. Sales had shrunk and the chain had fallen under the shadow of Wal-Mart, the behemoth discounter. Retailing professionals said the beleaguered toy industry was losing ground to flashy electronic gadgets. When Toys “R” Us was sold, in 2005, for $6.6 billion to two private equity firms and a real estate developer, analysts thought it was only a matter of time before the chain would be carved up and sold. They were wrong. The toy company’s new owners hired the bespectacled Mr. Storch, a longtime Target executive, to help Toys “R” Us get its sparkle back. In the last year, Mr. Storch has taken bold steps. He snapped up nearly every well-known specialty toy chain and Web site, including F. A. O Schwarz and KB Toys. As mall retailers went out of business, Mr. Storch opened more than 80 temporary holiday toy shops in their vacant storefronts. He is opening supercenters, with Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us stores together under one roof. And he kicked off the holiday shopping season earlier than ever, opening his stores at just after midnight on the Friday after Thanksgiving, instead of hours later. Recently, Mr. Storch stood at the flagship Toys “R” Us store in Manhattan and gazed at a replica of the Empire State Building made of Legos. “While it would be easy to get into a very defensive hunker-down mode during these economic times,” he said, “history has shown that the future rewards companies which are aggressive during economic downturns.” Toys “R” Us has not gone unscathed in this economy; the chain said in its most recent reporting period that sales declined from last year. Even so, Mr. Storch has managed to make it the last big specialty toy retailer left in the nation, and one whose prospects are looking up. Where consumers used to shop at KB Toys in malls throughout the country, they are now shopping at Toys “R” Us holiday boutiques. When tourists buy wide-eyed dolls at F. A. O. Schwarz, their dollars go into the coffers of Toys “R” Us. Even a search for the word “toys” on the Internet inevitably leads to a Web site owned by Toys “R” Us: Toys.com, eToys.com, BabyUniverse.com, FAO.com or ePregnancy.com. Wal-Mart overtook Toys “R” Us as the largest toy seller in the country more than a decade ago. Mr. Storch’s fundamental strategy is not to try to compete by matching Wal-Mart’s prices, a battle he would surely lose. Instead he is trying to outfox Wal-Mart by focusing on service and especially on selection, perceiving the next hot toy trend and locking in big orders before his competitors even see it coming. “Now our competitors are left competing purely by making price claims,” Mr. Storch said, adding that he would not reinforce “a rush to the cheap.” He pointed out that his competitors could not cut prices on toys they did not have. Mr. Storch, 53, joined Toys “R” Us after 12 years at Target, where he rose to vice chairman and was widely considered to be one of two contenders for the top job. But in 2005 he abruptly left the company, never giving a reason. Retailing professionals said they think it became clear inside Target that Mr. Storch, known as more of an operations man than someone with a flair for merchandising, was not going to ascend to chief executive. Four months after leaving Target, Mr. Storch was named chairman and chief executive of Toys “R” Us, where from his early days he held the chain accountable for its poor results and invoked the mantra, “We are not victims.” Industry veterans praised Mr. Storch for his intelligence (he has a bachelor of arts, a master’s and a law degree from Harvard), and for bringing Toys “R” Us back from the brink. At the same time, Mr. Storch has been described as being obstinate and of not having a particularly warm personality. Industry professionals said he had gone through several senior executives. At Target, Mr. Storch worked in areas as varied as supply chain operations and financial services, and led the development of the company’s grocery strategy and its Target.com business. “I remember when I was giving a presentation,” said Mr. Storch, “one of the board members saying, ‘Well, we can’t do a Web site at Target because, you know, you have to be specialized in something the way eToys is.’ ” Today, Toys “R” Us owns eToys. All of the recent acquisitions are meant to differentiate Toys “R” Us from its value-priced rivals, especially the purchase of F. A. O Schwarz, which enabled Toys “R” Us to offer exclusive, high-end toys. Toys “R” Us posted a loss of $67 million for the three months ended Oct. 31, an improvement over a loss of $104 million last year. The company typically makes large investments in the third quarter to prepare for the holidays. Net sales were $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion last year. Sales at United States stores open at least a year declined 9.3 percent year-over-year. Still, Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst with Needham &amp; Company, said Toys “R” Us had lately gained market share. “The profitability of the company is better than it’s been in a decade,” he said. Also, Toys “R” Us, which is owned by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, and a real estate developer, Vornado Realty Trust, refinanced its debt so that no major payments are due for two years. Last month, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded the chain’s outlook. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 19, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Tami Chappell for The New York Times A Home Depot employee works with a customer in Decatur, Georgia. The retailer said it saw improvement in regions hit hard by the housing crisis. Add to Portfolio Home Depot Inc Go to your Portfolio » Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, said its profit declined 8.9 percent, but executives said that business had improved in areas hardest hit by the housing crisis, including Arizona, California and Florida. Some 36 of Home Depot’s top 40 markets performed better. Though the average transaction at the cash register declined 7.1 percent from last year, to $51.89, the rate of decline slowed from the previous quarter. For the three months ended Nov. 1, Home Depot earned $689 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $756 million, or 45 cents a share last year. Revenue fell 8 percent, to $16.36 billion. “There is still a great deal of pressure in the housing and home improvement markets,” Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Indeed, the chain’s weakest categories were goods typically used by professional builders  plywood, lumber, concrete, gypsum, electrical and millwork. And transactions for goods of $900 and above, which represent a fifth of Home Depot’s United States sales, fell about 10 percent, though that was less of a decline than in previous quarters. The most robust categories continued to be tied to do-it-yourself repair and small remodeling projects  paint, plumbing, flooring, garden, building materials, and kitchen and bath. Sales of items used for décor updates, like vinyl flooring and special-order carpet, were also strong. So were sales of products related to energy efficiency, as consumers hunted for ways to save money. Sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, declined 6.9 percent from the period a year ago. Same-store sales for United States stores fell 7.1 percent. The company gained market share, outperforming its main rival, Lowe’s. Shares declined 2.39 percent, or 66 cents, to close at $26.99. Also on Tuesday, Target, the most upscale of the nation’s discount chains, posted a profit after eight quarters of declines. For the three months ended Oct. 31, Target earned $436 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with $369 million, or 49 cents a share in the period a year ago. Revenue rose 1.1 percent, to $15.3 billion, but same-store sales declined 1.6 percent. “We’re very pleased with our third-quarter earnings performance,” Gregg W. Steinhafel, Target’s chairman and chief executive said in a news release. Target’s credit card segment profit increased to $60 million, up from $35 million last year, because of better portfolio performance. Saks, the luxury department store, also broke free from the trend of earnings declines, posting a modest profit, mainly because it controlled expenses. Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, said in a conference call that the environment “appears a bit more stable and predictable” and that in the long run, he was “confident luxury will rebound.” Customer traffic declined by low single digits, up from double-digit declines. And the average purchase at the cash register was flat to up slightly. In recent months Saks has cut its inventory to be in line with lower demand, and the chain introduced more affordably priced and exclusive merchandise to appeal to the new frugal-minded consumer. For the three months ended Oct. 31, Saks made a profit of $1.9 million, or a penny a share, in contrast to a loss of $43.7 million, or 32 cents a share, last year. Same-store sales declined 10.1 percent year-over-year. Revenue declined 8.5 percent, to $631.4 million, from $690.3 million a year ago. While the company said sales remained weak, certain categories  women’s designer sportswear, jewelry and some accessories  began to perform better. Shares of Saks rose 4.06 percent on Tuesday, or 26 cents, to close at $6.67. More good news on Tuesday came from TJX Companies, which owns chains including TJ Maxx and Marshall’s and has been on a tear as consumers seek out bargains. The chain posted record sales and earnings for the three months that ended Oct. 31. For the third quarter, the company had a profit of $348 million, or 81 cents a share, up 40 percent from last year. Same-store sales rose 7 percent from the period a year ago, and customer traffic was robust. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $5.24 billion. Carol Meyrowitz, president and chief executive of TJX, said that with the company’s “value proposition and various off-price concepts, we have a broad customer appeal that spans a wide range of demographic groups.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 18, 2009, on page B9 of the New York edition.</text></article>

On Nov. 21, El Museo del Barrio started Target Super Sábado, which provides free tickets on the third Saturday of every month for exhibitions, concerts, gallery tours, art-making workshops, film screenings and spoken word recitals. And Alvin Ailey's American Dance Theater's celebration of the 20th anniversary of its artistic director, Judith Jamison, includes Target Twenty Night on Dec. 3, a performance for which every ticket is $20. Tickets went on sale Oct. 3; people started lining up at midnight; the box office opened at 9 a.m. and the performance was sold out by noon. These programs are among many that Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, has made available recently to cultural organizations all over the country. Despite an economic downturn that has seen many corporations and foundations cut back or eliminate their charitable giving, the company has maintained its philanthropy -- giving 5 percent of its income, or $3 million a week, to causes in the arts, education, social services and volunteerism. Applying its brand message -- ''Expect More. Pay Less'' -- Target is sponsoring more than 2,200 free days and reduced price performances at 100 museums and performing arts organizations nationwide, from the Seattle Art Museum to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., to the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, Calif. ''Target is an unusual company in the magnitude of its cash support for the arts,'' said Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center. ''They back it up with a significant amount of advertising. There is a strong identity of a national company and lots of notice around it.'' Mr. Levy, an expert on nonprofit fund-raising, said the retailer's support has become essential to arts groups ''at a time when companies are struggling with respect to their earnings.'' The Minneapolis-based Target Corporation, which has more than 1,600 stores nationwide, has been supporting cultural institutions since 1946. ''We remain committed to the arts and committed to making it affordable to families,'' said Laysha Ward, the company's president for community relations. The danger with any corporate sponsorship is that the company might place restrictions on the nature of the art. Ms. Ward said that while Target was careful to select programs that fit with its image, it did not involve itself in artistic content. ''We're not looking to censor,'' she said, adding that Target does not dictate what a cultural organization ''should and shouldn't present.'' In an effort to make the arts accessible to schoolchildren and cultural experiences affordable for children and families, the company pays for trips to the theater or symphony, for artists' residencies and for workshops in schools. In 2009, more than 1,100 of its recipients of grants for field trips will attend an arts-related outing, including visits to museums, music halls and theaters. As part of its ''Dream in Color'' campaign, Target has announced its sponsorship of five Congressionally designated heritage months at the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies: Hispanic Heritage (Sept. 15-Oct. 15), American Indian Heritage (November), Black History (February), Women's History (March) and Asian Pacific American Heritage (May). The events include performances, discussions, films and classroom resources. Target is the main supporter of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's community programs, including its annual Halloween extravaganza and the BAMkids Film Festival. ''They've been an ongoing partner,'' said Karen Brooks Hopkins, the president of BAM. ''They've continued to be supportive, and they've continued to work with us on the composition of the programs.'' The free events have become a Target signature -- Friday nights at the Museum of Modern Art, Monday nights at the Chicago Children's Museum, Saturday nights at the Brooklyn Museum.</text></article>

At first, Amazon appeared to be the low-price player when it extended its $9 price tag to three hardcover books that were officially released Nov. 3. Amazon had originally offered that price in response to price-cutting by Wal-Mart on its Web site for preorders of 10 titles that included the three that were released Tuesday: “Ford County” by John Grisham, “The Lacuna” by Barbara Kingsolver and “Kindred in Death” by J. D. Robb. As of Tuesday morning, Amazon still had those titles priced at $9 while Wal-Mart, which had offered them on pre-order at $8.98, and Target, which had offered pre-orders for $8.99, had raised their prices. At Walmart.com, for example, “Ford County” was selling for $12, while “The Lacuna” was $13.50. At Target.com, “The Lacuna” was on sale for $18.89 and “Kindred in Death” was $17. But by late morning, Amazon had raised its prices  “The Lacuna” and “Kindred in Death,” for example, were offered for $13.50  while Walmart.com had cut them again. All three novels that went on sale Tuesday were on sale at Walmart.com for $8.99, but by the afternoon, Walmart.com had raised its prices to just one penny lower than the price for the three titles on Amazon. In an e-mailed statement, a spokeswoman for Walmart.com said that it would “continue to adjust our pricing accordingly and as needed on these books.” Skip to next paragraph Blog ArtsBeat The latest on the arts, coverage of live events, critical reviews, multimedia extravaganzas and much more.

It was around 2:10 p.m., and the sales count on a $99.99 leatherlike coat with a plush collar was up to 16,011. A woman on the phone was saying, “You can smell Europe looking at your design.” Mr. Falchi, a Brazilian who got his start dressing rockers and jazzmen in 1970s Greenwich Village  where he still lives with Missy, his wife of 25 years  mumbled something about his roots. Then there are those nights in New York when he and his wife are out at some hip place like Freemans, on the Lower East Side, and they see a young woman at the bar with an old buffalo bag of Mr. Falchi’s on her shoulder. Once he said to a girl, “That’s my bag.” She didn’t care for the remark, but then it sank in that this pot-bellied, gray-haired guy with silver bracelets was really him, the designer Carlos Falchi. Maybe in an age of brands and manufactured nostalgia she didn’t even think he was real. She called her mother, who bought the bag 30 years before, and put Mr. Falchi on the phone and then closed the celebrity moment with a photo. That’s how it is with him. One day he’s busing tables at Max’s Kansas City  it’s 1970  and going home to bleach snakeskin in his bathtub on Eighth Street for patchwork pants. Jimi Hendrix is a neighbor. Forty years later, after experiencing just about everything you can imagine  early success, the implosion of the Japanese economy (“That was a big wham”), the It Bag craze, the loss of his name to another company  he gets a call from Target. The mass merchandiser wants him to produce a line of bags. They will be available Nov. 1 for two months. “My life has been a chart,” Mr. Falchi, 65, said not long ago, making an up-and-down motion with a finger. Maybe the weirdest thing about him is that he’s still here. Target has made a business of tapping high-end designers like Alexander McQueen to do collections at affordable prices. In turn, they receive exposure that dwarfs their sophisticated audiences. Drawing on his squashy, patchwork style, Mr. Falchi produced 10 shapes  hobos, satchels, totes  in black, brown and plum shades of faux snakeskin. Prices are $19.99 to $49.99. On Thursday, as she watched her husband sell the separate HSN line on television, Ms. Falchi, in the couple’s office on West 39th Street, acknowledged Target’s expectations. “It’s a high-stakes design competition,” she said. “You want to put out your best work. It has to look innovative. Carlos worked very hard on the bags. And Target tends to pick younger designers.” Perhaps, despite the synthetic materials used for the Target bags, the appeal is that Mr. Falchi is a craftsman. He is one of the last makers of leather goods in New York. He employs about 60 people on three floors of the building on West 39th, and the bags he makes for stores like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks start from pieces of python, alligator and ostrich, among other skins. Prices for those bags can reach $5,000, though many are around $1,500. At a visit to his workrooms in August, multicolor pieces of leather were stacked like poker chips; virtually every scrap is saved and used in patchwork. As Mr. Falchi looked over some crocodile-embossed leather satchels being made for an order, there was a steady tapping of hammers at the worktables. Below a faded picture of Miles Davis in a pair of Mr. Falchi’s trousers from the ’70s was an oblong piece of crocodile. “That’s about $900,” he said. “I need almost two skins for a bag, so that’s about $1,500 alone in materials.” In another room, a big, smooth, yellow-pale shoulder bag, pinched at the front with a drawstring and evocative of the 1970s, was hanging from a peg. “That bag was done many moons ago,” Mr. Falchi said, touching it. “This is vegetable-tanned leather. You cannot kill that leather.” In just about every way, a Falchi bag represents the opposite design aesthetic of an Hermès Kelly bag, though Mr. Falchi says he uses some of the same tanneries as the French house. The most obvious difference  and it nearly put him out of business a few years ago  is that a Falchi bag is soft and unstructured. When fashion turned ladylike and accessories became formal, Mr. Falchi tried to make a version of the Kelly. “What a disaster,” he said. “I just couldn’t do it. The hand wasn’t there.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Fashion &amp; Style » A version of this article appeared in print on October 29, 2009, on page E1 of the New York edition.CARLOS FALCHI’S life must feel weird to him at times.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/books/23price.html?ref=targetcorporation">Book Association Challenges Retailers’ Price Plan<date>Published: October 22, 2009</date><text>The American Booksellers Association, which represents independently owned bookstores, has sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to investigate what it describes as “predatory pricing” by Amazon, Wal-Mart and Target. Skip to next paragraph Related In Book-Pricing Battle, How Low Can They Go? (October 21, 2009) In the letter dated Thursday, the association argues that steep discounting on 10 hardcover titles by authors including John Grisham, Stephen King and Barbara Kingsolver “is damaging to the book industry and harmful to consumers.” The price war began last week when Wal-Mart announced that it would offer Walmart.com customers who preordered any of 10 of the coming holiday season’s biggest potential best sellers the chance to buy the books in hardcover editions for just $10. Typically new hardcovers sell for $25 to $35, although some discounting is common. Amazon.com quickly matched Wal-Mart’s preorder price on the same books, which include “Ford County” by Mr. Grisham, “Under the Dome” by Mr. King and “Going Rogue,” Sarah Palin’s memoir. Wal-Mart then lowered the price to $9, and Amazon followed suit. By late Friday afternoon Wal-Mart had cut another penny off the price. On Monday, Target entered the fray by offering six of the preorder titles on Target.com for $8.99. By Tuesday Wal-Mart had lowered the price on those titles to $8.98. The association’s letter, which is signed by the group’s nine board members, accused the retailers of “devaluing the very concept of the book” and effectively selling the books at a loss in an “attempt to win control of the market for hardcover best sellers.” Retailers typically pay publishers a wholesale price of half the list price of a hardcover book  so on a $35 hardcover, the retailer pays $17.50, meaning that it loses money on a $9 consumer price. Most publishers whose titles were affected did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. But David Young, chief executive of Hachette Book Group  publisher of James Patterson, whose “I, Alex Cross” is included in the discounted promotions  said he wished that the United States would emulate France’s prohibition against booksellers’ pricing books below cost. “I do think this massive devaluation of the industry’s crown jewels could very quickly be extremely harmful,” Mr. Young said. “And I would not be alone in thinking that.” More Articles in Books » A version of this article appeared in print on October 23, 2009, on page C2 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Drive in East Harlem, has proceeded at a glacial pace. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ruby Washington/The New York Times East River Plaza in East Harlem. A Costco store opens there on Nov. 12, with more stores moving in next spring. Ruby Washington/The New York Times David Blumenfeld began working on the project in the early 1990s. David Blumenfeld, the scion of a Long Island real estate family, first spotted the dormant Washburn wire factory in the early 1990s, while commuting to work in Syosset. To Mr. Blumenfeld, then in his 20s, the site seemed to offer the perfect chance to introduce suburban-style big-box shopping in Manhattan. Nearly two decades later, workers are finally preparing for the Nov. 12 opening of the shopping center’s first tenant: a 110,000-square-foot Costco wholesale warehouse club, the borough’s first. Target, Best Buy and Marshall’s will start moving in next spring. Of 485,000 square feet, only 30,000 are not yet spoken for. The opening is coming 15 years after the Blumenfeld Development Group, headed by Mr. Blumenfeld’s father, Edward, worked with Canyon Capital Realty Advisers of Beverly Hills, Calif., to buy the six-acre site, which stretches from 116th Street to 119th Street, for $3.1 million at a foreclosure auction. Five years later, the project was approved by the City Council. In 2004, Canyon Capital sold its interest to Forest City Ratner. Many factors contributed to the delay, including a long battle with a cabinetmaker whose shop occupied land needed for a parking structure with 1,248 spaces. (Finally the developers bought his shop and five other properties.) The project was stalled for years over the question of whether public subsidies or shoppers would help defray the costs of the parking garage. Mr. Blumenfeld said the project lost a lot of political muscle when Randy A. Daniels, the state official who had championed it, took a job in the private sector. Mr. Daniels described the delay as a classic example of what is wrong with the development process in New York. “It takes too long to get anything done,” he said. “There are many missed opportunities because of that.” Now 45 and graying at the temples, Mr. Blumenfeld said he never expected the project would consume so many years. “We’ve been to hell and back to get it done,” he said. In the interim, the price tag ballooned to $500 million, partly offset by about $80 million in tax credits and other subsidies. In 1999, the price was estimated as $150 million. One of the largest developments in northern Manhattan in decades, East River Plaza is the most significant commercial development in East Harlem since a Pathmark supermarket opened on Lexington Avenue and 125th Street in 2000. The Target store will be the first to be fully situated in Manhattan (a Target in the Bronx dips its toe into the Marble Hill section of Manhattan). But these days, East River Plaza no longer seems quite so pioneering. Superstores have proliferated in New York City, and some retailers like Home Depot have squeezed into smaller urban spaces, often on multiple floors. As the crime rate fell, retailers stopped shunning poor neighborhoods and developers took advantage of financial incentives. Even stacking large retailers on top of one another is no longer a novelty. One new example is Gateway at Bronx Terminal Market, on 149th Street in the South Bronx, which took just five years to build, though it is twice the size of East River Plaza. Mr. Blumenfeld said the Related Companies, which developed Gateway, got the benefit of his trailblazing, even hiring the same architectural firm, GreenbergFarrow. “Obviously, things went a lot faster for Related,” he said. Related officials have said they were inspired by Dadeland Station, a big-box center in Miami. Mr. Blumenfeld said his first challenge was getting superstores to accept the idea of operating in Manhattan. He said national chains could not imagine that apartment dwellers, especially renters, would shop in their stores. “They all told me I was crazy,” he said. Then, too, there were the logistical problems that big-box retailers do not encounter in the suburbs. How efficiently would the traffic flow through narrow urban streets? How would freight be moved to the higher floors? Eventually, Home Depot and Costco agreed to be anchor tenants. “It took years to get to that point,” Mr. Blumenfeld said. Because of the delays, however, the developers had to redo the leases. The second time, Costco thought it had a deal but the developers decided to lease to Target. But then Home Depot slowed its expansion plans because of the recession and opened a store at Gateway while surrendering its space at East River Plaza to Costco. Jeffrey H. Brotman, the chairman of Costco, said he expected annual sales at the East Harlem store to exceed $2,000 a square foot, about double the average. While some residents living near the project are angry about the prospect of more noise and traffic, most residents are eagerly awaiting its opening, said Robert J. Rodriguez, the chairman of Community Board 11 in East Harlem. “The overwhelming sense in the community is that this has been slated to happen for so long, the community really wants to see the benefits of this project,” he said. Under an agreement with the developers  including such concessions as the installation of double-paneled windows at the developers’ expense, to block out noise for nearby residents  a local nonprofit group is helping Costco recruit workers from the neighborhood and has identified 900 qualified candidates, more than twice the number of available jobs, he said. The project began to pick up speed after Forest City, a partner in the development of the headquarters building of The New York Times Company on Eighth Avenue, became involved. Having a well-connected local partner added strength to the project, Mr. Blumenfeld said. The thorny question of who would pay for the $62.4 million garage was resolved when the tenants finally accepted the notion of paid parking  $4 for two hours, and an additional $9 for a third. As his project nears completion, Mr. Blumenfeld said he was disappointed that the city’s Planning Department had not allowed him to make the center’s brick-and-limestone facade more eye-catching from the highway. “This is one of the first properties you see when you come into Manhattan,” Mr. Blumenfeld said. “It deserves something more iconic.” Under a design commissioned from Kevin Roche, a Pritzer Prize-winning architect, the facade would have been draped in mesh, with an American flag sandblasted onto it. But city officials issued a stop-work order in 2007 after the Planning Department discovered that the facade did not conform to the design that had been approved in 1999, said Rachaele Raynoff, a spokeswoman for the department. Though the flag design was not rejected on aesthetic grounds, “that is not to say that anybody liked it,” she said. Amanda M. Burden, the planning commissioner, was one of three commission members to vote against East River Plaza in 1999. “I don’t think she thought this was the right use for the site,” Mr. Blumenfeld said. Ms. Raynoff said Ms. Burden would not offer an opinion on the shopping center. The developers got a big shock last Dec. 11, when Bernard L. Madoff, the Blumenfelds’ close family friend, was arrested and accused of a multibillion-dollar fraud. Edward Blumenfeld’s personal guarantee for the East River Plaza loan was collateralized by his investment with Mr. Madoff, and Ruth Madoff, Bernard’s wife, made a small investment in the project, David Blumenfeld acknowledged. “It was a terrible day for us,” he said, without further comment. Looking back on his experience at East River Plaza, Mr. Blumenfeld said that developers of complex projects needed a lot of patience. “Ten to 15 years is probably the right time horizon,” he said. “I don’t know if a lot of people have the stomach for that.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the architect involved in the development of East River Plaza. It is GreenbergFarrow, not Greenberg &amp; Farrow. More Articles in Real Estate » A version of this article appeared in print on October 21, 2009, on page B5 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Related Book Association Challenges Retailers Price Plan (October 23, 2009) Target, the discount retailer known for its low prices on dish detergent, home furnishings and Isaac Mizrahi clothes, has entered the battle to bring down the price of some of the holiday season’s biggest anticipated hardcover books to the lowest possible level. And Wal-Mart, which started it all and has vowed to maintain the lowest prices, immediately fired back. On Monday Target began offering customers who ordered any of six soon-to-be published books on its Web site the same $8.99 price that Wal-Mart has been offering since Friday for 10 titles on its Web site. Wal-Mart.com had originally offered the books for $10, then dropped to $9 on Friday after Amazon.com had matched its $10 price. When Amazon also went to $9, Wal-Mart cut its price by just a penny. And sure enough, when Target.com, the newcomer to the price war, matched that $8.99 on six of the books, Wal-Mart responded on Tuesday by dropping its price on those books to $8.98. Target says it soon will include the four remaining books on its discount list, as well. The books include Sarah Palin’s “Going Rogue”; “Under the Dome” by Stephen King; “I, Alex Cross” by James Patterson; “Pirate Latitudes” by Michael Crichton; “The Lacuna” by Barbara Kingsolver; and “Ford County,” a short-story collection by John Grisham. Amazon had not cut any pennies as of Tuesday afternoon and was sticking with $9. It’s a contest “that has no end in sight,” said Michael Norris, an analyst with Simba Information, which provides research and advice to publishers. Mr. Norris said the price war could be particularly damaging to booksellers because they could not afford to discount that heavily, while the retailers who were slashing prices “don’t need to sell books in order to stay in business” and therefore can sell the books at a loss. “Obviously, authors don’t own our physical books, just the words inside, so we have no control over how they’re sold,” Ms. Kingsolver said. “But we can ask our readers to consider how much they value their local bookstores. If this price war is another way of using volume discounts to put independent booksellers out of business, then every thoughtful reader is going to lose in the long run.” Publishers typically sell hardcover books to retailers at half the list price, while retailers set consumer prices. Most of the books discounted by Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon are listed at a minimum of $24. Mr. King’s novel has a list price of $35. At $8.99 or $8.98, that is about 75 percent off the list price. When the price war began last week, Mr. King said he was “gobsmacked” by this turn of events, comparing it to gas stations in the 1970s that tried to undercut one another penny by penny. “I don’t think it’s a good thing for books to be perceived to be low-value items,” said David Young, chief executive of Hachette Book Group, Mr. Patterson’s publisher. “A hell of a lot goes into the creation of a book or a career of a writer, and to have our top products savagely discounted is not good for the long-term health of our business.” More Articles in Books » A version of this article appeared in print on October 21, 2009, on page C3 of the New York edition.</text></article>

When a real Twin blasts a homer next season, the sign will light up and the gigantic Twins will shake hands. On some nights, it will probably seem as if they should be wearing winter gloves.

Go to the Bats Blog » Major League Baseball Live Scoreboard Standings | Wild Card Stats | Injuries Yankees Schedule/Results Roster | Stats Mets Schedule/Results Roster | Stats The next regular-season game the Twins play here will be played outdoors. After the sloppy Twins lost to the Yankees, 4-1, to end their season on Sunday night, they will leave their drab dome behind and move 12 blocks away to a charming $420 million ballpark. The new place does not have a retractable roof. The Twins spent 28 seasons playing their games under a dingy white roof and in one of the loudest environments in professional sports. Now the Twins will have a heated field where they will feel raindrops and maybe snowflakes. The prospect of frigid late-season games does not worry the Twins. “It’s October baseball,” said Dave St. Peter, the president of the Twins. “I hope we have that problem every year.” When Carl Pavano tossed the first pitch to the Yankees’ Derek Jeter on Sunday in Game 3 of the division series, it was 68 degrees in the Metrodome. It was 39 degrees outside with a chance of snow. So, if the Twins had played this game in their new 39,800-seat park, they would have needed coffee and hand warmers. Instead, it was another shrill, climate-controlled night in a dome where the Twins finished 1,227-1,040. The Twins were a glossy 8-0 in the World Series, but they lost their last seven postseason games here. Kirby Puckett had the highest average (.344) and played the most games (914) here. Dave Engle hit the first home run, and Jorge Posada ripped the last, a game-winning shot off Carl Pavano. Nick Punto’s base-running blunder was the last and fatal mistake by the Twins at the Metrodome. “We’ve had some really good times in this building,” said Twins closer Joe Nathan, who scooped some dirt off the mound and plans to sprinkle it on the new mound. At Target Field, the Twins snaked 41 miles of cable underneath the field to ensure that the temperature never dips below 40 degrees. St. Peter said the Twins monitored weather conditions and would have had no postponements if they had played outdoors in 2009. St. Peter explained how Jerry Bell, the president of Twins’ Sports Inc., which is the parent company of the team and oversees the design, development and construction of Target Field, “fought for 10 years” to try to get a retractable roof. But Bell said a roof would have added $125 million to a $550 million project, which includes the ballpark and infrastructure expenses. The Twins, who have contributed $180 million, have no plans to add a roof. “I don’t think we’d have as nice a park,” Bell said. “You can’t put that roof in a closet.” Target Field has a batting cage, a pitcher’s mound and a sprint track near the dugout and has a weight room, none of which exist at the Metrodome. The clubhouse is 2,700 square feet, almost twice as big as the old one, and there is a hydrotherapy pool area that Joe Mauer might rent space in. Because the Twins clinched two World Series titles at the Metrodome, St. Peter called leaving “bittersweet.” Otherwise, St. Peter was not overly nostalgic. The Twins will have a 23-foot-high right-field fence at Target, just as they did at the Metrodome. The Twins dug up home plate and the pitcher’s rubber, but St. Peter said they would not be relocated to the new park. “Morneau and Mauer are coming from the Metrodome,” St. Peter said, referring to the Twins’ best players. “That’s about it.” When St. Peter was reminded that Mauer was signed only through 2010, he told a group with reporters from Boston and New York that Mauer would be here another year “before you guys try to steal him.” The Mets paid tribute to Jackie Robinson at Citi Field, but their first-year park was criticized for failing to honor their former players. The Twins did not forget their own in a one-million-square-foot park that most resembles San Francisco’s AT&amp;T Park and Pittsburgh’s PNC Park. There are gates that are numbered and named after Harmon Killebrew (3), Tony Oliva (6), Kent Hrbek (14), Rod Carew (29) and Kirby Puckett (34). There is a bar called 573 for Killebrew, who had 573 homers, and one called Hrbek’s that Bell said would have “a lot of beer” and not much food. Now that the Twins have played their final inning at the Metrodome, St. Peter predicted that Target Field would “be viewed as a gem” among ballparks. That may be true. Just remember to bring some gloves. More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on October 12, 2009, on page D7 of the New York edition.</text></article>

According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of sales, the book sold just 2,000 copies. Skip to next paragraph Indeed, the book, by the first-time novelist Tatiana de Rosnay, was well on its way to sinking out of sight last fall when Target, the discount retailer, chose the paperback version of “Sarah’s Key” as its Bookmarked Club Pick: a choice for a program that designates titles for prominent display throughout the chain’s stores. Suddenly sales exploded. A special edition of the novel that its publisher, St. Martin’s Press, produced exclusively for Target has sold 145,000 copies. The ordinary paperback edition has sold 200,000 copies, and this Sunday will be its 22nd week on the New York Times trade paperback fiction best-seller list. In publishing circles Target has long been known as a place that can move many copies of discounted best sellers, as do other mass-merchant retailers like Wal-Mart and Costco. But in the last few years, much in the way it has cultivated its image as a counterintuitive purveyor of Isaac Mizrahi clothes or Michael Graves tea kettles, Target has been building itself into a tastemaker for books. Through its book club, as well as a program it calls Bookmarked Breakout, both started in 2005, the company has highlighted largely unknown writers, helping their books find their way into shopping carts filled with paper towels, cereal and shampoo. Compared with a large chain bookstore like Barnes &amp; Noble, which averages about 200,000 titles per location, Target carries only about 2,500 titles in each of its 1,700 stores. Offerings include diet books, children’s picture books, young-adult novels and series romances. Paperbacks far outnumber hardcovers, and over the last decade Target has focused on the larger trade format as opposed to the smaller mass-market paperbacks. (The other big-box retailers rely mostly on the biggest commercial books of the moment, though Costco does on occasion offer its own special picks of little-known authors.) Virtually every book at Target is shelved face out. Books in the book club and Breakout program are set apart on so-called endcaps  narrower shelves that stand at the front or end of aisles  with specially designed signs. At a Target in Clifton, N.J., last week, one top shelf was devoted exclusively to the current book club pick, “The Wednesday Sisters” by Meg Waite Clayton. Five small stacks were lined up, face out, while lower shelves held previous selections, including “The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes” by Diane Chamberlain and “Still Alice,” a first novel by Lisa Genova. Another endcap featured Breakout books under a sign that read “Hand-Picked Titles From Emerging Authors” and showed a picture of a small chick pecking its way out of a broken eggshell. Not surprisingly, the conspicuous display helps sell books. “Still Alice,” which was a Target book club pick early this year, has sold 51,000 copies in its Target edition. Louise Burke, publisher of Pocket Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster that released “Still Alice,” said that the book  which has sold 174,000 copies over all, according to BookScan  has sold more in Target than in any other outlet. And after the chain anointed “The Year of Fog,” a novel by Michelle Richmond about a child’s disappearance, in April 2008, the book went on to sell 152,000 copies of its Target edition, according to Bookscan. Target “can sell hundreds of thousands of copies of a book that is virtually unknown in the rest of the marketplace,” said Jacqueline Updike, director of adult sales at Random House, one of the world’s largest publishers. By assembling a collection of books by unheralded authors, Target behaves more like an independent bookstore than like a mere retailer of mainstream must-haves (although, of course, Target sells its share of best-seller list regulars, like James Patterson and Janet Evanovich). “Target says every month, ‘Here are some new titles we’re bringing to you, and you can trust us, even if you haven’t heard of them,’ ” said Patrick Nolan, director of trade paperback sales for Penguin Group USA. “That is a very different approach.” Danielle Owens, a 24-year-old receptionist in Virginia Beach, Va., regularly buys clothes and other supplies for her 2-year-old son at Target. Last fall she wandered into the book section looking for a book for her son and noticed “Come Back,” a mother-daughter memoir of drug addiction and recovery by Claire and Mia Fontaine that had been a club pick in 2007 but was still featured on the book club shelf. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Books » A version of this article appeared in print on July 22, 2009, on page C1 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/theater/reviews/07bullseye.html?ref=targetcorporation">Superstore Me: Guilt, Rituals and Red Bags<date>Published: July 7, 2009</date><text>When Target opened in 2004 at the Atlantic Terminal Mall in Brooklyn, this Minnesota-based superstore, trying to fit in, threw an invite-only party where a D.J. and local celebrities (including Maggie Gyllenhaal and Lizzie Grubman) mingled among two floors of Gatorade, kitchen appliances and reasonably priced consumer goods. But making Target cool is not easy, and inviting Sandra Bernhard to host was asking for trouble. According to a write-up in The Brooklyn Paper, when she started telling customers about designer burkas for sale, one store spokeswoman remarked, “She’s not exactly on the Target message.”

Target has not attracted the controversy of the nearby Atlantic Yards project, which plans to add a stadium and a new skyline of towers to downtown Brooklyn. But for some locals it’s part of the out-of-scale corporate sheen that threatens the spirit of their leafy borough. Anxiety about this development is stylishly illustrated in “Behind the Bullseye,” an intimate Target polemic that looks like one of Reverend Billy’s nightmares staged by Robert Wilson on a budget.

Based on interviews with employees and shoppers, this multimedia experimental piece, a Sponsored by Nobody production, presents shopping as a kind of religious experience complete with rituals, hypnotic music and a healthy helping of guilt. The customers, dead-eyed and dour, have only a few distinguishing characteristics. For Sarah Stephens’s White Woman, it’s her nervous eyes and breathy voice, while Sauda Jackson’s Black Woman is all exhaustion and umbrage. They describe their mundane routines, while the employees build a circular shrine of red shopping bags, bright blue drinks and cereal boxes.

Kevin Doyle’s script connects the store to the global marketplace through Asian Woman (Natalie Kim), who works overseas making textiles, appliances and other goods. With a defeated look on her face, she says of her work, heavy-handedly, “Everything same same.”

Most audience members will find the images more potent than the ideas. Mr. Doyle, who also directed, has a résumé that includes music videos, a talent evident in his creation of mood and the grand gesture. But his sleek style may work against him: while his message is a strident critique, it is presented in stage pictures — vivid constructions with surprising splashes of color — seductive enough to make Target look rather beautiful.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Readers’ Opinions Post a Comment About This Column on the Executive Suite Blog Add to Portfolio Target Corp Go to your Portfolio » I’ve seen my share of odd moments during annual meetings, but until Thursday I’d never seen a grown man cry during one. O.K., maybe “cry” is a bit of an overstatement for what happened. Still, it was pretty startling when, in the middle of his speech to Target Corporation shareholders, William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager who had waged an expensive, high-profile proxy fight against the company, suddenly choked up and stopped speaking. He wiped away a tear. It was early in the meeting, which was held at a soon-to-be-opened Target store in suburban Milwaukee. Target, ever the polite Midwestern company (it’s based in Minneapolis), had granted Mr. Ackman time to make a case for his board nominees to the company’s shareholders. I suspect that Mr. Ackman already knew he was going to lose; his words had an elegiac quality, like a politician delivering a gracious concession speech. “This is a great day for Target and for shareholders generally,” he said  because this was one of the few times that shareholders have been given a genuine choice for the board. He said that he had begun the proxy fight not because he had a $1 billion-plus investment in Target shares that was seriously underwater  not at all!  but because “we never want Target to be referred to as a ‘once-great company.’ ” He described the board members Target had nominated  people he had been denigrating for weeks  as “stellar.” He made it sound as if he had achieved a moral victory just by the fact that he had waged this proxy fight. Somehow, he seemed to believe, it was going to make corporate America a better place. Then  I kid you not  he started quoting John F. Kennedy. “We will pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,” he said. And that’s when the tears started welling up.  From the start, Mr. Ackman’s decision to put Target in his cross hairs two years ago has been a real head-scratcher. The founder of the $4.5 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, Mr. Ackman has gained a well-deserved reputation as an aggressive, even relentless shareholder activist. For years he attacked the monoline insurance companies, especially MBIA, and was finally vindicated when their stock prices essentially collapsed in advance of the financial crisis. He forced Wendy’s to divest itself of Tim Hortons, the Canadian doughnut chain. He has a half-dozen similar notches on his belt. Nobody digs into a company’s numbers as maniacally as Bill Ackman, and few are as dogged about pushing ideas on companies that he thinks will get the stock price up. Over the years, he has also become increasingly comfortable using the news media as a way to help put pressure on companies. When he first appeared on my radar screen, Mr. Ackman was so press-shy he refused to allow Fortune magazine, then my employer, to take his photograph. Now he happily co-hosts CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” trading bons mots with Becky, Joe and the gang. He has gone from being awkward in public to silky smooth. Indeed, Mr. Ackman had become so successful that he was able to raise $2 billion for a fund that would essentially invest in only one company  and he would then go to work generating ideas to boost the stock price. The company this new fund invested in was Target. But why? When somebody like Carl Icahn sets his sights on, say, Motorola, you may not agree with his methods, but you can’t deny he has taken aim at a seriously troubled company. But Target? In July 2007, when Mr. Ackman began buying the stock, the shares were trading in the 60s, near the all-time high. More to the point, Target isn’t exactly a troubled company. Rather, it is just about the only big-box retailer that has figured out how to compete successfully against Wal-Mart. Its 10-year stock performance is better than Wal-Mart’s. Analysts swoon over it. Customers, 80 percent of them women, love it. “Bill Ackman is an idea machine,” Target’s chief financial officer, Douglas A. Scovanner, told me a few days before the meeting. Sure enough, he began presenting Target management with highly detailed ideas, most of which amounted to sophisticated financial engineering. The company should offload its credit card risk by teaming up with a financial institution, he said. (Target is one of the few retailers to manage its own credit card portfolio, instead of handing it over to a financial institution.) It should buy back $15 billion in stock. And so on. Target, in fact, did sell off 47 percent of its credit card operation to JPMorgan Chase, which Mr. Ackman applauded at the time. (Later, he described it as a halfway measure.) But he was far from done. He then began agitating for a series of highly complex real estate transactions, the gist of which was that Target should spin off the land under its stores into a real estate investment trust. This time, after much to and fro  including many meetings with Mr. Ackman, and much consultation with its investment bankers at Goldman Sachs  Target declined to follow Mr. Ackman’s advice. Meanwhile, of course, Target’s stock had sunk, in large part because of the financial crisis. “Target’s performance has been unsurprising in that they don’t sell a lot of food and drug and other consumable items,” said Bill Dreher, the senior retail analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. “From the middle of September to the beginning of March the only thing people wanted to buy were things they could eat or drink. It had nothing to do with any missteps from the board or from management.” On the contrary, Mr. Dreher gives Target credit for cutting its costs drastically, and keeping the damage to a minimum. The stock, which bottomed out at around $25 a share, has since returned to the low 40s. (It closed Friday at $39.30.) 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on May 30, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/business/29target.html?ref=targetcorporation">Target’s Shareholders Strongly Reject Dissident Slate, Ending Divisive Proxy Battle<date>Published: May 28, 2009</date><text>In one of the most contentious proxy battles in corporate history, William A. Ackman, the activist hedge fund manager, suffered a painful defeat on Thursday in his quest to install five nominees to the board of the retail giant Target. According to preliminary tally, Target shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the company’s four incumbent directors while also supporting a plan to cap its board seats at 12, defeating a proposal by Mr. Ackman to expand the board to 13 members. Mr. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management owns 7.8 percent of Target through stock and options, failed to persuade his fellow shareholders that the company needed fresh blood in the boardroom to help it navigate the recession and compete against its main rival, Wal-Mart. Since beginning the proxy fight in March, Mr. Ackman has argued that Target’s current board lacked relevant experience in the real estate, retail and credit card business. Mr. Ackman gave an impassioned five-minute speech on shareholder democracy at Target’s annual meeting on Thursday, invoking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy as tears welled up in his eyes. “Our goal is not to criticize or embarrass anyone, but ensure Target maintains its status as one of the great companies of America,” he said. Target maintains that its stock has performed well over the long term and no board changes are needed. The meeting, held at an unfinished store in Waukesha, Wis., was the end of one of the most notable and expensive boardroom contests in recent memory. It has added fuel to the continuing debate over how much influence big shareholders like Pershing should have over a company’s business strategy. The two sides have spent at least $25 million for high-priced lawyers, bankers, public relations advisers and proxy solicitors, not to mention valuable time trying to persuade shareholders of their respective positions. Mr. Ackman’s critics argue the proxy fight has been a distraction to Target’s management, which should be focused on running its business and improving its stores. “There’s a great deal of instability that a company goes through in a proxy contest,” said Damien J. Park of Hedge Fund Solutions, a consulting firm that advises companies on shareholder activism. “I guarantee you that every single Target board discussion over the last six months has been about this proxy fight and not about setting the business strategy of the company.” Mr. Ackman says he has shed light on important issues at Target that will benefit shareholders in the long run. Before starting the proxy fight, Mr. Ackman pushed Target to spin off the land underneath its stores into a separate real estate investment trust and to sell its entire portfolio of credit card receivables. Last year, Target took his advice and sold about half of its credit card portfolio to JPMorgan Chase, but rejected the real estate plan, saying it was too risky and would put the company in tough financial position. This year, Mr. Ackman approached the company with three director nominees, but they were rejected by the board’s nominating committee. Mr. Ackman still has to deal with his own investors, which have suffered losses on Pershing’s stake in Target. In 2007, Pershing Square introduced a $2 billion fund specifically for betting on Target. In February, Mr. Ackman apologized to his investors and let some of them withdraw their cash after the fund lost 90 percent of its value. Target’s stock has risen 21 percent since then. After the meeting, Mr. Ackman said he expected to hold onto his Target shares for the foreseeable future, but reserved the right to change his mind. “It’s a disappointment not to get a majority vote, but we were the underdogs on the way in,” he told reporters after the meeting.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Graphic Retail Sales in April 2009 Add to Portfolio Target Corp BJ's Wholesale Club Inc AnnTaylor Stores Corporation Go to your Portfolio » For months, retailing professionals have said necessities like groceries and household sundries are the only items on many consumers’ shopping lists. Now, first-quarter earnings are proving that true. BJ’s Wholesale Club, the big-box discount chain, made a profit of $24.3 million, or 45 cents a share, for the three months that ended May 2, up from $17.2 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 7.5 percent, not including fuel sales, which significantly hurt the results. In a conference call with investors, BJ’s said comparable sales of food climbed 9 percent, driven by a 12 percent increase in sales of perishable food. Customer traffic was up 7 percent in the quarter, the strongest it has been in years. “We had a truly excellent first quarter,” said Laura J. Sen, the company’s president and chief executive. Apparel, jewelry and sporting goods were among the weakest categories at BJ’s. Most retailers concede that discretionary items are a tough sell nowadays. Indeed, Target, the most upscale of the nation’s discounters, is trying to strike the right balance between offering more groceries while still selling the smartly designed home goods and apparel on which it built its reputation. For the three months that ended May 2, Target made a profit of $522 million, or 69 cents a share, compared with $602 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.7 percent. Sales were driven by Target’s food and commodity categories. To lure consumers who tend to think rock-bottom prices can be found only at Wal-Mart, Target is testing a “low price promise” in some stores, enabling a customer to request a price adjustment if the same item is found for less at a local competitor. While Target is emphasizing its low prices and enhancing its grocery offerings, it wants to continue introducing fashions and housewares that distinguish it from competitors like Wal-Mart. In September, for example, Target will begin selling clothes by Anna Sui, whose designs have been worn by the likes of Cher, Sofia Coppola and Lindsay Lohan. Target has been contending not only with sluggish sales of its more discretionary items, but also a proxy fight with William A. Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and owns a 7.8 percent interest in Target. A vote at the company’s annual shareholder meeting is to take place on May 28. Still, Target’s management team was upbeat on Wednesday, and sales were better than analysts expected. Executives said some parts of the business, like monthly sales at stores open at least a year, were more stable. That seemed to be all Wall Street needed to hear. Target’s shares rose $1, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday to close at $42.94. Shares of BJ’s fell $1.69, or 4.4 percent, to close at $36.37. Discounters were not the only chains to report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, though they delivered the better news. A loss at Ann Taylor, the long-struggling women’s apparel manufacturer, underscored how badly apparel retailers have been hurt. For the three months that ended May 2, the company posted a loss of $2.3 million, or 4 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $25.9 million, or 43 cents a share, last year. Sales at stores open at least a year declined 30.7 percent compared with the previous year. At the company’s Ann Taylor division, the decline was even worse, at 42.7 percent. Even at Loft, Ann Taylor’s more casual, lower-priced segment, sales at stores open at least a year declined 24.2 percent. Shares fell 98 cents, or 11 percent, to $7.97.

The latest example starts on Sunday when visitors to the Target Corporation’s Facebook page can vote for one of 10 charities eligible to win a portion of $3 million the retailer will be giving away. “It’s a national trend, not only in the philanthropic sector but also among businesses, to look at how best to leverage social media,” said Laysha Ward, Target’s president of community relations. “Contests like this can help our nonprofit partners learn to use this new media to build not just financial resources but also awareness.” GlobalGiving, an online system through which donors can support charitable projects around the world, is in the middle of a contest that will give American nonprofit groups the chance to win as much as $6,000 and a permanent berth on GlobalGiving’s list of vetted programs. “Many nonprofits are looking to diversify sources of funding and leverage new kinds of social networks in different ways,” said Mari Kuraishi, co-founder and president of the GlobalGiving Foundation. Ms. Kuraishi and Ms. Ward also pointed out the benefits to their organizations. For Target, Ms. Ward said, the contest is an opportunity to demonstrate the company’s commitment to supporting nonprofit work and enhance its brand. For GlobalGiving, it is an opportunity to expand its work in the United States, Ms. Kuraishi said. In recent years, companies like Amazon.com and Trip Advisor have had contests similar to Target’s. And in each of the last two years, American Express has sponsored a contest called the Members Project, which gives its cardholders the chance to propose charitable projects and then vote for the one they think most deserves to win some of the company’s money. In April, the actor Hugh Jackman challenged Twitter users to explain in 140 characters or less why he should support their favorite charity. The charity supported by the most convincing “tweet” would win $100,000 from Mr. Jackman  although two organizations, Operation of Hope and Charity Water, ended up sharing the prize. Also using Twitter, Bob Woodruff, the television reporter who sustained serious injuries while covering the Iraq war, and his wife, Lee, will try to raise $1.65 million over the Memorial Day weekend for their foundation, the Bob Woodruff Foundation, which aids injured service members and veterans. The contests push charities to use the Internet in new ways. One of the surprise findings of the Case Foundation’s Giving Challenge, a contest conducted through Causes on Facebook and Parade Magazine in 2007, was that participating charities with similar missions often worked on behalf of each other so that each one would have a chance to win a daily prize of $1,000 for having the most unique donors in a 24-hour period. “One of the big takeaways from this was that some of the small guys on the block were able to do some really powerful things,” said Jean Case, chief executive of the foundation. The point of the Giving Challenge and many of the recent contests has not been to judge the participants’ fund-raising prowess but rather to gauge interest in their work and cause. Participants in the Giving Challenge, for example, won prizes based on how many unique donations they received, not how much money they raised. The Kids in Need Foundation, which works to provide free school supplies to needy children and school districts, is participating in two contests this month, Target’s and CommuniCause, which offers a “social media makeover” as a prize. David Smith, the foundation’s executive director, said the organization had been looking to cultivate more individual donors to decrease its reliance on corporate donations. “That’s why these programs are so good for us right now,” Mr. Smith said, “because they require using things like e-mail, Facebook pages and other social networking tools that we’re experimenting with to win.” On May 2, for instance, Kids in Need was 71st on the list of favorite charities on CommuniCause. It set to work sending out e-mail messages, and a few days later it had risen to ninth place, Mr. Smith said. Operation Gratitude, which sends care packages to soldiers deployed abroad, is hoping to win the Target contest to have more money to pay its biggest expense  postage. The organization, which relies on volunteer labor and corporate product donations, can ship 7,000 to 8,000 packages a day, but only if it has $80,000 to $90,000 to cover the mailing costs. “I’m by nature an incredibly competitive person, so this has kind of sparked my juices,” said Carolyn Blashek, founder of the organization. “Social networking dovetails with what we do in so many ways, and since May is Military Appreciation Month, there’s a whole lot of symbiosis for us in this contest.” More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on May 10, 2009, on page A19 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Ackman is cutting his fees and allowing investors to take what is left of their money from one of the funds he manages. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Target Corp Go to your Portfolio » Mr. Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, is suffering huge losses on a fund he started nearly two years ago to bet solely on the rise of the stock of the discount retailer Target Corporation. The fund, called Pershing Square IV, is down nearly 90 percent this year, and Mr. Ackman has been feeling pressure from investors who want to take their money out. In an effort to mollify those investors, Mr. Ackman apologized for the losses in a letter sent on Sunday. He personally committed $25 million to the fund to help pay investors. “Bottom line, PSIV has been one of the greatest disappointments of my career to date,” Mr. Ackman said in the letter. “That said, we continue to believe that we will ultimately be successful in our investment in Target.” Those who want to withdraw what is left of their capital from the fund will be paid in March, Mr. Ackman said. About 90 percent of the investors in the Target fund are also investors in Pershing’s other hedge funds, which were down 11 percent to 13 percent at the end of last year. For those investors, Mr. Ackman has agreed to forgo any performance fees on the other funds until he makes up for the current losses in the Target fund, according to the letter. The concessions could spur other hedge fund managers to cut their fees and increase the amount that investors can withdraw. Hedge funds typically charge customers yearly fees of 2 percent of total assets managed plus 20 percent of any profits. Several large hedge funds, including Citadel Investment Group and Farallon Capital Management, have halted investor redemptions in certain funds after having huge losses last year. Mr. Ackman said in the letter that he was disappointed by the fund’s “dreadful performance,” adding, “I apologize profusely for the fund’s results to date.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 9, 2009, on page B8 of the New York edition.</text></article>

In early February, Target is introducing a limited-edition collection of Orla Kiely (pronounced KY-lee) home décor products, for about $2.50 to $22. (Tablecloths with a green pear or brown floral motif are the most expensive; short plastic cups with orange or white designs are the cheapest.) Whether she is designing mugs or handbags, Ms. Kiely said in an e-mail message, she keeps the same things in mind: “I try to think of the person loving them and why.” Her favorite items in the collection are the pear canisters (available in three sizes, shown behind Ms. Kiely in her south London living room, above, starting at about $15), which she likes because they are “simple” and “striking” and because of the way the wooden lid complements the vessel. Other products in the collection include melamine serving bowls (about $20 each) and side plates (about $3.50 each). Information: target.com.

Skip to next paragraph Target THIS O.K.? A studded leather vest and shirtdress from Targets McQ collection. Related Times Topics: Alexander McQueen For his collections shown in Paris, Mr. McQueen has frequently delved into dark territories of bondage, skulls and, most recently, taxidermy, which could make some audiences understandably squeamish. Not to stereotype, but Mr. McQueen’s designs have not exactly played well in the Midwest and the Plains, where there is not a big market for gothic-inspired corsetry. Mr. McQueen would like to be better known throughout America, he said, which is why he has designed a collection for Target. It will go on sale in March under his McQ label. The clothes are inspired by rocker-chick bands and look a bit like something Debbie Harry would wear to the grocery store, meaning zippered black tights, slinky T-shirt dresses in hot pink and black tiger stripes and shirtdresses with a tattoo print. A couple of concert T-shirts show images of Liela Moss, the lead singer of the Duke Spirit, an English band that is surely well-known in Tulsa. “I’m bringing my culture to them,” Mr. McQueen said. “I wouldn’t ever design a collection where I’d think about what people would wear in the Midwest.” Tapping Mr. McQueen to design a collection seems a little odd even for Target, which has branded itself as a design maverick, given the times. (The company said Tuesday that it would lay off 600 employees at its headquarters in Minneapolis.) The McQ clothes are on average more expensive, from $19.99 to $129.99, than Target’s prior fashion collaborations, and certainly not as cheerful as anything Isaac Mizrahi would have considered. But Trish Adams, a Target senior vice president, said the line will be offered in only 250 Target stores and online, as well as during a two-day preview in Manhattan, starting Feb. 14, at 330 West Street. “We are trying to push the envelope with this,” she said. “We thought it was maybe time to come up a level in fashion credibility.” Target will also be selling a compilation album from the Duke Spirit, introducing Ms. Moss’s music to a new audience, or at least giving a clue as to who that lady is on the T-shirts. “I did think that was sort of weird,” Ms. Moss said. “But I might as well revel in thinking about all these young women either wearing this anonymous face, or maybe taking a moment to try and figure out who it is.” More Articles in Fashion &amp; Style » A version of this article appeared in print on January 29, 2009, on page E4 of the New York edition.“THERE’S a big difference between Paris and Oklahoma,” the designer Alexander McQueen said the other day, and, boy, did he have a point.

The thinking on gift cards is less extensive but has its place in that history. To the believer in the idea of gift-giving as a practice that binds individuals, and indeed societies, a store-specific piece of plastic preloaded with $50 is an offensively thoughtless dodge. To the believer in marketplace solutions to the problem of well-meaning but misguided givers, it’s a triumph of efficiency. Gift-card sales are expected to suffer this year on widely publicized fears that they’ll be rendered worthless by failing retailers. But that has overshadowed the more surprising development in the nature of the form: the introduction of gift cards with functionality. Target, which has been a leading experimenter in gift-card design, introduced a tiny digital camera that works as a gift card, and Best Buy has put out a gift card that can be plugged into an MP3 player and works as a speaker. Neither promises to impress on raw gizmo terms, but each does potentially elevate the gift card out of the realm of the purely transactional — to turn the gift card into a gift thing. Originally, of course, a gift card was just “a plastic version of a gift certificate,” notes Scott Brady, who has observed the category for years, first as a manufacturer and today as the overseer of a Web site called GiftCardCollector.com. Gift cards, along with other forms of stored-value plastic like phone cards, were once relatively rare. Nowadays it’s estimated that about three-quarters of us have given the gift of card at least once. Cumulative 2007 gift-card sales were around $97 billion, according to TowerGroup, a research firm, which expects that number to fall this year. (Numerous media accounts have pointed out that millions of dollars in unused Sharper Image gift cards were probably rendered worthless when that chain went bankrupt.) Brady figures that Starbucks was the first company to introduce significant breadth in the designs of its gift-card offerings. Target has become perhaps the most obsessed with variety, and Brady’s site has a gallery of 1,245 designs and counting that the chain has produced. (Several individual collectors — it’s a small but devoted group — have created sites dedicated entirely to Target or Starbucks cards.) Target, Brady says, has become “the most innovative with what they consider a gift card.” The key to innovation is using a bar code, instead of a magnetic stripe, to transfer value from the object to the retailer; that means the object can be something besides a thin, plastic rectangle that must be swiped. A slim box with flashing lights on the side, designed to resemble a Nintendo Wii, was one prominent example from a couple of years ago. Target’s camera card is one of about a dozen gift things it is offering this season, including a night light, a maze game, a USB drive, a tin of M &amp; M’s and a “holiday jukebox” that plays three songs. In most cases, the upshot is an object that falls somewhere between a gimmicky greeting card and a freebie geegaw handed out at a conference. One reviewer of the camera-card on Target’s own Web site called it “junk.” Others online were skeptical of the Best Buy speaker-card. Really, though, what do you expect? If you view these objects through the prism of technological innovation, the most charitable thing you can say is that they exemplify the perfection of cheap manufacturing. But that’s the wrong prism. A gift card is, in effect, a stand-in for something desired, and its lack of utility underscores the suggestion that the holidays are simply a series of pure monetary transfers. A gift thing takes a bit of the edge off that feeling, but that doesn’t mean its value lies in usefulness; it’s still just a stand-in. The fact that it does anything at all gives it utility — as a marketing gimmick. Both the Target camera-card and the Best Buy speaker-card were hyped by, approximately, every single tech and gadget blog in existence. It’s pretty clear that most, if not all, were reacting to a press release (or other bloggers) and not the thing itself, but that didn’t prevent declarations that, say, the Target camera-card was “awesome.” So you see, the real value of the card thing doesn’t go to the recipient at all. The real value is free publicity for the issuer. More Articles in Magazine » A version of this article appeared in print on December 21, 2008, on page MM24 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/magazine/30wwln-consumed-t.html?ref=targetcorporation">Delayed Gratification<date>Published: November 28, 2008</date><text>LAYAWAY Skip to next paragraph Peter Arkle More from Rob Walker at his blog, murketing.com/journal RSS Feed   Rob Walker's Consumed Column » Kmart has offered its customers the option of buying products on layaway for much of its 46-year history. What it has not done during that time, however, was make the layaway plan a central focus of an advertising campaign — until this year. Maybe you associate the layaway with low-income consumers who have few other options. But in October, Kmart television spots and direct-mail ads positioned it as a savvy and exciting way to shop “Kmart smart.” Indeed, the TV spot depicts a distinctly middle-class couple; she piles goods in a shopping basket while he stays home to rake the lush yard. The chain is evidently pleased with the results; in November, the Sears Holdings Corporation, which owns Kmart, announced that Sears itself would follow suit. Clearly the layaway plan is not a new development in the annals of retail. In fact when someone first mentioned the Kmart ads to me, my initial reaction was along the lines of: Layaway . . . what’s that again? Kmart’s program serves as a reminder. Pick your items, pay 10 percent of the cost plus a $5 setup fee on the spot; your stuff comes off the selling floor and is stored (laid away) for you; pay off the rest in regular (interest-free) installments over eight weeks, and the goods are yours to take home. Should you stop making payments on an item — or simply change your mind — it goes back to the shelves, and your money is refunded, minus that initial setup charge and a $10 cancellation fee. You can put a whole shopping cart full of goods on layaway for one fee, and many do, says Tom Aiello, division vice president of public relations for Kmart and Sears. Nancy Koehn, a Harvard Business School historian, notes that buying on installment has a long history; 19th-century-America examples include expensive farm equipment and Singer sewing machines. The layaway option — which various accounts suggest dates back to the 1920s or 1930s and which is often associated with the Great Depression — differs in a couple of ways from other installment plans. On the plus side, there’s no tacked-on interest. But gratification is delayed, and it’s not hard to see why this option lost steam as all-purpose credit cards became universally available. Wal-Mart discontinued its layaway option a couple of years ago, and Sears stopped offering layaway plans on anything except fine jewelry back in the late 1980s. Kmart’s decision to treat this throwback as a selling point can be traced back nearly a year, when the discount chain began plotting its 2008 holiday strategy. Signs of an economic slowdown were already apparent — though not so acute as they are today — and in focus groups, shoppers talked about needing alternatives to racking up a pile of plastic-enabled debt. At least some of those Kmart regulars knew the chain still had layaway, intended to make use of it and suggested more early-season sales to help them get a head start on holiday shopping. Kmart has struggled for years to change its image as the has-been retailer competing with more up-to-date rivals like Wal-Mart and Target, so hyping such a musty, old-school service seems risky, to say the least. But times have changed, Aiello says. “When we talked to customers, they gave us a lot of credit,” he says. “They didn’t see it as tired or a throwback. They saw it as a really great solution.” And not just fixed-budget consumers, he asserts, but also “more affluent people who see it as a risk-free way to get something while it’s in stock, at the price they want to pay.” At Sears, he adds, layaway’s comeback was a direct result of consumers simply asking for it. Meanwhile, a site called eLayaway.com lets Web shoppers use a version of the old payment style at a variety of online merchants, suggesting another future for such installment plans. It’s hard to know whether fresh consumer interest in the layaway is more than a one-season phenomenon. But it seems the suddenly more attractive feature of the layaway is the manner in which it enforces spending discipline. After all, credit cards don’t make people spend unwisely and rack up debt. They just don’t prevent us from doing so. Layaway is “smart” because makes it harder to behave foolishly.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Target Corp Go to your Portfolio » Growth in online sales slowed to a near halt in October, comScore, a research firm, is expected to report on Tuesday. Separately, Lowe’s and Target reported Monday that third-quarter profit fell as consumers cut back on large home-improvement projects and discretionary purchases. Online spending grew by only 1 percent over October 2007, comScore said. That was the lowest monthly growth rate since comScore began tracking e-commerce in 2001, and was down from 5 percent in September. In the past, e-commerce has been somewhat protected from cutbacks in consumer spending that have affected retail stores, because online shopping was perceived as more convenient. Consumers also turned to online outlets to compare prices easily. But goods sold online are often discretionary, and as necessities like food and energy have become more expensive, people have less discretionary income, said Gian Fulgoni, chairman of comScore. “If people are stretched to basically make their budget, it just sucks the disposable income out of consumers’ wallets, and e-commerce is really driven by disposable income,” he said. Online sales had been the one bright spot for many retailers, growing as much as 28 percent in August 2007. In October, sales of music and movies online fell 38 percent from the year before. Sales of clothes, books, computer software, video games, flowers, toys and jewelry were also negative. “Those are troubling because those are categories that in the holiday season are very popular,” Mr. Fulgoni said. Only sales of computers and hand-held devices, consumer electronics and sports and fitness equipment rose over the year before. Households with income under $100,000, which have been hit hardest by the pullback in the economy, account for two-thirds of online spending. Those making less than $50,000 have led much of the recent decline, spending 3 percent less in the last three months than they did in the same period last year, comScore said. Lowe’s, meanwhile, said its net income in its third quarter dropped 24 percent to $488 million, from $643 million the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose slightly to $11.7 billion, up 1.4 percent from $11.57 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Profit at Target decreased 23.8 percent to $369 million, from $483 million. Earnings were 49 cents a share, which beat estimates by 1 cent. Sales for the quarter, which include revenue from credit card operations, were $15.1 billion, up 1.9 percent from $14.8 billion. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, fell 3.3 percent. Target also said it would suspend its share-buyback program and cut capital spending by $1 billion.

Chipotle, the burrito chain, has installed an energy-producing wind turbine outside a new store in the Chicago suburbs. And a Florida chain called Pizza Fusion reuses the draft from its ovens to heat water. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Beth Rooney for The New York Times John Rockwell, manager of restaurant design for McDonalds, at the rooftop garden on the revamped restaurant. Across the country, a race is under way among stores and fast-food restaurants to build environmentally friendly outlets, as a way to curry favor with consumers and to lower operating costs. Most chains are focusing on prototypes at the moment, but the trend could eventually change the look and function of thousands of stores. One of the latest participants is McDonald’s, which recently opened a revamped restaurant in a gritty industrial area on the South Side of Chicago, across from a food manufacturing plant and next to the Swap-O-Rama flea market. The newly rebuilt restaurant is crammed with energy- and water-saving gadgets as varied as high-efficiency appliances, pavement that filters rainwater, and tables and chairs made out of recycled material. It even has a garden on the roof. The green building boom is partly being driven by retailers’ desire to capture the attention of consumers who have become fascinated by hybrid cars, energy-saving light bulbs and wind turbines. But more important for the companies, it is a way to shave long-term operating costs at stores and restaurants, which consume copious amounts of energy and water for ovens and fryers, heaters and air conditioners, sinks and toilets. McDonald’s, for instance, plans to take the most successful aspects of its Chicago restaurant and replicate them at new outlets across the country. “You get energy savings, and you can tell customers you are greener. That’s a win-win,” said Neil Z. Stern, a retail consultant for McMillanDoolittle in Chicago. While customers may like the idea of green buildings, Mr. Stern said he was skeptical that it would lure them into stores. “Ultimately, the reason you do it is it’s a better way to run your business,” he said. Subway unveiled its first “eco-store” last year in Florida and has opened four more. Target, Office Depot and Staples have opened green stores, and Best Buy has announced plans to do the same. A few chains are even further along. Recently, Kohl’s opened 45 stores that were built using recycled materials, water-saving plumbing fixtures and on-site recycling. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has taken the most successful techniques from prototype stores and incorporated them into all new stores, and it continues to experiment with “high-efficiency” stores that save 20 to 45 percent in energy costs when compared with more traditional stores. While the “green” moniker is ill-defined and vulnerable to exaggeration, many of the chains, including McDonald’s, are seeking certification from the United States Green Building Council, a nonprofit agency in Washington whose rating system is a widely accepted standard. Called LEED certification, for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, it provides a rating for buildings based on human and environmental health, sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. Under a new program, McDonald’s hopes to obtain certification for its prototype and then build many more restaurants based on that template, without going through the paperwork and expense of certifying each restaurant. LEED certification, though, is not without detractors, some of whom complain about the cost and inconvenience. Michael Gordon, one of the founders of Pizza Fusion, a Florida chain that has several green restaurants and boasts of its environmental ethos, said a 2,000-square-foot restaurant paid the same certification fees as one five times as large. Some others say they are uncomfortable with companies promoting their buildings as green. “There’s no such thing as a green building with a full parking lot,” said Seth Kaplan, vice president for climate advocacy at the Conservation Law Foundation. “That’s just an unavoidable truth.” Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University and a frequent critic of fast-food chains, said the green buildings were laudable but were ultimately intended to make people feel better about eating unhealthful food. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 8, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Video Ackman Discusses Target Plan Add to Portfolio Target Corp Go to your Portfolio » William Ackman, the activist investor and hedge-fund manager, proffered an idea on Wednesday that he claimed was worth billions. He wants Target Corporation, the large discount chain, to sell the land underneath its stores to a new unit set up for the purpose. Target, he proposes, would pay rent to the spinoff, with existing Target shareholders gaining stakes in the new real estate business. The supposed benefit? Mr. Ackman foresees a big increase in the total value the stock market would attach to a sliced-up Target, as much as 74 percent by his reckoning. That would include a payday of several billion dollars for Mr. Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns nearly 10 percent of Target. The potential cost? According to several analysts and Target itself, the complicated new setup would hurt Target’s credit rating and thereby raise its cost of borrowing, perhaps undermining the company’s ability to survive the economic downturn. And the company believes a sliced-and-diced Target would ultimately have less control over its stores, the lifeblood of the business. The plan might lead to transitory gains in the short run, but in the long run, “the retailer would be on much shakier ground, so to speak,” wrote Carol Levenson, director of research for Gimme Credit, a bond research firm. In an e-mail message, she added that “with overleveraged retailers going under right and left, and inhospitable lending and commercial paper markets,” the timing of such a transaction could not be worse. Maneuvers like the one Mr. Ackman suggested Wednesday are the latest variation on the Wall Street notion that the parts of a company may be worth more than the whole. Wall Street sees chopping such a company up as “unlocking value.” But in some recent cases, activist investors who pushed such deals through have been accused of wrecking the companies. For example, Mervyn’s, the bankrupt department store chain, is suing its onetime private equity owners on grounds that they crippled the company by separating the chain’s valuable real estate from its retail operations. Mr. Ackman has included features in his plan meant to avoid some of the worst problems of previous deals. In particular, he proposed that Target spin off only the land on which its stores sit, retaining long-term leases on the stores themselves. But several analysts were left scratching their heads after he presented his proposal to investors in Manhattan on Wednesday. They could not figure out if he had come up with a truly novel idea or just some financial manipulation that would end badly. Deborah Weinswig, a retail equity analyst with Citigroup, said Mr. Ackman’s presentation answered a fundamental concern that retailers always had when they contemplate a real estate spinoff: Will the company retain adequate control of its buildings? But, she added: “In this kind of environment, I don’t know if anyone wants to tamper with or wants to risk a credit-rating downgrade.” Target, which operates 1,684 stores, owns the majority of its real estate and considers it a significant asset that strengthens its balance sheet and financing options in difficult economic times. “For a retailer to have more control of their destiny in today’s environment is critical,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD Group. Mr. Ackman said his proposal was in the interest of all Target shareholders. Noting that Target owns the highest percentage of its real estate compared with other big-box retailers, he said the transaction would unlock the value of that real estate, which he said he thought had not been reflected in the company’s stock price. In Mr. Ackman’s proposal, Target would retain control of the buildings through 75-year leases. He argued that the long leases offer “bondlike stability.” “It’s a very creative and innovative way to do this,” said David Bassuk, managing director in the retail performance improvement practice of AlixPartners. Indeed, industry experts in reorganization and in mergers and acquisitions said financial engineering was likely to happen even more now, given the gloomy economy. “These conversations are going on in every single board room in every single C.E.O. suite in this country,” said Claire Gruppo, managing director of Gruppo, Levey &amp; Company. “ People are scrambling to be as creative as possible, to look at ways that they can generate cash.” “Believe me,” she added, “this is all anyone is thinking about.” Target, along with an outside adviser, Goldman Sachs, has been listening to Mr. Ackman’s ideas since May, and has put several of them into effect, such as selling part of Target’s credit card business to JPMorgan Chase for $3.6 billion. The retailer said that it would evaluate Mr. Ackman’s proposal. Target has not been faring as well in the downturn as its competitors, Wal-Mart Stores and BJ’s Wholesale Club. But many analysts say they think it is a well-managed company whose problems are a reflection of the overall retail environment  in which consumers are not buying the sorts of cheap-chic, discretionary items Target is known for. “I think that they’ll weather the tough retail environment,” Jason Asaeda, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor’s equity research, said. “The company’s still growing and they are investing in new brands.” Ms. Weinswig, who has a sell rating on the company’s shares, said she had been worried about Target’s credit card operations, uninspiring women’s clothing in the stores and the economic climate, which favors a low-price retailer like Wal-Mart. Whether Target or its investors will embrace Mr. Ackman’s proposal remains to be seen. Either way, he has perhaps already accomplished his goal. Over the last two days, as buzz about Mr. Ackman’s plan focused Wall Street’s attention on the company, its shares rose by 25 percent (closing Wednesday at $40.72), and the total market value of Target increased by more than $6 billion. The short-run gain to Mr. Ackman’s hedge fund just for presenting his idea? Roughly $600 million. Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.

The space, for which she pays $585 a month, could easily be gloomy: together, the bathroom and kitchen occupy an area the size of a closet, and are separated only by a curtain and a folding door. But Ms. Carroll, 21, who is a junior at the Rhode Island School of Design, found a way to make her apartment upbeat and original. Using a handmade stencil, she created a powder-blue polka dot wall  a playful, unexpected touch that nonetheless works perfectly with the traditional black granite fireplace. She continued the polka-dot theme with a set of sheets from Ikea, one of which she made into the curtain that divides the bathroom from the kitchen. “Most of my thrifty finds were spotted at Target, including the bedspread, desk lamp, bucket seat, industrial black shelf and the modern clock above the fireplace,” she wrote in an e-mail message. “All other furniture was purchased from Ikea.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Video Peek Pocket E-Mail Enlarge This Image That old cliché is more true than ever. Red state/blue state. Pro-choice/pro-life. Mac/Windows. And, in consumer technology: feature-listers/elegance-appreciators. Feature-listers judge a product by one criterion: how many features it has, no matter how clunky the design. A music player with FM radio must be better than one without. A phone that downloads music is superior to one that doesn’t. More megapixels  well, you get the idea. Elegance-appreciators, on the other hand, prefer something that does less, but does it better. Fortunately, this group has been on the rise lately. The iPod has achieved world domination despite having no built-in radio or Wi-Fi. The Flip camcorder, with only three buttons and no zoom, now commands 13 percent of the camcorder market. Make way for another elegant one-trick pony: a pocket-size doodad called the Peek, which sends and receives e-mail. It arrives in Target stores (and getpeek.com) next week, whereupon it will follow the usual cycle of simple, elegant tech products: 1) universal scorn by feature-listers online; 2) quiet, gradual popular acceptance by normal people; 3) bafflement on the part of the feature-listers, who still don’t get that there are two kinds of people in the world. At first, you might not see how the Peek is any different from the BlackBerry, whose design it shamelessly rips off. It’s a plastic slab (4 by 2.7 by 0.4 inches), in dark gray, aqua or dark red, with a screen and thumb keyboard on the face. On the right edge is a thumbwheel, which scrolls through lists and menus (you click inward on that wheel to select a menu command). Below the wheel is a Back/Cancel button. On top is the power button. So far, so BlackBerry. In its mission, however, the Peek is totally different. It has no ambitions to appeal to corporate America or to the kind of person who already carries a smartphone. Instead, it’s aimed at the world’s nontechnical population. The entire concept is to eliminate cost and complexity by stripping away everything but e-mail. For example, since the Peek is not a phone, it can afford to shed a microphone, speaker and several buttons  not to mention a credit check, a contract and a bunch of taxes and fees. It costs $100, and $20 a month for unlimited e-mail service that, behind the scenes, is delivered by T-Mobile’s cellular network. That’s nothing like the $60 or $70 you’d pay for a smartphone each month, but it still feels about $5 too high. Since the Peek is not a Web browser, it sheds all the complexity of plug-ins, bookmarks, downloads and so on. And since the Peek is not a business tool, it does without things like a calendar, alarm clock, games, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and anything else that would make it complicated. There are essentially only three screens: the list of messages, the open message itself and a Preferences page. If you get lost on this machine, heaven help your encounters with an A.T.M. The first time you turn on the Peek, you’re asked for your e-mail address and password. If it’s a Web-based account like Hotmail, Gmail or AOL, that’s all there is to it. The Peek automatically checks for new messages every 5 to 15 minutes, and notifies you with a little chime, a little vibrating buzz and a blinking blue light in the corner. (You can also check on demand.) If you have a traditional e-mail account  one provided by your Internet company, for example (a so-called POP or IMAP account), the setup usually involves a call to Peek technical support; you can’t input server settings yourself. The Peek handles three e-mail accounts, max. The color screen (240 x 320 pixels) is bright and clear, even in sunlight. The thumb keyboard feels satisfyingly clicky, and the keys are brightly illuminated. Nor will your jeans list to one side; the Peek weighs only 3.8 ounces. Each charge of the removable battery lasts two to five days, depending on how much e-mail you get. The power cord ends in a micro U.S.B. connector; alas, you can’t recharge the Peek from a computer, as you can with a BlackBerry or an iPod. We’re not yet in the era of universal power-cord compatibility, where we won’t need a different black power brick for every single gadget. In other words, the company saw to it that the hardware, which can’t easily be changed after the sale, was done right. But the software has room for improvement. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on September 11, 2008, on page C1 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/business/05shop.html?ref=targetcorporation">As Consumers Focus on Basics, a Sluggish August for Most Retailers<date>Published: September 4, 2008</date><text>Many retailers struggled with a sluggish back-to-school season last month, though Wal-Mart posted higher sales on Thursday as shoppers focused on buying essentials amid persistent worries about high gas and food prices. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Retail Sales in August Add to Portfolio Wal-Mart Stores Inc Go to your Portfolio » As merchants announced their August sales results, Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, reported a solid gain that beat Wall Street forecasts, as consumers stuck to low-price operators. Mall-based apparel stores, including merchants like Wet Seal and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, remained in the doldrums. And the high-end retailers Saks and Nordstrom posted weaker results as their affluent customers started to feel pinched. “Consumers are spending on necessities and looking for value and the lowest price possible,” Ken Perkins, president of the research company RetailMetrics, said. “And it’s reflective again in the results that we are seeing.” A report from the Labor Department offered more evidence that the slowing economy was taking its toll on the job market, a bad sign for consumer spending. The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits jumped unexpectedly last week, reversing three weeks of declines. The reports are not comforting to the retail industry as it prepares for the holiday season. Many merchants entered the fall season with inventories well below a year ago, but such reductions might not have been enough as last month proved to be even weaker than planned. Dan Hess, founder and chief executive of the research firm Merchant Forecast, estimated that discounts were 10 percent deeper at mall-based apparel stores than a year ago, despite a drop of 10 to 15 percent in inventories. One encouraging piece of news is that Hurricane Gustav, which hit the Gulf Coast on Monday, was not as bad as analysts had feared. But retailers are now getting ready for the next series of tropical storms, including Hanna, which could become a hurricane by the time it makes landfall in the United States on Saturday. Wal-Mart reported a 3 percent gain in same-store sales, helped by sales of groceries and back-to-school products. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a 1.6 percent increase. Including fuel, the retailer’s sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.5 percent. “The underlying business performance for Wal-Mart U.S. continued to show strength, and the improved relative performance has resulted in market share gains,” Eduardo Castro-Wright, the president and chief executive of Wal-Mart’s American stores, said in a statement. Wal-Mart expects same-store sales to rise 2 to 3 percent in the current month. At a Wal-Mart rival, the Target Corporation, same-store sales fell 2.1 percent, though that was better than the 2.6 percent decline that Wall Street had expected. The discount retailer has not fared as well as Wal-Mart in the weak economy, as Target heavily emphasizes nonessentials like home furnishings and stylish jeans. Another bright spot is warehouse club operators as shoppers buy in bulk. The Costco Wholesale Corporation announced a 9 percent same-store sales increase in August on Wednesday as higher gas prices lifted sales. Analysts had expected a 9.6 percent gain. Excluding the effect of higher gas prices, Costco’s same-store sales rose 6 percent. Among luxury department stores, Saks recorded a 5.9 percent decline in same-store sales, steeper than the 4.7 percent that Wall Street had expected. The weakest categories were women’s apparel, women’s shoes and intimate apparel, while the strongest categories were fashion jewelry, fragrances, men’s sportswear and men’s shoes. Nordstrom recorded a 7.9 percent drop in sales, a bit worse than the 7.1 percent decline expected. On Wednesday, J. C. Penney announced that same-store sales at its department store business dropped 4.9 percent, slightly better than the 6.3 percent drop that analysts had projected. Penney also predicted a mid- to high-single digit decrease in sales for the current month. Kohl’s announced a 5.8 percent drop on Wednesday, though the decline was not as steep as the 7.6 percent expected by analysts.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Bess Greenberg/The New York Times At Nostrand and Flatbush Avenues, several stores will make up a vertical mall. Besides Target and Circuit City, Davids Bridal, the Childrens Place and Payless ShoeSource will also be coming. Such were the hurdles that had to be cleared at the 300,000-square-foot Triangle Junction in the Flatbush section of central Brooklyn. Triangle Equities, a developer based in Whitestone, Queens, began working with New York City eight years ago to rejuvenate an anemic mix of mostly small retailers at Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, one of Brooklyn’s busiest hubs. At first, Triangle planned to create a large shopping center at the intersection, with Kmart as the anchor. After that company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, it scrambled to find another tenant. Last April, the center’s first store finally opened: a two-level Target, which at 225,000 square feet is the discount retailer’s largest ever. Target, which is based in Minneapolis, occupies the top two levels of the three-story center, which last week received yet another national retailer on its ground floor: a 20,000-square-foot Circuit City. According to Peter Botsaris of the Botsaris Realty Group in Manhattan, the leasing broker, tenants that have already signed on include a large David’s Bridal store; a Children’s Place; a Payless ShoeSource, which is owned by Collective Brands; and an Applebee’s restaurant, owned by IHOP. Two ground-floor spaces have yet to be leased, he said. National retailers have already flocked to other parts of Brooklyn, including the part of lengthy Flatbush Avenue that passes through downtown Brooklyn. But local real estate brokers say that until about two years ago, when it became clear that Target was really going to open a large store at the point where Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues intersect with Avenue H, they were generally reluctant to enter this area. This was the case even though it had heavy foot traffic (partly because of nearby Brooklyn College), was home to one of the busiest subway stops in Brooklyn and also was a stopover for a half-dozen bus lines. One of the biggest obstacles that Triangle Equities faced in creating the Junction was the site itself, which formerly had two parking lots, a car wash and an open portion of the Long Island Rail Road bordered by two bridge abutments. Because a third of the Junction was to sit in air space over the railroad, structural engineers working for Triangle Equities first had to design a special platform that would serve as a base for a retail center. The company also needed to build a wide pedestrian sidewalk to seamlessly connect the center to two narrow bridge abutments on the north and south sides of the center. Meanwhile, the project’s architect, the New York office of Cooper Carry, a group based in Atlanta, designed the center so that instead of looking like a very large single building  which local community groups strongly opposed  it would actually look like six smaller separate buildings, to more closely resemble other low-lying retail buildings in the area. All this was not inexpensive. When Triangle Equities bought the site for the center from the New York City Economic Development Corporation in 2004, the project was expected to cost about $70 million. Costs are now expected to add up to about $150 million. Target also had design challenges. The retailer had already shown that it was adept at building large, vertically oriented urban stores elsewhere, including at the Atlantic Terminal mall in downtown Brooklyn. But here the company had to take a standard rectangular-shaped store format and fit it onto a relatively small building site of irregular shape. “It was like taking a rectangular-shaped peg and fitting it into a trapezoid-shaped hole,” said Ben Wauford, a principal at Cooper Carry’s New York office. Mr. Wauford said that Cooper Carry skewed the layout of the floors slightly and then designed the rest of the building so Target could use leftover space for storage and a street-level entrance lobby. The company also gave the center many elevators  12 in all  so the upper-level store could be easily reached from the street as well as from an adjacent 500-car covered garage. “This was the most complex construction project that Target has ever taken on,” said Bridget Hammond, a spokeswoman for the company, which as of July had 1,648 stores. She said her company decided to install an unusually large store at the Flatbush-Nostrand intersection because the area was so heavily trafficked. Many of the retail properties around the intersection sit on relatively small lots, so it is not clear how many other large national retailers will be able to come to the area soon. Real estate brokers agree that the asking rents for ground-floor retail space within a two-block radius of the intersection have doubled, or in some cases tripled, over the last two years, to about $100 a square foot annually. Some established property owners in the area say they are already considering renovating their properties to make them more appealing to retailers looking for larger spaces. One of those owners is Stanley Liker, who, along with a group of investors, has owned for 20 years a 20,000-square-foot building across the street from the Junction, a building that used to be the old College Theater. “This is an area that used to be completely dead,” Mr. Liker said last week. For now, retail space in the area is tight. “It’s one of the tightest retail corridors in Brooklyn right now, and availability is scarce,” said Zach Mishaan, a senior managing director at the Winick Realty Group in Manhattan. Timothy King, the founder of CPEX Real Estate in Brooklyn, says he thinks the combination of so-called destination retailers at Triangle Junction, as well as its very large parking garage  a rarity in Brooklyn  will be a strong draw for shoppers outside the immediate area.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Target In a photoillustration, Target depicted the look of its bodegas, which will open on Sept. 12 with clothes unavailable elsewhere. Add to Portfolio Target Corp Go to your Portfolio » Fashions and accessories by three of them  Sigerson Morrison, Jonathan Saunders and Anya Hindmarch  will be sold in the city a month before they are available anywhere else in the country. The retailer will not open its first full-blown store in the city until next year, but it has been plastering its bull’s-eye logo around the city for years  on a big billboard in Times Square; in a fashion show with models, supported by ropes, walking down the side of a Fifth Avenue skyscraper; and by projecting images of its fashions inside Grand Central Terminal. “New York is the place you go to get noticed,” said Kathee Tesija, Target’s executive vice president for merchandising. Target is calling these temporary stores bodegas to convey an egalitarian and very New York shopping experience, said Ms. Tesija. They will be located in vacant storefronts in Midtown, Union Square, SoHo and the East Village, and will open Sept. 12, which is the end of Fashion Week. “The idea was really generated based on the Target take on Fashion Week,” she added. “This would be a way we could bring affordable design to the masses.” At the pop-up stores  which will be open for four days from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  merchandise will be priced on average at $25. Target often sells less expensive offerings from brand-name designers. In the spring, Rogan Gregory, whose designs are sold in Barneys New York for $230 to $450, created a line of clothes for Target that sold for $14.99 to $44.99. Several pieces from the collection, though, are now on clearance. A Rogan for Target sleeveless button-front dress is marked down to $8.74, from $34.99, on Target.com. As much as Target is promoting its fashion credibility in New York, it is also focusing on its role as a discounter for struggling consumers across the chain. “We can emphasize ‘Expect more’ or ‘Pay less’ depending on the economy,” said Ms. Tesija, playing on the company’s tagline. “We are putting a little bit more emphasis on ‘Pay less.’ ” In its circulars, Target is advertising fewer items and giving more prominent display to prices. In its stores, many displays draw attention to low-price sundries. Target reported that profit for the three months ended Aug. 2 fell 7.6 percent, to $634 million, compared with $686 million, for the same period last year. Sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health, declined 0.4 percent for the quarter. “The merchandise mix of, say, Wal-Mart for example is much more suited to customers now than the merchandise mix of Target,” said Bill Dreher, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. “Wal-Mart is much more of a supermarket-style discount store, and Target’s much more of a department store-style discount store.” Analysts say the current economy is not suited to Target’s core strengths, but its prospects are nonetheless strong. “What’s unique about Target within the American retailing landscape is they still have immense opportunity to grow,” said Mr. Dreher, adding that the retailer could easily double, even triple, the number of its stores, particularly in areas like New York and New England. In Manhattan, he suggested, Target would be a logical successor to the retail space currently occupied by the aging Kmarts at Pennsylvania Station and Astor Place, near New York University. “You could imagine most of the N.Y.U. dorms being outfitted from that store,” Mr. Dreher said.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Target Corp Go to your Portfolio » Saks forecast weak sales through the end of the year as an anemic economy prompted even its well-heeled shoppers to curb spending, and Target said the economic conditions were the harshest it had seen in years. Saks said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to be flat or slightly lower in the second half of the fiscal year. “We know the near term will be difficult, and that we will continue to face challenges,” the chief executive, Stephen I. Sadove, said during a call with analysts. The company, based in New York, said its net loss widened to $31.7 million, or 23 cents a share, from $24.6 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Aug. 2 and was the second quarter of Saks’s fiscal year, fell to $669.2 million, from $694.1 million. Saks said its sales weakened across nearly all regions and merchandise categories. The loss was worse than analysts had expected and the company’s stock fell 93 cents, or 8.3 percent, at $10.29 a share. Target, based in Minneapolis, said volatile back-to-school sales made it uncertain about its ability to meet analysts’ estimates for the third quarter. “The customer is very cash-strapped right now and, in some ways, our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge in that our stores are fun and unique,” the chief executive, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said on a conference call, though he made clear the company had no plans to change its strategy. “We have both what you need and what you want, and during these tough economic times, some of our consumers don’t want to be tempted as much as they have in the past,” Mr. Steinhafel said. Target said it earned $634 million, down from $686 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were higher as a result of having fewer shares outstanding, and rose to 82 cents a share, from 80 cents a share. Sales in the period, which was the second quarter of Target’s fiscal year, rose 5.7 percent, to $15 billion, from $14.2 billion, but sales at stores open at least a year slipped 0.4 percent. Its per-share results beat analysts’ average estimate of 76 cents, but its stock fell 33 cents Tuesday, to $49.72 a share.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Rob Bennett for The New York Times Lizbeth Hayek, her daughter Sarah, 11, and son Chris, 16, were lured to a Staples in Paramus, N.J., by low prices. Many retailers attract customers with very low prices on school items, and hope those buyers will also buy more expensive goods. With 1930s prices for pens, glue, notebooks and even T-shirts, the season seems more “Back to the Future” than back to school. A penny these days buys eight No. 2 pencils at Staples or a wooden ruler at OfficeMax. Fifty cents buys a watercolor set at Target. A box of 24 Crayola crayons is the cost of a gumball  25 cents. Or, as Sharon Hartley, vice president for United States marketing and sales for Crayola, put it: “Sixteen boxes of a 24-pack equals a gallon of gas.” Such pocket-change bargains, known as loss leaders, are not a novel strategy for retailers, of course. But in the first back-to-school season since the economy weakened considerably, the discounts are earlier, deeper and more creative than in previous years. Staples, for instance, has offered one-cent deals before, though this is the first year the retailer is giving away products, like Elmer’s glue. Thrift is the theme this back-to-school year: people are spending less, consolidating shopping trips, forgoing discretionary items and going without new wardrobes and backpacks. And stores are trying to play to the public mood. “I’ve seen a much higher prevalence of those types of big attention-grabber promotions this season,” said Stacy Janiak, an analyst with Deloitte. “The one-cent deals, the bundling of products or three-for-two deals. I’ve seen a lot of that, much more than in the past.” Loss leaders are called that because by selling items at a loss or even giving them away, stores can lure in shoppers who will buy other, more profitable items. Drawn by the prospect of free glue, Laura Janowski, 23, stocked up on school supplies for her siblings, 12 and 14, at a Staples store in Rolling Meadows, Ill., this week. “Now, I just need to find the 9-cent filler paper and 33-cent index cards,” she said. Even as consumers visit stores like Staples, lured in by the penny deals, they are doing much of their shopping at discount and off-price retailers. There they can buy everything from sneakers to paperclips, and prices are low throughout the store, not just on a few select items. “With the high price of gas and food this summer, it is absolutely necessary for me to try to save money on back-to-school shopping,” said Jennifer Lee, a mother of three, ages 9, 12 and 15, as she loaded her minivan with bags of folders and binders from a Wal-Mart in Rolling Meadows, Ill. “That means reusing last year’s scissors and markers, and even the old spiral notebooks that have only a few pages used.” Ms. Janiak of Deloitte said 71 percent of households would cut their spending on back-to-school items this year, with 48 percent planning to reduce spending by more than $100. Deborah Weinswig, an analyst with Citigroup, said 75 percent of consumers planned to spend less than $400 on back-to-school shopping, up from 45 percent last year. “Everyone is just much more price focused,” Ms. Weinswig said. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that Wal-Mart on Thursday announced record earnings for the three months ending in July and raised its full-year earnings forecast to $3.43 to $3.50 a share, up from $3.30 to $3.43. The bargain retailer’s profit rose to $3.4 billion, or 87 cents a share, up from $2.9 billion, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales at American stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales and a measure of retail health, rose to 4.5 percent (not including fuel) for the quarter, up from 1.9 percent last year. “Their sweet spot within the customer framework are items below $10 and items that customers are familiar with,” said Bill Dreher, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. “It’s working.” Wal-Mart has been offering back-to-school deals like a week’s worth of children’s outfits (five tops and five bottoms) for $60, though it too is selling school supplies for pennies. “You have a series of wow items,” John Simley, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said this week. “People are coming in expecting to buy a notebook. But 5 cents for a notebook? You can get 20 for a buck.” Andrew Schneider, director of global brand management for Staples, said compelling penny offers bring customers into stores. “And they then will discover the wide range of products we have,” he said. Analysts agree that in an economic downturn penny deals help retailers retain, if not gain, customers. More important, the eye-popping deals can keep a retailer at the top of consumers’ minds. “Can you afford to sell something for a penny?,” said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group’s chief industry analyst. “The answer is, you can’t afford not to.” In addition to price, a big appeal of discounters is that they offer one-stop shopping, saving consumers fuel. 1 2 Next Page » Karen Ann Cullotta contributed reporting.

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/business/01macke.html?ref=targetcorporation">Kenneth Macke, Who Led Target, Dies at 69<date>Correction: July 8, 2008Published: July 1, 2008</date><text>Correction Appended Kenneth A. Macke, a former chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the forerunner of the retail giant Target Corporation, died Saturday near his home in Napa, Calif. He was 69. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Kenneth A. Macke The cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease, said Ann Barkelew, a former spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson. In a 33-year career with Dayton Hudson, Mr. Macke rose from a sales trainee hired right out of college to chairman and chief executive of Target, which was then a division of Dayton Hudson, and on to chairman and chief executive of the entire company. When Mr. Macke retired in 1994, at the age of 55, Dayton Hudson was one of the five largest general merchandise retailers in the country, with annual revenue of $19.23 billion. In 1983, when he was elected chairman and chief executive, it had revenue of $6.5 billion. Dayton Hudson, a Minneapolis-based department store chain started in 1902 by George Draper Dayton as a dry goods store, was renamed the Target Corporation in 1999. There were 49 Target stores in nine states when Mr. Macke was chosen to lead the division in 1976, and 137 stores in 16 states by the time he was promoted to chief executive of Dayton Hudson in 1983. Target now has 1,613 United States outlets. Although there was considerable growth at Dayton Hudson in the decade that Mr. Macke led the company, there were also significant challenges. In 1987, he repelled a $6.6 billion hostile takeover by a holding company based in Washington, the Dart Group, largely with the help of Minnesota politicians who were well aware of Dayton Hudson’s standing with the state’s voters. At the time, the company employed 34,000 Minnesotans. Every Christmas, thousands of children would go to the auditorium at the company’s downtown Minneapolis store for its annual holiday show. The Dart Group tried to acquire Dayton Hudson at a somewhat vulnerable moment in 1987. Though annual revenue had grown during Mr. Macke’s tenure, earnings had been virtually flat for two years. Mr. Macke had begun reorganizing the company with the 1986 sale of the B. Dalton bookstore chain, but some divisions were struggling. The company was incorporated in Minnesota, and Mr. Macke appealed to Gov. Rudolph G. Perpich, who convened a special legislative session. In one day, an antitakeover law was written and passed. It stipulated that an investor who acquired a Minnesota company in a hostile takeover was barred from liquidating any of its assets for at least five years. The takeover effort eventually faded with the October 1987 stock market crash. The next year, Dayton Hudson’s net earnings rose 26 percent, to $287 million. In 1990, Dayton Hudson prevailed over two other major bidders, the May Department Store Company and Dillard Department Stores, in buying Marshall Field and Company of Chicago, one of the oldest names in American retailing. In 2004, Target sold Marshall Field and nine store sites of another large retailer, Mervyn’s, to May. Kenneth Anthony Macke was born in Carroll, Iowa, on Dec. 16, 1938, a son of Leonard and Carol Macke. His father worked for a wholesale candy distributor. At 15, Ken Macke was selling shoes at Anderson’s, a local store. “My dad was a born merchant,” Mr. Macke’s son Jeffrey said. “My dad absolutely loved working on Target and walking the aisles, undercover, at every opportunity.” Besides his son Jeffrey, of Bedford, N.Y., Mr. Macke is survived by his wife of 42 years, the former Kathleen O’Farrell; another son, Michael, of Napa, Calif.; a daughter, Melissa Raz of San Francisco; a sister, Judy DeGraeve of Green Bay, Wis.; a brother, Jim, of Carroll, Iowa; and five grandchildren. Mr. Macke graduated from Drake University in 1961 and within weeks was a trainee at Dayton Hudson. When he retired in 1994, Mr. Macke told The New York Times that it was time to get off the corporate treadmill. “I have spent my entire career marching to a calendar,” he said, adding, “My fondest wish is that I will have the willpower to do nothing.” Instead, besides serving on the boards of companies like General Mills, Unisys and Pillsbury, he became a mentor to many small start-up retailers. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 8, 2008 Because of an editing error, an obituary last Tuesday about Kenneth Macke, who headed the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the forerunner of the retail giant Target, misstated the disposition of the retail chain Mervyn’s when Target sold it and another chain, Marshall Field, in 2004. Target sold nine Mervyn’s store sites along with Marshall Field to the May Company in June 2004; it did not sell the entire Mervyn’s chain to May. (Target sold Mervyn’s in July 2004 to a consortium of several businesses.) More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Saks Inc., the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue stores, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday. Related Times Topics: Home Depot Inc. Times Topics: Target Corporation Home Depot, the leading home improvement retailer, and Target, the No. 2 discounter after Wal-Mart, both reported lower earnings, and warned that results for the rest of the year would be sluggish. “As gas and food prices continue to rise and housing market slows, consumers are facing increased financial pressure and reducing their spending, especially in discretionary categories,” Target’s chief executive, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said in a call with analysts. Shares of Home Depot fell $1.50, to $27.37, while Target slipped 63 cents, to $54.29. While Target and Home Depot have different business models, the weakness in consumer spending is widespread. The upscale department store owner Inc."&gt;Saks Inc. was also downbeat about prospects for the rest of this year. “I do believe that we’re in a rough economic period right now,” Saks’s chief executive, Stephen I. Sadove, said. “The consumer is operating as if we are in a recession, whether we’re technically in one or not.” Saks, which operates the Saks Fifth Avenue stores, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as markdowns pressured gross margin even though sales rose 9 percent, to $862.4 million, as consumers responded to promotions. Mr. Sadove said that higher-end consumers who crave designer brands were still willing to spend, but lower-end buyers, who represent 15 to 20 percent of Saks’s customer base, were more pressured. Target reported a 7.5 percent drop in quarterly profit as shoppers passed over clothes and jewelry in favor of basics like food. The company said profit was $602 million, or 74 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, which ended May 3, down from $651 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 71 cents a share, according to Reuters estimates. Sales, excluding credit card revenue, rose 5 percent, to $14.3 billion, bolstered by new store openings. But sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial retail gauge known as same-store sales, fell 0.7 percent. Home Depot said its profit fell 66 percent as the housing crisis hurt sales. It also took a charge to close stores and curb expansion plans. Net income fell to $356 million, or 21 cents a share, in the first quarter ended May 4, from $1.05 billion, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the charge, profit was 41 cents a share, compared with the average forecast of 37 cents. Sales fell 3.4 percent to $17.9 billion, topping estimates of $17.63 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 6.5 percent. Home Depot’s rival Lowe’s said on Monday that first-quarter profit fell 18 percent, while total sales slid 1.3 percent. It also cut its full-year earnings forecast. The Home Depot results “corroborate assessments from Lowe’s results yesterday  the sector is bumping along the bottom, lagging housing turnover by several months,” a Goldman Sachs analyst, Matthew Fassler, said in a note.

In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » WHEN New Roc City, the huge youth-oriented entertainment complex here, opened in 1999, city officials viewed it as a catalyst to help revive downtown. Built on the site of a failed mall that lasted only about 15 years  and at a time when many retailers would not risk setting up shop downtown  New Roc, with an 18-screen movie complex, bowling, miniature golf and a full-size hockey rink, was expected to help bring jobs, consumers and activity to the area. A new 25-story apartment tower across the street was supposed to help, too. In some ways, New Roc accomplished its mission: Despite periodic problems, including a melee involving hundreds of youths in April 2007, New Roc City attracted millions of people who would not otherwise have come and spent money downtown, city officials and developers say. But the recent announcement that New Roc will most likely be revamped soon to eliminate many of its entertainment properties and house two large retail stores, Target and Kohl’s, has city officials, developers and property owners saying that the two big stores’ arrival will signal that downtown is at last on the brink of its long-awaited renaissance. Opinions among advocates for downtown are mixed as to whether the discount retailers Target and Kohl’s are appropriate for a downtown that in its heyday catered to some of the state’s wealthiest shoppers (one large movie theater had fireplaces in its ladies’ room). Residents and officials who were interviewed, however, largely agreed that the retailers’ willingness to move in was proof of downtown’s impending reinvigoration  an undertaking that has been in the works so many years and has so many moving parts it can be hard to grasp. The process began in the early 1990s after the failure on this site of The Mall  which took Macy’s, the last downtown department store, with it  and has evolved with retail trends of the times. “A plan aimed at recreating the vibrant New Rochelle of 1950 is more likely to produce the dying New Rochelle of 1990,” Mayor Noam Bramson said. “We need to be focused on what our city can and should be in the 21st century and beyond.” In doing so, Mr. Bramson said, the reintroduction of department stores downtown (the first suburban Bloomingdale’s opened there in 1941, later becoming an outlet that closed in the early 1980s) is just one component of the current evolution of the area. It is based on the premise that shoppers coming to a large store like Target will spill over to smaller merchants, he said. The newly opened Trump Plaza, a luxury condominium high-rise towering 39 stories across the street from New Roc City, and the planned LeCount Square project, which calls for office space, a hotel and 200,000 square feet of retail space, are some of the other projects in the area. City officials say those developments could result in nearly 2,000 new jobs. Construction could begin on LeCount Square next year, Mr. Bramson said. The city is about halfway through this decade-long redevelopment, though efforts to keep downtown vibrant will continue long past the new construction, he said. Efforts are also continuing to restore historic Main Street, where storefronts in Art Deco buildings are undergoing restorations with help from city grants and low-interest loans. A dozen new restaurants have opened, joining a mix of existing ethnic restaurants, some with newly rehabbed exteriors and dining rooms. Long-vacant buildings on Main Street, including those that once housed Bloomingdale’s and Lillian Vernon, are finding new lives as residential loft and condominium units, all 162 of which are occupied. Also in the works is a plan to build 700 waterfront residences, retail space and a waterfront promenade at Echo Bay, an area just north of downtown that has long been home to city storage yards and environmental waste. The Municipal Arts Commission is pursuing public art. The first big project will be a stained-glass and lights display in the windowed bridge that connects New Roc City and Trump Plaza across the street, commissioners said. There also are plans to place sculptures along Main Street. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in New York Region »</text></article>

Some investors have been pressuring Target for months to make such a sale. The hedge fund investor William A. Ackman said in December that he had raised his stake in Target to nearly 10 percent in addition to stock swaps and options and that the company needed to take steps to increase its share price. Target, based in Minneapolis, is one of the last major American retailers to have kept its credit assets. Target said that the transaction should give it enough funds to carry out its business plans, including previously announced capital investment and share repurchase activity, without the need to use the term-debt capital markets again this year. The transaction is expected to close before the end of May. JPMorgan Chase will get an undivided interest representing about 47 percent of the principal amount of Target’s outstanding receivables at that time. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Leaving a Retailer... To Design for Another Add to Portfolio Target Corp Liz Claiborne Incorporated Penney, J C, Co Go to your Portfolio » Isaac Mizrahi, the everyman’s fashion oracle, is about to leave behind his wildly popular cheap-chic clothing collections at Target to be the creative director for Liz Claiborne, the stalwart shopping-mall label. Dana Buchman, a longtime favorite of customers at upscale stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, is decamping this fall to the budget-conscious Kohl’s. And Tommy Hilfiger, a constant in department stores like Dillard’s and Bon-Ton for two decades, now says he will sell his clothes only at Macy’s. Over the next year, an unusually large group of famous clothing designers, motivated by lucrative deals, plan to shift their retail allegiances, in many cases abandoning stores and customers who have supported them for years. So like angry sports fans wounded by a the trade of a star player, consumers (and even stores) are left to wonder: What ever became of loyalty? The sudden flurry of designer address changes  J. C. Penney, Gap, Old Navy and Wal-Mart have also recruited their own designers over the last six months  is likely to create jarring transitions for American consumers as they try to navigate the once-familiar aisles of their local clothing chains, wondering where to find Isaac, Dana and Tommy, among others. “There will be a period of dislodgment and disenfranchisement,” said William L. McComb, chief executive of Liz Claiborne, whose efforts to revive flagging sales hinge upon his company’s aggressive wooing of Mr. Mizrahi from Target. After Claiborne announced the move in January, Target responded by saying it would end its relationship with Mr. Mizrahi at the end of the year, leaving, for now, a void in its lineup. The motivation behind these defections and poachings is equal parts economic and egocentric. Clothing manufacturers are responding to a seemingly insatiable appetite for fashion across every income bracket. They are also benefiting from a lively, and occasionally vindictive, competition between mass retailers (Wal-Mart and Kohl’s) and the traditional department stores (Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Lord &amp; Taylor) that remain after years of industry mergers. When it comes to luring designer brands, it seems that popularly priced chains are suddenly on equal footing with their glossier rivals. For decades, department stores like Saks had a virtual lock on designer clothing labels, until Mr. Mizrahi broke that barrier with his collection at Target in 2003, which, rather than burying his career, became an estimated $300-million-a-year success. Once the stigma of crossing into mass-retail territory lifted, such high-low designer partnerships became commonplace, with Vera Wang selling a line at Kohl’s and blue-chip names like Karl Lagerfeld and Stella McCartney creating lines for H&amp;M. All this activity has raised a bar for traditional retailers like Macy’s, which rarely had to fend off competition from below. Its 2005 merger with May Department Stores, which created the country’s largest department store company, was in part an effort to use size to wield more influence over designers. The democratization of design forced Macy’s to claim exclusives it never before needed, and to punish designers who cut deals elsewhere. When Ms. Wang went to Kohl’s, Macy’s dropped her popular lingerie line. The chain cut orders from Liz Claiborne after the company offered a line called Liz &amp; Co. to Penney. “If the product is available in 50 different points of distribution in a five-mile driving radius, convenience becomes the No. 1 reason to buy a brand,” said Terry J. Lundgren, chief executive of Macy’s. “And so we lose.” That’s why Macy’s, which has begun promoting its designer relationships in television ads, persuaded Mr. Hilfiger to drop his other partnerships, infuriating regional department store chains like Bon-Ton, Belk and Dillard’s that had promoted his brand. “The stores we exited were very upset,” Mr. Hilfiger said. “I’m sure we’ll lose certain consumers in certain areas, but I’m sure the gain is much greater than the loss could potentially be.” In recent months, the designer poaching has devolved into open warfare among retailers, leaving some battlefield casualties. Only a year ago, Dana Buchman was designing a $6,950 leopard-patterned swing coat made, with real mink, for the affluent women who shopped for decades at high-end stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale’s. But as Liz Claiborne tried to reorganize its business because of declining sales from department stores like Macy’s, the company decided to close the Dana Buchman line and reinvent it as a bargain-conscious brand for Kohl’s, where no article of clothing is sold at full price, and most are under $100. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 8, 2008, on page A1 of the New York edition.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/business/media/04adco.html?ref=targetcorporation">A Package That Lights Up the Shelf<date>Published: March 4, 2008</date><text>ABOUT a year ago, when Jamie Leventhal was trying to convince big chain stores to stock his new line of shaving gels for young men, a buyer for Target asked a crucial question: How much would he spend on advertising? “I told him we would not spend a single dollar,” Mr. Leventhal said. The buyer was stunned until Mr. Leventhal pulled a prototype out of his briefcase. The product, called NXT, is sold in an arresting triangular container that lights up from the bottom, illuminating air bubbles suspended in the clear gel. The plastic is tinted blue, and when the AAA batteries in its base are lighted, the whole thing looks like a miniature lava lamp or a tiny fishless aquarium. The novelty of the light-up container worked, and NXT’s shaving gel  as well as its after-shave and face wash, similarly packaged  will hit the shelves at Target this month. It will also arrive at other retailers like Wal-Mart, CVS, Duane Reade, Winn-Dixie and Fred Meyer. To call attention to themselves, the products, which are aimed at 18- to 24-year-old men, will glow on the shelves, inviting customers to pick them up. Every 15 seconds, a light-emitting diode (LED) in the bottom of the container flares on, stays lighted for a few seconds, then fades out.  When brands get creative with packaging, the innovations are usually a one-two punch combined with advertising. That’s what Coors Light did with its labels that turn blue when properly chilled, and what Huggies did with a children’s hand soap that has a built-in light that flashes for the recommended hand-washing duration of 20 seconds. But Mr. Leventhal believes the packaging of NXT (pronounced “next”) is powerful enough to speak for itself. “It’s impossible for a new brand to spend like a Unilever or a Procter &amp; Gamble,” on promotions, said Mr. Leventhal, whose privately held company, Clio Designs, has manufactured a line of women’s electric shavers since 2002. “We as a new company could go out and raise $200 million in venture capital, but that would be ludicrous  why spend $100 million on advertising that’s speculative at best?” Such talk may send a chill through advertising agencies and media outlets, but retailers who see the new containers can barely contain themselves. “The packaging was more advanced than anything we’d seen before,” Andrea Harrison, category manager for men’s shaving at CVS, wrote in an e-mail response to questions. Ms. Harrison, describing NXT as having an “almost nightclub-friendly appearance,” said that at CVS, “we consider whether a product in a given package can have impact on our shelf, and this was potentially an impact on a new level.” While most brands want to be placed at eye level or higher, Mr. Leventhal said the ideal shelf location for NXT is lower. “When you look down at them it’s more dramatic, so what I’m doing is going into retailers and saying, ‘Let’s take the less valuable real estate on the shelf and make it more valuable,’ ” he said. Each NXT light is powered by two or three AAA batteries, and a rolling switch turns off the contraption when it’s upside down or sideways. The light will flash for about a year, so the product is shipped upside-down from its plant in China in boxes that say “This Side Up” in five languages. Mr. Leventhal declined to say how much the lights cost, but said the additional manufacturing cost was less per unit than what many brands spend on advertising. The suggested retail price for the products is $4.99 to $5.99. Lights in NXT products also are meant to telegraph their ingredients. They are formulated for sensitive skin  “generally the most popular variety across all men’s grooming products, from skin care to razors,” according to Ms. Harrison of CVS  but NXT favors the term “light” over “sensitive,” as in Light Shave Gel. “For our young consumer, the term ‘sensitive’ would seem kind of wimpy, ” Mr. Leventhal explained.  The shaving cream is also light on lather, the foam that bursts from the can of brands like Gillette Foamy or that forms when gels like Edge are slathered onto beards. While shaving creams with no lather can still do an excellent job of preventing nicks, foam helps with “tracking,” in industry parlance. Tracking, said Lou Hantman, 85, a chemist who developed shaving cream and other products for Gillette for 50 years  first as an executive and then as a consultant  and who helped formulate the NXT shaving products, is “when you make a sweep down and then you know you’ve been there.” While a thick lather tracks where your razor has been, it makes it harder to know where it’s going, like around goatees or sideburns. “We believe our target market is interested in what we call ‘improved navigation’ around existing facial hair guys want to keep,” Mr. Leventhal said, adding that he is planning to introduce an “improved” shave gel in six months that foams a bit more.

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/27shop.html?ref=targetcorporation">Profit Rises at Macy’s and Falls at Target<date>Published: February 27, 2008</date><text>The department store company Macy’s said Tuesday that lower costs sent fourth-quarter profit up more than analysts had expected, while Target reported that its sales declined. Net income at Macy’s rose 2.3 percent, to $750 million, or $1.73 a share, on a tax benefit and lower costs to integrate former May Department Stores locations. At Target, profit fell 8.1 percent, to $1.03 billion, or $1.23 a share. The results underscored an erosion of confidence among American consumers as the outlook for the job market dimmed and fuel and food prices soared. Macy’s margins improved as a percentage of sales, helping profit beat analysts’ estimates by 4 cents a share. Earnings were also helped by a tax benefit of 18 cents a share. Integration costs at Macy’s, which is based in Cincinnati, dropped by more than half, to $69 million in the quarter. The retailer acquired the May stores in 2005 for $11 billion. Macy’s is in the process of shutting nine stores before March and also is combining regional divisions. The moves will eliminate almost 3,200 jobs. Macy’s shares climbed $1.76, or 7.1 percent, to $26.52, on the New York Stock Exchange. At Target, customers bought food and pharmacy items and cut back on discretionary goods. Target “has clearly felt the impact of the economic slowdown in 2007,” the chief financial officer, Douglas A. Scovanner, told analysts in a conference call. The retailer “continues to expect a soft sales environment going into 2008.” Earnings were helped by Target’s credit card operations, where profit before taxes climbed 12 percent, to $137 million. Twenty analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that the company, which is based in Minneapolis, would earn $1.22 a share. Target shares rose $1.64, or 3.1 percent, to $54.89.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Retail Sales Merchants had hoped that shoppers with gift cards would provide a lift after a slack holiday season, partly because they tend to spend more than the value of the card. But that did not seem to happen last month, and retailers are feeling the pain. On Thursday, the nation’s retailers turned in their worst January in almost four decades as high gasoline and food prices, the slumping housing market, tighter credit and tougher job prospects pushed some consumers to the edge. Sales at 43 retailers surveyed by the UBS-International Council of Shopping Centers rose just 0.5 percent in January, well below a forecast of 1.5 percent. The results, based on same-store sales  those at stores open at least a year  followed a 0.7 percent growth pace in December and were below the 2.1 percent gain for all of 2007. “Gift cards are being used as a secondary way to save,” said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of the Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm in New York. Even at department stores, he said, consumers are using gift cards to buy basic apparel like socks and lingerie. The information from Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, that gift card redemptions were below expectations and people were buying only necessities shook up industry analysts. Retailers record gift-card revenue only when the cards are redeemed. “It shows you the level of worry,” said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. Even with money in their hands, he said, consumers were not willing to spend on anything more than necessities. Still, the share prices of several retailers rose Thursday as many either confirmed their earnings forecasts or raised them, signaling that they were able to control their inventories. Hot Topic and Wal-Mart stuck with their outlooks, while Pacific Sunwear of California, Wet Seal and Gap raised their profit guidance despite lower sales. Department stores and mall-based apparel retailers, though, posted steep sales declines. At J. C. Penney, same-store sales at its department stores dropped 1.9 percent, though that was better than the 6.3 percent decline expected in a Thomson Financial analyst survey. Nordstrom reported a 6.6 percent decline in same-store sales, much worse than the 0.7 percent decrease expected. Macy’s had already reported a 7.1 percent decrease in same-store sales on Wednesday, worse than expected. A spokesman, Jim Sluzewski, acknowledged that gift-card sales and redemptions were weaker than last year, reflecting a slower sales trend over all. Macy’s does not track how shoppers use their gift cards. Saks fared better, saying that same-store sales rose 4.1 percent, better than the 2.2 percent estimate. But the retailer said shoppers were shifting more of their spending to sale merchandise. Discount retailers have held up better as higher-income shoppers opt for less expensive stores. But their traditional customers are cutting back as well. Target reported a 1.1 percent decline in same-store sales in January, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts expected. Wal-Mart reported a 0.5 percent gain in same-store sales, sharply lower than the 2 percent increase expected. The company said it continued to do well with basics like groceries, but home furnishings remained weak. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

That usually means building a fancy new orchestra hall, financing an opera season or helping to pay sleek ballet dancers. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show Musuem of Musical Instruments Not for Robert J. Ulrich, the chairman and chief executive of Target Corporation, the purveyor of cheap chic. Mr. Ulrich is donating millions of dollars to establish the decidedly unglamorous Musical Instrument Museum, which he says will be the country’s only free-standing museum devoted to instruments of world cultures. Ground will be broken on Wednesday in the scrub desert on the northern edge of Phoenix for the new museum, a cultural monument to the power of retail. It is expected to cost a relatively modest $125 million, including the initial collection, what some might consider a Wal-Mart price when compared with that of recent major museum projects. The new museum has delighted experts in the history of musical instruments, the poor relation in music academia and the museum world. It also comes at a time when world music is increasingly present on concert stages. Using Target lingo like “guest” to refer to a museum visitor and “team member” for an employee, Mr. Ulrich gave a rare interview this week to describe his plans for the museum, which will focus on indigenous and popular instruments from nearly every country: a sort of world-music tour of all things plucked, bowed, blown and whacked. The two-story museum will have 180,000 square feet, with 75,000 square feet of exhibition space. It will include an auditorium, a conservation laboratory open for viewing, a recording studio and galleries where visitors can see and hear instruments being played on video. Musicians will occasionally perform, and museumgoers will have an opportunity to try some of the instruments. The lead architect is Rich Varda. It will be a “fun, friendly, exciting guest experience.” Mr. Ulrich said. The collection will have about 5,000 items, nearly 1,000 of which have been acquired and are in storage. It is expected to open in early 2010. For now, the museum has a president and director: Billie R. DeWalt, a cultural anthropologist who left his job as director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. He and a staff of about a dozen are based in temporary quarters in Tempe, Ariz. About $50 million has been raised so far. Mr. Ulrich, who is the founding chairman of the museum, contributed the bulk of those funds, Mr. DeWalt said. After a 40-year career at Target, Mr. Ulrich seems to have the wherewithal. He got $36.4 million in compensation in 2006; after his retirement, planned for February 2009, he will be eligible for pension and deferred compensation payments of $135 million, according to Target’s April 2007 proxy as analyzed by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm in Redwood Shores, Calif. His shares in the company, held directly and indirectly, amount to about $40 million. The museum also hopes to raise a $50 million endowment. Target, as a company, has made contributions. Gail Dorn, a former vice president for community affairs and a member of Target’s foundation board, is working on the museum as a part-time consultant to the company and is on the museum’s board. So is Michael R. Francis, Target’s executive vice president for marketing. A division of Target that supplies imports for sale in its stores and that has offices in more than 40 countries, is helping identify and ship instruments, Mr. Ulrich said. Most of the acquisitions, he added, will come through the help of ethnomusicologists in the field. “We certainly don’t want to look like we came from a garage sale or storage shop,” he said. The museum’s prizes so far include a century-old Javanese gamelan; an original saxophone built by Adolphe Sax, the instrument’s inventor; and large slit-gong drums from the Congo. Why a musical instrument museum? Mr. Ulrich said he had no special experience studying music. “I just did the average kid things,” he said. “You pound on drums for a while and play clarinet in school and have a neighbor lady teach you piano.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Arts »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Bennett Williamson A blogger says Targets Times Square billboard, a photograph of which has appeared on several Web sites, is demeaning to women. That was the message the cheap-chic retailer seemed to convey in an abrupt e-mail message to ShapingYouth.org, a blog about the impact of marketing on children. Early this month, the blog’s founder, Amy Jussel, called Target, complaining about a new advertising campaign that depicted a woman splayed across a big target pattern  the retailer’s emblem  with the bull’s-eye at her crotch. “Targeting crotches with a bull’s-eye is not the message we should be putting out there,” she said in an e-mail interview. Target offered an e-mail response: “Unfortunately we are unable to respond to your inquiry because Target does not participate with nontraditional media outlets,” a public relations person wrote to ShapingYouth. “This practice,” the public relations person added, “is in place to allow us to focus on publications that reach our core guest,” as Target refers to its shoppers. Word of the exchange quickly spread and the blogosphere did not appreciate the slight. “Target doesn’t participate in new media channels?” asked the Web site for the Word of Mouth Marketing Association. Target “dismisses bloggers” commented the blog for Parents for Ethical Marketing. “Ahem! So bloggers don’t count!” Ms. Jussel chimed in on ShapingYouth. Could Target, the ever-hip, contemporary retailer, really have such a low opinion of blogs, the ever-hip, contemporary media channel? Yes, at least for now. “We do not work with bloggers currently,” said a company spokeswoman, Amy von Walter, who agreed to speak with this traditional media outlet. “But we have made exceptions,” Ms. von Walter said. “And we are reviewing the policy and may adjust it.” Target’s policy is to focus limited resources on the big media outlets, like television stations and newspapers, which reach large numbers of shoppers. With a small public relations team, she said “we want to make sure we are making an educated decision and we live up to any promises we make, in terms of service.” So what about the offending ad? Ms. von Walter said the ad  part of a marketing campaign that appeared in sales circulars and a large billboard in Manhattan’s Times Square  depicts a fully-clothed woman making a snow angel. Other ads featured a man skating over the bull’s-eye, she said. Ms. Jussel, who described herself as a faithful Target shopper, was not impressed. “Any customer deserves a response to a concern, so I found this to be a shortsighted, ill-conceived judgment call,” she said. Target does not plan to change its ads. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/business/16design.html?ref=targetcorporation">Isaac Mizrahi Leaves Target to Revamp Liz Claiborne<date>Published: January 16, 2008</date><text>Isaac Mizrahi, the cheap-chic designer who helped create the image of Target as a style destination, defected from the retailer on Tuesday to a more ambitious, and lucrative, role of making over the struggling Liz Claiborne label. The end of his five-year run at Target is a blow to a retailer that has based its entire business on creating a safe home for celebrity designers to reach a broader and less-affluent audience. Mr. Mizrahi’s collection sold as much as $300 million each year, and it will be a challenge for Target to find a replacement as well known to consumers. Claiborne, which has been losing market share in department stores like Macy’s for several years, hopes to revive its image with high-profile hires like Mr. Mizrahi, who was named creative director of the brand one day after the company announced that John Bartlett would design its men’s wear. Minutes later, Target said it would end its relationship with Mr. Mizrahi at the end of the year, just before his clothes for Claiborne will appear in stores. Target fought hard to keep Mr. Mizrahi, whose contract was up for renewal this year, but the company was unwilling to match Claiborne’s offer, according to executives who were forbidden to speak publicly about the negotiations. Because Liz Claiborne is carried by Target’s mainstream competitors, like Macy’s and Dillard’s, Mr. Mizrahi’s contract with Claiborne created an obvious conflict. “We wish him the best, ” Susan Giesen, a Target spokeswoman, said. His success inspired other high-end designers like Vera Wang to break an industry taboo by simultaneously designing for luxury and mass consumers. The timing could hardly be worse for Target. Same-store sales  sales at stores open at least a year  fell 5 percent in December, and its chief executive, Robert J. Ulrich, has just said he was stepping down. Bill McComb, the chief executive of Liz Claiborne, said the company had been inundated with customer letters after Ms. Claiborne died in June, asking what would happen to the label. “We’ve been disappointed with the performance of the line for several seasons running,” Mr. McComb said. “The results have called out that a strategy change is needed.” Dave McTague, an executive vice president for Claiborne, said he approached Mr. Mizrahi because the company was looking for a designer with star appeal. “It had to be someone who was a complete icon beyond designing apparel,” Mr. McTague said.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/business/14spend.html?ref=targetcorporation">Americans Cut Back Sharply on Spending<date>Published: January 14, 2008</date><text>Strong evidence is emerging that consumer spending, a bulwark against recession over the last year even as energy prices surged and the housing market sputtered, has begun to slow sharply at every level of the American economy, from the working class to the wealthy. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Past Due Related Blogrunner: Reactions From Around the Web The abrupt pullback raises the possibility that the country may be experiencing a rare decline in personal consumption, not just a slower rate of growth. Such a decline would be the first since 1991, and it would almost certainly push the entire economy into a recession in the middle of an election year. There are mounting anecdotal signs that beginning in December Americans cut back significantly on personal consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy. A raft of consumer companies  high-end stores like Nordstrom and Tiffany, and middle-of-the-road ones like Target and J. C. Penney  reported a pronounced slowdown in growth last month, and in several cases an outright drop in business. American Express said that starting in early December the growth in the rate of spending by its 52 million cardholders, a generally affluent group of consumers, fell 3 percentage points, from 13 percent to 10 percent, the first slowdown since the 2001 recession. And consumer confidence, an important barometer of economic health, has plunged. Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, says consumer satisfaction with the economy has reached a 15-year low, according to the firm’s polling. Even wealthier consumers, who were seen as invulnerable to rising gasoline prices and falling home values, are feeling the squeeze. “People are clearly concerned that we are headed into a recession,” said Stephen I. Sadove, the chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, the upscale department store whose runaway growth throughout much of the year slowed markedly in December. Gia Trumpler, 37, a travel consultant who lives in Manhattan, shops at luxury chains like Saks. But she is trimming costs where she can by bringing lunch to work from home, rather than eating out. “Everything just feels more expensive to me now,” she said, including the cost of heating her apartment this winter. There are plenty of recession naysayers. Average hourly wages and salaries have not fallen, and some economists argue that unless  or until  that happens, consumer spending will hold up despite widespread economic unease. According to these economists, what happened in December was a temporary blip. “Incomes have managed to hold up,” said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, who added that the data to date did not support the view that a recession was inevitable. Even in tough economic times Americans rarely reduce their consumption, preferring instead to slow the growth in their spending. Since 1980, they have cut spending in only five quarters  a total of 15 months  most of them in the depths of a recession. The 2001 recession passed without a cutback in consumer spending. Only once before, in 1980, did consumer spending fall during a presidential election year, helping Ronald Reagan in his campaign against Jimmy Carter, the Democratic incumbent. Official statistics do not yet show that consumer spending has dropped, but they do suggest that in late 2007, it slowed in areas like automobiles, furniture, building materials and health care, said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com. Fresh evidence of a pullback is pouring in from many quarters as Americans confront the triple threats of higher energy costs, falling home prices and a volatile stock market. Perhaps the strongest barometer over the last 30 days is the performance of the country’s big chain stores. December turned out to be a blood bath for retailers at every rung on the economic ladder, with sales for the month growing at the slowest rate in seven years. Sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial yardstick in retailing, plunged by 11 percent at Kohl’s and 7.9 percent at Macy’s, compared with last year. Chains that cater to the middle and upper classes, which have benefited from years of trading up  when customers splurge on select expensive products  struggled as well. Coach, the leather goods maker, said sales of its popular handbags had become sluggish, prompting the company to issue rare coupons to drum up business. “This is the real deal  consumers are slowing down across the spectrum,” said David Schick, a retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. But it is the trouble at the highest reaches of retailing that has economists most worried about a recession. Over the last year, even as low-wage and middle-income consumers have cut back, the wealthy have spent freely, keeping high-end chains insulated from the economic turbulence. That started to change in December, as shoppers held off on buying $300 designer shoes and $500 dresses. For example, store sales fell 4 percent at Nordstrom, the high-end department store. 1 2 Next Page » Louise Story contributed reporting. More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/business/11shop.html?ref=targetcorporation">Poor December at Retailers; Most Report Drops in Sales<date>Published: January 11, 2008</date><text>The weakest holiday shopping season in five years ended dismally for most retailers, whose sales tumbled despite deep discounts and extended store hours, stoking fears that the economy is tipping into a recession. Sales fell across the board, knocking down once seemingly invincible chains like Target (down 5 percent compared with last year); Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (2 percent); Nordstrom (4 percent); and Kohl’s (11.4 percent). “It shows that the U.S. economy absolutely tanked in December,” said Ellen Zentner, United States macroeconomist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. “Consumer spending drives the economy. What we’re left with is no evidence of any kind of consumer momentum going into 2008.” But one major chain was spared: Wal-Mart, whose relentless price slashing appeared to resonate with penny-pinching shoppers. Its sales rose 2.7 percent. Wal-Mart’s lopsided victory  and the strength of off-price chains like TJ Maxx and Ross Dress for Less  suggested that jittery consumers, trying to cut back on spending, favored bargain chains over full-price stores during the 2007 holiday season. That is a reversal from years of trading up, when consumers flush with cash reached for more expensive products at higher-end stores. “Trading down became contagious,” said John D. Morris, senior retail analyst at Wachovia Securities. Even Saks Fifth Avenue observed the trend, saying its well-heeled consumers were holding out for discounts. Over all, sales growth in December was the weakest in seven years, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group that averages sales from 45 big chains. It found that same-store sales  sales at stores open at least a year  rose a meager 0.9 percent, aided by Wal-Mart, which lifted the entire retail index because of its size. Averaging sales in November and December, it said, the 2007 holiday season produced the slowest growth rate since 2002. Same-store sales are a crucial yardstick in retailing, because they exclude business at new and closed stores, which tend to distort a chain’s performance. In the aftermath of the dreary results, a raft of chains, like J. C. Penney, Kohl’s and American Eagle Outfitters, cut earnings forecasts for the final three months of the year. Shares of Wal-Mart rose on its news, gaining $1.50, or 3.2 percent, to close at $48.40. The market reaction was mixed for other retailers, as some had already warned of lackluster holiday results. Shares of Gap fell more than 7 percent, while American Eagle’s shares gained just as much. With higher energy costs and sagging home values pinching consumer spending, retail analysts had predicted a rocky December. Adding to the stores’ troubles, this year’s earlier Thanksgiving shifted an extra week of shopping into November, making December look weaker for many stores compared with the previous year. But even with those factors, the size of the sales declines at many chains surprised analysts. Same-store sales fell 8 percent at Limited Brands; 7.5 percent at J. C. Penney; and 6 percent at Gap. “Consumers clearly tightened purse strings this holiday season,” said Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, a research firm. Clothing sales were especially hard hit in December. MasterCard Advisors, a division of the credit card company, estimated that women’s apparel, by far the biggest category, fell by 3.8 percent from last year, dragging down business at department store and specialty apparel chains at malls. By contrast, sales of electronics rose 2.2 percent, suggesting that products like digital picture frames and satellite navigation systems emerged as the must-have gifts for the holidays. That was reflected in a strong performance from Best Buy, which said sales rose 6.7 percent in the third quarter. Because of the calendar shift, stores encouraged investors to look at the average sales for November and December combined. But even by that analysis, the holiday season was weak for most chains. Macy’s, for example, said sales fell 7.9 percent in December and 1.1 percent for November and December combined. “After a strong November, we had hoped that a more positive sales trend would continue through December,” said the chief executive of Macy’s, Terry J. Lundgren. But a tough economy, “led customers to spend cautiously for the holiday,” he said. The most closely watched drama was Wal-Mart vs. Target. For much of the last five years, Target had trounced Wal-Mart, in percentage terms, in holiday sales performance. But not this time. Target said that even with the calendar shift factored in, sales rose just 0.6 percent, an unusually low number for it, especially compared with Wal-Mart’s 2.7 percent increase, a figure that includes sales at Sam’s Club. Target’s chief executive, Robert Ulrich, said earnings for the last three months of the year would probably fall from last year’s level. Wal-Mart was not the only success story, though. Costco, the wholesale club chain, said sales rose 7 percent, with higher gasoline prices bolstering its results. Costco, like many club stores, sells gas to members. Excluding gas, its sales rose 4 percent. Analysts said the chain benefited from shoppers buying in bulk to save money. Specialty clothing stores struggled all month. Sales fell 9.4 percent at Ann Taylor; 6.2 percent at Hot Topic; and 2 percent at American Eagle Outfitters. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was dragged down by the performance of its Ruehl chain, intended for 20-something clothing shoppers. Sales fell 22 percent in December, compared with a decline of 1 percent for the company’s brand, geared toward teenagers. Peter S. Goodman contributed reporting.

Ulrich, will retire May 1 and will be succeeded by the company’s president, Gregg W. Steinhafel. Mr. Ulrich, 64, will remain as chairman through the end of the 2008 fiscal year. He has been with the company that became Target since 1967 and has been chairman and chief executive since 1994. The company said that during Mr. Ulrich’s tenure, it has nearly tripled its sales and American stores, and profits have jumped almost ninefold. Mr. Steinhafel, 52, has been with the company since 1979. He became executive vice president for merchandising in 1999 and, in a signal that he was on his way toward the chief executive’s chair, was named to the board last year. “During Bob’s tenure, Target has achieved outstanding financial results and become one of the most recognized and valuable brands in the world,” Mr. Steinhafel said in a statement.

The International Council of Shopping Centers said its index of retail chain-store sales rose 2.8 percent last week, putting merchants on track for a smaller sales gain than the trade group originally expected. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.36 points, or 0.02 percent, to 13,551.69. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.21 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,497.66. The Nasdaq composite index rose 10.91 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,724.41. Target indicated its sales might have fallen in December, while MasterCard said holiday spending  including credit, cash and checks  climbed a modest 3.6 percent from Thanksgiving to Christmas. That compares with a rise of 6.6 percent over the same period last year. The 2007 holiday figure is at the low end of its expected 3.5 to 4.5 percent range. Excluding gasoline and auto sales, the figure was 2.4 percent. Slow holiday sales were widely expected, but the news could still raise concerns about the strength of consumer spending and, in turn, the economy. A report that home prices fell for the 10th consecutive month in October also appeared to limit the stock gains. Kim Caughey, senior equity analyst at the Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, said reports on retailing had dashed some investors’ hopes for strong consumer spending in the long weekend before Christmas. “From the quick analysis it doesn’t look like it was a great year. I think investors had held out hope that retail might have had that final flourish. It was a sad flourish, not a strong one,” she said. Ms. Caughey said, however, that light trading in both Monday’s and Wednesday’s sessions meant that investors should not read too much into the market’s moves. “A little bit of sentiment goes a long way on light trading days,” she said. A barrel of light crude oil rose $1.84, to settle at $95.97 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising to a one-month high of $96.54 during the session. The Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index declined 6.7 percent, the steepest monthly decline since early 1991. Among chain stores, Target fell $1.31, to $51.16, after it said that same-store sales  sales from stores open at least a year  would range from a 1 percent increase to a 1 percent decrease for the five weeks through Jan. 5. Earlier expectations had called for a gain of 3 to 5 percent. Apple traded above $200 for the first time Wednesday as investors appeared upbeat about the company’s prospects to continue brisk sales of its iPods and computers. The stock rose 15 cents to close at $198.95, after trading as high as $200.96. Acquisition news may have reassured some investors. Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett’s company, agreed on Tuesday to pay $4.5 billion to buy 60 percent of Marmon Holdings, a privately held company with more than 125 manufacturing and service businesses. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 16/32, to 99 25/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 4.27 percent late Wednesday, from 4.21 percent on Monday.

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/business/27shopping.html?ref=targetcorporation">Major Retailers Feel the Squeeze From Consumers<date>Published: December 27, 2007</date><text>As the nation’s merchants began poring  or weeping  over holiday sales receipts Wednesday, a surprising pattern emerged: even brands that for years have inspired the undying devotion of shoppers felt the pinch of tightening wallets. Once seemingly invincible marquee chains like Coach, Target, Starbucks and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch are settling for ho-hum growth this winter, after surpassing even the most rosy expectations season after season. Though they sell very different products, at very different prices, these companies all shared the same bragging rights. Their customers considered them indispensable, even expressions of who they were. But in this turbulent economy, the indispensable is becoming disposable. “This season tested brand loyalty,” said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst at NPD Group, a retail research firm. By early December, the traditional start of the holiday buying rush, Coach, Target and Starbucks  arguably the reigning trendsetters among American retailers  warned that the number of consumers walking into their stores had begun to dip, or was likely to, as consumers restrained their spending. Coach cautioned that the 20 percent growth rate for handbags over the last several years would most likely fall to 10 percent for the final months of this year  nothing to be ashamed of, but a significant setback. And Target, which is used to monthly sales increases of 4 percent or more for its stores, said results for December could fall 1 percent, a rarity for the chain. A final sales tally from the season will not be available from most chains until next week. But an early projection from MasterCard Advisors, a unit of the credit card company, found that overall spending from Nov. 23 to Dec. 24, when adjusted for inflation, was essentially unchanged over last year, a weak performance. Lynn Brisbois is the kind of shopper who is giving these companies holiday heartburn. At the Twelve Oaks mall outside Detroit on Wednesday, Ms. Brisbois, 46, browsed the pristine white shelves of a sparsely filled Coach store, but bought nothing. When she walked into an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, it was not to make a purchase but to return a pair of pajamas and a sweatshirt to obtain a post-Christmas discount, which knocked $25 off the $98 she originally paid. “I was very limited in what I did this year,” said the mother of two, who gave her twin daughters cash instead of head-to-toe clothing from Abercrombie, a brand they covet. Retail executives had predicted that the collision of high gas prices, falling home prices and an uncertain economy would hurt most, if not all, stores this winter. But these chains were supposed to be different. For decades, retailers and the analysts who track them have bemoaned the death of brand loyalty, once a hallmark of American retailing. A Sears shopper, or a Woolworth consumer, remained that way for life. The explosion of mass merchants meant that the same product, for example a Sony digital camera, could be found at a dozen competing stores. That inspired consumers to make shopping choices based on low prices, rather than allegiance to a single store. But a handful of astute retailers, like Coach and Target, thrived through fashionable stores, sleek advertising and irresistible merchandise. Inside the retailing industry, they earned the nickname “lifestyle brands” because they managed to reflect their customers attitude and taste, overriding concerns about price. Coach, for example, became so popular over the last decade that many otherwise judicious women purchased six of its $500 handbags, with their elaborate designs and eye-popping colors. Its sales, profits and stock price soared. Slightly lower down the retail hierarchy, Target, with its guest designers, like Isaac Mizrahi (for dresses) and Thomas O’Brien (for housewares), earned a zealous following. Shoppers even took to calling it Tar-ZHAY, in the mock French fashion, because of its flair for style, which distinguished it from Wal-Mart. Like Coach, Target’s sales soared. This year, both brands are falling back to earth. So, it seems, is Starbucks. After years of strong sales, the chain last month disclosed that customer traffic dropped 1 percent in the United States during the summer, the first falloff since it began reporting such information three years ago. There are exceptions, of course. Apple, for example, has expanded the ranks of devotees with all its new i-products (iTouch, iPhone, iPod and so on). But consumers appear reluctant to splurge on their favorite brands. Abercrombie’s popular Hollister division, a surf-themed store intended for a slightly younger shopper than its namesake chain, said sales failed to grow in November, compared with last year  a letdown for a fast-growing brand. Tom Lennox, a spokesman for Abercrombie, said that “while it’s argued that spending is more difficult, our brands continue to perform quite well.” Indeed, at the flagship Abercrombie brand, sales rose 4 percent in November. Shining Young, 25, and Ray Chou, 29, both graduate students, waited for clearance sales before buying clothes Wednesday at the Hollister store at the Westfield San Francisco Centre. In the end, they bought a puffy jacket for $80, regularly $128, and a zip-up sweatshirt for $30, originally $50. The life of a graduate students is not luxurious, and with their expenses rising, “I shop at Hollister when it’s on special,” Ms. Young said.

Skip to next paragraph Daniel Barry/Bloomberg News William Ackman manages the Pershing Square hedge fund. Pershing, which is managed by William A. Ackman, recently raised a $2 billion fund to invest in Target. It now holds a 9.97 percent stake, up from about 9.6 percent in July, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Pershing said it had also invested in Target swaps and options, which combined with the stock give the fund an economic exposure equal to a 12.6 percent stake. Mr. Ackman said in November that he had raised his stake in Target, but declined to say by how much. Pershing said it might meet with Target’s management again to discuss the company’s strategy, business, assets, operations, capital structure or financial condition. When Pershing disclosed the 9.6 percent stake in July, analysts speculated that Mr. Ackman would pressure Target to sell its credit card portfolio or real estate assets. In September, Target said it was weighing a sale of its credit card assets. But this month, the company said it was taking longer than expected to determine whether to sell its $7 billion in credit card receivables, given prevailing market conditions. Target also warned on Monday that its December sales at stores open at least a year were below expectations and that it now expected sales in the range of down 1 percent to up 1 percent. While more consumers came to its stores at the end of the third week of the month, the increase was not enough to make up for weak sales after Thanksgiving that carried over into December, the retailer said. Given the lower forecast, Target said December sales were likely to fall “well short of the meaningful improvement” it had earlier said was needed to achieve growth in fourth-quarter earnings per share. The retailer had forecast December same-store sales would rise 3 to 5 percent on a calendar-adjusted basis. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image John Gress/Reuters In Chicago, Andy Baker braved the cold on Black Friday last month to take advantage of early bargains at Target. Buffeted by high energy costs and a slowing housing market, consumers were expected to trade down from midpriced department stores, like Macy’s and Nordstrom, to discount retailers with designer cachet  Target’s undisputed terrain. But instead of dominating this holiday season, Target is muddling through it, perplexing rival merchants and Wall Street analysts, who consider the chain a bellwether and are scrutinizing its performance for clues on the health of the economy. In two of the last three months  September and November  Target’s sales growth has slipped below 1.5 percent, well under its historical average and lower than its biggest rival, Wal-Mart Stores. The chief executive of Target, Robert J. Ulrich, has warned that the company may not meet its earnings forecast for the final three months of the year, on the heels of a third-quarter performance that he described as “disappointing.” Behind the slowdown, analysts suspect, is a pullback on routine purchases of housewares and clothing, Target’s traditional strengths  and, in general, the most profitable merchandise in its stores. In flusher times, Americans snapped up Target’s $40 taffeta dresses designed by Isaac Mizrahi and $9.99 plush towels from Thomas O’Brien. But with shoppers anxious about the economy, they appear to be skipping the splurges. Linda Shannon, 56, a retired nurse in North Bergen, N.J., adores Target’s sheets and towels, but she walked right by them last week at her local store. “In this economy, what we have at home is good enough,” she said. Target is by no means losing money; it remains one of the most profitable chains in the country. But in retailing, analysts and investors are hungry not just for profits, but for growth. They tend to gauge success by monthly sales increases at stores open at least a year. And by that yardstick, Target is lagging. For the first time in years, in fact, the chain that devotees refer to as Tar-zhay, because of its fashion flare, looks vulnerable. In November, sales at Target stores open a year rose 1.1 percent, when adjusted for a quirk in this year’s calendar. The company will provide a glimpse into sales so far this December in a conference call Monday. Lazard Capital Markets predicts that Target’s average monthly sales growth for 2007 will be the lowest in four years. And that is raising broader questions about the American consumer: If the store that America’s middle class loves to love is experiencing turbulence, analysts say, it bodes poorly for all retailers. There is some dispute about exactly what ails Target. Many analysts said consumers are cutting back on optional products, like a new bath mat, and spending their money on essentials, like cleaning supplies, which are less profitable for stores. Adrianne Shapira, a retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that “in the past, what Target has done so well is capitalize on discretionary spending. Shoppers walked around the store and tossed a few things they did not need into the basket.” Now, she said, “that is falling by the wayside.” Rosa Setkiewicz, 50, stopped at the Target in Jersey City, N.J., recently to stock up on Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda, Clorox bleach and Downy laundry detergent  “things that are cheap,” she said as she loaded the trunk of her Toyota Corolla. “I have cut back a lot on clothing and things that are not necessary.” Bill Dreher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, dubbed this phenomenon “trading down within the store.” Target executives acknowledge there is some truth to the theory. But the bigger issue, in their view, is that the number of customers walking into Target’s stores has dropped. They see that as a sign not of any tactical failure on Target’s part, but of rising doubts among consumers about the economy. “I think people are being more conservative in an environment where they are uncertain,” said Susan Kahn, vice president of communications at Target. Ms. Kahn said that sentiment was hurting sales across Target’s stores, not just in its popular home and apparel departments. “The piece that is worrisome is the overall sales growth,” she said. “It is not specific to apparel or home.” Target also faces a tough adversary this year in Wal-Mart, which has staked its holiday season on heavily promoted discounts. The chain held early-morning, door-buster sales every weekend in November in an effort to steal the thunder from its rivals, which generally waited until the day after Thanksgiving to stage such sales. Target countered with a display of merchandise priced at $1 in the lobbies of its stores, sending a strong low-price message as consumers walked in. Nevertheless, Todd Slater, a retail analyst at Lazard, said that “Wal-Mart may be better positioned for an economic downturn than Target, because it is the price leader.” He added that “Target is more the fashion leader; it’s more upscale.” Ms. Kahn, of Target, said the chain generally matched Wal-Mart’s prices in communities where the two compete. Asked if Target would change its strategy in response to lower traffic, she said the company was determined to stick with its plan, rather than take any action  like drastic price cuts or a reduction in store staffing  that could hurt the brand’s image. “Our focus is long-term profitability and growth, not on month-to-month sales,” she said. “We believe we have a winning strategy.” Investors appear to be less certain. Over the last year, Target’s stock price has fallen 12 percent, to $50.68 on Friday. During the same period, Wal-Mart’s stock rose 5 percent. In coming weeks, consumers can expect more clearance sales, analysts said, like the 50 percent to 70 percent discounts on racks of women’s and children’s clothing at several Targets in New Jersey last week. There is little doubt that shoppers covet Target’s ever-trendy merchandise. The question, in this holiday season of economic unease, is how much of it they will actually buy. Eileen Gowlak, 68, walked out of the Target in North Bergen, N.J., the other day without purchasing anything. She liked a pair of pants, but the price was $26, twice what she would pay at Wal-Mart, she estimated. “It’s too expensive,” said Ms. Gowlak, who recently lost her job as a waitress at a seafood restaurant. She has her eye on a $20 pair of red patent leather shoes at Target. But instead of buying them for herself, as she might have in the past, she has asked a daughter to buy them for her as a Christmas gift. More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/arts/design/30voge.html?ref=targetcorporation">Splitting Up a Collection<date>Published: November 30, 2007</date><text>SPLITTING UP A Collection Nancy Goliger and Bruce Bermans photography collection began in 1991 when the Hollywood couple  he is chairman and chief executive of Village Roadshow Pictures, she is executive vice president of creative advertising at Paramount Pictures  commissioned emerging artists to hit the road and take pictures. As I was able to afford to, I then began to buy more established, important images that were at the root of photography, Mr. Berman said. A selection from the collection  at last count some 2,600 photographs  was exhibited last year at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Now, because the couple are divorcing, about 500 works are heading to auction at Christies in New York, starting in April. The rest are being given to three Los Angeles museums: the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Getty, whose donors have included the couple. It wasnt until about two or three years ago that I realized I was a collector, said Mr. Berman, who worked with Rose Shoshana, a Los Angeles dealer, to build the collection. It has not been determined which images will go to which museum. I have asked the museums to give me a list of prioritized preferences, he said. Nancy and I want to give them what they want and need. The task for the Christies experts is how best to sell 500 photographs. People tend to think that selling so many photographs floods the market and depresses prices, but auction history indicates just the opposite happens, said Joshua Holdeman, international director of Christies photography department. Rather than sell them all at once, however, Christies plans to hold three different sales: one limited to works by Diane Arbus, in April; another of images by William Eggleston, scheduled for October; and a third offering a selection of photographers  from Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange to younger artists with less well-known names  planned for 2009. Together the three sales are estimated to bring $7 million to $10 million. Its a truly American collection that goes from the Depression era to artists who are alive and working today, Mr. Holdeman said. Among the highlights are A Family on Their Lawn One Sunday Afternoon in Westchester, N.Y., a seminal 1968 Arbus work estimated at $30,000 to $50,000, and Los Alamos Portfolio, 80 prints of Eggleston images taken from 1967 to 1974 and considered his most important work, which carries an estimate of $250,000 to $350,000. The Evans work includes Interior at Biloxi, Mississippi, a 1945 photograph of a fishermans bedroom estimated at $30,000 to $50,000. Black Maria, a 1955 Lange shot of the back of a police van replete with bullet holes, is estimated at $40,000 to $60,000. I am surprised that I dont feel sad, Mr. Berman said about the collections dispersal. Its time to move on. AN OVERNIGHT OPENING To inaugurate the New Museum of Contemporary Arts home on the Bowery, Target is sponsoring 30 consecutive hours of free admission (otherwise $12). From noon tomorrow until 6 p.m. Sunday, 500 people an hour are expected to visit the seven-story, 60,000-square-foot building. By Wednesday the 15,000 timed tickets to be the first in had all been spoken for. Were encouraging people to come by and see if they can get a ticket at the door, said Gabriel Einsohn, the museums communications director. We expect that there will be some tickets returned and some unused, but were not making guarantees. A dramatic configuration of irregularly stacked, shiny metal boxes designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of the Tokyo architectural firm Sanaa, the New Museum replaces an old parking lot at 235 Bowery, the eastern end of Prince Street. Visitors will see an exhibition of contemporary sculpture titled Unmonumental: The Object in the 21st Century. (Reviews of the architecture and the exhibition begin on Page 33.) The New Museum says it has surpassed its $64 million capital campaign goal, raising $74 million. A windfall of $8.2 million came from a charity auction earlier this month at Phillips de Pury &amp; Company. We never expected the auction to make so much, said Lisa Phillips, the New Museums director. We now have a solid endowment: it went from $3 million to $20 million. The rest of the $74 million will go toward paying for the building. We dont have any debt, Ms. Phillips said. So we can actually get a nights sleep. A RETURN TO LONDON If, as expected, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain signs off on the appointment, Nicholas Penny, senior curator of sculpture and decorative arts at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, will become director of the National Gallery of Art in London. Considered one of Britains leading Renaissance scholars, Mr. Penny is a familiar face at the London institution, having worked there as a curator from 1990 to 2002. He was passed over for the directors job six years ago in favor of Charles Saumarez Smith. (Mr. Saumarez Smith resigned in March to become chief executive of the Royal Academy in London.) Mr. Penny, who is to take up his new post in February, will carry a few American ideas to London, like working closely with collectors on everything from acquisitions to donations, an activity uncommon among British museum directors. He is also expected to join the group of British museum professionals lobbying to create tax incentives for charitable donations. More Articles in Arts »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show Black Friday Related Rising Early, Not to Start the Turkey, but to Shop (November 23, 2007) Dot Earth: A Fresh Advertising Pitch: Buy Nothing (November 22, 2007) Well: When Shopping Puts the Happy in Your Holidays (November 23, 2007) Times Topics: Black Friday With an uncertain economy, a slowdown in the housing market and high gas prices hanging over their heads, consumers flocked to discount chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy, brandishing bargain-filled fliers. In a reversal from years past, they largely bypassed more expensive retailers, including such powerhouses as Nordstrom, Coach and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, according to shoppers and merchants interviewed around the country. This shift has prompted industry analysts to christen this the trade down holiday season. In Columbus, Ohio, Theresa Johnston, a 47-year-old social worker, was shopping at the Big Lots discount chain  because she had to, not because she wanted to. Its a little embarrassing, actually. I dont like to be seen here, she said, planning to buy a set of 42 knives for $35. Like thousands of Americans, Ms. Johnston has an adjustable-rate mortgage, and her rising payments have stolen from her holiday spending budget. Before this, I shopped mostly at Macys and some at J. C. Penney, so shopping at Big Lots is, like, two big steps down for me, she said. This is going to be a hard Christmas. The nations retailers are making the same prediction, expecting this to be the weakest holiday shopping season in five years. In more certain economic times, Black Friday  so called because stores traditionally become profitable on that day  was a full-throated celebration of capitalism, generating more than $19 billion in sales in 2006, or nearly 5 percent of all holiday spending. This year, stores managed to draw huge crowds again, but the mood was more desperation than celebration. Stores left nothing to chance, opening their doors before dawn and cutting prices deeply enough to guarantee throngs of bargain hunters. Two major chains, J. C. Penney and Kohls, pushed their openings up an hour, to 4 a.m., and dangled half-off sales and $10 coupons. Toys R Us nearly quadrupled the number of door-buster discounts it offers, to 101. And Wal-Mart extended its Black Friday specials into Saturday, calling it a 48-hour sale. (In a publicity stunt, the company bragged that it had even petitioned the Royal Observatory in London to create a 48-hour Friday.) Rather than buying on impulse, consumers drew elaborate shopping plans to track down steep discounts  and stuck to them. I am not buying as much, and I am buying on sale, said Pam Collins, 54, as she browsed the shoe department at Nordstrom at the Natick Collection, a mall west of Boston. Ms. Collins said she would buy her grandchildren savings bonds this year rather than big gifts. The economy has me somewhat worried, she said. A final tally from yesterdays sales will not be available until tomorrow, at the very earliest. MasterCard Spending Pulse, a division of the credit card company, predicted sales this Black Friday would rise up to 5 percent, to about $20 billion, from $19.1 billion in 2006. That growth, however, comes with caveats. Shoppers might have spent more this year than last, but they bought deeply discounted items that generate little profit. And their spending might trail off in the coming month, particularly as deals become harder to find. In interviews, retail executives, who were constantly checking sales figures on BlackBerrys and laptops yesterday, said the numbers suggested that the holiday season was off to a strong, if highly discounted, start. The lines outside our stores are bigger than last year, for sure, said the chief executive of Toys R Us, Gerald L. Storch. Consumers have been holding back and waiting until today. There is so much uncertainty out there. In Times Square, Donna Lhopitault stood in line at a Toys R Us for four hours to secure the Nintendo Wii video game system that her children covet. She paid $250  about half the price she had seen on various Web sites. Ms. Lhopitault, a 38-year-old financial adviser from Smithtown, N.Y., said she used to splurge at high-end stores like F. A. O. Schwarz before the prices of gas and home heating oil surged. This year, I am sticking with Best Buy, Toys R Us and Target, she said. Thats where the deals are. Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said the phenomenon of shoppers trading down to lower-price chains was affecting every level of retailing, from Target to Nordstrom. People are cheaping out and sticking with the essentials, he said. John D. Morris, a senior retail analyst at Wachovia Securities, described the scene at malls around the country as the quest for value (rather than for a must-have fashion, because there was none). The merchandise, he said, is blah-humbug. That did not bode well for midpriced department stores and full-priced clothing stores in the mall, where the number of shoppers has fallen for much of the year. 1 2 Next Page » Brenda Goodman in Nashville, Eric Ferkenhoff in Chicago, Christopher Maag in Columbus, Ohio, and Katie Zezima in Boston contributed reporting.

The company said an unseasonably warm fall hurt sales of clothing and home items. The results, which missed Wall Street expectations, were disappointing, the chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Ulrich, said. Target shares dropped $2.21, or 4 percent, to close at $51.69, after setting a new low for the year earlier in the day. Limited Brands also blamed an unusually warm fall for weaker-than-expected third-quarter profits. The company, which operates Victorias Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works stores, said yesterday that it earned $12.1 million for the quarter, down from $23.5 million a year ago. Sales, at $1.9 billion, were down from $2.1 billion a year earlier, when Limited Brands still owned the Limited Stores and Express apparel brands. The tepid third quarters at Target and Limited contrasted with strong results at the upscale Saks and the discounter Ross Stores. Last week, Wal-Mart posted an 8 percent rise in third-quarter profit and raised its profit forecast for the year. Target, the nations second-largest discounter, behind Wal-Mart, left in place its reduced full-year estimate. Saks said its third-quarter earnings more than tripled, to $21.6 million, helped by strong sales growth and cost controls. The company, which owns the Club Libby Lu specialty stores as well as upscale department stores, said same-store sales rose 11.4 percent for the quarter. Same-store sales, compiled from outlets open at least a year, are a crucial measure for retailers because they filter out sales from recently opened stores. The discount clothing chain Ross Stores said strong sales in dresses, home items and shoes were behind its 11 percent rise in third-quarter profit, to $48.7 million. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $1.47 billion, although same-store sales rose just 1 percent. Targets president, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said he expected soft sales to continue into the quarter that ends in July 2008, although he predicted this years holiday season would be decent. Target earned $483 million, or 56 cents a share, during the quarter that ended Oct. 28, down from $506 million, or 59 cents a share, in the previous year, despite a 9 percent rise in sales, to $14.84 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast earnings of 62 cents a share on revenue of $14.83 billion. The earnings estimates typically exclude one-time items. Targets growth has been faster in food and consumable items, which carry a lower profit margin. And it has also tried to carry items like bedsheets in categories it calls good-better-best. Mr. Steinhafel said the third-quarter results did not mean that Target would change its mix of products. We think this is more temporary in nature, and that over the long term our current mix of assortments are about appropriate for what the business potential is, he said. Quarterly same-store sales increased 3.7 percent. Targets chief financial officer, Douglas A. Scovanner, said Target expected fourth-quarter same-store sales to rise in the 3 percent to 5 percent range. Mr. Scovanner said profits would be better than in the third quarter, but warned that growth in earnings per share will likely be quite modest compared to last years result, when it jumped almost 22 percent. Last years fourth quarter benefited from an extra week. For the first nine months of the year, Target earned $1.82 billion, or $2.11 a share, up 9 percent from the period last year. Revenue rose 9.3 percent, to $43.5 billion. Among other retailers, BJs Wholesale Clubs third-quarter profit rose 24 percent, slightly beating Wall Street expectations. The quarterly loss at the jeweler Zale widened to $28.4 million. It cut its earnings outlook and issued a subdued holiday sales forecast. The companys results were hurt by losses at the Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle chain, which it is selling, and the way it recognizes revenue from jewelry warranties. In Tuesday trading, BJs fell less than 1 percent, to $34.08. Limited, which released results after the market closed, reached a 52-week low of $17.07 before closing down a penny at $17.53. Ross shares rose more than 3 percent, to $25.75. Saks shares dropped 1.5 percent, to $19.83, and Zale shares fell less than 1 percent, to $19.74. More Articles in Business »</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A page from a leaked Home Depot circular posted on the Web site Bfads.net. Related Times Topics: Black Friday But it turns out that a big source of the leaks are the retailers themselves. This holiday season, chains large and small quietly handed over their circulars to Web sites like Bfads.net and Gottadeal.com to ensure that millions of deal-hungry shoppers see their discounts well before the day known as Black Friday, traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year. Over the past few weeks, Home Depot, Pacific Sunwear, CompUSA and OshKosh BGosh each supplied the sites with an advance copy of its ads, according to the chains and the sites owners. The unlikely alliance between stores and the insurgent Web sites, once the sworn enemy of the industry, indicates how worried retailers are about the holiday shopping season, expected to be the weakest in five years. With consumers uneasy about the economy, the only thing worse than having a retail circular leaked to the sites, it seems, is not having it leaked to the sites, whose popularity and influence have soared since they first materialized in 2003. When Bfads.net, the most popular of the Black Friday sites, did not immediately post a circular from Pacific Sunwear earlier this month, an employee at the clothing chain made clear how important the site was to the company. I havent seen our Black Friday deals on your site yet, so I am sending it again, he wrote to Bfadss founder, according to a copy of the e-mail message. Michael Brim, the founder of Bfads.net, said the outreach from retailers was definitely a change of pace from a few years ago when they all wanted to file lawsuits against us. Mr. Brim created Bfads in 2003 to compile hundreds of Black Friday discounts and other holiday circulars in one place for die-hard bargain hunters. Scores of retailers tried to block the site from publishing their ads, using cease-and-desist letters to threaten legal action. The stores complained that the early publication of the circulars  generally distributed in newspapers on Thanksgiving  gave competitors time to match the early morning deep discounts of Black Friday. In 2004, for example, Home Depot demanded that Bfads take down its Black Friday circular. Its publication, a company spokesman said at the time, could enable competing retailers to react and change their plans. But this year, Home Depot is singing a different tune, deciding to give the sites its ads. These site are popular and we know people are looking for the information, said Ron Defeo, a spokesman for the chain. And since Home Depot assumes the sites will eventually obtain the circulars, with its help or not, we want to make sure they get the accurate information. Pacific Sunwear, the teenage clothing chain, began giving its circular to the Black Friday Web sites two years ago, because we believe our customer is very dialed into the Web, said Gar Jackson, a spokesman for the retailer. John D. Morris, a senior retail analyst at Wachovia Securities, said stores sudden willingness to work with the sites is so telling about this holiday season. The gloves are off, he said, referring to efforts by the chains to lure shoppers worried about their finances. Stores are using every weapon they can to reach consumers. Brad Olson, who runs Gottadeal.com, said Web-savvy retailers now see sites like his as free advertising. For regional stores, Black Friday Web sites provide a rare chance to compete head-to-head with bigger chains. H. H. Gregg, an electronics chain with stores in the Midwest and Southeast, now sends its Black Friday circulars to the sites to reach consumers who may have never heard of the retailer. But not everyone is playing ball, especially the nations biggest discount chains. The day we see Target or Best Buy or Wal-Mart send us their ads early  that would be something, Mr. Olson said. Wal-Mart, known for dangling deep early morning discounts on the day after Thanksgiving, has no plans to send its Black Friday ads to the Web sites. In fact, lawyers for the retailer sent Mr. Olson a letter in October warning that premature publication of Wal-Marts Black Friday circular can give rise to liabilities and severe penalties. But behind the scenes, the companys relationship with the sites appears to be thawing. After Wal-Marts lawyers issued their warning, an advertising manager for the company wrote Mr. Brim, the owner of Bfads.net, to thank him for generating so much online traffic for Walmart.com  traffic that resulted from publication of leaked Wal-Mart seasonal ads. I checked out your site today and yesterday and we pulled some traffic reports  great job, Shannon Doung, associate marketing manager at Walmart.com, wrote to Mr. Brim in early November. Almost over 43,000 clicks just yesterday alone, she added. Thanks for giving us a nice write-up on your front page. Keep up the great work! More Articles in Business »</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/business/14shop.html?ref=targetcorporation">As Home Depot Fights a Weak Economy, Wal-Mart Sees a Ray of Holiday Hope<date>Published: November 14, 2007</date><text>Economic unease, from the credit markets to the gas pump, is proving a boon to the nations largest discount retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, but a bust for the biggest home improvement chain, Home Depot, as consumers start to make choices about spending this holiday season. Wal-Mart said yesterday that its profit rose 8 percent in the third quarter, and the chain raised its earnings forecast for the year. But Home Depot said its profit plunged 27 percent, and the company cut its forecast for the year. The starkly different performances suggest that American consumers, bruised by a struggling housing market and rising fuel prices, are skipping expensive purchases  from kitchen renovations to new suits  in favor of discounted merchandise. That is setting the stage for a holiday shopping season with unexpected winners and losers. Traditional powerhouses like Ralph Lauren, Nordstrom and Coach are bracing for a slowdown, as customers start to flock to budget brands like Target, Wal-Mart and Marshalls. Analysts are calling it the trade-down holiday season  a reversal from years past, when consumers had traded up to higher-end chains. David Schick, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, sees a pocketed recession that has left industries like home improvement retailing in trouble. If you sell furniture, home improvement products and building materials, Mr. Schick said, you are in a significant recession. Wal-Mart, known for its low prices, said its profit was $2.9 billion for the quarter that ended Oct. 31, as sales rose 9 percent, to $90.1 billion. The giant retailer credited strong sales of household staples like groceries and beauty products. The chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said that times are a little tougher than they were a year ago, and consumers appreciate that they can count on Wal-Mart to save them money. A year ago, Wal-Mart began an ill-fated push into higher-priced, fashionable merchandise, like 600-thread count sheets and fur-trimmed denim, which misfired with consumers. Since then, the company has returned to its original message of low prices, emphasizing basics like T-shirts and towels  and running commercials that say that the store saves the average American family $2,500 a year. Bill Dreher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said that, as a result, Wal-Mart was now well positioned for the current state of the economy. Consumers, Mr. Dreher said, are shying away from higher-priced products. Wal-Mart has benefited from cost-cutting efforts. By scheduling more store staff members at peak shopping times, like evenings and weekends, and by reducing inventory, it has improved its profit, Mr. Dreher said. Mr. Scott, in a conference call yesterday, predicted that earnings from continuing operations would be $3.13 to $3.17 a share for the year, higher than Wal-Mart had forecast in August. Shares of Wal-Mart surged yesterday, closing up $2.65, to $45.97. The outlook was less rosy at Home Depot. The chains third-quarter profit fell to $1.1 billion from $1.5 billion in the period a year ago, with its chief executive, Frank S. Blake, blaming a tough environment in the housing market. Behind the earnings dip: sales dropped to $19 billion, from $19.6 billion, as demand for home-building supplies like lumber and remodeling materials like paint has tumbled. We thought the housing market would be soft, but we were not pessimistic enough, Carol B. Tomé, Home Depots chief financial officer, said The company predicted that annual earnings from continuing operations could drop as much as 11 percent a share, a steeper fall than previously predicted. As we look at the rest of the year, Ms. Tomé said, the market will remain soft. A sluggish housing market is not the only problem for Home Depot. The chain has promised that, after years of cutting back on service, it would invest heavily in new employees and remodeling of stores. Now, that extra spending has coincided with an economic downturn. Ms. Tomé said the improvements would help Home Depot after the economy turned around, even if it hurt earnings this year. There is evidence that the investments are paying off. Mr. Schick, of Stifel Nicolaus, said his surveys show customer service had improved, if only slightly. If this means making less money in 2008 and even 2009, its worth it, Mr. Schick said. We want the company to protect its long-term brand reputation, he said. Shares of Home Depot rose 66 cents, to $29.12. With the credit market in turmoil, Home Depot said it would not rush to finish the planned $22.5 billion stock repurchase program announced in June. So far, it has bought back $10.7 billion in shares. Yesterday, the company said it would take a cautious stance on the remaining share repurchases. We are not backing away, Ms. Tomé said in an interview. But things are very different than they were in June. More Articles in Business »</text></article>
