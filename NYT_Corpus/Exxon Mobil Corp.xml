Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company and an active driller in new shale fields in the United States, Europe and Argentina, said its capital and exploration expenditures of $26.7 billion for the first nine months of the year represented a record. Still, natural gas production was flat and oil production was moderately lower in the latest quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts. “We continue pursuing new opportunities to meet growing energy demand while supporting economic growth, including job creation,” Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chairman, said in a statement. The rise in oil prices over the last year has spurred the drilling activity, but it may be difficult for oil companies to sustain the earnings momentum since they will face stiffer earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter and into 2012. Also, natural gas prices have been weakening. Oil prices began a steady climb at the end of last year because of expectations that the global economy was recovering and sudden fears of supply shortages as political turmoil began spreading across North Africa and the Middle East. The Brent oil benchmark price jumped nearly 50 percent in the July through September period, compared with the year before, but oil prices have eased a bit in recent months. Many energy experts say oil prices can remain at current high levels, but only if Europe averts a financial collapse; the United States avoids another recession; and China, India and other developing countries continue to grow strongly. A MasterCard SpendingPulse survey released this week showed that demand for gasoline in the United States declined by 2.8 percent for the week ending Oct. 21, compared with a year ago. Demand in Europe has also eased, although it has been more resilient in developing countries. Supplies are also uncertain, and they remain tight. The turmoil in Libya took 1.3 million barrels a day of high-quality crude off world markets earlier in the year. Exports are flowing again but at much reduced rates. Meanwhile violence in Nigeria has put production there in doubt. Exxon Mobil reported that its net income rose to $10.33 billion in the three months through September, from $7.35 billion a year earlier. But analysts were not impressed. “Production volumes and chemical earnings are tracking below our full-year estimates,” Allen Good, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a note. Net income at Shell, the biggest oil company in Europe, rose to $6.98 billion in the quarter from $3.46 billion in the same period a year earlier. “Shell did a lot better than expected, but Exxon came roughly in line,” said Fadel Gheit, senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. “Shell had higher than expected production and better than expected refining and chemical results.” Thursday in the United States, shares of Exxon closed at $81.88 up 1 percent. Shell’s Class A American depositary receipts were at $73.33, up nearly 2 percent. Benchmark oil prices rose by more than 3 percent. Shell’s chief executive, Peter Voser, said in a statement, “We are making good progress against our targets, to deliver a more competitive performance.” Mr. Voser said Shell was moving ahead with its plan to focus on its most valuable assets and invest in new projects to ensure continued production. Shell has completed $6.2 billion of asset sales so far this year — $1.8 billion of them in the third quarter. Shell had planned to raise $5 billion from asset sales this year. New projects in Qatar and Canada helped production levels, Shell said. The projects are part of a $100 billion b investment program While oil company earnings have been generally strong, several other companies this week have reported a drop in production volumes because of a variety of problems, including the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East, production shortfalls in Alaska and the North Sea, and interruptions in production because of an oil spill in China. ConocoPhillips, which reported a 12 percent production drop, said it was increasing its exploration and production budget by roughly $2 billion, or nearly 15 percent, next year. BP said that it expected production to grow as it prepares to drill again in the Gulf of Mexico more than a year after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

Swiger, a senior vice president at Exxon, said that the conventional gas fields currently supplying Europe were expected to decline, raising dependence on imports delivered through pipelines and as liquefied natural gas. “By 2030, Europeans are expected to be significantly more reliant on imports of natural gas than they are today,” Mr. Swiger said in London at the Oil and Money conference, which is jointly organized by The International Herald Tribune and Energy Intelligence. “Europe’s unconventional natural resources can provide the opportunity to offset this changing mix with domestic supplies,” he said. One of the main obstacles to drilling for gas trapped in fine-grained shale rock is the growing public skepticism about the environmental impact of “fracking,” using pressurized water, sand and chemicals to release the gas. Mr. Swiger’s remarks came after a decision this summer by the French Parliament to revoke permits from companies using the method. Since then, health and environmental activists have stepped up efforts to extend similar restrictions across the European Union. Europe is far from united against gas fracking. Poland and Bulgaria are among the countries enthusiastically developing shale gas, partly as a counterweight to mounting anxiety about depending on Russia for natural gas. Mr. Swiger said fracking could be done safely and cleanly, and he said local regulators should be permitted to decide whether to permit the technique in their communities. He said Europe’s shale resources, although different in some ways from the resources in North America, “may prove to be significant,” partly because of rapidly evolving drilling and extraction techniques. Since 2008, Exxon has drilled a number of exploratory wells in Germany for shale gas and for coal-bed methane, which is found in coal seams or in the surrounding rock, Exxon officials said. The company is still analyzing those results to establish their commercial potential, the officials said. Other experts who spoke at the conference said geologists needed to do more work to determine whether shale gas could be produced in Europe. “It remains to be seen whether Central Europe has the same rich source rocks as North America,” said Thomas S. Ahlbrandt, a former senior official at the United States Geological Survey, which is credited with numerous oil and gas discoveries. Michelle Michot Foss, chief energy economist and head of the Center for Energy Economics, part of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, said companies looking for opportunities in shale gas were undeterred — for now. “You go where you can go, and Eastern Europe seems to be more the place where everybody can go right now,” Ms. Foss said. “The question will be whether they get enough drilling and commercial success in Poland and other places to make it worthwhile.”LONDON — A senior executive from Exxon Mobil warned Wednesday that Europe could miss a chance to reduce its dependence on imported energy by making it too difficult to develop shale gas and so-called unconventional resources.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/world/americas/recent-discoveries-put-americas-back-in-oil-companies-sights.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Recent Discoveries Put Americas Back in Oil Companies’ Sights<date>Published: September 19, 2011</date><text>RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil has begun building its first nuclear submarine to protect its vast, new offshore oil discoveries. Colombia’s oil production is climbing so fast that it is closing in on Algeria’s and could hit Libya’s prewar levels in a few years. ExxonMobil is striking new deals in Argentina, which recently heralded its biggest oil discovery since the 1980s.Up and down the Americas, it is a similar story: a Chinese-built rig is preparing to drill in Cuban waters; a Canadian official has suggested that unemployed Americans could move north to help fill tens of thousands of new jobs in Canada’s expanding oil sands; and one of the hemisphere’s hottest new oil pursuits is actually in the United States, at a shale formation in North Dakota’s prairie that is producing 400,000 barrels of oil a day and is part of a broader shift that could ease American dependence on Middle Eastern oil. For the first time in decades, the emerging prize of global energy may be the Americas, where Western oil companies are refocusing their gaze in a rush to explore clusters of coveted oil fields. “This is an historic shift that’s occurring, recalling the time before World War II when the U.S. and its neighbors in the hemisphere were the world’s main source of oil,” said Daniel Yergin, an American oil historian. “To some degree, we’re going to see a new rebalancing, with the Western Hemisphere moving back to self-sufficiency.” The hemisphere’s oil boom is all the more remarkable given that two of its traditional energy powerhouses, Venezuela and Mexico, have largely been left out, held in check by entrenched resource nationalism. Venezuela is now considered to have bigger oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, putting it at the top of OPEC’s rankings. If it opened up more to foreign investment, it could tip the scales further in the hemisphere’s direction. Exactly how the Americas’ growing oil clout might rebalance energy geopolitics remains an open question. The Middle East can still influence oil prices greatly, its oil fields are generally cheaper to develop, and some countries in the region are endowed with great reserves. Moreover, the Americas still vie for investment with other oil-rich regions, like Russia’s portion of the Arctic Ocean and West African waters. Security concerns like the abduction of oil workers could, as they have in the past, prevent Colombia from continuing to raise output. And environmental and financing questions pose persistent challenges to the rapid growth of the hemisphere’s oil production. Still, the new oil exploits in the Americas suggest that technology may be trumping geology, especially in the region’s two largest economies, the United States and Brazil. The rock formations in Texas and North Dakota were thought to be largely fruitless propositions before contentious exploration methods involving horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing — the blasting of water, chemicals and sand through rock to free oil inside, known as fracking — gained momentum. While the contamination of water supplies by fracking is a matter of fierce environmental debate, the technology is already reversing long-declining oil production in the United States, with overall output from locations where oil is contained in shale and other rocks projected to exceed two million barrels a day by 2020, according to some estimates. The United States already produces about half of its own oil needs, so the increase could help it further peel away dependence on foreign oil. The challenges of tapping Brazil’s new offshore fields, located beneath 6,000 feet of water and salt beds formed by the evaporation of ancient oceans, are even greater. Petrobras, which has ambitions of surpassing ExxonMobil as the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, is investing more than $200 billion to meet its goals. “Brazil will become an oil power by the end of the decade, with production in line with that of Iran,” said Pedro Cordeiro, an energy consultant here for Bain &amp; Company, who sees the country’s oil production climbing to 5.5 million barrels a day by 2020. Construction backlogs could slow Brazil’s offshore expansion. But resurgent industries related to the oil boom, like shipbuilding, and strategic efforts like nuclear submarine construction to defend oil wells, underscore Brazil’s plan of using its energy resources to project global power from this hemisphere. “No other place on the planet is seeing this kind of investment,” said Márcio Mello, a former Petrobras geologist who is now the chief executive of HRT, a new oil company based here. “This decade is our chance to rise.” Optimism is plentiful here, and even a bit of hubris can creep into conversation. Still, oil analysts say the hemisphere’s new energy profile is already challenging the sway OPEC has long held. Canada, for instance, is already the top petroleum exporter to the United States, followed by Mexico. Beyond that, output from Canada’s oil sands may almost double to three million barrels a day by 2020, and there is an effort under way to build a pipeline to the Gulf Coast, stirring an environmental debate. Investors from other regions, notably Chinese oil companies, are also wading into the hemisphere’s oil plays, whether in Brazil’s “pre salt” fields or the tight oil areas in the United States. They are looking to secure new oil supplies or gain expertise that would help them explore similar rock formations within their own borders. The United States and Brazil do not see eye to eye on every issue — the Obama administration is still hesitant about endorsing the country’s ambition for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council — but the hemisphere’s two largest economies are strengthening energy ties, further cementing an already expansive economic relationship. As the United States has cut OPEC imports by more than a million barrels a day since 2007, Brazil and Colombia have emerged as leading suppliers to the American market, surpassing Kuwait. President Obama visited Brazil in March, refusing to delay the trip even as war was raging in Libya, emphasizing while here that he wanted the United States to be a “major customer” for Brazil’s oil once production climbed at new fields. American officials came again for talks in August, focusing on offshore exploration and biofuels cooperation. The United States is close to overtaking Brazil as the world’s largest ethanol exporter, a significant turn, and American producers may actually increase their corn ethanol exports to Brazil. The shift stems from factors including weak harvests of sugar, which is used in Brazil to produce ethanol, and rising costs for land and labor. The hemisphere’s capacity to meet demand for fuels from sources of new importance, whether agriculture or shale formations, is arguably what makes it competitive with countries like Iraq and Libya, which have abundant conventional reserves but face hurdles getting the oil out of the ground. “Middle East turmoil is almost always bad for oil production,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, associate director of Rice University’s Energy Program. “This should make the world’s megasuppliers nervous, since the pendulum has already begun to move in this direction.”RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil has begun building its first nuclear submarine to protect its vast, new offshore oil discoveries.

Commandos armed with assault rifles raided the offices of the British oil company BP on Wednesday, in one of the ritual armed searches of white-collar premises that are common enough here to have a nickname: masky shows (so-called because of the balaclavas the agents often wear, although this time they reportedly burst in bare-faced.) Whether the Russians intended to send a signal or not, the episode seemed to serve notice to Exxon that, when it comes to dealing with the state-run business world of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, Exxon isn’t in Texas anymore. “That incident, I’m sure, made Exxon very uncomfortable the day after they signed their deal,” Matthew Lasov, director of research at Frontier Strategy Group, a consultancy for companies operating in the developing world, said of the raid. Exxon, though a spokesman, declined to comment. BP, during its long involvement in Russia, has had so many police run-ins that its stock price often nudges up or down in response to raids or the arrests of employees. Russian oil and natural gas accounts for about a quarter of BP’s output — about the same portion as from the company’s fields in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. Until now, Exxon’s involvement in Russia has not been as extensive as BP’s. But that could change, based on the joint venture deal Exxon signed Tuesday with the state company Rosneft to explore for oil in the Russian sector of the Arctic Ocean and in the Black Sea. Rosneft, in turn, is to gain access to Exxon operations, including oil fields in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Partner beware was the watchword Wednesday in a note to clients by the Eurasia Group, another risk analysis organization. “The politics of the Russian energy sector remain treacherous, as the 31st of August raid on BP’s Moscow office demonstrates,” the note said. Exxon, it said, “will now be deeply engaged in those politics for many years.” Wednesday’s BP raid stemmed from a lawsuit filed by minority shareholders of the company’s Russian joint venture TNK-BP. They contend BP damaged their stock’s value by entering into a deal earlier this year with Rosneft that unraveled after opposition by the main Russian partners in TNK-BP. That debacle was an embarrassment to Prime Minister Putin, who had originally blessed the BP-Rosneft deal. An arbitration court, a type of Russian civil court, in the Siberian city of Tyumen authorized Wednesday’s search of the Moscow offices, according to both BP and a lawyer for the minority shareholders. The target of the search was apparently documents subpoenaed in the lawsuit, which BP had balked at surrendering, according to Vladimir Buyanov, a BP spokesman. The agents who raided BP’s offices on the 17th and 18th floors of the Lotte Plaza, a high-rise on Moscow’s Garden Ring, wore commando-style uniforms with yellow shoulder patches saying “Special Forces,” according to BP employees. The agents were escorting two investigators from the Russian federal bailiff service, who were not armed. The police ushered employees out, and began rifling through papers. Despite the assault rifles, “there was no great panic,” one BP employee said. “I was able to come up and get my keys” even after the armed men arrived. The employee, who insisted on anonymity, described the armed police as polite and not overtly intimidating. “They were just a group of comrades with the badges of special forces, in black outfits, with assault rifles — nothing extraordinary.” One policeman “slightly” pushed an employee with the butt of a rifle, to encourage him to get out of his chair faster, according to two employees who were present. “We believe that these legal actions are without merit and appear to be part of a pressure campaign against BP’s business in Russia,” Jeremy Huck, the president of BP Russia, said in an interview. It is not the first time BP has been the star of a masky show. In 2008, the Federal Security Service, a successor agency to the K.G.B., arrested an employee in the headquarters of the TNK-BP venture, just up Arbat Street from the BP offices, on charges of industrial espionage that were later dropped. That same year, labor and immigration authorities stripped visas and work permits from BP’s expatriate executives — including Robert Dudley, who was then the director of TNK-BP and is now BP’s chief executive. Mr. Dudley was compelled to leave Russia and run TNK-BP from an undisclosed location. Whatever the legal issues, and the relative merits, foreign businessmen in Moscow have for years implored the government to refrain from conducting such raids in white-collar cases. Their protests have had little effect. In February, masked and armed law enforcement agents raided Deutsche Bank’s main office in Moscow, looking for documents related to a commercial mortgage. In November, masked police officers armed with automatic weapons raided a bank belonging to the billionaire Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a part owner of the national airline Aeroflot. “It’s fine to do business there,” Mr. Lasov, the risk consultant, said in a telephone interview from Washington. “But you should do business with those sorts of expectations.” Olga Slobodchikova contributed reporting from Moscow.MOSCOW — Exxon Mobil, welcome to the world of the “masky show.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/business/global/exxon-and-rosneft-partner-in-russian-oil-deal.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Exxon Wins Prized Access to Arctic With Russia Deal<date>Published: August 30, 2011</date><text>MOSCOW — Exxon Mobil won a coveted prize in the global petroleum industry Tuesday with an agreement to explore for oil in a Russian portion of the Arctic Ocean that is being opened for drilling even as Alaskan waters remain mostly off limits.The agreement seemed to supersede a similar but failed deal that Russia’s state oil company, Rosneft, reached with the British oil giant BP this year — with a few striking differences. Where BP had planned to swap stock, Exxon, which is based in Texas, agreed to give Rosneft assets elsewhere in the world, including some that Exxon owns in the deepwater zones of the Gulf of Mexico and on land in Texas. In announcing the arrangement at a surprise signing in the Russian resort town of Sochi, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin described a sweeping global alliance — and a potentially vast investment by Exxon in the Russian Arctic. “The scale of the investment is very large,” Mr. Putin said. “It’s scary to utter such huge figures.” But while Russian news agencies said Mr. Putin had stated the potential investments by both companies to be as high as $500 billion, Exxon officials said the figures, at least initially, would more likely be in the tens of billions of dollars. For Exxon, which is America’s largest company and is a spinoff of the original Standard Oil, the deal means wading deeper into Russia’s risky business environment. As a result of the agreement, which is almost certain to require a review in Washington, more of the company’s investments and future earnings will partly hinge on policies set in the Kremlin. Russia has reneged on deals with Western oil companies before. In 2006, for example, it compelled Royal Dutch Shell to sell 50 percent of a Sakhalin offshore development to Gazprom, a state company — after Shell spent a decade and more than $20 billion of its own money and that of other investors to build the project’s infrastructure. Until now, Exxon’s principal investment in Russia has been a production sharing agreement on Sakhalin Island, on Russia’s eastern coast. That arrangement, which waives local taxes and provides the Russian government a share of the oil produced, is regarded as less risky than the deal made Tuesday. Under the new agreement, the state-owned Rosneft could become a part-owner of drilling operations in the United States. Those operations could include two of the industry’s most contentious oil extraction methods — drilling for oil in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and using the so-called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technique on land. The Russians want to learn about both types of drilling for use at home. The Rosneft deal would also be among the most significant attempts by a company from a country that is not an American ally to acquire United States oil fields since Cnooc, the large Chinese oil company, tried to buy the California oil company Unocal. Although it was not formally banned, that deal fell apart in 2005 after members of Congress criticized the potential Chinese ownership of American oil assets. Having an American company win the Rosneft deal could also suggest that the Obama administration’s policy of détente toward Russia, known as the reset, can benefit United States businesses, said Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy. The Exxon-Rosneft deal, if completed, would further a long-held goal of the Russian petroleum industry to diversify internationally. It would allow Russia to do that by using access to reserves at home to gain the necessary capital and technological expertise. Russia’s economy is dependent on petroleum for about 60 percent of its export revenue. Policies here are also important for world oil supplies, as Russia now pumps more oil than Saudi Arabia. Yet Russia’s onshore fields in Siberia are in decline, threatening the prosperity and geopolitical clout that has come with oil wealth in the last decade. Despite the varying accounts of the overall potential value of the agreement, a fact sheet released by the companies indicated an initial commitment to invest $3.2 billion in exploration in the Kara Sea, the body of water between the northern coast of European Russia and the Novaya Zemlya island chain. Once seen as a useless, ice-clogged backwater, the Kara Sea now has the attention of oil companies. That is partly because the sea ice is apparently receding — possibly a result of global warming — which would ease exploration and drilling. 1 2 Next Page »MOSCOW — Exxon Mobil won a coveted prize in the global petroleum industry Tuesday with an agreement to explore for oil in a Russian portion of the Arctic Ocean that is being opened for drilling even as Alaskan waters remain mostly off limits.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/business/the-advantages-of-breaking-up-breakingviews.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">The Advantages of Breaking Up - BreakingViews<date>Published: August 30, 2011</date><text> Conglomerates are out of favor.

By contrast, Marathon Oil, which announced a division of its upstream and downstream activities in January and completed it within six months, is a different story. Shareholders who now hold stock in Marathon Oil and Marathon Petroleum have paper worth around 10 percent more than it was just before the split was announced — and more than a 15 percent improvement on a market-adjusted basis because the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index has fallen. Owners of Motorola, which split into Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions in January after almost three years of preparation, now hold stock worth over 20 percent more, market-adjusted, than it was before the split was set in motion in March 2008. The gain didn’t emerge until after the split was completed. Much of it, in fact, is a result of Google’s recent deal to buy Mobility, which came at a 63 percent premium. But that’s often precisely the point of splitting — it makes the individual pieces more appetizing. Investors may become impatient waiting for announced separations actually to happen. And some, even then, may never see much benefit.

Just months after the collapse of BP’s much-hyped tie-up with Russia’s state oil company Rosneft, the British energy group’s United States rival has swooped in.

The Arctic reserves in question are the very same fields that were to be the subject of the original BP-Rosneft tie-up. But in contrast to that partnership, with its proposed $16 billion share swap, Exxon and Rosneft are not talking about swapping equity. Instead, Exxon is offering Rosneft access to some of its projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Exxon, in effect, has been the lucky beneficiary of chance circumstances. Rosneft’s embarrassment following the collapse of the BP deal has enabled Exxon to enter on more favorable terms. While the Russians love the idea of share swaps, the Western partners are keen to gain access to Russia’s vast reserves — but not so keen on getting Russian owners. There’s always the risk of a hidden obstacle. But Exxon is unlikely to face anything like the difficulties that scotched BP’s deal. These resulted mainly from BP’s terrible legal preparation and political misjudgments. Still, any investment in Russia can encounter snags. While Russia is eager to attract Western partners now, there’s the danger of it revising terms in the future. And searching for oil in the remote and inhospitable Arctic is an uncertain business — the envisaged $3.2 billion in exploration costs could escalate. On balance, though, Exxon looks like an eventual big winner, gaining access to sought-after acreage with an estimated 110 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. Rosneft can be happy, too, that it is getting access to both Exxon’s offshore expertise and North American projects. The only big loser is BP. Not only is its deal with Rosneft now dead, but Rosneft is under little pressure to discuss possible alternative projects any time soon.

Where BP had planned to swap stock, Exxon, which is based in Texas, agreed to give Rosneft assets elsewhere in the world, including some that Exxon owns in the deepwater zones of the Gulf of Mexico and on land in Texas. In announcing the arrangement at a surprise signing in the Russian resort town of Sochi, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin described a sweeping global alliance — and a potentially vast investment by Exxon in the Russian Arctic. “The scale of the investment is very large,” Mr. Putin said. “It’s scary to utter such huge figures.” But while Russian news agencies said Mr. Putin had stated the potential investments by both companies to be as high as $500 billion, Exxon officials said the figures, at least initially, would more likely be in the tens of billions of dollars. For Exxon, which is America’s largest company and is a spinoff of the original Standard Oil, the deal means wading deeper into Russia’s risky business environment. As a result of the agreement, which is almost certain to require a review in Washington, more of the company’s investments and future earnings will partly hinge on policies set in the Kremlin. Russia has reneged on deals with Western oil companies before. In 2006, for example, it compelled Royal Dutch Shell to sell 50 percent of a Sakhalin offshore development to Gazprom, a state company — after Shell spent a decade and more than $20 billion of its own money and that of other investors to build the project’s infrastructure. Until now, Exxon’s principal investment in Russia has been a production sharing agreement on Sakhalin Island, on Russia’s eastern coast. That arrangement, which waives local taxes and provides the Russian government a share of the oil produced, is regarded as less risky than the deal made Tuesday. Under the new agreement, the state-owned Rosneft could become a part-owner of drilling operations in the United States. Those operations could include two of the industry’s most contentious oil extraction methods — drilling for oil in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and using the so-called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technique on land. The Russians want to learn about both types of drilling for use at home. The Rosneft deal would also be among the most significant attempts by a company from a country that is not an American ally to acquire United States oil fields since Cnooc, the large Chinese oil company, tried to buy the California oil company Unocal. Although it was not formally banned, that deal fell apart in 2005 after members of Congress criticized the potential Chinese ownership of American oil assets. Having an American company win the Rosneft deal could also suggest that the Obama administration’s policy of détente toward Russia, known as the reset, can benefit United States businesses, said Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy. The Exxon-Rosneft deal, if completed, would further a long-held goal of the Russian petroleum industry to diversify internationally. It would allow Russia to do that by using access to reserves at home to gain the necessary capital and technological expertise. Russia’s economy is dependent on petroleum for about 60 percent of its export revenue. Policies here are also important for world oil supplies, as Russia now pumps more oil than Saudi Arabia. Yet Russia’s onshore fields in Siberia are in decline, threatening the prosperity and geopolitical clout that has come with oil wealth in the last decade. Despite the varying accounts of the overall potential value of the agreement, a fact sheet released by the companies indicated an initial commitment to invest $3.2 billion in exploration in the Kara Sea, the body of water between the northern coast of European Russia and the Novaya Zemlya island chain. Once seen as a useless, ice-clogged backwater, the Kara Sea now has the attention of oil companies. That is partly because the sea ice is apparently receding — possibly a result of global warming — which would ease exploration and drilling. 1 2 Next Page »MOSCOW — Exxon Mobil won a coveted prize in the global petroleum industry Tuesday with an agreement to explore for oil in a Russian portion of the Arctic Ocean that is being opened for drilling even as Alaskan waters remain mostly off limits.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/world/europe/16briefs-oilspill.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Scotland: Oil Spill in the North Sea<date>Published: August 15, 2011</date><text>Royal Dutch Shell estimated Monday that 54,600 gallons of oil had spilled into the North Sea from an oil rig off Scotland’s eastern coast.

Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, presenting plans for a new operating system after he rejoined the company in 1997. 4:02 p.m. | Updated At the end of regular trading Tuesday, Exxon was again the most valuable company. Apple’s market cap was $346.74 billion vs. Exxon’s $348.32 billion. In 1996, Apple Computer, the venerable founder of the personal computer, was struggling to stay afloat. Now, 15 years later, Apple is the most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. On Tuesday, the maker of iPhones, iPads and Macs, passed Exxon Mobil, the energy company, to take the title as the stock market’s most valued company. At 2:30 p.m., Apple’s stock was $366.62, up $10.66, or 3.02 percent, giving it a market valuation of $337.11 billion. Exxon Mobil was $68.90, down $1.45, or 2.07 percent, with a market valuation of $333.54 billion, nearly $4 billion less than Apple. Just three weeks ago Apple was $50 billion shy of  being crowned with the title of the world’s most valuable company. But that was before oil prices started falling and a broad stock market sell-off that drove Exxon’s stock price down faster than Apple’s fell. “This all goes back to Apple’s distillation when it changed its name from Apple Computer, to Apple, and their role as a technology influencer in everything we touch,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst specializing in mobile technology for Forrester Research. “Over the years Apple has become a massive force on our digital lifestyles, and they way that we connect with each other.” Much of Apple’s revival can be credited to Steven P. Jobs, the company’s co-founder and chief executive. Mr. Jobs, who left Apple in 1985 to start NeXT Computers, rejoined Apple in 1997, reorganizing the company’s focus, product line and management team.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/business/aaa-rating-is-a-rarity-in-business.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">AAA Rating Is a Rarity in Business<date>Published: August 2, 2011</date><text>Hanging over the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington has been the threat that the United States could lose its AAA credit rating, a coveted measure of the federal government’s financial strength. But in corporate America, the top rating long ago became an anachronism.Scores of big corporations have lost their AAA status in recent years — only four non-financial companies continue to hold the rating — as it became seen in board rooms as more of a straitjacket than a path to riches. Just as many consumers relied on their credit cards to finance a higher standard of living, companies took on more debt to reap bigger returns. The choice did not appear to hurt them. The borrowing costs of companies with AAA ratings and those one level below are not that far apart. Investors, in other words, do not see much difference in quality. “It’s like you are going from a Rolls-Royce to a Mercedes — not from a Rolls-Royce to a Yugo,” said Chris Orndorff, a senior portfolio manager for the bond giant Western Asset Management. “That’s nothing to be ashamed of.” More and more, in fact, companies have found that a AAA credit rating is not something worth aspiring to if a more conservative approach means lower profits. Today, markets often render credit judgments before the rating agencies can take out their pens, so a downgrade has a less noticeable effect. By that time, many of the traditional benefits of being deemed AAA, like lower borrowing costs and reputational glow, have evaporated. In the early 1980s, around 60 companies had AAA credit. By 2000, the number of AAA companies was about 15. Today just four corporations— Automatic Data Processing, Exxon Mobil, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Microsoft — can claim those once-coveted three initials. (Five big insurers and several government affiliated organizations can too.) Analysts say corporate buyouts and acquisitions accelerated the trend. Many AAA companies lost their ratings when they were taken over and their new owners loaded them with cheap debt to help pay for the deal. Other strategic decisions also triggered downgrades. UPS, for example, struck a long-term agreement with its union workers in fall 2007 that raised pay and benefits but froze certain pension obligations. Soon after, the ratings agencies started knocking down the company’s credit rating to AA because of the new pension arrangement. “Maintaining a AAA rating is not a financial goal of this company,” a UPS spokesman said at the time. Investors barely reacted. In the three months after the downgrade, yields on UPS bonds responded by increasing about 0.4 percentage point from 5.32 percent. Today, with borrowers enjoying ultra-low interest rates, the bond yields are back to their levels in late 2007. Meanwhile, the financial crisis and deep recession laid into several of the sturdiest pillars of American capitalism. Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric and Pfizer all lost their AAA ratings. Still, a funny thing happened when these companies were sent down to AA. Investors shrugged off the change; the markets had already rendered their verdict. Borrowing costs for General Electric and Berkshire actually fell in the weeks after they were downgraded in spring 2009, amid a broader market rally. “The rating agencies were late to the party,” said Mr. Orndorff, the bond investor. Ratings for companies and countries are viewed differently, even if they are evaluated in much the same way. For most Americans, the prospect that the government could lose its AAA credit rating is almost unthinkable — a blow to national pride and consumer confidence that could turn out to be more damaging than any increase in borrowing costs. That is why even after President Obama signed a law on Tuesday that lifted the debt ceiling, some in Washington were worried that the plan’s spending cuts were not deep enough to appease all the major rating agencies. For now, all three major rating firms continue to give the United States a AAA rating. But on Tuesday, Moody’s said its outlook was negative after putting the government on notice last month that it could be downgraded. Fitch said on Tuesday that it planned to complete another review of the government’s finances by the end of this month, and Standard &amp; Poor’s has warned that the United States might lose its rating if it did not sharply rein in the deficit. It helps, of course, that the dollar remains the world’s leading currency, ensuring that demand for United States debt is strong in spite of the nation’s myriad financial challenges. But the truth is, even as the government maintained its AAA grade, the markets suggested long ago that the United States was no longer deserving of such a high rating. 1 2 Next Page »Hanging over the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington has been the threat that the United States could lose its AAA credit rating, a coveted measure of the federal government’s financial strength.

It was the strongest quarter for Exxon since it set a corporate quarterly earnings record in 2008, when crude oil prices approached $150 a barrel before collapsing as the world economy slowed. Exxon, the biggest American oil company, reported earnings of $10.7 billion for the quarter, up from $7.56 billion the year before, but a bit less than Wall Street had been expecting. Shell, the largest European oil company, posted profits of $8.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. The results of Exxon and Shell, as well as ConocoPhillips and BP earlier in the week, highlighted the oil majors’ dependence on high oil prices for profit growth at a time when they are straining to pick up new reserves to increase or even sustain future production. Major oil companies are finding it difficult to acquire new reserves because countries rich in oil and gas have become increasingly grudging in their dealings with foreign companies, striking production-sharing agreements that offer them a smaller share of the profits. That is prompting oil companies to drill deeper below the ocean’s surface and explore in the Arctic for oil — expensive propositions that put pressure on profits — or drill for less profitable gas. “We are going into a world where finding the oil and gas is going to be more complex,” Shell’s chief executive, Peter R. Voser, acknowledged as his company released its results. “It needs more money.” Smaller oil and gas companies like EOG Resources and Cabot Oil and Gas have proved to be more nimble than the giants in recent years, moving into shale oil and gas fields in the United States and booking new reserves at a far faster rate. The major companies have tried to follow suit over the last two years, but a glut of natural gas from rising production has weakened the profitability of some fields. Growth in oil company profits for the rest of the year is uncertain, given that oil and gas prices are strongly tied to the health of the global economy. Demand in the United States for diesel, gasoline and other petroleum products has eased in recent months after starting the year strongly, and the growth in Chinese oil demand has slowed somewhat. “If the economy does not grow faster, earnings growth in the energy sector is obviously going to be limited,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company. “You can’t grow energy demand in a flat economy.” The Energy Department reported on Thursday that United States oil demand in May fell by nearly 2.5 percent from the same month the year before, representing a decline of 464,000 barrels a day. The department also reported that oil inventories last week were up by 2.3 million barrels from the week before, suggesting a less-than-robust summer driving season. Oil prices have eased more than 10 percent since the spring, when crude prices peaked because of the loss of 1.3 million barrels of oil a day of production caused by the turmoil in Libya and fears that instability could spread to major producers like Saudi Arabia and Algeria. Since then, increased production in Saudi Arabia and the release of oil from strategic reserves in the United States and other industrialized countries have helped prevent shortages. Even if oil demand and prices increase, large oil companies will strain to keep up production. ConocoPhillips reported a 90,000-barrel-a-day decline in oil and gas production for the quarter on Wednesday, though earnings were higher anyway as a result of higher oil prices. Shell also reported a decline of 100,000 barrels of daily oil and gas production for the quarter, in part because of permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP accident last year. Exxon’s earnings were lower than analysts had expected despite strong revenue growth, reflecting a record $10.3 billion in capital and exploration expenditures in new oil and gas projects, up 58 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Exxon’s purchase of XTO Energy last year to become the nation’s biggest natural gas producer has been questioned by some investors in light of low gas prices, but the acquisition helped Exxon’s oil and gas production to increase by 10 percent from a year ago. Exxon is continuing to invest heavily in natural gas, purchasing 317,000 acres for $1.7 billion in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale field in June. It is also drilling deep in the Gulf of Mexico, and last month announced the discovery of a new deepwater field holding the equivalent of 700 million barrels of oil. Edward Westlake, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Exxon profits were hurt by the shutdown in production in several oil fields and refineries around the world for maintenance reasons. He said he was optimistic about the company’s prospects because of an increase of annual capital expenditures from $21 billion in 2007 to around $35 billion currently, along with its aggressive acquisition of oil and gas acreage. “One day this will pay off,” Mr. Westlake added. While Exxon has tried to buy reserves, Shell has invested heavily over the last decade in complex projects, particularly in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. Its $20 billion Pearl project, which will produce liquid fuels out of natural gas on an enormous scale, has been going through final tests this year and should begin to produce profits in coming months. For Shell, “earnings and cash flow should greatly improve over the next few years,” said Brian M. Youngberg, an oil analyst at Edward Jones.

Lazard missed second-quarter estimates on Thursday, though only by a penny, because of lower growth in advisory fees than peers. Evercore Partners delivered a similar underperformance as compensation expenses more than doubled. And Greenhill &amp; Company has been frantically trying to calm nerves about departing executives.On the surface, the confluence of issues might suggest such specialist financial firms are struggling to keep up the momentum of the last few years. The credit crisis was a boon. Losses by trading desks and treasury departments at larger rivals made the likes of Lazard look more attractive to both clients and bankers. The fear has always been that a recovery for the big players could cause a reversal of fortunes. But each looks robust enough to ride out these latest bumps. Greenhill’s mini-exodus isn’t as worrying as first appeared when investors wiped 12 percent off the stock in a single day not long ago. Most of those leaving were no longer front-line bankers. And while Evercore’s pay more than doubled from a year ago, it was only just ahead of the impressive jump in advisory fees. At 70 percent of revenue, compensation still looks high and needs to come down, but it’s not out of whack from previous quarters. As for Lazard, run by Ken Jacobs, its 17 percent increase in M.&amp; A. revenue from a year ago might look lackluster next to Evercore’s, and even more so against the jumps of at least 70 percent enjoyed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. But Lazard’s business also held up better than many last year. What’s more, Lazard has fingers in more pies than its smaller rivals. Its M.&amp; A. revenue was more than double Evercore’s in the three months to June. And Lazard also boasts a strong asset-management business, which has almost doubled revenue in just two years and now accounts for almost half the firm’s top line. Of course, the danger still remains that megabanks will be more aggressive about using their balance sheets to steal market share. For now, though, despite these latest troubles, independent M.&amp; A. shops should be able to keep holding their own. Exxon’s Long View The pressure is mounting for Exxon Mobil’s boss, Rex W. Tillerson. Disappointing second-quarter results on Thursday represented a rare miss of Wall Street expectations for the oil titan. The primary culprit was refining, where earnings can be capricious. But at a time when Exxon is still struggling to win over investors on its beefy bet on natural gas, Mr. Tillerson can ill afford such slips. American natural gas is the usual suspect these days when shareholders look for weakness at Exxon Mobil. Ever since the biggest American company by market capitalization splurged $31 billion on the gas giant XTO last year, low prices have been a drag. This time the blame lay elsewhere. Along with refining and marketing, European gas, until this latest quarter a major money spinner, proved a letdown. Many of the problems appear to be caused by unexpected maintenance costs and other one-off factors. That won’t necessarily let Mr. Tillerson off the hook. Since the XTO deal was announced in December 2009, Exxon’s shares have trailed rivals, rising around 20 percent, against nearly 45 percent for those of ConocoPhillips, while Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell have also bounded ahead. Such punishment looks overly harsh. While American gas prices are down about 15 percent since the deal, XTO has been no bust. Since the acquisition, Exxon has bolstered XTO’s natural gas resources by about a third to 60 trillion cubic feet. The exodus of skilled shale drillers and executives from XTO that many feared has failed to materialize. Production has been rising. In addition, far from being cowed by the broader reaction to the big transaction, Mr. Tillerson has bolted on several smaller American gas firms. It is to Exxon’s credit that it refuses to be a slave to quarterly expectations. Mr. Tillerson’s long-term bet that gas will overtake coal as the world’s second most widely used fuel by 2030 still looks credible. But that won’t stop investors from getting restive if Exxon’s misses become more common.

San Diego will soon be home to an all-electric, one-way car sharing service from Car2go, the Daimler subsidiary. The first of its kind in the United States, the program would allow members to rent the Smart Fortwo Electric Drive by the minute in a city that is becoming a focal point for E.V. launches. Unlike Zipcar, the car-sharing service that requires users to pick up and return a vehicle from the same reserved spot, Car2go allows a driver to choose from open parking spaces in designated areas. The idea is to make car sharing more practical for circumstances where a car might otherwise sit parked, racking up charges during the hours between arriving at a destination and returning home. Car2go first began in Ulm, Germany, three years ago. In late 2009, Daimler brought the service to the United States as a pilot program for city employees in Austin, Tex. The service now is available in Austin,  Ulm, Hamburg, Germany, and Vancouver, British Columbia. Those fleets used conventional Smart cars. The electric Car2go program in San Diego,scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011 with 300 cars, should be followed by a similar service in Amsterdam later this year, Car2go representatives said on Wednesday. In 2009, a small-scale, all-electric car sharing program backed by ExxonMobil and run by a local museum began in Baltimore using batteries and cars produced by Electrovaya, a Canadian manufacturer. Autolib, a subscription-based program in France, expects to start rolling out 3,000 electric vehicles in the fall. And earlier this year, Zipcar introduced eight plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius vehicles, well ahead of the cars’ 2012 showroom target. Previously, members of Zipcar and some regional car sharing services have had access to plug-in hybrid conversions, but with major automakers rolling out purely electric models, the services have another option, provided they are willing to guarantee a sufficient battery charge for each trip. The electric Smart Fortwo can travel up to 84 miles on a full charge, according to Daimler, and recharging a battery from zero charge takes up to eight hours. A statement issued by the company on Wednesday, however, said the charge time should not pose a challenge to adoption. Recharging, it said, was “seldom necessary, as the daily stretch covered by Car2go drivers in urban areas rarely exceeds six miles.” In San Diego, the electric Smart cars will recharge at stations developed by Ecotality, the Arizona-based E.V. infrastructure company, which is identifying sites and installing its charge points. Ecotality plans to install as many as 1,000 charging stations throughout the San Diego area by the end of the year as part of the federally funded E.V. Project. Still, some details have yet to be resolved. Rachel Laing, press secretary to San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the city is working to change the municipal code to “allow car sharing services to park on-street and have charging there.” A car sharing provider like Car2go then would reimburse the city for lost revenue from parking meters. The city council is expected to vote on the amendment next Tuesday, a final legislative hurdle before Car2go can move forward.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/science/earth/12brfs-TESTSINDICAT_BRF.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Montana: Tests Indicate Water Is Safe After Oil Spill<date>Published: July 11, 2011</date><text>Air and drinking water along the Yellowstone River in Montana have so far met safety standards in government tests after an oil spill, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday. The agency said that while floodwaters had prevented tests since the rupture of an Exxon Mobil pipeline on July 1, the waters had receded and the E.P.A. was able to begin testing and cleanup. Findings so far have shown that the water is safe to drink, the agency said.  </text></article><article index="7" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/well-water-safe-so-far-spot-tests-show-after-oil-spill/?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Drinking Water Seems Safe After Spill, E.P.A. Reports<date>July 11, 2011, 4:06 pm</date><text>Associated PressExxon Mobil workers scanned an area along the Yellowstone River on Monday. Ten days into the oil spill on the Yellowstone River in Montana, the federal government is releasing test data indicating that the air and drinking water do not appear to pose safety risks. According to Exxon Mobil, about 1,000 barrels of oil leaked from its Silvertip pipeline into the Yellowstone River. Raging flood waters prevented testing on the river in the immediate aftermath of the leak. But on Sunday night, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement that the waters had receded enough that the agency had begun putting boats in the river. The agency is also sampling hundreds of drinking wells in the area. “We want to screen every drinking water well within the heaviest affected area between Laurel and Billings as quickly as possible and move downriver from there,” Steve Merritt, the E.P.A.’s on-scene coordinator, said in a news release. Findings from earlier tests of water systems have so far shown that the water is safe for drinking. The E.P.A. has said in earlier statements that the odor of evaporating oil is not causing severe air pollution but that some people could experience symptoms like nausea and headaches. A map for both water and air monitoring data is now available at the E.P.A.’s Web site. The E.P.A. said it had rejected several elements of Exxon Mobil’s proposed work plan as incomplete or requiring technical clarification. It expects to receive an amended work plan next week, the agency said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/business/global/exxon-to-face-lawsuit-over-rights-violations-in-indonesia.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Exxon to Face Lawsuit Over Rights Violations in Indonesia<date>Published: July 8, 2011</date><text>Indonesian villagers who accused security forces employed by the Exxon Mobil Corporation of murder, torture and other atrocities have regained their right to sue the giant oil company in the United States.A federal appeals court said on Friday that companies were not immune from liability under a 1789 law known as the Alien Tort Statute for “heinous conduct” committed by their agents in violation of human rights norms. The 15 villagers contended in their lawsuit that family members were killed and that others were “beaten, burned, shocked with cattle prods, kicked and subjected to other forms of brutality and cruelty” amounting to torture in Indonesia’s Aceh province between 1999 and 2001, a period of civil unrest. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said Exxon Mobil should be forced to defend against such charges and sent the case back to the trial court. Given that laws in civilized nations hold corporations responsible for lesser wrongs, “it would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in lawsuits brought for shockingly egregious violations of universally recognized principles of international law,” Judge Judith Rogers wrote for a 2-1 majority. Friday’s decision reversed part of a ruling by the United States District Court in Washington. It is also at odds with a landmark ruling last September by the Court of Appeals for the Second District in New York, raising the prospect that the case will reach the Supreme Court. “The ruling basically says that corporations are not above the law,” said Jennifer Green, a University of Minnesota law professor and director of that school’s human rights litigation clinic, who submitted a brief on the plaintiffs’ behalf. “When corporations have knowledge that they are aiding and abetting human rights abuses, they can be held liable in a U.S. court.” Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Tex., said it was reviewing Friday’s decision, calling the plaintiffs’ claims “baseless.” Patrick McGinn, a spokesman, said in a statement that Exxon “strongly condemns human rights violations in any form.”Indonesian villagers who accused security forces employed by the Exxon Mobil Corporation of murder, torture and other atrocities have regained their right to sue the giant oil company in the United States.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/us/09spill.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Governor Says Montana Was Misled on Oil Spill<date>Published: July 8, 2011</date><text>HELENA, Mont. — Gov. Brian Schweitzer criticized Exxon Mobil on Friday for its handling of the Yellowstone River oil spill, saying that the company had withheld documents and misled state officials and local residents about the pipeline rupture.He also accused the company of failing to honor open-government laws by denying the state access to Exxon Mobil documents. And as a result, he said, the state is pulling its people from an incident command task force set up to assess and clean up the spill, which occurred July 1. At a public meeting of about 100 people along the river, the governor passed out sample jars for residents to fill with contaminated soil and water for testing. The evidence, he said, could be used in claims against Exxon Mobil. The list of the governor’s grievances was long. At first, he said, the company reported that the pipe had been turned off within six minutes. Federal records show it was nearly an hour. Company executives also initially said that oil had affected just 10 miles of the river, but “now oil has completely inundated the low-lying areas of a state park 40 miles downriver.” Exxon Mobil has maintained that 750 to 1,000 barrels were spilled, but the governor said he believed it could be more. Pius Rolheiser, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, explained the discrepancies by saying, “When we became aware of the incident, we did our best to calculate with the best engineering data that we had.” As for the timing, company officials said that because of the high volume of oil moving through a pipeline — 39 barrels per minute — a ruptured line must be shut down slowly. “You can’t just close it,” said Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman. “If you close it too fast, you could damage valves and lose your ability to control it.” The House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials has scheduled the first Congressional hearing on the spill and on pipeline safety for Thursday. Local residents had complained that the pipeline was exposed for more than a year because of erosion from the Yellowstone River, Mr. Schweitzer said, and had asked Exxon Mobil to inspect it. Company officials said they did an inspection in May but found no problems. Mr. Schweitzer has written a “demand” letter to Exxon Mobil and the federal Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration requesting that documents and physical evidence about the condition of the line and the rupture be preserved. “I said, ‘Do not touch that pipeline without a State of Montana representative present,’ ” he said. “We want to see what happened and preserve evidence.” Mr. Jeffers apologized Friday for the lack of transparency and response and said it was a function of an emergency, not an effort to mislead. “We have apologized and continue to apologize, but there is no attempt to delay or misrepresent.” Jenny Pelej, a staff member of the National Wildlife Federation in Billings, Mont., said it was a mistake to have companies in charge of cleanup efforts after a spill. “Relying on industry to lead the cleanup is a mistake,” she said. “We always see problems when industry is in charge.” “They say there is all this cleanup happening, but people haven’t seen much,” said Alexis Bonogofsky, who works for the National Wildlife Federation and whose hayfields and wetlands along the Yellowstone were flooded with oily water. “And there’s no good answers. People don’t know what the effects are, long term or short term” The governor also complained that residents had been kept in the dark about health concerns, and whether they could harvest hay, irrigate or use their well water. “No one has contacted them,” he said. Exxon Mobil security guards have also tried to keep residents and the news media from public areas, the governor said. Because of the high level of the river, oil has spread into low-lying areas along much of its course. “It’s spreading a thin film on the wetlands of the Yellowstone,” he said. “These wetlands are the health and wealth of the river, and thousands of acres have been compromised.” The rupture may have bearing on a debate over a controversial pipeline being proposed that would carry heavy crude oil from the tar sands of Alberta to Texas and which is expected to pass through Montana and other parts of the West. In spite of this spill, the governor said he still supported it. A spokesman from the Environmental Protection Agency, the lead agency on the cleanup, said Saturday morning that the oil was concentrated within 20 to 30 miles of the spill and that it had remained largely within that range for four days.  About 350 people were actively cleaning oil at 30 sites.HELENA, Mont. — Gov.

Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, said that so far, none of the towns that take drinking water from the river have stopped doing so. Amy Cilimburg, an organizer with the conservation group Montana Audubon, confirmed that few oiled birds had been spotted and said that the group was concerned about contaminants’ entering the food chain in the long term.

Crews that continue to arrive have had difficulty sopping up oil and putting oil booms around slicks because the river is so active. “The situation is very challenging,” said Gary Pruessing, president of the Exxon Mobil Pipeline Company, a division of Exxon Mobil, who added that the river was four times its usual flow for this time of year. “Because the river is outside its banks, it’s flowing into areas that don’t normally flood. Yesterday, we saw the tops of fence posts in the river, and we just can’t wade into there and start working.” River banks are unstable, and there are snags, or large dead trees in the water. So cleanup workers, wearing orange life vests and hard hats, are working the mosquito-infested shoreline. Investigators trying to determine the cause of the spill have not been able to get on boats or get close to where the leak occurred late Friday night. The river is flooding people’s yards and fields and carrying oil with it. The crew brought in by the oil company, which now numbers 125 or so, is using special large pads that repel water and soak up oil. Where the river has receded, it has left a deposit of oil that looks like a bathtub ring on the ground. There is an oily brown sheen on the water in places where the water is slack, and much of the grass has been stained black by escaped crude. Along Thiel Road, which runs parallel to the swollen river and is less than a mile from the pipeline rupture, homeowners were concerned. “We have old asparagus plants, apple trees and wild plums along the river, and there’s oil all around them,” said Carla Van Siclen, speaking of her four-acre property. “We’re concerned about them dying out, and they are pretty good natural bank protection. I’m a little irritated we haven’t gotten the full story, and I wish they would hold a public meeting.” A faint smell of diesel hung in the air as Ms. Van Siclen spoke. “It depends on which way the wind is blowing,” she said. Alan G. Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said, “The testing we’ve done has not indicated any cause for concern for human health.” Air-quality monitoring showed no benzene and no hydrogen sulfide. A hot line set up has garnered about 75 calls — mostly residents reporting oil damage to property, or with questions. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard are part of the unified command here. Estimates put the leak at 750 to 1,000 barrels, which is as much as 42,000 gallons, and the river has carried it a long way. The pipeline had passed an inspection in December and an audit of the pipeline’s integrity management program by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration in June. It had been briefly shut down in May but restarted when the company determined nothing was amiss. “We feel this line was safe even with the high current,” said Mr. Pruessing, who would not estimate a cost or a time frame for the cleanup. The cleanup has been split into four zones that total 241 miles. The first seven miles from where the spill occurred is where most of the oil is concentrated, and that is where the cleanup crew is most active. The second is 12 miles out, then 144 and 78. “Our job is to contain the source of the leak and monitor the spread,” said Frank Box, head of the rapid response team for Exxon Mobil. “We’re following E.P.A.’s advice.” Mr. Box said his team had 32,000 feet of boom ready to be put out and 2,300 packs of large oil-absorbing pads. “We’re still ramping up,” he said. The crews, expected to number 200 or more this week, are made up of people who work for Exxon Mobil around the country and are tasked with showing up quickly at emergencies. Both the Audubon Society and International Bird Rescue are ready to help, but as of Monday evening, according to Mr. Pruessing, there had been only one report of a contaminated goose. Rescuers sent to find it could not locate it. Exxon Mobil officials had noticed a significant reduction in pressure Saturday night and shut off the pipeline. Later a policeman reported smelling diesel fumes. It is not known why the pipeline, a 12-inch line with a concrete coating buried 6 to 13 feet below the river back in 1991 , ruptured, although many speculate it is related to the surging river. The line was last tested with a “smart pig,” a pipeline inspection gauge, that went through in 2009. “We regret what happened and we need to apologize to everybody affected in Montana,” Mr. Pruessing said. “We’re here until the job is done.” Joanna Foster contributed reporting from New York.LAUREL, Mont. — Specially trained crews streaming into this refinery town to clean up tens of thousands of gallons of oil that spilled into the Yellowstone River from a ruptured Exxon Mobil pipeline over the weekend have found their efforts hampered by a muddy, raging river filled with debris.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/us/04spill.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Ruptured Montana Pipeline Was Shut Down Before<date>Published: July 3, 2011</date><text>An Exxon Mobil pipeline that ruptured late Friday along the Yellowstone River in south-central Montana, spilling crude oil into the river and forcing evacuations, had been shut down for one day in May because of concerns over the rising waters on the Yellowstone, the company said Sunday.The president of the Exxon Mobil Pipeline Company, Gary Pruessing, said in a conference call that the company decided to restart the line after examining its safety record and determining that the risks of failure were minimal. The pipeline, which is buried about eight feet below the river, runs about 70 miles to Billings, Mont., where it supplies an Exxon refinery. Mr. Pruessing said it was unclear what had caused the spill. In addition to sending 70 employees to clean up and investigate, Exxon said it was using contractors and airplanes to search for oil along the riverbank and to assess whether the shores had been damaged. On Sunday, Exxon’s team was joined by federal and state workers who traveled to the affected area to assess the damage. Mr. Pruessing said that company observers flying over the river had seen “very little soiling” beyond Billings. Tim Thennis, a public assistance officer at the Montana Disaster and Emergency Services Division, told The Associated Press that the company’s claim was reasonable but had not been independently verified. “My guess is that as fast as that water is moving, it’s probably dissipating pretty quick,” he said. Claire Hassett, a spokeswoman for Exxon, said by telephone on Sunday that the company had reduced production at its refinery in Billings and shut down the pipeline after the leak, which the company estimated at 750 to 1,000 barrels. Industry experts said that the amount was relatively small, although it remained uncertain precisely how much oil had been leaked. The company said that air-quality monitoring in the affected area was continuing and that there was no danger to public health. It said the impact of the spill on water quality had not been determined. The pipeline burst about 10 miles west of Billings, coating parts of the Yellowstone River that run past Laurel — a town of about 6,500 downstream from the rupture — with shiny patches of oil. Throughout the weekend, cleanup crews in Laurel worked to lessen the impact of the spill, laying down absorbent sheets along the banks of the river to mop up some of the escaped oil and measuring fumes to determine the health threat. Fearing a possible explosion, officials in Laurel evacuated about 140 people on Saturday just after midnight, then allowed them to return at 4 a.m. after tests showed that fumes from the leaked oil had dissipated, The Associated Press reported. While the cause of the rupture was not immediately known, Brent Peters, the fire chief for Laurel, told the news agency that it might have been caused by high waters eroding parts of the riverbed and exposing the pipeline to debris. The pipeline is 12 inches wide and runs to Billings, an area with three refineries, Exxon Mobil said. All three were shut down after the spill. Exxon Mobil said it had called in its North American Regional Response Team to help clean up the spill, and a Fire Department spokesman in Laurel said more than 100 people, including officials with the Environmental Protection Agency, were also dispatched. In a statement, Exxon Mobil said it “deeply regrets this release and is working hard with local emergency authorities to mitigate the impacts of this release on the surrounding communities and to the environment.” “The pipeline has been shut down and the segment where the release occurred has been isolated,” the statement added. “All appropriate state and federal authorities have been alerted.” The rupture occurred around 11:30 p.m. Friday. Duane Winslow, a disaster and emergency services coordinator for Yellowstone County, told a local television station, KTVQ, that all oil companies with pipelines near the river were told to immediately shut them down, and that the damaged pipe was shut down within half an hour.

Dr. Soon, who works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has researched whether solar variance might be responsible for climate warming. He earned notoriety among climatologists when he attacked Michael Mann’s so-called “hockey stick” graph of warming temperatures in 2003 and when he wrote that polar bears were not threatened by a decline in Arctic ice in 2007. Dr. Soon did not rely to e-mail messages or return messages left with his employer seeking comment. 12:52 p.m. | Updated Charles Alcock, director of the astrophysics center, acknowledged that Dr. Soon’s grants since 2003 had come from fossil-fuel energy companies or from foundations that receive money from the fossil fuel industry. He said that Dr. Soon’s grants were not typical for his staff and that it was a “concern” but nonetheless acceptable, because the money came with no conditions and the grant sources were disclosed when Dr. Soon’s work was published. “As long as there are no strings with the money and as long as there is full disclosure, I am fine with it,” Dr. Alcock said. What may be more intriguing about the Greenpeace report, ussued on Tuesday, is a tangential finding: according to Greenpeace’s research director, Kert Davies, ExxonMobil has sharply reduced its funding for groups that dispute that global warming is under way. Greenpeace used a Freedom of Information Act Request to obtain extensive records and e-mails from the Smithsonian regarding Dr. Soon’s research funding. It discovered, for example, a $55,000 grant from ExxonMobil in 2007-8 for research on “Arctic climate change.” For more than a decade now, climate scientists and their allies have linked Exxon money to groups that promote skepticism of the science underlying global warming. The links brought Exxon some negative press. Then in 2008, the company promised shareholders it would stop financing groups that had become a “distraction.” Many climate groups wondered if it would follow through. But recent evidence indicates that it has to a significant extent. Alan Jeffers, an ExxonMobil spokesperson, says the company and its foundation are no longer disbursing grants to Dr. Soon, for example. Greenpeace said that Exxon’s most recent annual worldwide giving report, released this week, confirmed that it was not financing Dr. Soon. Numerous other groups that are critics of climate science and longtime Exxon beneficiaries — the Frontiers of Freedom and the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, for example — have also been dropped, according to that report. In total, Greenpeace found Exxon has reduced its donations to such groups from a peak of $3.4 million in 2005 to less than $800,000 for 2010. “Without giving them any credit, it does make a big difference,” Mr. Davies said. Mr. Jeffers of Exxon also acknowledged a shift in his company’s funding strategy. “I am not prepared to talk about the individual grant requirements, but if their positions are distracting to how we are going to meet the energy needs of the world, then we didn’t want to fund them,” he said. Mr. Davies said he would still like Exxon to acknowledge the damage that Greenpeace contends the company has done. “It is like leaving a room without ever saying they are sorry,” he said. An earlier version of this post misstated the name of the center for which the astrophysicist Willie Soon works. It is the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, not the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysics Observatory.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/business/energy-environment/17oil.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">As Iraq Oil Industry Rebuilds, American Subcontractors Dominate the Work<date>Published: June 16, 2011</date><text>MOSCOW — When Iraq auctioned rights to rebuild and expand its oil industry two years ago, the Russian company Lukoil won a hefty portion — a field holding about 10 percent of Iraq’s known oil reserves.It seemed a geopolitical victory for Lukoil. And because only one of the 11 fields that the Iraqis auctioned off  went to an American oil company — Exxon Mobil — it also seemed as if few petroleum benefits would flow to the country that took the lead role in the war, the United States. The auction’s outcome helped defuse criticism in the Arab world that the United States had invaded Iraq for its oil. “No one, even the United States, can steal the oil,” the Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, said at the time. But American companies can, apparently, drill for the oil. In fact, American drilling companies stand to make tens of billions of dollars from the new petroleum activity in Iraq long before any of the oil producers start seeing any returns on their investments. Lukoil and many of the other international oil companies that won fields in the auction are now subcontracting mostly with the four largely American oil services companies that are global leaders in their field: Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Weatherford International and Schlumberger. Those four have won the largest portion of the subcontracts to drill for oil, build wells and refurbish old equipment. “Iraq is a huge opportunity for contractors,” Alex Munton, a Middle East analyst for Wood Mackenzie, a research and consulting firm based in Edinburgh, said by telephone. Mr. Munton estimated that about half of the $150 billion the international majors are expected to invest at Iraqi oil fields over the next decade would go to drilling subcontractors — most of it to the big four operators, which all have ties to the Texas oil industry. Halliburton and Baker Hughes are based in Houston, as is the drilling unit of Schlumberger, which is based in Paris. Weatherford, though now incorporated in Switzerland, was founded in Texas and still has big operations there. Michael Klare, professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College and an authority on oil and conflict, said that American oil services companies were generally dominant both in the Middle East and globally because of their advanced drilling technology. So it is no surprise, he said, they came out on top in Iraq, too — whatever the initial diplomatic appearances. United States officials have said that American experts who advised the Iraqi oil ministry about ways to restore and increase petroleum production did so without seeking any preferences for American companies. And immediately after the 2009 auction round won by Lukoil, the United States Embassy spokesman in Baghdad, Philip Frayne, told Reuters that “the results of the bid round should lay to rest the old canard that the U.S. intervened in Iraq to secure Iraqi oil for American companies.” But Professor Klare said that the American officials who had advised the Iraqi government on its contracting decisions almost certainly expected American oil services companies to win a good portion of the business there, regardless who won the primary contracts. “There’s no question that they would assume as much,” he said. The American oil services companies, which have been in Iraq for years on contract with the United States occupation authorities and military, are expanding their presence even as the American military prepares to pull out. For example, Halliburton, once led by former Vice President Dick Cheney, has 600 employees in Iraq today and said in a statement that it intended to hire several hundred more before the end of the year. “We continue to win significant contracts in Iraq, and are investing heavily in our infrastructure,” Halliburton said. The 11 contracts Iraq signed with oil majors, including the six for the largest fields, are intended to raise Iraqi output from about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day now to 12 million barrels daily in 2017. Some of the oil services contracts are for repairing currently productive fields, others to tap mostly unused sites. 1 2 Next Page »MOSCOW — When Iraq auctioned rights to rebuild and expand its oil industry two years ago, the Russian company Lukoil won a hefty portion — a field holding about 10 percent of Iraq’s known oil reserves.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/business/10views.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Prices Fall for Some Gas-Rich Shale Land<date>Published: June 9, 2011</date><text>The gas-rich land of the Marcellus shale has offered some of the hottest wildcat real estate in recent years. But if Exxon Mobil’s recent $1.7 billion acquisition is any indication, the days of eye-watering prices are over. The oil titan is paying barely half the price such acres were fetching last year, as the frenzy has shifted to Texas. Cheaper real estate may even make gas assets look appealing again.Exxon is paying about $5,000 an acre by buying Phillips Resources and TWP, two private drillers in the Marcellus, which spans Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia. This may not seem like such a steal when compared with 2006 prices of around $100 an acre. Even so, it does suggest that energy land values are coming off the boil. The property boom reached its peak when Chesapeake Energy doled out $17,000 an acre in early 2010, according to research from IHS. Mitsui and India’s Reliance Industries both paid $14,000 an acre in the spring of 2010. As recently as December, Exco Resources was willing to pay $9,000. There are good reasons the froth has come out of Marcellus. Gas prices have been in the doldrums and are running about a third their 2008 peak. Meanwhile, state regulators are taking a tougher line on hydraulic fracturing, supported by a skeptical public. This has sent energy firms flocking to the oilier Eagle Ford Shale, which is now experiencing a property boom of its own. Marathon Oil paid $20,000 an acre for oil-rich land in Texas earlier this month. But with less hype built into land values, the Marcellus is looking like a good bet again. The glut of gas that depressed prices is finally clearing. And because of its proximity to the New York market, gas from the Marcellus sells for a premium. Shell’s announcement that it is mulling a new petrochemical plant in the region suggests more demand may be on its way. The Marcellus may be yesterday’s story in terms of land values. But Exxon’s purchase is a vote of confidence that gas from the region will flow, alongside rich profits. Picard’s Filings Irving H. Picard is aiming for a triple-word score in the Bernard L. Madoff case. He’s not playing Scrabble, but Mr. Picard, the trustee for the Ponzi schemer’s victims, is trying for triple damages of $59 billion by suing Mr. Madoff’s Italian and Austrian banks for racketeering. Though the novel tack raises issues that a judge on June 6 agreed to resolve, Mr. Picard has again shown a creative touch in beating the bushes for cash. The civil case against the Vienna-based Bank Medici, its founder Sonja Kohn and Milan’s UniCredit is an audacious leap in size and law for Mr. Picard. At $19.6 billion, it is by far his biggest suit. And with the racketeering counts, he not only shoots for triple the base amount, but also opens a can of legal worms. For starters, all the defendants are based abroad, and the Supreme Court decided last year that a federal law didn’t cover foreigners acting outside the United States unless it specifically said so. The racketeering law RICO mentions nothing about foreign applications, which led a federal court to dismiss a case last year. Mr. Picard’s approach may be to argue that Ms. Kohn started the racketeering scheme in New York. A thornier issue is whether Mr. Picard has the right to sue under the racketeering law. As trustee, he stands legally in the Madoff fund’s shoes. By accusing the banks and Ms. Kohn of duping investors and using the fund’s accounts, he arguably includes Mr. Madoff in the pattern of racketeering. An objection may be that the trustee, as Mr. Madoff’s legal avatar, can’t sue as a victim of a fraud he participated in. If he makes his preliminary case, though, he’ll wield a frightening weapon. In addition to triple damages, RICO winners can win legal fees and the losers’ property. And the trustee is far from done. On Wednesday he filed another lawsuit, seeking $975 million that Kingate Global Fund and other feeder funds are accused of taking out of the Ponzi scheme. Beside the racketeering claim and the $10 billion already recovered, the $175 million in fees charged so far by Mr. Picard is looking like peanuts.   For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.The gas-rich land of the Marcellus shale has offered some of the hottest wildcat real estate in recent years.

Exxon estimated the new wells could produce about 700 million barrels of oil equivalent. “Seven hundred million barrels doesn’t happen very often,” said John White, an analyst at Triple Double Advisors in Houston. “That’s a lot of oil.” This portion of the deepwater gulf is thought to hold as much as 15 billion barrels of oil. Recent large discoveries there include BP’s Kaskida field, estimated to hold three billion barrels of oil. Exxon had reserves of 24.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of last year. The discoveries are the company’s first in the gulf since the government moratorium was lifted. The find “speaks to the fact there are resources in the gulf and if we have a tax and regulatory environment that will encourage us to find and produce our own domestic oil, the industry will respond,” said Mark Routt, an energy industry consultant with KBC Advanced Technologies. Exxon has not finished its development plan yet, and more drilling will be needed to further appraise how much oil is in the reservoir. Production could be years away. The wells are located in the Keathley Canyon at a water depth of about 7,000 feet, 250 miles southwest of New Orleans. Exxon owns a 50 percent interest in the three new wells, which are part-owned by Eni Petroleum U.S., part of Eni of Italy, and Petrobras of Brazil. Last month, Noble Energy said it made an oil discovery at its Santiago prospect in the deepwater gulf. Noble was the first company to receive a drilling permit from regulators after the drilling halt.Exxon Mobil has made two big new oil discoveries and a natural gas find in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, news that underscores the importance of the basin to American crude output.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/on-our-radar-oil-shareholders-demand-fracking-disclosures/?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">On Our Radar: Oil Shareholders Demand Fracking Disclosures<date>May 26, 2011, 12:27 pm</date><text>Bloomberg NewsRex Tillerson, center, Exxon Mobil’s chief executive, spoke with shareholders on Wednesday in Dallas.

Democrats had hoped that directing the savings toward the deficit would make it harder for Republicans to reject it. In the 52-to-48 vote, 3 Democrats joined 45 Republicans in opposing the bill, which was supported by the Obama administration and fiscal watchdog groups that saw the tax help for the oil industry as wasteful. Forty-eight Democrats, two independents and two Republicans backed it. Energy-state Democrats criticized the initiative, saying it was misdirected and would do nothing to ease gasoline prices and could cost American jobs. “Why are we harming an industry — five large oil and gas companies that work internationally, that employ 9.2 million people in the United States directly?” asked Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. “Why are we doing it?” Republicans, who on Wednesday will push their own plan to open more areas to oil drilling and speed government permits, said the Democratic proposal would contribute to higher prices and increase dependence on foreign oil even though a recent Congressional Research Service report predicted any impact on prices would be negligible. “Clearly, this is not a serious effort to address the price of gas at the pump,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Under the proposal, Democrats would have eliminated five different tax breaks enjoyed by the multinational oil companies, producing an estimated $21 billion over 10 years. More than $12 billion would have come from eliminating a domestic manufacturing tax deduction for the big oil companies, and $6 billion would have been generated by ending their deductions for taxes paid to foreign governments. Critics suggest that the companies have been able to disguise what should be foreign royalty payments as taxes to reduce their tax liability. The bill would also deny the companies the ability to deduct some intangible drilling and development costs. The bill would have applied to BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The White House lent strong support to the effort though the president in the past has recommended applying revenue generated by ending the tax breaks to the development of alternative energy sources. “The administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to reduce federal deficits, the nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies,” the White House said.  Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, portrayed the vote as one that revealed the values of Republicans. “Instead of defending oil companies, Republicans should be defending the American taxpayer,” Mr. Reid said. “We believe this is the kind of wasteful spending that will lead to an agreement on reducing the debt.” While most Republicans have opposed eliminating the tax breaks as a back-door tax increase, some, including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman, have indicated a willingness to consider the idea. Also on Tuesday, Senate Democrats wrote to the Federal Trade Commission seeking an inquiry into whether domestic oil refiners had reduced production to drive down the gasoline supply and drive up prices. “This is just another piece of the puzzle that we need to get at as we try to take away taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and hold Big Oil accountable for whatever may be going on in the supply chain that is hurting the families that I work for,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.WASHINGTON — The Senate on Tuesday blocked a Democratic proposal to strip the five leading oil companies of tax breaks that backers of the measure said were unfairly padding industry profits while consumers were struggling with high gas prices.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/opinion/15sun1.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">A Big Whine From Big Oil<date>Published: May 14, 2011</date><text>With gas at $4 a gallon, oil at $100 a barrel and profits at near-record levels, it is hard to feel sympathy for the oil industry. Yet sympathy is what the C.E.O.’s of the five biggest companies asked for when they appeared Thursday before a Senate hearing on a Democratic proposal to eliminate about $2 billion in tax breaks for the Big Five.Exxon’s Rex Tillerson called the proposal “misinformed and discriminatory.” ConocoPhillips’s James Mulva, in a letter, called the idea “un-American” because it would supposedly cost American jobs, raise consumer prices and discourage investment — a position he reasserted during the hearings. The other three companies at the witness table, BP America, Shell and Chevron, raised similar complaints. How absurd are their claims? Utterly absurd. Take investment. In 2005, with oil nearing $60 a barrel, Mr. Mulva and other top executives told a Senate committee that the companies did not need the tax breaks to keep exploring for oil. Congress left them in place. Now that the Senate seems serious about getting rid of them, he and his colleagues have changed their tune — even though their companies obviously need them even less at $100 a barrel. Or take prices at the pump. In a memorandum to Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that eliminating the tax benefits would have virtually no effect on the price of gasoline. The impact on industry profits — the Big Five earned a robust $35 billion in the first quarter of this year alone — would be trivial. The report also addressed one more industry claim: that ending the tax breaks for the oil companies alone would be discriminatory. Most of the breaks — deductions for well depletion, intangible drilling costs and the like — are unique to the industry. The exception is a deduction for domestic production, designed to encourage all manufacturing companies to invest in this country. But as the research service pointed out, industry is not going to stop drilling on American territory as long as the oil is there and yielding big dollars. These subsidies are clearly unnecessary, and returning $2 billion to the Treasury would be a good thing. But more than anything, one has to wonder why the oil companies are fighting so hard for a comparatively small amount of cash, at least for them. The only explanation we can come up with is that they have always gotten what they wanted and expect to do so now, so why not? The House is certainly tripping over itself to do the industry’s bidding. Last week, it passed two more irresponsible bills accelerating drilling permits and authorizing leasing in long-protected waters of the north and central Atlantic coasts, the Southern California coast and Alaska, including Bristol Bay. It is as if the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico had never happened. It is imperative that the Senate block the House’s drilling and leasing plans, and that President Obama veto them if the Senate caves. And both the Senate and the president should keep pressing to eliminate the tax breaks. Three-fourths of Americans responding to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said they want to end them. Obviously, $4-a-gallon gas has something to do with this. But there is also an elemental matter of fairness here. As Mr. Obama put it in his radio address a week ago, when the oil companies are making huge profits and people are suffering and deficits are growing, “these tax giveaways aren’t right. They aren’t smart. And we need to end them.”With gas at $4 a gallon, oil at $100 a barrel and profits at near-record levels, it is hard to feel sympathy for the oil industry. Yet sympathy is what the C.E.O.’s of the five biggest companies asked for when they appeared Thursday before a Senate hearing on a Democratic proposal to eliminate about $2 billion in tax breaks for the Big Five.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/13oil.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">At Senate Hearing, Oil Executives Defend Tax Breaks<date>Published: May 12, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Executives of five of the largest oil companies on Thursday defended the $2.1 billion they receive each year in tax breaks, but said they would be willing to give them up as part of a comprehensive reform of the tax code.At a three-hour Senate Finance Committee hearing that was largely political theater interrupted occasionally by a serious tax policy discussion, the oil industry executives said their current tax breaks were not subsidies but legitimate tax deductions, shared in some cases with other industries. Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said that the provisions, such as a tax deduction for certain types of manufacturing, were not “special incentives, preferences or subsidies for oil and gas, but rather standard deductions applied across all businesses in the United States.” He said that eliminating the provision just for the oil industry would be “misinformed and discriminatory.” Under questioning from Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the panel’s chairman, Mr. Tillerson said that he would support repeal of the manufacturing tax credit and other tax incentives, as long as all businesses were treated the same. “Repeal it for everybody, gone,” he said. “Everything for everybody everywhere ought to be on the table.” At issue was a Democratic-sponsored bill to rescind roughly $2 billion of the $4 billion in tax incentives the oil industry now enjoys annually, with the money dedicated to deficit reduction. Mr. Tillerson shared the witness stand with top executives of the four other biggest multinational oil companies, John S. Watson of Chevron; Marvin E. Odum of the United States division of Shell; H. Lamar McKay of BP America; and James J. Mulva of ConocoPhillips. Collectively, the five companies reported more than $35 billion in first-quarter profits, and are on a pace to set record profits for the year. Their profits, their tax treatment and gasoline that in many areas is over $4 a gallon have made them juicy targets for Democrats seeking political points and painless revenue. The bill, which is expected to come to a vote on the Senate floor next week, is unlikely to command a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Even if it passes, it has little chance in the Republican-dominated House, which seems more inclined to provide the oil companies more access to public lands and waters than to clamp down on their tax incentives. The House passed the third of three Republican pro-drilling bills on Thursday. The measure would force the Interior Department to open large tracts of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts to oil exploration and to set annual production goals. The administration and most Democrats opposed it, saying that the Deepwater Horizon accident a year ago demonstrated the dangers of offshore operations. The Senate tax bill’s chief sponsor, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, demanded that Mr. Mulva apologize for a ConocoPhillips press release on Wednesday that called the tax proposal “un-American.” “I think that’s beyond the pale,” Mr. Menendez said. “I was hoping you would come here and apologize for that.” “Nothing was intended personally,” Mr. Mulva said. “So the bottom line is you’re unwilling to apologize,” Mr. Menendez said. “So I’ll continue to take offense.” Most Republicans, along with Democratic senators from energy-producing states, appear sure to oppose the plan. One oil-state Democrat, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, said this week that oil and gas subsidies accounted for less than 13 percent of all United States energy subsidies. The ranking Republican on the finance committee, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, suggested that Democrats were playing a cynical game, seeking to blame oil companies while, he asserted, intending to raise gasoline prices to force reduced consumption. “So while the American people ask Congress to do something about high gas prices,” he said, “the response of Democrats is to rail against oil executives, to mask the fact that their policy is actually to make the price at the pump more painful.” He called the hearing a “dog and pony show” and displayed a blown-up picture of a dog riding a pony, to underscore his argument that the hearing was just a chance for Democrats to score political points, without doing anything about high gas prices or a sensible energy policy. Mr. Odum of Shell said in an interview after the hearing that he was disappointed that the discussion focused on the relatively small value of the oil industry’s tax breaks and not on the broader question of how to address the deficit and expand domestic production of oil and gas. “The piece I take the most exception to, once you get past some of the theater aspects of the setting, is that it’s such a narrow view,” he said. “If the purpose is to address the deficit and the long-term health of the economy, the bigger picture is more important. And that is to produce more oil and gas and get the revenue streams and jobs from that.” Brian Knowlton contributed reporting.WASHINGTON — Executives of five of the largest oil companies on Thursday defended the $2.1 billion they receive each year in tax breaks, but said they would be willing to give them up as part of a comprehensive reform of the tax code.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/round-up-the-usual-c-e-o-s/?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Round Up the Usual C.E.O.'s<date>May 11, 2011, 11:28 am</date><text>Doug Mills/The New York TimesFrom left, executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell and BP being sworn last June before testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It has been nearly a year since the chief executives of the five biggest multinational oil companies were hauled before a committee of Congress for a ritual flaying. Last June, the heads of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and ConocoPhillips were called by the House Energy and Commerce Committee to testify on the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which at the time was still pouring 50,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico. On Thursday, the same Big Five executives will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to explain why they need more than $4 billion a year in tax breaks even as they are raking in near-record profits (more than $35 billion in the first quarter of 2011 alone). The cast of characters is the same: Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil; John S. Watson of Chevron; Marvin E. Odum of the United States division of Shell; H. Lamar McKay of BP America; and James J. Mulva of ConocoPhillips. These Congressional set pieces feature the dark-suited villains of the day (tobacco executives, bankers, oil company chieftains) standing in a row taking an oath to tell as much of the truth as their lawyers will allow. The legislative scorecard is mixed. The tobacco companies were brought to heel by state attorneys general, not by Congress. The Obama administration and Congress are still wrestling over bank regulation and consumer financial protection. Neither the House nor the Senate has passed comprehensive legislation dealing with offshore oil drilling. And despite the current angst over high gasoline prices, it is unlikely that Democrats can muster enough votes in both chambers to take away the oil companies’ favorable tax treatment. For those who want to follow the action, the hearing is scheduled for Thursday at 9 a.m. and can be watched at the Senate Finance Committee’s Web site.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/global/29oil.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Profit Jumps at Exxon and Shell<date>Published: April 28, 2011</date><text>Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell reported huge increases in their first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by higher oil prices and earnings from refining. Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, said net income rose 69 percent to $10.7 billion, or $2.14 a share, in the first three months of this year, from $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a share, in the same period last year. The earnings beat some analysts’ expectations, and was the fifth consecutive quarter that Exxon reported an earnings increase. Shell reported earlier on Thursday that its profit for the period rose 30 percent. Oil companies are benefiting from a rise of more than 30 percent of the price of oil over the last year. Concerns about political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East have pushed prices to heights some analysts said were not justified by the level of demand.

Japan will be spending tens of billions of dollars on rebuilding after its tsunami. Egypt can’t afford to finance an equivalent fund. But foreign powers could help by showing they’re not just interested in bombing neighboring Libya.In the long run, the most important thing is to accelerate free trade between Egypt and the industrialized world. More immediately, as the country teeters on the brink of recession, foreign countries can show they really care about Egypt’s transition to democracy by financing a fund to invest in physical and social infrastructure, like power generation, transit and education. Over the two months since the Egyptian revolution began, nothing concrete has emerged. Western countries want to help but are tight on cash. There’s also an understandable desire to link aid to the achievement of the milestones on the road to democracy. Meanwhile, Japan and Libya have captured attention. But it’s not too late to grab the moment. Nor is it impossible to raise cash. The main source of new money is the Persian Gulf. Even if Saudi Arabia and others bubbling with petrodollars don’t obviously have an interest in fostering democracy, they certainly have an interest in good relations with Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country. Meanwhile, Western countries could write off government-to-government debt or convert it into equity in infrastructure projects. Ideally, a reconstruction fund should be run as a public-private partnership, or a series of them, at arm’s length from the government. Given the fund would be invested largely in infrastructure, it should then be able to raise more money through borrowing. Added to donations and debt-for-equity swaps, total investments of around $20 billion, or just under 10 percent of G.D.P., might be possible. It could be argued such a plan would do little to solve Egypt’s short-term problems of rising unemployment and inflation. But this is only partly true. An external vote of confidence could encourage industry to push forward with its own investment plans. And the government could direct its own limited resources to priorities like subsidizing food if it knew cash was coming in to address structural problems. An investment in democracy would be money well spent. Exxon’s Equation Giant energy companies tend to treat their chemicals units as poor relations. The big exception is Exxon Mobil, whose chemicals business is now benefiting from speedy Asian growth. That gives the company an argument for vertical integration that rivals don’t have. But it’s only partly convincing. Instances of more specialized firms trading at higher valuations suggest the oil industry’s model of shackling racy exploration businesses with steady refining operations doesn’t help investors. Still, Exxon does have a case for keeping some of its businesses under a single roof. Teamwork between the company’s petrochemicals and refining operations has been particularly lucrative. This success is partly because of Exxon’s persistence with a business neglected by others. BP raised $9 billion selling the bulk of its chemical operations in 2005. Five years earlier, Chevron and Phillips Petroleum, before its merger with Conoco, shunted off their businesses into a joint venture. Meanwhile, Exxon’s chemical operation has outshone even pure chemicals firms like BASF with return on capital of around 26 percent in 2010, according to Exxon, against BASF’s 13 percent, as calculated by Morningstar. Much of it, though, is down to the benefits of coexistence with refining. Most chemicals, especially the more specialized kinds, are made at stand-alone plants. But 90 percent of Exxon’s operations are linked to refineries. That helps ensure every barrel of oil is optimally used. Shared infrastructure also trims costs. Still, it’s only half a case for Exxon’s version of integration. The logic remains shaky when extended to exploration and production. Neither refining nor chemicals benefit much from extracting oil and gas, often in quantities that do not always match their needs. And with shareholders in mind, there’s the issue of the conglomerate-style discount that investors apply to integrated groups. With about 16 percent of earnings last year coming from the chemicals division, against just 6 percent at ConocoPhillips, for example, Exxon will gain more than its rivals from surging demand in Asia. But Exxon’s prowess at chemistry doesn’t make it any better placed to benefit from the unstable mixture of refining and exploration.

The move is part of a broader strategy to improve shareholder returns. In February, the company approved a $13.5 billion capital program, the bulk of which will go toward exploration and production. Only about 9 percent will be devoted to refining and marketing — activities like getting gasoline to the consumers at the pump. The company sells gasoline in Europe and the United States, mainly under the Phillips 66 and Conoco brands. “This year’s capital budget reflects our emphasis on building the upstream business,” the chief executive, James J. Mulva, said in a statement in February. “We expect competitive returns from our increased investments in North American and Australian unconventional resource projects.” The company is also involved in Canadian oil sands projects. In a related initiative, the company has been aggressively buying back shares. Last year, ConocoPhillips announced plans to buy back as much as $5 billion worth of shares. With $4 billion repurchased, ConocoPhillips said in February that it would buy back an additional $10 billion of stock. “We are executing the plan set out last year to improve returns and create value through disciplined capital spending, noncore asset sales and growing production per share,” Mr. Mulva said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our unique approach prioritizes value creation over low margin production growth and is designed to position the company for higher returns and increased shareholder distributions in the future.” In the last two years, shares of ConocoPhillips have gained more than 80 percent, outperforming rivals like BP, Chevron and Exxon Mobil as well as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/opinion/lweb18frack.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Regulating Drilling: The View From Exxon Mobil<date>Published: March 17, 2011</date><text>To the Editor: “Address the Fears on ‘Fracking’ ” (Reuters Breakingviews, Business Day, March 7) portrays Exxon Mobil as forming “a united front against regulation.” Along with other companies, Exxon Mobil works with state regulatory authorities to develop sound, science-based regulations for oil and gas drilling.

Their aftermaths can seem infinite.More than two decades after the spill caused by the 1989 wreck of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska’s Prince William Sound, oil still coats the rocks on remote beaches and the great runs of herring that once filled fishermen’s nets have yet to return. And now, even after the Supreme Court has had its say, even after the company now called Exxon Mobil has pronounced the matter closed and said it would pay no more for environmental and economic damages, the company, the government and a marine biologist with a history of not letting either off the hook are heading back into federal court on Friday to argue over the meaning of a special section tucked into the original 1991 agreement over the spill that may or may not cost the company about $100 million. The section is known as the “reopener” provision, and, for the moment at least, it has reopened questions about Exxon Mobil’s continuing obligations and the government’s efforts — or lack thereof — to hold the company accountable. “If they were to be a responsible corporate citizen, they’d just cut a check on Friday and be done with it,” Rick Steiner, the marine biologist who has spent much of his career studying oil-spill issues, said of Exxon Mobil. As for the government, Mr. Steiner said his “greatest fear” is that it “wanted people to forget about” the remaining legal options in the Valdez case. Mr. Steiner has essentially forced the issue back into court single-handedly. In December, he filed a motion asking a judge to rely on the reopener provision to order Exxon to pay $115 million for what he said were unanticipated environmental damages caused by the wreck, which spilled 11 million gallons of oil into the sound and on its shores 22 years ago this month. Mr. Steiner points to studies that show a majority of the species affected by the spill have yet to fully recover. The amount he cites includes $92 million in damages — the reopener provision capped new damages at $100 million — and $23 million in interest. He said the government itself demanded the $92 million payment back in 2006, but has yet to follow up. The government, in consultation with the State of Alaska, replied to Mr. Steiner’s motion with one of its own saying that he had no standing in court. It also cited the government’s continuing studies of environmental damage. A spokesman for the Justice Department referred to a 2009 letter that said “these studies may well affect the scope of the government’s reopener claim.” Then, on Jan. 14, Judge H. Russel Holland of the United States District Court in Alaska, who presided over the 1991 agreement, surprised many people by ordering the parties to hold a hearing on the matter. The case was back on, the reopener provision suddenly relevant. “No doubt the public is interested in knowing the status of the latter proceedings,” Judge Holland wrote, referring to the 2006 reopener claim, “and this court is very seriously interested in seeing overall closure of the litigation flowing from the grounding of the Exxon Valdez.” Mr. Steiner, whose past efforts in court in the case have not always succeeded, said he was surprised “and delighted” that the issue is back in the public eye. Exxon Mobil appears less enthusiastic. The company, which has already paid about $900 million under the 1991 settlement, agreed with the government that Mr. Steiner had no standing. But it also took on the government, saying that whatever damage the sound still suffers is not unexpected and therefore does not meet the requirements of the reopener provision. Citing “20 years of intensive scrutiny” by “hundreds of scientists,” the company said, “the Prince William Sound and the oil spill area are in good ecological shape.”Disasters eventually end. Their aftermaths can seem infinite.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/business/16markets.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Shares Retreat on Disappointing Retail Sales<date>Published: February 15, 2011</date><text>Stocks retreated, pulling the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index down from a 32-month high, after a report showed retail sales increased less than forecast, and Exxon Mobil led a decline in energy producers.Exxon Mobil slid 2.3 percent for its biggest drop since August as investors analyzed data on its proven reserves.

The Dow Jones industrial average declined 41.55 points, or 0.34 percent, to 12,226.64. The Nasdaq composite index fell 12.83 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,804.35. Commerce Department figures showed that January retail sales increased less than economists had estimated and might have been affected by harsh weather. “It’s quite simple — people are trying to discern between weather conditions and economic momentum,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Va. “There’s been some confusion about the impact of the weather on the overall figures, as we saw with retail sales today. That adds up to some nervousness following a strong advance for stocks.” Interest rates were slightly lower. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 4/32, to 100 5/32, and the yield slipped to 3.60 percent from 3.62 percent late Monday.

Exxon said engineers found more oil and natural gas than expected in fields that came with its acquisition of XTO Energy. Revised estimates and discoveries at the end of 2010 added the equivalent of 3.5 billion barrels of crude to its proved reserves, enough to replace 209 percent of last year’s production. Excluding the acquisition, the reserve replacement ratio “would have only been 45 percent,” Paul Cheng, an analyst at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note. The “poor organic replacement ratio” could reignite concern over whether Exxon acquired XTO only for reserves and production growth, Mr. Cheng wrote. Monsanto, the agricultural company, sank 4.8 percent, to $71.54. The $27 billion Soros Fund Management cut its stake to 3.29 million shares, from 6.52 million in the previous quarter, according to a regulatory filing. Netflix declined 2.7 percent, to $240.79.

Chevrolet’s Volt and Nissan’s Leaf are the talk of the car world, city governments are installing battery chargers, and the Obama administration has promoted them. Even the TV commercials for the battery chargers are cool. Bloomberg News A Nissan employee installs a battery-charger component for a Leaf vehicle at a plant in Yokosuka City, Japan. There are some skeptics, however. And on Thursday I caught up with one of them, William M. Colton, ExxonMobil’s vice president for corporate strategic planning, who is definitely not a fan. A reverse skeptic could say, sure, why would ExxonMobil say nice things about a car that would displace gasoline? That’s certainly true, although Exxon Mobil is getting more and more invested in natural gas, which would indirectly help fuel electric and hybrid cars because it is an important fuel stock for the electric utilities that ultimately charge the car batteries. For Mr. Colton, the argument against the electric car is purely economic. “One word tells you the whole picture, and its starts with the letter B: batteries are not ready for prime time,” he said, noting that the last time he looked, the battery in the Leaf cost $17,000. By his calculation, batteries cost $800 to $1,000 per kilowatt-hour, and that has to be reduced to $300 to $500 for electric cars to make sense. And the comparison with the internal combustion engine is a no-brainer, at least for him. “A conventional car uses only about 100 pounds of gasoline to go 400 miles,” he said. “You go 60 miles an hour, 400 miles. You can run the air conditioner and the radio, and refuel in five minutes. Compare that with a battery, a very heavy and very expensive battery that will only take you 100 miles on a good day and it takes 12 hours or 8 hours to refuel. It’s a very problematic purchase.” What is needed is a breakthrough in battery technology, he said, but he does not see that happening in the next 10 years at least. So what alternative does Mr. Colton offer to reduce emissions, especially carbon dioxide, which is linked to climate change? He says that a lot can be done to improve existing technology in transmissions, engines and electronics to improve the internal combustion engine’s performance. He says hybrids like the Prius will make more sense in the future as technologies improve. And there are other more cost-effective ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, he says. “When you look at mitigation costs for CO2 in electric vehicles, you are talking about hundreds of dollars per ton of CO2. Its very, very expensive because the batteries are so expensive,” he said. “So we say instead of doing that, if you take natural gas and just displace coal at an electric power plant, you can do it for just $20 a ton. Why wouldn’t you do that first? Since ExxonMobil is the No. 1 natural gas producer in the country, company shareholders would probably agree with him.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/business/01oil.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Exxon Profit Rises 53%, Aided by Higher Oil Prices<date>Published: January 31, 2011</date><text>HOUSTON — Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, reported a 53 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit on Monday, helped by an improving world economy that has increased energy demand and crude prices.It was the strongest quarterly profit in more than two years, reflecting the strong recovery in oil markets. They soared in 2007 and 2008, collapsed in 2009, and returned to loftier heights by the end of 2010. “It’s a home run,” said Fadel Gheit, managing director for oil and gas research at Oppenheimer &amp; Company. “It’s a big positive earnings surprise on strong operating results across all business segments underpinned by strong production growth, higher oil and gas prices and improved margins.” Exxon’s performance was in line with the strong results of most other large energy companies, which have benefited not only from rising oil prices but also from improved margins in their refinery businesses. Nevertheless, the results do not equal the record profits set a few years ago, when oil and gas prices were far higher than they were at the end of last year or even today. Oil prices have been steadily creeping up in recent months to over $90 a barrel, settling on Monday at $92.19. The turbulence in Egypt has made traders skittish about the possibility of shortages of supplies if the Suez Canal is somehow blocked or political tensions spread to nearby Saudi Arabia. But natural gas prices, which are increasingly important to big oil companies, which have been increasing their gas investments in recent years, remain depressed. Oil and gas prices rose again on Monday, with developments in Egypt serving as a reminder that the energy markets were vulnerable to political events in such vital producing countries as Nigeria, Iraq and Iran, which did not suffer major production interruptions in 2010. Rising political tensions mixed with continued growth in economic demand usually means higher energy prices. But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries still has the capacity to produce more oil in the event of a slowdown in traffic in the Suez Canal or interruptions in production in one or two producing countries. Exxon Mobil’s profit in the quarter was $9.25 billion, or $1.85 a share, compared with $6.05 billion, or $1.27 a share in the period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.63 a share. Total revenue in the quarter was $105.2 billion, up from $89.8 billion in the quarter a year earlier. For the year, Exxon Mobil made $30.46 billion, or $6.22 a share, compared with $19.28 billion, or $3.98 a share, for 2009. Revenue for 2010 rose to $383 billion from $310 billion the previous year. Exxon Mobil said its production increased 19 percent in the quarter. Gas production in the United States has tripled as a result of the company’s acquisition of XTO Energy and other purchases of companies with shale field operations around the country. Gas now accounts for almost half of the company’s production, up from 43 percent a year ago. Earnings from the company’s upstream business, which includes oil and gas production, rose to $7.48 billion in the quarter from $5.78 billion in the period a year earlier. The company’s refining and marketing business reported earnings of $1.15 billion after a loss a year ago, driven by higher refining margins. “Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize shareholder value,” said David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, during a conference call. Shares of Exxon Mobil rose $1.69 , or 2.1 percent, to $80.68 on Monday. Most other oil companies also gained. Chevron, the No. 2 American oil company, reported on Friday that fourth-quarter earnings were 72 percent higher than the preceding year’s. The third-largest, ConocoPhillips, reported that its quarterly profit climbed 46 percent. The earnings reports have been overshadowed by the developments in Egypt, which have caused a sharp upturn in oil prices over the last week. Egypt is not a major oil producer, and rising domestic demand in recent years has converted the country into a net importer. But 1.8 million barrels pass through the Suez Canal every day, and the Sumed pipeline carries another 1.1 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The canal is also a major transit route for liquefied natural gas to Europe. There has been no disruption of gas or oil flows so far. Several Western oil companies operate in Egypt, including BP and Apache, contributing to the country’s production of more than 650,000 barrels a day. The most vulnerable is Apache, a middle-size Houston-based oil and gas producer that relies on Egypt for as much as a fifth of its oil production. But so far, the unrest has had little impact on exploration and production since the oil fields are far away from major population centers. “Our people are safe, and we are monitoring the situation,” William A. Mintz, an Apache spokesman, said.HOUSTON — Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, reported a 53 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit on Monday, helped by an improving world economy that has increased energy demand and crude prices.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/business/global/28oil.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Despite Past Setbacks, Exxon to Work With Rosneft on Black Sea Oil<date>Published: January 27, 2011</date><text>MOSCOW — Exxon Mobil once was poised to acquire a stake in Russia’s largest private oil company, only to have the deal fall apart when the Kremlin arrested the owner and the company went bankrupt.A few years ago BP was squeezed out by its Russian partners, and its top executive was forced into hiding. Yet both Exxon and BP are back big in Russia. So are some other large oil companies, which find the allure of Russian petroleum too strong to resist, whatever the political risks of dealing with the government or becoming partners with the country’s notoriously tough billionaires. On Thursday, Exxon Mobil, America’s largest oil company, signed a deal with the Russian state oil company, Rosneft, to explore offshore in the Black Sea. That came just two weeks after BP agreed to a share swap with Rosneft to form a joint venture to explore off the country’s ice-bound northern coast. Russia being Russia, though, BP is already in trouble over the new deal. On Thursday, its wealthy Russian partners in a separate, private venture filed an injunction in a London court to block BP’s $16 billion Rosneft agreement. Despite the risks, Russian oil is where the action is for the West. The country is now the world’s largest oil-producing nation, pumping about 10 million barrels a day. That is currently more than Saudi Arabia’s output, although the two countries frequently trade off for first place. The bigger draw now, though, may be Russia’s willingness to engage in offshore exploration. Onshore oil reserves around the world are gradually being depleted. And new offshore drilling in environmentally attuned countries like the United States are currently off limits. But Russia is open to deepwater development. In Exxon Mobil’s case, that is in the Black Sea. With BP, it is even more on the cutting edge — off the Continental shelf in the Russian Arctic. Another big oil company, Chevron, also recently agreed to explore in Russia’s coastal waters. And Royal Dutch Shell — which in 2007 was forced to sell half of its $20 billion Sakhalin II oil and gas deepwater development to the state gas company, Gazprom — has been invited back by Russia to join the Sakhalin III and Sakhalin IV projects in the Pacific Ocean. The country’s top energy official, Igor I. Sechin, at the signing ceremony with Exxon on Thursday, seemed eager to counter the lingering worry that Russia might nationalize its oil industry at any moment, saying it envisions its energy industry “as a part of an integrated global marketplace.” The signing was held in Davos, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. At the ceremony, Rex W. Tillerson, the Exxon chief executive who punched his Russian oil card earlier in his career as a manager of the Sakhalin I development during the 1990s, praised his company’s work with Rosneft as a “successful relationship.” The new deal-making by Rosneft is a matter of necessity, Valery Nesterov, oil and gas analyst at Troika Dialog investment bank in Moscow, said in a telephone interview. Russian law grants Rosneft exclusive rights to potentially rich offshore deposits. But it lacks the technology to develop them. “The only option is to cooperate with foreign companies,” Mr. Nesterov said. Western executives are betting this time that their technical knowledge may insulate them from Russia’s political and business vagaries. The Exxon-Rosneft agreement commits Exxon to spend about $1 billion looking for oil off Russia’s Black Sea coast, and holds the promise of sharing in the prize if it is discovered. But Russian authorities have reneged on deals with Exxon in the past. Desperate for investments when oil prices sank in the 1990s, Russia agreed to give Exxon generous terms that exempted it from most taxes and allowed it to sell much of the oil it prospected. But in recent years, local authorities have interfered in operations. In the early 2000s, Exxon was intent on acquiring a large stake in Yukos, once Russia’s largest private oil company. But those efforts fell apart in 2003 when the Kremlin arrested Yukos’s main shareholder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, in what has been viewed as a politically motivated effort to transfer Yukos assets to the state oil company, Rosneft. BP is now trying to do business with the state-owned Rosneft over the protests of its private Russian partners in a joint venture known as TNK-BP. BP’s arctic deal with Rosneft, announced late on Jan. 14, would give BP as much offshore acreage as lies in the British sector of the North Sea. But BP’s partners in the TNK-BP joint venture say the Rosneft deal violates their shareholder agreement. According to the TNK partners, BP should have provided the joint venture’s management with a detailed and written description of its arctic exploration plans before reaching the agreement with Rosneft. The venture has a right of first refusal for all BP work in the country, they say. The partners also said BP trampled on their rights by forging a strategic alliance with another company in Russia. The TNK venture, they said, was supposed to be the British company’s only major partner in the country. “BP appears to have closed its eyes to its obligations to TNK-BP,” the partners contend in their 28-page court filing in London, seeking an injunction against the Rosfneft deal. A BP spokesman said the company was aware of the injunction filing, but thought that it had not violated the shareholder agreement with the partners. It was unclear whether the legal action in London might be swiftly resolved, or whether this signified the opening moves in the type of protracted fight with TNK partners that plagued BP in Russia in 2008. Before that dispute, BP had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with another state energy giant, Gazprom, but that proved no help in what became a drawn-out battle with the BP’s partners. That dispute was resolved only when BP effectively surrendered management control of its Russian assets, while retaining the equity ownership in TNK-BP. In that earlier fight, Robert Dudley, the current chief executive of BP, had served as head of TNK-BP before BP lost control of the company. He was compelled to flee Russia and went into hiding for several months after his work visa was revoked.

But to do so they need to slaughter an industry sacred cow: the integration of the exploration and production business with refining and other activities. This model worked for decades but today accords a conglomerate discount to the likes of Exxon Mobil, Shell and BP. Splitting up, as the smaller Marathon is doing, could add tens of billions of dollars to shareholders’ portfolios.As United States members of the group prepare to report earnings starting this week, the world’s big oil companies know they have a problem. Whereas a decade ago their shares fetched price-to-earnings multiples in the high teens, today they languish on valuations ranging from around seven times earnings for BP to 12 times for Exxon, despite the tripling of oil prices over the period. With the majors increasingly locked out of oil-rich nations, the difficulty of ramping up production bears much of the blame. But so, too, does a growing distaste for complexity among investors. Largely for historical reasons, today’s oil giants are ungainly combinations of higher growth exploration businesses shackled to sluggish refining and marketing operations. Observable valuation measures hint at a shareholder preference for simplicity. While the integrated majors as a group trade at around nine times 2011 earnings, pure exploration companies in the United States command multiples closer to 20 times, with independent refiners at about 14 times. Even allowing for the swifter growth of these smaller companies, investors are penalizing big oil companies. Oppenheimer researchers contend the United States majors could raise their valuations 20 percent by spinning off their refining and marketing operations. By this calculus, a partition would add $15 to Exxon’s $79 share price — or $80 billion to its nearly $400 billion market capitalization. Slower-growing leviathans don’t deserve the racier values accorded to the independents. Yet even a modest increase in price-to-earnings multiples could be a boon for investors. For instance, valuing Exxon’s exploration and production business at 13 times expected 2011 earnings — far less than independents command — would yield a stand-alone value of $382 billion, according to research from Madison Williams. Assuming a conservative multiple of 10 times for Exxon’s downstream, or refinery, businesses makes them worth $78 billion, Madison Williams calculates. Combined, that’s a 15 percent higher value than Exxon at present. That kind of illustration makes justifications for integration seem increasingly threadbare. Executives argue that lumping refiners and explorers together offers a natural hedge. In theory, when falling crude prices hurt production, the refining business gets relief from lower input costs. Exxon, for example, fared relatively well during the slide in oil prices of 2008, when its shares fell a mere 15 percent. Still, it seems Exxon was shielded more by its size and a lack of debt, rather than integration. The much smaller rival Marathon, for example, fell 55 percent over the year. In reality, oil prices and refining margins are frequently correlated, since both are led by fuel demand and economic growth. Big oil companies also claim that technology developed in one part of the business can be used in another. Yet with the possible exception of liquefying natural gas, energy experts struggle to think what these supposed synergies may be. Besides, technology can be easily bought or hired: none of the majors seem to have objected to relying on oil services companies like Schlumberger for technology and Transocean for rigs. Finally, energy majors contend that refining expertise helps clinch access to reserves in oil-rich nations. A company that knows refining, they say, is more likely to be granted exploration rights. This may have been true decades ago when large national oil companies were less sophisticated. Now they are more than capable of developing their own refining operations or signing joint ventures. So the benefits of integration are hard to pin down. By contrast, splitting up would make oil companies far easier for investors to value. It would surely sharpen management focus, since different skills are required to run exploration and refining operations. There is no reason to fear that oil giants would have to give up the scale needed to compete. Newly liberated exploration and production companies could simply hook up. Most of the smaller integrated oil companies, like Marathon and Murphy Oil, have already reached these conclusions. It may not be long before the majors do too.

Splitting up, as the smaller Marathon is doing, could add tens of billions of dollars to shareholders’ portfolios.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/us/12montana.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Along a Course of Purling Rivers, a Raw Divide<date>Published: December 11, 2010</date><text>MISSOULA, Mont. — In this region famous for both its angling and its authors, Annick Smith has a long history with the Blackfoot River.She and her family erected their home, a hand-hewn log cabin, along one of its tributaries, Bear Creek, in 1971, which she wrote about in her memoir “Homestead.” In the 1980s, she and her companion, William Kittredge, collaborated with Norman Maclean to turn his book “A River Runs Through It” into a film script, which became the movie directed by Robert Redford. Now she feels that her wild corner of the world is under attack. “I’m doing the only thing I can do, other than laying down in the road to stop it, and that is writing,” said Ms. Smith, who has joined the growing buzz-saw of opposition to the efforts by Imperial Oil, a Canadian subsidiary of ExxonMobil, to move its oversize oil-processing equipment from a port in Idaho to Canada, along a path that includes some of the nation’s most scenic highways. Ms. Smith’s home is near Highway 200, the only major artery in the rural valley near Missoula. If an environmental study finds that the megaloads would have little impact, then 207 modules — each three stories tall, 24 feet wide and nearly as long as a football field — would rumble by cattle ranches and along the Blackfoot, one of the West’s best-known trout streams. The facility in Alberta that the modules will part of is an $8 billion project that will process oil from Canada’s tar sands, a giant open pit that is swallowing up huge areas. The equipment is made in Korea and shipped to Lewiston, Idaho. The easiest route from there to Alberta is over 1,300 miles through Idaho and into Montana, crossing the wild, forested spine of the Rockies on serpentine two-lane roads. The alternative, the company says, is to ship through the Panama Canal and up the Mississippi. Ms. Smith and other writers are bringing their literary weight to fight the project, using the mythos of America’s wildest trout streams, especially the Blackfoot River, the setting for Mr. Maclean’s novel. David James Duncan and Rick Bass, acclaimed writers on the wilderness and rivers, live near Missoula and have each set aside a novel to work on a cri de coeur modeled, they say, after the 1941 book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men” by James Agee and Walker Evans. Proceeds from their book, called “Heart of the Monster” after a Nez Perce Indian story, will go to All Against the Haul, an advocacy group. “The tar sands are the biggest generator of climate change on the planet,” Mr. Bass said about his opposition to the loads. The equipment to be transported, which dwarfs regular semi-loads, is wider than the two-lane roads on which it will be hauled. It requires large pullouts, where vehicles can park when they are idle, as well as the movement of power lines and times when both lanes will be blocked. Two other companies have also said they want to move oversize equipment along the same route, and there could be many more. Gov. Brian Schweitzer supports the route and says its opponents are overreacting. “Chlorine, insecticides and fertilizers go down these roads in trucks every day,” he said. “If they spill, they would kill fish for 50 to 100 miles.” But the large loads, he said, “are inert, like big shoe boxes made of steel. If one fell in the river, they could be cut in half or taken out whole.” Until they were removed, he argued, “fish could spawn under them.” Still, wading into or floating on dark, purling mountain rivers is reverently held, and the waters here are cathedrals for fly fishermen. As the opening line in “A River Runs Through It” says, “In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.” “The loads will defile the Blackfoot,” Ms. Smith said. The road through the Blackfoot Valley “will be a road to the worst, instead of a sacred highway through what is beautiful and natural.” Opponents say the loads will change the wild character of the rivers, as floaters fish and watch giant machinery go by. But Mr. Schweitzer argues that the roads are a federally financed transportation corridor. “Montana can’t up and change the rules because we don’t like somebody,” he said of the efforts by opponents to stop the loads. Many residents worry that the loads will block emergency vehicles, but the governor said helicopters could provide transport. The shipping companies seem assured that they will get the needed permits for the 12-month haul. Dozens of modules have already been shipped to Idaho, pullouts have been built and trees along highways have been cut back to allow passage. Invoking the name of one of the world’s most famous trout streams to fight development has been used before — with success. In the 1990s, a company proposed building a mine that uses cyanide to extract gold near Lincoln, Mont. Eventually a voter initiative banned the mining. “We never would have won if it hadn’t been for Norman Maclean’s novel and Robert Redford’s movie,” Mr. Bass said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/nyregion/18newtown.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Exxon Mobil Agrees to Newtown Creek Cleanup Pact<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>Exxon Mobil has agreed to pay $25 million and commit to a more thorough cleanup of its huge oil spills along Newtown Creek and a faster timetable for the process, according to a settlement announced on Wednesday by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo. Of the $25 million, $19.5 million will go to projects, like parks, that benefit the environment — the largest single payment for such a purpose in New York State history, state environmental officials said. The agreement settled a suit filed by the state in 2007 over the extent and pace of oil companies’ efforts over more than two decades to clean up spills from refineries and storage tanks at the site, underneath the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. The amount of oil in the combined spills is estimated at 17 million to 30 million gallons, contaminating about 55 acres of land. The federal government recently named Newtown Creek a Superfund site slated for a comprehensive cleanup of oil that has leached into the water, along with pesticides, PCBs and other pollutants found in both water and sediment. Along with the settlement, environmentalists say, the designation will assure that the contamination will be identified and remediated. “We’re thrilled,” said Katie Schmid, director of the Newtown Creek Alliance, an advocacy group. “Now we have confidence that these problems will be addressed with the strongest tools available.” Under the terms of the settlement, which was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Exxon Mobil, which was responsible for most of the continuing cleanup in the area, agreed to expand its efforts to remove not just the oil but also oil-contaminated groundwater and soil, as well as soil vapor. The agreement also sets a timetable for faster cleanup operations, including a plan for identifying the scope of the contamination and quarterly reports on the status and progress of the cleanup effort. The company will also pay more than $5 million in penalties and costs. “For far too long, residents of Greenpoint have been forced to live with an environmental nightmare lurking just beneath their homes, their businesses and their community,” Mr. Cuomo, who is New York’s governor-elect, said in a statement. “With this settlement, Exxon Mobil will be held accountable for fully cleaning up this environmental disaster.” In a statement, Exxon Mobil officials said they were “pleased” to have reached a resolution to the suit. “The health, safety and welfare of those living and working in the Greenpoint community continue to be our top priority,” they said. “Exxon Mobil is committed to remain in Greenpoint until the remediation effort is done — and done right.” Exxon Mobil noted that, along with BP and Chevron, two companies that have taken responsibility for part of the cleanup, it has removed over 11 million gallons of spilled oil. But the environmental group Riverkeeper and the residents who had filed separate lawsuits over the cleanup deemed the efforts, which began in earnest in 1990, to be too little and too slow. “Finally, attention has been paid to the Greenpoint community,” Paul Gallay, the executive director of Riverkeeper, said of the settlement. “The cleanup should be a lot faster than another 20 years.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/world/africa/18nigeria.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">19 Hostages Rescued by Nigerian Forces<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) — Nigeria’s military rescued 19 hostages held by militants in the Niger Delta oil region on Wednesday, security officials said. Among those freed were two Americans, two French citizens, two Indonesians and a Canadian who had been abducted from an oil rig, as well as eight Nigerians taken hostage from an Exxon Mobil platform and four others, two officials involved in the operation said. “It was a land, air and marine assault,” said one of the officials, who requested anonymity because of the delicate nature of the operation. President Goodluck Jonathan, who is the first Nigerian head of state from the Niger Delta, brokered an amnesty with militants in the region last year. The continued unrest risked undermining his credibility. The military task force responsible for security in the vast wetlands region, which is the heartland of the country’s oil and gas industry, said earlier that it was carrying out several operations simultaneously in the Niger Delta, but declined to provide details. A military spokesman declined to comment on the operation or to confirm whether the hostages had been freed, saying a statement would be issued Thursday.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/business/energy-environment/17FUEL.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Energy, and Plenty of It, for Decades to Come<date>Published: November 16, 2010</date><text>HOUSTONTHREE summers ago, the world’s supertankers were racing across the oceans as fast as they could to deliver oil to markets growing increasingly thirsty for energy. Americans were grumbling about paying as much as $4 a gallon for gasoline, as the price of crude oil leapt to $147 a barrel. Natural gas prices were vaulting too, sending home electricity bills soaring. A book making the rounds at the time, “Twilight in the Desert,” by Matthew R. Simmons, seemed to sum up the conventional wisdom: the age of cheap, plentiful oil and gas was over. “Sooner or later, the worldwide use of oil must peak,” the book concluded, “because oil, like the other two fossil fuels, coal and natural gas, is nonrenewable.” But no sooner did the demand-and-supply equation shift out of kilter than it swung back into something more palatable and familiar. Just as it seemed that the world was running on fumes, giant oil fields were discovered off the coasts of Brazil and Africa, and Canadian oil sands projects expanded so fast, they now provide North America with more oil than Saudi Arabia. In addition, the United States has increased domestic oil production for the first time in a generation. Meanwhile, another wave of natural gas drilling has taken off in shale rock fields across the United States, and more shale gas drilling is just beginning in Europe and Asia. Add to that an increase in liquefied natural gas export terminals around the world that connected gas, which once had to be flared off, to the world market, and gas prices have plummeted. Energy experts now predict decades of residential and commercial power at reasonable prices. Simply put, the world of energy has once again been turned upside down. “Oil and gas will continue to be pillars for global energy supply for decades to come,” said James Burkhard, a managing director of IHS CERA, an energy consulting firm. “The competitiveness of oil and gas and the scale at which they are produced mean that there are no readily available substitutes in either one year or 20 years.” Some unpleasant though predictable consequences are likely, of course, as the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico this spring demonstrated. Some environmentalists say that gas from shale depends on drilling techniques and chemicals that may jeopardize groundwater supplies, and that a growing dependence on Canadian oil sands is more dangerous for the climate than most conventional oils because mining and processing of the sands require so much energy and a loss of forests. And while moderately priced oil and gas bring economic relief, they also make renewable sources of energy like wind and solar relatively expensive and less attractive to investors unless governments impose a price on carbon emissions. “When wind guys talk to each other,” said Michael Skelly, president of Clean Line Energy Partners, a developer of transmission lines for renewable energy, “they say, ‘Damn, what are we going to do about the price of natural gas?’ ” Oil and gas executives say they provide a necessary energy bridge; that because both oil and gas have a fraction of the carbon-burning intensity of coal, it makes sense to use them until wind, solar, geothermal and the rest become commercially viable. “We should celebrate the fact that we have enough oil and gas to carry us forward until a new energy technology can take their place,” said Robert N. Ryan Jr., Chevron’s vice president for global exploration. Mr. Skelly and other renewable energy entrepreneurs counter that without a government policy fixing a price on carbon emissions through a tax or cap and trade, the hydrocarbon bridge could go on and on without end. So what happened to shift the energy world so drastically the last few years? Is the shift reversible once the economy picks up? The recession throttled the world’s demand for energy, particularly in the United States and Europe, but that tells only part of the story. Periodic jolts, like the Arab oil embargoes in the 1960s and 1970s, are likely to recur in a world with unpredictable actors like Iran. Access to oil and gas may always be limited by geopolitics, especially in places like the Middle East. Just in the last few days, the decline in the dollar spurred a new spike in oil prices, along with those of other commodities. Yet, the outlook, based on long-term trends barely visible five years ago, now appears to promise large supplies of oil and gas from multiple new sources for decades into the future. The same high prices that inspired dire fear in the first place helped to resolve them. High oil and gas prices produced a wave of investment and drilling, and technological innovation has unlocked oceans of new resources. Oil and gas from ocean bottoms, the Arctic and shale rock fields are quickly replacing tired fields in places like Mexico, Alaska and the North Sea. Much depends, of course, on government policies in the coming decades. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization that advises industrialized countries, projected this month that global energy demand would increase by an astounding 36 percent between 2008 and 2035, assuming the broad policy commitments already announced by governments were exercised. Oil demand is projected to grow to 99 million barrels a day in 2035, from 84 million barrels a day in 2009.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/opinion/lweb01papua.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Papua New Guinea Abuses<date>Published: October 31, 2010</date><text>To the Editor: “In One of World’s Poorest Corners, a Flood of Wealth and Worry” (front page, Oct 26) cited the return of police forces to lawless areas of Papua New Guinea as a positive effect of ExxonMobil’s operations there. But Papua New Guinea’s police force has a record of corruption and abuse. With near-total impunity, members of the force have beaten and tortured criminal suspects and raped female detainees. Large multinational companies like ExxonMobil often rely on the police for protection in Papua New Guinea, but their protectors also prey on local communities. Police forces deployed near a gold mine run by Barrick, a Canadian company, burned a village to the ground last year, and officers allegedly raped three teenage girls in June. ExxonMobil has publicly committed itself to follow principles designed to prevent such abuses. Unless the company succeeds, the police presence that has appeared alongside its operations may soon emerge as yet another source of local discontent.

Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, reported earlier Thursday that its third-quarter profit rose by 7 percent. ConocoPhillips announced on Wednesday that its net income had more than doubled for the quarter. “Industry fundamentals have lifted sharply from a year ago,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company. “A rising tide raises all ships.” There are signs, however, that oil prices are not going to support higher profits over the next several quarters. The Energy Department released a report Wednesday showing that crude oil inventories rose last week by more than 5 million barrels as a result of weak demand, the largest increase since July. Oil prices have been lodged in a relatively narrow band of $70 to $86 over the last year, and they have been hovering just above $80 over the last month. Most energy experts expect continuing slow economic growth will decrease the likelihood of any oil price increase over the winter months unless there is a geopolitical crisis or a collapse of the dollar that would encourage private investments in commodities. Meanwhile an abundance of natural gas from a wave of drilling in shale fields in recent years has brought the gas price down to below $4 per million British thermal units, a price that makes profitable drilling difficult. Stockpiles of gas are also growing, and weather analysts are expecting a warmer winter than last year, which should produce modest demand. The industry is also facing the slowdown of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP well blowout in April that killed 11 rig workers and spilled millions of barrels of crude oil into the gulf. Shell reported that it expected to produce 40,000 fewer barrels next year in the gulf, which represents more than 1 percent of its current production, and declines could persist into 2012. But Exxon, based in Irving, Tex., reported a strong quarter with oil and gas output rising by 21 percent, largely as a result of its acquisition of XTO Energy, a major gas producer, and the ramping up of huge liquefied natural gas export projects in Qatar. “Our cash generation remains very strong,” said David S. Rosenthal, Exxon Mobil’s vice president for investor relations, “reflecting strong results across all business lines.” The company’s third-quarter net profit was $7.35 billion, or $1.44 a share, compared with $4.73 billion, or 98 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $95.3 billion, a 15.8 percent rise. Crude oil prices were about 13 percent higher in the quarter than the comparable quarter in 2009, while gas prices were also higher for much of the quarter. Shares of Exxon rose 55 cents, or 0.84 percent, to $66.22 on Thursday. Mr. Rosenthal said the company welcomed the recent government lifting of the gulf drilling moratorium, and was preparing revised permitting applications to drill new wells. “We are always looking for opportunities that are out there,” he said. Royal Dutch Shell benefited from improving conditions in the industry, Peter Voser, the chief executive, said in a statement. Shell was “making good progress against our targets, and there is more to come,” Mr. Voser said. Shares rose 0.5 percent in trading Thursday in London. Like its rivals, Shell is reducing costs to try to improve profitability. Shell sold $2 billion of assets this year, including older oil assets in Norway and refining capacity in Germany. The company said it expected to sell another $6 billion of assets by the end of next year, mainly operations in Europe and Africa that were not part of its core business. To increase output, Mr. Voser plans to invest in new projects in Qatar, China and the United States. He said Thursday that Shell was “in a delivery window for new growth.” A new oil sands mine in Canada started production in the third quarter, and Shell has decided to invest in deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. Net profit rose to $3.46 billion in the third quarter, from $3.25 billion a year earlier. Excluding one-time items and inventory changes, Shell earned $4.9 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the third quarter of last year. Production in the third quarter rose 5 percent, to 3.058 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, from 2.92 million barrels in the year-earlier period. Sales for liquefied natural gas, or LNG, rose 22 percent, to 4.26 million tons.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/world/asia/26papua.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Papua New Guinea Is Little Prepared for Gas Wealth<date>Published: October 25, 2010</date><text>TARI, Papua New Guinea — A founding myth in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea is said to have foretold the arrival of ExxonMobil, the American oil giant that is preparing to extract natural gas here and ship it overseas.According to the myth, called Gigira Laitebo, an underground fire is kept alive by inhabitants poking sticks into the earth. Eventually, the fire “will light up the world,” said Peter O’Neill, the national government’s finance minister. “By development of the project and delivering to international markets, it’s one way of fulfilling the myth.” But like all myths, this one is open to wide interpretation, as a group of men and women at a Roman Catholic parish here suggested before Sunday Mass recently. “If foreigners come to our land, you give them food and water, but don’t give them the fire,” said John Hamule, 38, as the others nodded. “If you do, it will destroy this place.” In 2014, ExxonMobil is scheduled to start shipping natural gas through a 450-mile pipeline, then on to Japan, China and other markets in East Asia. But the flood of revenue, which is expected to bring Papua New Guinea $30 billion over three decades and to more than double its gross domestic product, will force a country already beset by state corruption and bedeviled by a complex land tenure system to grapple with the kind of windfall that has paradoxically entrenched other poor, resource-rich nations in deeper poverty. While the West’s richest companies are used to seeking natural resources in the world’s poorest corners, few places on earth seem as ill prepared as the Southern Highlands to rub shoulders with ExxonMobil. The most impoverished region in one of the world’s poorest countries, it went unexplored by Westerners until the 1930s. Believing that this rugged, mountainous region was uninhabited, the explorers were stunned to find at least one million people living here in one of the world’s most diverse areas, largely in small, distinct communities separated by different cultures, languages and nearly impassable terrain. Constant tribal wars over land, women and pigs — the last being prized measures of wealth, used to pay for dowries and settle disputes — have grown deadlier in the past decade with the easy availability of high-powered rifles smuggled in from Indonesia, just to the west, which are exchanged for the marijuana grown here. Mr. O’Neill says the Southern Highlands are too diverse, too fragmented, to develop the kind of widespread insurrection that exists in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. But local leaders worry about the continuing inflow of guns into an area with almost no government presence, and no paved roads, electricity, running water, banks or post offices. They worry that the benefits of the gas project will fall short of expectations, begetting a generation of young men who will train their anger on ExxonMobil. Already, in fact, angry landowners have forced ExxonMobil’s contractors to suspend work temporarily at several construction sites, and local businessmen bid for contracts with unconcealed threats. “Any outside waste management company that is given the contract will not be allowed into Komo by force or whatever means,” said Robin Tuna, 34, whose company was bidding for just such a contract in Komo, an area south of here where ExxonMobil is building a large airfield. And ExxonMobil faces the daunting prospect of dealing with Papua New Guinea’s distinctive form of land tenure, which grants control over 97 percent of the land to customary landowners, primarily indigenous people whose ownership rights to small plots are inherited. More than 60,000 people own land where gas will be either extracted or transported. To get their agreement, the government invited 3,000 to a meeting last year to hammer out benefit-sharing agreements. The government intentionally held the conference on an island to ward off gate-crashers, though 2,000 uninvited landowners eventually flew over, said Anderson Agiru, the governor of Southern Highlands Province. The meeting, scheduled for seven days, lasted six weeks. And still thousands, who remain unsatisfied, have streamed to the nation’s capital, Port Moresby, to try to get their cut. “They tell us they are busy or to come back the next day,” said Jim Tatape, one of hundreds of angry landowners milling around recently in front of the Department of Commerce and Industry, waiting to see anybody inside. “We don’t want to deal with government anymore,” added Mr. Tatape, who was seeking money to start a small, though vaguely defined, business. “ExxonMobil is the developer. We are the landowners. We should deal together.” Officials at ExxonMobil declined to be interviewed for this article. In an e-mail, the company said it “seeks to create long-term economic and social benefits from its projects and presence.” Citing its ethics policy, the company wrote that it strived to “help developing nations to improve their systems as well as help support local business to develop proper governance systems.”</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/business/energy-environment/22road.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Oil Sands Effort Turns on a Fight Over a Road<date>Published: October 21, 2010</date><text>KOOSKIA, Idaho — As U.S. Highway 12 hugs the serpentine banks of the Clearwater and Lochsa Rivers here, road signs bear the silhouettes of the 19th-century explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, with Mr. Lewis pointing off into the distance.He is not pointing the way for big oil companies, says Lin Laughy, whose gravel driveway abuts the road. But to Mr. Laughy’s dismay, international oil companies see this meandering, backcountry route as a road to riches. They are angling to use U.S. 12 to ship gargantuan loads of equipment from Vancouver, Wash., to Montana and the tar sands of Alberta in Canada. The companies say the route would save time and money and provide a vital economic boost to Montana and Idaho. The problem, said Mr. Laughy, is that the proposed loads are so large — and would travel so slowly — that they would literally block the highway as they rolled through. According to plans submitted to state regulators, some of the shipments would weigh more than 600,000 pounds, stand as tall as a three-story building, stretch nearly two-thirds the length of a football field and occupy 24 feet side-to-side — the full width of U.S. 12’s two lanes for much of its course through Idaho. Mr. Laughy and his wife, Borg Hendrickson, have sued the state to stop the shipments by Imperial Oil and ConocoPhillips, arguing that the loads would threaten the integrity of Idaho’s historic portion of U.S. 12, as well as the safety of communities that depend on it as the main road in and out of the area. National environmental groups and climate change activists are supporting their efforts, seeing a broader opportunity to stall development of Canada’s oil sands, which they denounce as a dirty source of energy. “If you’d asked us six months ago whether we’d be in the middle of all this, we’d have laughed,” said Mr. Laughy, 68, who has the carriage and countenance of a Santa Claus and conducts heritage tours of the area. “But we’re resigned now to the fact that there’s going to be a major war.” The companies’ plans call for the oil field equipment, manufactured in Asia, to be delivered to the port of Vancouver, then floated on barges for some 300 miles up the Columbia and Snake Rivers to Lewiston in western Idaho. From there, the equipment would inch its way along Idaho’s stretch of U.S. 12, through the Clearwater National Forest, into Montana and points beyond. Imperial Oil, the Canadian unit of ExxonMobil, hopes to move 207 separate “modules” from a manufacturer in South Korea to its $7.1 billion Kearl Lake oil sands project near Fort McMurray in Alberta. ConocoPhillips wants to transport two gigantic coke drums, manufactured in Asia and delivered to Lewiston in May, down much of the same route to a refinery in Billings, Mont. The proposed route could shave thousands of miles of transportation costs for such shipments, which might otherwise be forced to travel through the Panama Canal to overland routes accessed through Houston or New Orleans. Interstates and other wide highways are typically not an option, in part because overpasses are too low. Transportation officials in Idaho and Montana say that their roads — with some modifications made and paid for by the companies, including additional pullouts along the route and raised or buried power lines — could handle the shipments. The plan calls for the loads to move only at night and in start-and-stop fashion, going down the road for a short time, then pulling over to let other traffic pass. For Imperial Oil’s trips, it would take the trucks nine nights to cover the 510-mile route through Idaho and Montana. “We have done our level best to ensure, if given approval, that we can move these modules safely,” said Pius Rolheiser, an Imperial spokesman. Eighteen-wheelers already traverse U.S. 12 here, which serves as a gateway to the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness area, one of the largest tracts of virgin wildland in the contiguous United States. The road is also part of two national trails tracing routes followed by the Nez Perce tribe and Lewis and Clark. But Mr. Laughy, whose home sits on a ridge above U.S. 12, about 75 miles east of Lewiston, says the oil equipment is different. He points to thin margins of error along U.S. 12, where the road slices a tight path between rising rock walls on one side and a quick drop-off to the river on the other. He also fears that sooner or later, an emergency vehicle rushing toward a fire or delivering someone to a hospital will be slowed by the meandering shipments, potentially costing lives. “The companies say they have no plans to make this a permanent corridor,” he said. “But once the first shipment is allowed, what’s to stop the next one, and then the next one?” Supporters of the shipments say they would inject millions of dollars into struggling rural economies along the route. “This wouldn’t be just an economic benefit for Lewiston,” said David Doeringsfeld, manager of the Port of Lewiston, “but for all of north-central Idaho.” Mr. Doeringsfeld said he had been approached by several other companies interested in using the corridor. In May, Mr. Laughy and Ms. Hendrickson started a Web site called Fighting Goliath, which serves as a clearinghouse of information related to the megaloads, as the shipments are called. The site has since drawn the attention of regional and national environmental activists, and a movement has mobilized around the goal of stopping the loads. “I have never really seen so many people have such a unified voice against a project,” said Nick Stocks, a co-founder of Northern Rockies Rising Tide, a climate change advocacy group in Missoula, Mont., which is also on the proposed route. Environmentalists abhor Canada’s oil sands — a gooey mixture of sand, clay and bitumen that can be refined into crude oil — as an energy-intensive and highly polluting energy source that generates large amounts of greenhouse gases. But the oil sands are also one of the largest sources of foreign oil for the United States, and they are poised for further development. A proposed pipeline awaiting approval by American officials would add 1.1 million barrels of Canadian oil to the roughly two million already imported to the United States each day — much of it from the tar sands. No permits have been issued yet in Montana. But when the Idaho Transportation Department granted a permit to ConocoPhillips in August, Mr. Laughy and Ms. Hendrickson, joined by a neighbor down the road and represented by the environmental law firm Advocates for the West, promptly sued the department, arguing that it had failed to adequately consider the safety and convenience of the public, as its own rules stipulate. A lower court agreed. The case now rests with the Idaho State Supreme Court, which heard arguments on Oct. 1. and is expected to render a decision any day. Meanwhile, both sides seem confident that they will prevail. Imperial has already floated the first of its 207 modules up the river to Lewiston, and it plans to move 40 of them there by early December. Mr. Laughy, meanwhile, said that even if the court ruled against him, other obstacles — legal and physical — would probably emerge to stop the shipments. “We’re really very nice people,” Mr. Laughy said. “Unless you’re a big oil company.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/oil-rush-in-gray-whales-last-redoubt/?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Oil Rush in Gray Whales' Last Redoubt<date>September 29, 2010, 5:34 pm</date><text>Dave Weller/International Union for Conservation of Nature A gray whale near an oil rig off of Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. With reserves of as much as 45 billion barrels of crude by some estimates, the waters around Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East are seen as one of the world’s most promising frontiers for oil exploration. So despite the island’s frigid weather and rough seas, new fields continue to come online, like the Odoptu field of Exxon Mobil, which is to start production this week. But while proliferating rigs and drilling vessels off Sakhalin translate into growing profits for Russian-owned and multinational oil companies and a new supply of oil for an energy-thirsty region, they also pose a intensifying threat to a critically endangered population of gray whales. Once thought extinct because of extensive commercial whaling in the 19th and early 20th centuries, a small group of western gray whales was rediscovered in the early 1970s off the coast of Sakhalin Island, still largely undeveloped at the time. The group, estimated today at around 130 whales, is the only remnant of the species left in the western Pacific. (A separate subpopulation of gray whales exists off the west coast of North America.) As oil exploration has intensified around Sakhalin, environmental groups have sought to mitigate its impact on the whales, with mixed success. Of particular concern is seismic testing, which plumbs the seafloor for oil deposits but creates deafening underwater blasts of noise that are highly disturbing to the whales. One oil exploration group, Sakhalin Energy, a joint venture of Shell, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and the state-owned Russian energy giant Gazprom, has cooperated with conservation groups and postponed seismic testing so as not to coincide with peak feeding time for the whales. Sakhalin Energy also relocated a planned pipeline last year to lessen the disturbance to the whales. Other groups have been less cooperative. One set of seismic tests, by the Russian state-owned firm Rosneft, has been under way for the past month in the direct vicinity of the whales’ crucial feeding grounds, and efforts by environmental groups to gain more information have yielded little. “It’s an ongoing battle just trying to find out what they’re doing, much less trying to get them to implement some kind of mitigation effort,” said Randall Reeves, chairman of a whale specialist group for the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A major spill or leak is another potential threat — one that may be more pronounced around Sakhalin than elsewhere, as the area is prone to powerful earthquakes, like one in 1995 that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. But oil exploration is not the only hazard facing the whales. An even more immediate threat may be the use of large fixed nets by Japanese fishermen, which occasionally ensnare and kill gray whales, along with more common whale species. (Japan lies just 25 miles southeast of Sakhalin.) In 2005, three female gray whales were fatally entangled in nets off the coast of Japan, representing a major blow to the population, which has just 30 to 35 breeding females. The last recorded death by netting occurred in 2007, but the deployment of nets has not changed much since then, Dr. Reeves said. “Nothing has changed to make it safer for these whales,” he said. As for oil development, it is expected to increase significantly in the region over the next decade, according to Russian government documents. “It’s almost breathtaking how much they plan to do,” Dr. Reeves said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/would-a-public-kosmos-be-worth-5-billion/?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Would a Public Kosmos be Worth $5 Billion?<date>September 3, 2010, 5:06 am</date><text>The private equity backers of the oil firm Kosmos Energy are considering taking it public in either Britain or United States, which could value the company at around $5 billion, The Financial Times reported.

But the directive, intended to prevent banks from making big bets for their own accounts, remains vague enough for Goldman and its Wall Street rivals to put plenty of money at risk.Investment banks can still use their own money to facilitate trades for customers. The rules envisage limiting that to the expected near-term demand for client trades. But identifying where that ends and proprietary trading begins is a blurry line. The Volcker Rule’s definition of proprietary trading is also open to interpretation. At first blush, it looks watertight: the rule forbids banks from buying and selling financial products for their “trading account.” That, in turn, is defined as an account meant to profit in the “near term” from “short term” movements in prices. That clearly knocks on the head trades that last for, say, a few days. But it’s unclear how far “near term” and “short term” are supposed to stretch. For instance, would the new rule have prohibited Morgan Stanley from placing a huge short bet on the mortgage market that lost the firm some $10 billion? That trade, though modified at times, was in place for almost a year. And banks can still trade government and agency securities for their own account. These are hardly risk free. Some of the problems at the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management stemmed from trying to arbitrage prices between Treasuries of different terms. And the Carlyle Capital Corporation, a heavily leveraged debt fund, crashed in 2008 when prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds dropped. Longer-term investments aren’t ruled out either, so long as they’re not part of a private equity unit. Goldman’s special situations group, for example, sits in the firm’s fixed income division and invests in securities over a year or more. This group’s precrisis annual profit may have been as much as $1 billion. Prop trading and private equity may be dead. But long live principal investing. Big Oil, Big Gas United States oil companies are becoming less liquid — but not in a financial sense. With natural gas so plentiful, Big Oil is fast becoming Big Gas. Shareholders may be underestimating the impact of the shift on future returns while an unexpected advantage is tipping to the oiliest majors. America’s energy titans are finding it increasingly difficult to ramp up oil output. Exxon Mobil is on track to pump 5 percent less this year than in 2005, according to Barclays Capital forecasts. Instead, the company has turned to gas for growth. A big project in Papua New Guinea and its acquisition of XTO Energy are accelerating the shift. Gas, which accounted for 38 percent of Exxon’s output in 2005, could account for up to 48 percent next year. Exxon isn’t alone. Two rivals, ConocoPhillips and, to a lesser extent, Chevron, are also expanding in gas. The trend looks ominous. Oil offers fatter margins and, in the United States, sells for almost three times more than gas for the same quantity of energy. Drillers are partly victims of their own success, with new techniques raising gas reserves and driving down prices. Meanwhile, lawmakers have ditched proposals for a carbon tax, which had promised to spur demand for cleaner-burning gas. The gas market is not so grim everywhere. Multidecade contracts for liquefied natural gas in Asia are typically hooked to oil and so can fetch double the price in the United States. That helps Chevron in particular. But even overseas markets look less safe over the long run. The same drilling innovations that led to plunging prices in North America are being plied in Germany, Poland and China. Meanwhile other monster gas projects in Qatar and Australia are expected by the International Energy Agency to increase output by 50 percent by 2013. With even Chevron drifting toward gas, Occidental Petroleum, which still gets 75 percent of its output from black gold, might wind up the last of the majors deserving the moniker Big Oil. Its stock is costlier than its three biggest rivals, trading at 14 times expected 2010 earnings compared with an average of about 9.5 times. But its significantly lower exposure to gas justifies the premium, and then some. ANTONY CURRIE and CHRISTOPHER SWANN</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/business/economy/30views.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Exxon Shares Have Fallen Too Much<date>Published: July 29, 2010</date><text>Disgruntled investors have wiped more than $40 billion off the value of Exxon Mobil since its splurge on the gas giant XTO Energy — almost exactly the latter firm’s price tag. With Congress ditching carbon emissions rules, clean-burning gas looks like a bad bet. Yet to assume that XTO has zero value seems wrongheaded.Even before lawmakers went cold on limiting greenhouse gases, investors were skeptical of the purchase. Between the announcement of the deal on Dec. 14 and Thursday’s bumper second-quarter results, Exxon stock slid 16 percent. Adjusting for an average 4 percent fall of its peers Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, investors have lopped slightly more than XTO’s entire $41 billion enterprise value off Exxon’s market capitalization. True, Exxon’s huge outlay on XTO is starting to look questionable. With the benefit of hindsight, it may not have been the ideal time for Exxon to nearly triple its natural gas production in the United States. But anemic gas prices in 2009 didn’t stop XTO from eking out $6 billion or so of operating cash flow during the year. And although natural gas demand may not spike, conventional gas production in the United States is set to halve by 2030, providing some support for prices. And Exxon’s discipline and strong credit rating will surely lower costs at XTO. Exxon’s better-than-expected $7.6 billion profit in the second quarter is a reminder that there is more to the company than XTO. Unlike ConocoPhillips, Exxon is continuing to lift output. Annual production growth of 2 to 3 percent looks within reach over coming years. Nor is Exxon as exposed to the troubled Gulf of Mexico as Chevron. And a top-notch reputation for safety should become even more valuable to Exxon as risk aversion increases in the wake of BP’s spill. XTO may not deliver the plump returns on capital Exxon shareholders have grown accustomed too. But the deal isn’t the total wipeout the loss of market value would suggest. Exxon shares have suffered too much. The Allure of Size More than ever, the biggest investors are entrusting their money disproportionately to the largest hedge funds. They may discover that bigger isn’t always better. The size fetish has meant that the share of industry assets held by firms with more than $1 billion under management has risen gradually from about 75 percent in 2006 to about 82 percent at the start of this year, according to Hedge Fund Intelligence. And the trend seems to be accelerating. In the second quarter, 92 percent of net inflows went to managers with more than $5 billion under their control, Hedge Fund Research reckons. Yet research by PerTrac suggests that older and larger managers tend to deliver lower absolute returns than smaller and younger ones. Smaller funds on average outperformed larger ones every year from 1996 to 2009, except for 2008. Larger funds, meanwhile, may struggle to find opportunities big enough to make a difference. Or they may have to take more risk to generate the same returns. There’s also the danger that management fees bring in so much money that big funds may focus on accumulating assets rather than on investing. So why are hedge fund fans so keen on size? One reason is that the investor base is changing. More money now comes directly from large institutions like sovereign wealth funds and pension managers. These investors typically want brand-name managers with plenty of resources, powerful management systems and diversified strategies. These large funds should be less likely to blow up because of one bad trade. And crucially, they fared less badly than smaller brethren in the crisis year of 2008. But size and reputation are no guarantee of performance. Even big blue-chip managers like Fortress and D. E. Shaw hamstrung investors by limiting redemptions during the turmoil two years ago. Happily for newcomers, start-up funds can still raise money from seed-capital providers including the likes of Julian Robertson of Tiger Management. And the new breed of hedge fund investors should over time get more comfortable handing cash to smaller managers. Good thing, too: they could lose out if they sideline small funds for long.

Exxon said second-quarter net income excluding one-time items rose 85 percent compared with the same period in 2009, to $7.56 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.46 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 24 percent to $92.5 billion, from $74.5 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Shell said second-quarter profit, calculated on a similar basis, rose 34 percent to $4.21 billion. Revenue was $90.6 billion, up from $63.9 billion. After strong showings in the first quarter for both, the results raised hopes that both companies could start to offer investors meaningful growth again. Exxon said second-quarter production was 4.0 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 8 percent from the same period a year earlier, while its smaller rival Shell said output was up 5 percent at 3.1 million barrels. Shell has suffered seven years of falling output and Exxon’s performance has also been anemic over the period. Philip Weiss, an oil analyst with Argus Research, said the impressive headline output numbers were driven by gas, with Shell’s crude production up 1 percent and Exxon’s down 1 percent. Oil accounted for only 58 percent of Exxon’s output, compared with 64 percent in the same period last year, and Shell’s oil weighting dropped to 53 percent from 59 percent. A global gas glut because of the economic crisis and a big increase in shale gas production means the outlook for gas prices is uncertain, which could put pressure on future earnings. Exxon, now the largest natural gas producer in the United States after its $30 billion stock deal to buy XTO Energy, plans to accelerate drilling in gas-rich shale fields in North America in the second half of this year. “It’s our expectation that overall drilling activity would continue to increase,” David Rosenthal, an investor relations executive with Exxon, told analysts in a conference call. Shell’s chief financial officer, Simon Henry, said the gap between gas and oil prices grew in the last year as oil prices rose faster than gas prices. BP, which is based in London, said Tuesday that its underlying result rose 77 percent. The company is still battling to permanently seal a blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico that has caused the worst oil spill in American history. High oil and gas prices were the main driver of the gains, although the higher output and a recovery in refinery margins also helped. Crude oil prices were 30 percent higher in the quarter than a year before, averaging $77.81 a barrel, while global refining margins rose 10 percent, according to BP data. Shell’s results included a $56 million charge related to the United States moratorium on deepwater drilling, imposed after the BP oil spill three months ago. Shell’s chief executive, Peter Voser, told analysts in a conference call that he would think about reclaiming the money from BP. BP declined to comment on the potential for a Shell claim, but pointed out the compensation fund they agreed to pay into did not cover such items. Shell added it had exceeded restructuring targets, achieving annual cost savings of $3.5 billion and cutting 7,000 jobs, allowing it to conclude its overhaul six months quicker than planned.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E5D61031F931A15754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=exxonmobilcorporation">4 Oil Firms Commit $1 Billion For Gulf Rapid-Response Plan<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>Four of the world's biggest oil companies said on Wednesday that they were committing $1 billion to create a rapid-response system to deal with deepwater oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, seeking to restore public confidence in the industry after the BP disaster painfully exposed how unprepared the industry was for a major accident. The voluntary effort, which involves building a set of modular containment equipment that would be kept on standby for emergency use, comes as oil companies seek to persuade the Obama administration to lift a temporary ban on deepwater drilling. The moratorium was imposed after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20 and spewed millions of gallons of oil into the gulf. Officials said the spill served as a wake-up call for the industry, which had invested billions of dollars to develop oil and gas resources in ever-deeper waters offshore but neglected to devise spill-response technology that could be effective in thousands of feet of water. Environmentalists, members of Congress and federal and state officials have already made it clear that the industry will face tougher regulations when drilling resumes. The emergency response plan is part of the oil industry's effort to show it can improve its safety procedures and shape the inevitable rules of conduct that will be imposed. The plan -- which was put together by Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell -- incorporates many of the lessons that BP was forced to learn the hard way in trying to cap a gushing oil well 5,000 feet below the ocean's surface. The four companies said their initiative would seek to include all the companies involved in offshore drilling in the gulf, including BP. Their initial financing of $250 million each will be used to build a set of containment equipment, like underwater systems and pipelines, that will be able to deal with a variety of deepwater problems and can be deployed rapidly in the event of a spill. The partners said it would take six months to get all the elements in place. The companies expect the system will be able to contain spills in water as deep as 10,000 feet and capture up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day, although that capacity could be increased if needed. ''It's doubtful we will ever use it, but this is a risk-management gap we need to fill in order for the government and the public to be confident to allow us to get back to work,'' Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman of Exxon, said in an interview. Critically, the new system is expected to be deployed within 24 hours of an offshore spill, and to be able to fully contain the oil spilled within weeks, said Sara Ortwein, a vice president of engineering at Exxon, which has taken the lead in setting up the spill plan. A new nonprofit entity, called the Marine Well Containment Company, will be created and be in charge of operating and maintaining this emergency capability. The entity, modeled in part after the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which was set up after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, will also finance research to look into new ways of tackling an underwater spill. It has taken BP nearly three months to finally cap its gushing oil well in the gulf, after repeated failures to plug the well using a series of jury-rigged devices. While drilling two relief wells to permanently seal its damaged well, BP has relied on inflatable booms, chemical dispersants, containment vessels and controlled burning to address the spill. ''One thing that has become clear is that we need to have a system that is flexible, adaptable and available for rapid response,'' Ms. Ortwein said in an interview. Oil companies hope the initiative, the product of four weeks of intensive efforts involving 40 engineers from the four companies, will help persuade government regulators and the administration to allow them to resume offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico as soon as possible. Oil companies are also seeking to deflect a series of bills being considered in Congress -- including one proposal that would force companies to drill a second well, called a relief well, alongside any new exploration well. Oil executives argue that such a proposal would not enhance safety offshore, but instead would double the risk because a relief well would be just as likely to blow up as an exploration well. The Interior Department agency that oversees deepwater drilling said Wednesday that the industry's new response plan was a ''move in the right direction.'' ''The BP oil spill has made it clear that oil and gas companies did not have the sufficient containment capacity to respond to a major spill,'' Michael R. Bromwich, the director of the department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said in a statement. ''We are encouraged that a number of companies recognize this issue and are taking steps to correct it.'' However, oil companies still face considerable skepticism about their ability to operate safely in the gulf. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of the industry's most vocal critics, described the plan as ''BP's current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint.'' When top oil executives appeared before Congress several weeks ago, Mr. Markey and other lawmakers forced them to admit that their spill response plans were outdated and woefully inadequate. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who has opposed the drilling moratorium, said Wednesday that the industry's initiative was badly needed. ''It is clear that we simply cannot afford three months of trial and error ever again,'' she said in a statement. The initiative is the first product of a larger discussion within the industry on how to improve safety in the gulf. Oil companies have set up an industrywide task force to consider new safety standards for offshore drilling, more frequent rig inspections, new requirements and certification for blowout preventers and improvements in well design. Frank Verrastro, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said an updated approach to safety in the gulf was overdue. ''Companies have used their technology to get into the deep water but they didn't have an adequate plan to intervene at these depths or to contain a large-scale spill,'' he said.

Exxon developed a rigid system of rules for all its operations, from gas stations to offshore platforms, and it empowered everyone, even contractors, to speak up about safety problems. Today, Exxon stands out among its peers for its obsessive attention to safety, according to analysts and industry insiders. And in a case that bears many similarities to the Deepwater Horizon incident, the system prevented what might have been a very serious accident, according to Exxon officials. In September 2006, Exxon was drilling a particularly challenging exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico, called Blackbeard. After more than 500 days of drilling, the well had reached a depth of 30,067 feet, a record at the time, and was within striking distance of its target. Seismic reports suggested that 2,000 feet further down was a giant prize: an “elephant” field of around a billion barrels of oil and gas. But six miles below the sea floor, the conditions were hellish, with high temperatures and pressures reaching 29,000 pounds per square inch, more than twice the force needed to crush a truck. The drilling team was getting nervous. The well had experienced a “kick” — a sudden gush of natural gas similar to the one BP experienced in its doomed Macondo well. Attempts to relieve the pressure by pumping down heavy fluids, known as drilling mud, were unsuccessful. Engineers worried that high-pressure gas might burst out of the well and exceed what the blowout preventer, a heavy piece of equipment designed to control a well, could handle. “There was a pretty extensive discussion between the geoscientists, who wanted to keep going — here they were near their objectives — and the drillers, who were saying, ‘We are just really not comfortable,’ ” recalled Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, in an interview last month. Mr. Tillerson eventually sided with the drillers. The well was capped and abandoned, and Exxon wrote off Blackbeard as a $187 million dry hole. “We were right at the ragged edge and they felt the risk was too great,” Mr. Tillerson said. At the time, company was criticized for lacking courage. Another oil company, McMoRan Exploration, later bought the rights and drilled down to the target depth, boasting of a giant find, although two years later, it has yet to produce any oil from it. Now, after the BP blowout, the Exxon decision looks different, said Paul Sankey, a Deutsche Bank analyst. “Exxon’s ‘lack of guts’ looks a lot more like justified conservatism and prudence, and a prescient awareness that safety, caution and catastrophic risk avoidance would be key themes as oil companies were forced to push the envelope in the search for new oil,” he wrote in a recent report. “The fact is that Valdez pushed Exxon to the highest safety standards in the industry.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/business/economy/09views.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">How the Mighty Have Fallen<date>Published: July 8, 2010</date><text>The poor are teaching the rich a lesson. It used to be that the world’s less developed nations were the problem children — giving plutocrats too much power while running irresponsibly large budget deficits and failing to overcome deep internal imbalances. Now, rich countries look like the new poor.Start with trade. China and middle-income commodity exporters have most of the biggest trade surpluses while the world’s richest large economy, the United States, still runs the biggest deficit. With surpluses come financial clout and funds for investment. Deficits lead to dependency and, eventually, industrial weakness. Fiscal deficits are too high everywhere, but after the financial crisis of 2008 the rich are in far worse shape than the poor. Deficits in developed economies like the United States and Britain have jumped by 7.7 percent of G.D.P., close to twice the 4.2 percent rise in middle-income countries, according to the International Monetary Fund. And rich-country governments are finding it hard to summon the political will to reduce those outsize deficits. Leaders know they have a problem but can’t bring their people — and sometimes their political allies — along with them. President Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy are among them. That’s a big contrast to the strong and popular governments in countries such as Brazil. Finally, rich countries seem unable to agree on what they stand for. America’s culture wars define its politics. There are sharp disputes about the future of the European Union and the euro. Japan is forever searching for its role in the world. Poor countries have their fights, but much less doubt in their overarching goal of getting richer. Sure, there are exceptions. Many poor countries, such as Thailand, are struggling. And some rich ones, including Germany, are doing relatively well despite the economic turmoil surrounding them. But the global balance does seem to have shifted. This shouldn’t be too surprising. People in developing countries want more wealth, and are learning from those who amassed it before them. As for the cultural malaise of the already rich, almost two millennia after the Roman Empire started its decline, the jury is still out on what exactly went wrong. Exxon’s Long Hedge Exxon Mobil Corporation’s $31 billion hedge is way out of the money. Gas prices have tumbled since the company agreed to pay that amount for the gas producer XTO. That doesn’t make the deal a bust. A carbon tax might make the XTO purchase look smart, but Exxon benefits for as long as Congress twiddles its thumbs. To his credit, Exxon’s chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, has made little attempt to mask the grim economics of the natural gas market. If anything, these have worsened since December when Exxon broke a decade-long deal fast to buy XTO. Since then, the already depressed gas price has fallen nearly another 20 percent. The very technical success of drillers uncovering growing quantities of shale gas is proving their financial undoing. The Congressional failure to place a price on carbon, a move that promised to catapult demand for clean-burning gas, is a bigger worry still. Exxon’s own number-crunchers assume a $30-a-ton price for carbon over the next 10 years, leading electric utilities to ditch coal for natural gas. Since December’s XTO deal, however, what minimal Republican support existed for a climate bill has nearly disappeared. With unemployment so high, both political parties seem hesitant to push a bill that might be accused of destroying jobs. So it may be years before XTO contributes to Exxon’s industry-beating return on equity. Yet Mr. Tillerson may not be too perturbed. XTO represents a fraction of Exxon’s business. The heads of Exxon’s other carbon-spewing businesses are unlikely to be praying for climate legislation. The company’s downstream and refining business already has lost over $200 million since the start of 2009 and a price on carbon would likely add to the pain. What’s more, the XTO bet doesn’t need to pay off any time soon. Unlike fast-gushing deepwater oil, XTO’s shale wells will last for 40 years at current rates of production. By holding on to leases as cheaply as possible and drilling in the most promising wells, Exxon can keep shale businesses from being too much of a drain.

It was bringing in a new man to head its American operations — the source of most of the company’s problems — who would make safety his top priority. And on, and on. That interview didn’t take place this week — a week in which BP was excoriated in Congress for the extraordinary safety lapses that led to the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster, while also being strong-armed by President Obama into putting $20 billion in escrow to compensate victims. No, the interview took place nearly four years ago, after BP’s previous disaster on American soil, when oil was discovered leaking from a 16-mile stretch of corroded BP pipeline in Prudhoe Bay in Alaska. And that was just a year after a BP refinery explosion in Texas City, Tex., killed 15 workers and injured hundreds more. Nor was the chief executive in question Tony Hayward, who spent Thursday before a Congressional panel ducking tough questions and evading personal responsibility — while insisting, absurdly, that as head of the company he had been “laser-focused” on safety. No, the interviewee was his predecessor and mentor John Browne, who had spent nearly 10 years at the helm of BP before resigning in May 2007. Do you remember the Prudhoe Bay leak and the Texas City explosion? They were big news at the time, though they quickly faded from the headlines. BP was fined $21 million for the numerous violations that contributed to the Texas City explosion, and it was forced to endure a phased shutdown of its Alaska operations while it repaired the corroded pipeline, which cost it additional revenue. In retrospect, though, the two accidents represented something else as well: they were a huge gift to the company. The fact that these two accidents — thousands of miles apart, and involving very different parts of BP — took place within a year showed that something was systemically wrong with BP’s culture. Mr. Browne had built BP by taking over other oil companies, like Amoco in 1998, and then ruthlessly cutting costs, often firing the acquired company’s most experienced engineers. Taking shortcuts was ingrained in the company’s culture, and everyone in the oil business knew it. The accidents should have been the wake-up call BP needed to change that culture. But the mistakes and negligence that took place on the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico — which are so profound that everyone I spoke to in the oil business found them truly inexplicable — suggest that the two men never did much more than mouth nice-sounding platitudes. Which also makes the disaster even more unforgivable than it already is. BP executives had four years to fix the company’s problems before an accident took place that was truly catastrophic. And they blew it.  Before the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, the greatest oil disaster in American history was the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, which spewed 10.8 million gallons of crude into Prince William Sound in Alaska. (By comparison, the gulf blowout is pouring out that much oil every four or five days.) That experience was searing for the country — but it was also pretty searing for Exxon (now known as Exxon Mobil). “A low point in the history of the company,” Exxon Mobil’s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, called it when he testified before Congress on Tuesday. There is a reason Exxon Mobil has not had a serious accident in the subsequent 21 years. Unlike BP, it used the accident to transform itself. Immediately after the spill, Exxon pulled together some of its most respected executives and gave them a new assignment: figure out how to embed safety into the core of the company. The message was reiterated by the top brass, including the chief executive, whenever they visited a rig or a refinery. Processes were put in place that had to be followed at any Exxon facility anywhere in the world. Redundancies were built in. Workers were encouraged to bring safety concerns to their bosses. And the statistics bear out the genuineness of this cultural change: by every measure, Exxon Mobil has by far the best safety record in the industry. The company has become so safety-crazed that an Exxon Mobil cafeteria worker takes the temperature of the lettuce in the salad bar. Compare that to BP’s record these last four years. On Thursday, during his day before an angry House energy subcommittee, Mr. Hayward was confronted with the fact that BP had been cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 760 “egregious willful” safety violations in its refineries. Mr. Hayward tried to slough this off by claiming that the violations had taken place in 2005 and 2006 — before, that is, he became chief executive and brought his “laser focus” on safety.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/world/africa/17nigeria.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">In Nigeria, Oil Spills Are a Longtime Scourge<date>Published: June 16, 2010</date><text>BODO, Nigeria — Big oil spills are no longer news in this vast, tropical land. The Niger Delta, where the wealth underground is out of all proportion with the poverty on the surface, has endured the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every year for 50 years by some estimates. The oil pours out nearly every week, and some swamps are long since lifeless.Perhaps no place on earth has been as battered by oil, experts say, leaving residents here astonished at the nonstop attention paid to the gusher half a world away in the Gulf of Mexico. It was only a few weeks ago, they say, that a burst pipe belonging to Royal Dutch Shell in the mangroves was finally shut after flowing for two months: now nothing living moves in a black-and-brown world once teeming with shrimp and crab. Not far away, there is still black crude on Gio Creek from an April spill, and just across the state line in Akwa Ibom the fishermen curse their oil-blackened nets, doubly useless in a barren sea buffeted by a spill from an offshore Exxon Mobil pipe in May that lasted for weeks. The oil spews from rusted and aging pipes, unchecked by what analysts say is ineffectual or collusive regulation, and abetted by deficient maintenance and sabotage. In the face of this black tide is an infrequent protest — soldiers guarding an Exxon Mobil site beat women who were demonstrating last month, according to witnesses — but mostly resentful resignation. Small children swim in the polluted estuary here, fishermen take their skiffs out ever farther — “There’s nothing we can catch here,” said Pius Doron, perched anxiously over his boat — and market women trudge through oily streams. “There is Shell oil on my body,” said Hannah Baage, emerging from Gio Creek with a machete to cut the cassava stalks balanced on her head. That the Gulf of Mexico disaster has transfixed a country and president they so admire is a matter of wonder for people here, living among the palm-fringed estuaries in conditions as abject as any in Nigeria, according to the United Nations. Though their region contributes nearly 80 percent of the government’s revenue, they have hardly benefited from it; life expectancy is the lowest in Nigeria. “President Obama is worried about that one,” Claytus Kanyie, a local official, said of the gulf spill, standing among dead mangroves in the soft oily muck outside Bodo. “Nobody is worried about this one. The aquatic life of our people is dying off. There used be shrimp. There are no longer any shrimp.” In the distance, smoke rose from what Mr. Kanyie and environmental activists said was an illegal refining business run by local oil thieves and protected, they said, by Nigerian security forces. The swamp was deserted and quiet, without even bird song; before the spills, Mr. Kanyie said, women from Bodo earned a living gathering mollusks and shellfish among the mangroves. With new estimates that as many as 2.5 million gallons of oil could be spilling into the Gulf of Mexico each day, the Niger Delta has suddenly become a cautionary tale for the United States. As many as 546 million gallons of oil spilled into the Niger Delta over the last five decades, or nearly 11 million gallons a year, a team of experts for the Nigerian government and international and local environmental groups concluded in a 2006 report. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 dumped an estimated 10.8 million gallons of oil into the waters off Alaska. So the people here cast a jaundiced, if sympathetic, eye at the spill in the gulf. “We’re sorry for them, but it’s what’s been happening to us for 50 years,” said Emman Mbong, an official in Eket. The spills here are all the more devastating because this ecologically sensitive wetlands region, the source of 10 percent of American oil imports, has most of Africa’s mangroves and, like the Louisiana coast, has fed the interior for generations with its abundance of fish, shellfish, wildlife and crops. Local environmentalists have been denouncing the spoliation for years, with little effect. “It’s a dead environment,” said Patrick Naagbanton of the Center for Environment, Human Rights and Development in Port Harcourt, the leading city of the oil region. Though much here has been destroyed, much remains, with large expanses of vibrant green. Environmentalists say that with intensive restoration, the Niger Delta could again be what it once was. Nigeria produced more than two million barrels of oil a day last year, and in over 50 years thousands of miles of pipes have been laid through the swamps. Shell, the major player, has operations on thousands of square miles of territory, according to Amnesty International. Aging columns of oil-well valves, known as Christmas trees, pop up improbably in clearings among the palm trees. Oil sometimes shoots out of them, even if the wells are defunct. “The oil was just shooting up in the air, and it goes up in the sky,” said Amstel M. Gbarakpor, youth president in Kegbara Dere, recalling the spill in April at Gio Creek. “It took them three weeks to secure this well.” How much of the spillage is due to oil thieves or to sabotage linked to the militant movement active in the Niger Delta, and how much stems from poorly maintained and aging pipes, is a matter of fierce dispute among communities, environmentalists and the oil companies. Caroline Wittgen, a spokeswoman for Shell in Lagos, said, “We don’t discuss individual spills,” but argued that the “vast majority” were caused by sabotage or theft, with only 2 percent due to equipment failure or human error. “We do not believe that we behave irresponsibly, but we do operate in a unique environment where security and lawlessness are major problems,” Ms. Wittgen said. Oil companies also contend that they clean up much of what is lost. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil in Lagos, Nigel A. Cookey-Gam, said that the company’s recent offshore spill leaked only about 8,400 gallons and that “this was effectively cleaned up.” But many experts and local officials say the companies attribute too much to sabotage, to lessen their culpability. Richard Steiner, a consultant on oil spills, concluded in a 2008 report that historically “the pipeline failure rate in Nigeria is many times that found elsewhere in the world,” and he noted that even Shell acknowledged “almost every year” a spill due to a corroded pipeline. On the beach at Ibeno, the few fishermen were glum. Far out to sea oil had spilled for weeks from the Exxon Mobil pipe. “We can’t see where to fish; oil is in the sea,” Patrick Okoni said. “We don’t have an international media to cover us, so nobody cares about it,” said Mr. Mbong, in nearby Eket. “Whatever cry we cry is not heard outside of here.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/business/16oil.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Oil Executives Try to Explain Differences From BP<date>Published: June 15, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The chairmen of four of the world’s largest oil companies broke their nearly two-month silence on the major spill in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday and publicly blamed BP for mishandling the well that caused the disaster.Seeking to insulate their companies from the continuing crisis in the gulf and the political backlash in Washington, the leaders of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and ConocoPhillips insisted at a Congressional hearing that they would not have made the mistakes that led to the well explosion and the deaths of 11 rig workers on April 20. “We would not have drilled the well the way they did,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil. “It certainly appears that not all the standards that we would recommend or that we would employ were in place,” said John S. Watson, chairman of Chevron. “It’s not a well that we would have drilled in that mechanical setup,” said Marvin E. Odum, president of Shell. The hearing was an opportunity for three dozen members of Congress to vent their frustration at top executives of the world’s largest privately owned oil companies. The occasion was reminiscent of the 1994 hearing before a panel of the same committee — the House Energy and Commerce Committee — at which the chief executives of the major tobacco companies were ritually grilled on the dangers of their products. Top banking executives recently got the same treatment. The oil company leaders presented a similar tableau on Tuesday — a group of middle-aged, dark-suited executives raising their right hands in preparation for nearly five hours of hostile interrogation. Democrats generally were seeking confessions of error and expressions of regret. Republicans focused more on the economic impact of the spill and the moratorium on most offshore drilling that President Obama imposed in the aftermath of the disaster. They sought assurances that deepwater drilling could resume safely. But even some Republicans were moved to join the attack on Lamar McKay, president of BP America and designated scapegoat of the day, who was seated at the witness table with the other executives. Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida, told Mr. McKay that he should resign; another Republican, Representative Joseph Cao of Louisiana, said, “In samurai days, we would just give you a knife and ask you to commit hara-kiri.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee that convened the hearing, demanded that Mr. McKay apologize for what Mr. Markey termed the incompetence and deceit that led to consistently low estimates of the size of the spill and the resulting damage. After weaving for a bit, Mr. McKay said meekly: “We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through. We are sorry for that and for the spill.” He refused repeated requests that he promise to place billions of dollars of BP’s profits in an escrow fund to pay damage claims, as members of Congress and Mr. Obama have demanded. “I cannot commit today one way or another to a fund,” he said. “We said we’ll honor all legitimate claims, and the full company stands behind that.” Until now, the other major oil companies had provided technical assistance to BP and refrained from criticizing the company’s handling of the disaster. Even as they watched their offshore rigs idled and their stock values fall, they had presented a united front. But that unity crumbled Tuesday before the House committee, mirroring growing private frustration with being linked to BP. Some executives have been angered at BP’s efforts to paint the gulf accident as an industrywide problem that will require industrywide reforms. The executives of the other companies asserted Tuesday that they believed BP was an outlier, cutting corners to save time and money in ways that they would not tolerate. The BP spill came just as the industry was about to realize a long-awaited goal of expanding offshore drilling to new parts of the gulf, the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Arctic. That is now all in question. Although most of the Congressional fire was aimed at BP on Tuesday, the other executives came under criticism as well, particularly for the response plans that they prepared for a major spill in the gulf. The five companies submitted virtually identical plans to government regulators and to the committee. The 500-page document, prepared by a private contractor, refers to measures to protect walruses and gives a phone number for a marine biologist who died five years ago. James J. Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said the citations were “certainly an embarrassment to Conoco,” adding, “Plans need to be updated more frequently.” Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, noted that each of the companies said it had planned for a much larger spill than the BP accident, even though it is clear that even a spill of the current size is beyond any company’s ability to handle. “BP failed miserably when confronted with a real leak,” Mr. Waxman said, “and Exxon Mobil and the other companies would do no better.” Mr. Tillerson admitted that the only way to deal with major spills was to keep them from occurring. “The point is,” he said, “we have to take every step to prevent these things from happening, because when they happen we are not well equipped to prevent any and all damage. There will be damage. There is no response capability that will ensure that you won’t have an impact.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/science/earth/15cleanup.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Onshore Oil Spill Response Is Described as Chaotic<date>Published: June 14, 2010</date><text>GRAND ISLE, La. — Deano Bonano, the emergency preparedness director for Jefferson Parish, marched from a motor home being used as a command center to an office across the street filled with BP officials.It was late May. Oil had been creeping into the passes around Grand Isle. Two fleets of fishing boats were supposed to be laying out boom, the long floating barriers to corral oil and protect the fragile marshes of Barataria Bay. But the boats were gathered on the inland side of the bay — the wrong side — anchored idly as the oil oozed in from the Gulf of Mexico. BP officials said they had no way of contacting the workers on the boats, Mr. Bonano recalled. “You’re watching the oil come in,” Mr. Bonano said, “and they can’t even move.” For much of the last two months, the focus of the response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion has been a mile underwater, 50 miles from shore, where successive efforts involving containment domes, “top kills” and “junk shots” have failed, and a “spillcam” shows tens of thousands of barrels of oil hemorrhaging into the gulf each day. Closer to shore, the efforts to keep the oil away from land have not fared much better, despite a response effort involving thousands of boats, tens of thousands of workers and millions of feet of containment boom. From the beginning, the effort has been bedeviled by a lack of preparation, organization, urgency and clear lines of authority among federal, state and local officials, as well as BP. As a result, officials and experts say, the damage to the coastline and wildlife has been worse than it might have been if the response had been faster and orchestrated more effectively. “The present system is not working,” Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said Thursday at a hearing in Washington devoted to assessing the spill and the response. Oil had just entered Florida waters, Senator Nelson said, adding that no one was notified at either the state or local level, a failure of communication that echoed Mr. Bonano’s story and countless others along the Gulf Coast. “The information is not flowing,” Senator Nelson said. “The decisions are not timely. The resources are not produced. And as a result, you have a big mess, with no command and control.” They were supposed to be better prepared. When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska in 1989, skimmers, booms and dispersants were in short supply for the response, which was led by a consortium of oil companies in which BP was the majority stakeholder. A year later, lawmakers passed the federal Oil Pollution Act to ensure that plans were in place for oil spills, so the response effort would be quick, with clear responsibilities for everyone involved. Every region of the country was required to have a contingency plan, tailored for its unique geography, for responding to a spill. But Leslie Pearson, a private oil-spill response consultant, said federal oversight of spill contingency plans largely amounts to accepting what oil industry operators say they can do, rather than demanding they demonstrate that they can actually do it. “Their plans don’t say, ‘Within X amount of time it has to be controlled and industry needs to prove how the heck you’re going to do that,’ ” she said. She and other critics of the federal government’s response point to parts of the world where they say foreign governments have stricter rules for offshore operators. In the Canadian Arctic, for example, some offshore operators are required to have ships on close standby to drill relief wells more quickly than the ones being drilled in the gulf. While the United States requires operators to be prepared to drill relief wells, their contingency plans do not have to specify a firm timeline for how quickly they will do so, experts said. Some states have tried to establish tougher rules within their jurisdictions. In Prince William Sound, where the Valdez ran aground, for example, Alaska requires all tankers to be accompanied by two escort vessels. Enough equipment also has to be at the ready to remove up to 300,000 barrels of oil in 72 hours. Scott Schaefer, the deputy administrator of California’s Office of Spill Prevention and Response, said his state’s regulations also went beyond federal law, requiring, among other things, repeated tests of response equipment. Mr. Schaefer, who is now in Mobile, Ala., working to fight the oil spill there, declined to characterize the level of preparation in the gulf. He did note, though, that many other experts had flown in from California, including scientists trained in gauging damage to sensitive areas and experts in aerial imaging to study the density of oil in the water. “They’ve got their programs here and they’re pretty proud of them,” he said. “I think on the West Coast it’s just much bigger and better funded.” Still, said Ms. Pearson, the consultant, states have limited tools to deal with offshore drilling in federal waters, as was the case with the Deepwater Horizon. And by the time oil arrives at a coastline, she said, “you’ve lost the response.” Many experts also said that no plan could really fight this leak perfectly, and that the problem was more with the regulations that allowed it to happen in the first place.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/us/11spill.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">New Estimates Double Rate of Oil Flowing Into Gulf<date>Published: June 10, 2010</date><text>A government panel on Thursday essentially doubled its estimate of how much oil has been spewing from the out-of-control BP well, with the new calculation suggesting that an amount equivalent to the Exxon Valdez disaster could be flowing into the Gulf of Mexico every 8 to 10 days.The new estimate is 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil a day. That range, still preliminary, is far above the previous estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day. These new calculations came as the public wrangling between BP and the White House was reaching new heights, with President Obama asking for a meeting with BP executives next week and his Congressional allies intensifying their pressure on the oil giant to withhold dividend payments to shareholders until it makes clear it can and will pay all its obligations from the spill. The higher estimates will affect not only assessments of how much environmental damage the spill has done but also how much BP might eventually pay to clean up the mess — and they will most likely increase suspicion among skeptics about how honest and forthcoming the oil company has been throughout the catastrophe. The new estimate is based on information that was gathered before BP cut a pipe called a riser on the ocean floor last week to install a new capture device, an operation that some scientists have said may have sharply increased the rate of flow. The government panel, called the Flow Rate Technical Group, is preparing yet another estimate that will cover the period after the riser was cut. The new estimate appears to be a far better match than earlier ones for the reality that Americans can see every day on their televisions. Even though the new capture device is funneling 15,000 barrels of oil a day to a ship at the surface, a robust flow of oil is still gushing from the well a mile beneath the waves. The question of how much oil is pouring into the gulf has been a nagging one for weeks, especially since early estimates from BP and the government proved woefully low. And the new estimates come as the company, after weeks of failed efforts, is enjoying its first substantial success at preventing a significant volume of oil from entering the gulf. The new numbers are certain to ratchet up the already intense political pressure on BP. For days Mr. Obama and his advisers have fended off questions about why he has not spoken with the chief executive of BP, Tony Hayward. The president’s commander for the spill response, Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, wrote on Thursday to the chairman of the BP board, Carl-Henric Svanberg, requesting that he and “any appropriate officials from BP” meet with administration officials next Wednesday. Mr. Obama will participate in part of the meeting, he wrote. Administration officials suggested that they had no immediate plans to directly block BP from paying the dividend, even as the White House and its allies made clear that they would pressure the company to ensure that it made paying spill-related claims its top financial priority. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, told reporters that BP should withhold dividends to shareholders until it paid small-business owners along the gulf for their loss claims. Representative Edward J. Markey, who is chairman of one committee investigating the spill, suggested that the government would take action to block the payments if necessary. “This company, I think, will stay solvent,” said Mr. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts. “And we’re going to make sure that the shareholders wait until the victims are paid first.” Andrew Gowers, a BP spokesman, said “there is no change in the position” of retaining the dividend. “We intend to meet all our obligations to all our stakeholders,” he said. “We are a very financially strong company.” In coming weeks, BP hopes to start capturing the vast bulk of the oil emerging from the well. The new high estimate of 30,000 barrels, however, would exceed BP’s current processing capacity, which is expected to reach 25,000 barrels a day by next week. The company plans to move an additional ship into position by early July to improve its ability to manage the flow. Mr. Gowers said that the flow-rate group was doing “appropriate” work and that the new estimate would not affect the company’s planned containment efforts. Mr. Gowers noted that BP had supplied the information that allowed the technical group to make its calculation. “It’s their job to produce the estimate, and we have nothing to add,” he said. As investors have fled BP stock over uncertainties about the company’s future and its ability to pay what it will end up owing, BP has lost nearly half its market capitalization since April, and its bonds are now trading at junk levels. Credit Suisse estimates the cleanup costs could end up at $15 billion to $23 billion, plus an additional $14 billion of claims. But analysts make much of BP’s financial flexibility: it had net profit of $17 billion last year alone. Mr. Gowers said the company did not have an estimate of what its potential liability costs would be. But he said that as of Thursday morning, the company had already spent $1.43 billion, including claims payments, the costs of trying to plug and cap the leak, and payments of block grants to gulf states. On the new estimates of the flow rate, Marcia McNutt, director of the United States Geological Survey and chairwoman of the technical panel, said the new figures were based on a more detailed analysis of information like video of the gushing well. The new range was also based on the first direct measurement of the flow rate, using sonar equipment lowered to the ocean floor. Two scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Richard Camilli and Andy Bowen, made that measurement on May 31, Mr. Bowen said. As with the government’s previous estimate, Dr. McNutt said subgroups of the panel applied various analytical techniques to come up with estimates. The best overlap among the techniques was the range of 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day, she said, and that became the new official estimate. Dr. McNutt added, however, that the range of estimates the technical panel considered plausible was actually wider, more like 20,000 to 40,000 barrels a day. A barrel is 42 gallons, so 30,000 barrels would equate to nearly 1.3 million gallons a day. The Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 is estimated to have spilled 10.8 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska. Ira Leifer, a researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a member of the flow-rate group, said the new figures confirmed a suspicion he had developed, based on looking at satellite data, that the rate of flow for the well was increasing even before BP cut the riser pipe. “The situation is growing worse,” Dr. Leifer said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/us/28spill.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">BP Resumes Work to Plug Oil Leak After Facing Setback<date>Published: May 27, 2010</date><text>HOUSTON — BP on Thursday night restarted its most ambitious effort yet to plug the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, trying to revive hopes that it might cap the well with a “top kill” technique that involved pumping heavy drilling liquids to counteract the pressure of the gushing oil.BP officials, who along with government officials created the impression early in the day that the strategy was working, disclosed later that they had stopped pumping the night before when engineers saw that too much of the drilling fluid was escaping along with the oil. It was the latest setback in the effort to shut off the leaking oil, which federal officials said was pouring into the gulf at a far higher rate than original estimates suggested. If the new estimates are accurate, the spill would be far bigger than the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 and the worst in United States history. President Obama, who planned to visit the gulf on Friday, ordered a suspension of virtually all current and new offshore oil drilling activity pending a comprehensive safety review, acknowledging that oversight until now had been seriously deficient. Mr. Obama said at a news conference in Washington that he was angry and frustrated about the catastrophe, and he shouldered much of the responsibility for the continuing crisis. “Those who think we were either slow on the response or lacked urgency, don’t know the facts,” Mr. Obama said. “This has been our highest priority.” But he also blamed BP, which owns the stricken well, and the Bush administration, which he said had fostered a “cozy and sometimes corrupt” relationship between oil companies and regulators at the Minerals Management Service. The chief of that agency for the past 11 months, S. Elizabeth Birnbaum, resigned on Thursday, less than a week after her boss, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, announced a broad restructuring of the office. “I’m hopeful that the reforms that the secretary and the administration are undertaking will resolve the flaws in the current system that I inherited,” she said in a statement. Mr. Obama plans on Friday to inspect the efforts in Louisiana to stop the leak and clean up after it, his second trip to the region since the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20. He will also visit with people affected by the spreading slick that has washed ashore over scores of miles of beaches and wetlands. Even as Mr. Obama acknowledged that his efforts to improve regulation of offshore drilling had fallen short, he said that oil and gas from beneath the gulf, now about 30 percent of total domestic production, would be a part of the nation’s energy supply for years to come. “It has to be part of an overall energy strategy,” Mr. Obama said. “I mean, we’re still years off and some technological breakthroughs away from being able to operate on purely a clean-energy grid. During that time, we’re going to be using oil. And to the extent that we’re using oil, it makes sense for us to develop our oil and natural gas resources here in the United States and not simply rely on imports.” In the top kill maneuver, a 30,000-horsepower engine aboard a ship injected heavy drill liquids through two narrow flow lines into the stack of pipes and other equipment above the well to push the escaping oil and gas back down below the sea floor. As hour after hour passed after the top kill began early Wednesday afternoon, technicians along with millions of television and Internet viewers watched live video images showing that the dark oil escaping into the gulf waters was giving way to a mud-colored plume. That seemed to be an indication that the heavy liquids known as “drilling mud” were filling the chambers of the blowout preventer, replacing the escaping oil. In the morning, federal officials expressed optimism that all was going well. “The top kill procedure is going as planned, and it is moving along as everyone had hoped,” Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, the leader of the government effort, told CNN. And Robert Dudley, BP’s managing director, said on the “Today” program on NBC that the top kill “was moving the way we want it to.” It was not until late afternoon that BP acknowledged that the operation was not succeeding and that pumping had halted at 11 p.m. Wednesday. After the resumption, Doug Suttles, BP’s chief operating officer for exploration and production, struggled to offer guidance on whether the latest effort was likely to succeed. “It’s quite a roller-coaster,” Mr. Suttles said. “It’s difficult to be optimistic or pessimistic. We have not stopped the flow.” Engineers had feared the top kill was risky because the high-pressure mud could have punctured another gaping hole in the pipes, or dislodged debris clogging the blowout preventer and pipes and intensified the flow. The engineers also said that the problem they encountered was not entirely unexpected, and that they believed that they would ultimately succeed.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/business/28views.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Spill Could Make BP Vulnerable<date>Published: May 27, 2010</date><text>BP is likely to eventually stop the flow of oil from its explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. After that happens, the autopsy of the spill will begin in earnest. But if the information dribbling into the public domain proves correct, the British energy giant will be a weakened creature — so weak it will be vulnerable to a takeover.Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil are almost certainly running the numbers. Government leaders ought to be plotting their strategy, too. The fiasco in the gulf, which killed 11 workers, has shined a new light on BP’s poor safety track record. The current disaster is the company’s third American offense in recent years, coming shortly after the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 workers and the 2006 Prudhoe Bay spill that leaked more than 200,000 gallons into Alaskan waters. The list of problems reflects poorly on management and furthers the impression of a corner-cutting culture that the chief executive, Tony Hayward, had, until recently, been widely credited with improving. The response by BP’s board has been somewhat tepid, with little public support offered to management or guidance provided to shareholders. Add these factors up, fold in the potential cost of cleanup, and it is little wonder that investors have wiped as much as $46 billion off the company’s market value since mid-April. At $141 billion on Thursday, BP’s capitalization is half of Exxon’s and less than the $165 billion value of Shell, which has traditionally traded at a discount to BP. Even before BP’s latest troubles, the arguments for a deal were compelling, largely because of the cost savings that could accrue. Mr. Hayward’s predecessor, John Browne, wrote in his memoirs that BP had aimed for $9 billion in annual synergies from a possible merger with Shell a few years ago. Those would in theory be worth some $60 billion to investors. And though a combination with Shell or BP would be huge, the antitrust implications might not be. The company would control no more than about 6 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves. At a time when nearly 90 percent of the planet’s crude oil is controlled by even larger national energy groups — including Saudi Aramco and Russia’s Gazprom — that kind of scale seems defensible. It might even be viewed as a positive factor in securing Western energy independence from potentially unfriendly oil-rich governments. Some operations in the United States and Britain would probably need to be sold, including refineries and service stations. That was envisioned in the discussions the companies held a few years ago, according to Mr. Browne’s book. But these would account for only a small fraction of the deal’s value. Such wrinkles are tiny compared with BP’s other attractions for a Shell or an Exxon. Though BP has operations worldwide, it has a big footprint in the politically stable areas that the major oil firms increasingly crave. It is the largest producer in the Gulf of Mexico and Britain’s North Sea. And its Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska is still the largest in North America. So what’s stopping Exxon or Shell from pouncing? For starters, there is still no clear indication of what happened on Deepwater Horizon, who was at fault and what it will cost to clean up things. Any responsible acquirer would probably wait for greater clarity on these contingent liabilities before making a move. That could be months away. And though antitrust concerns could be assuaged, the politics could prove trickier. For one, Britain’s new government might object to seeing a former national champion sold to a Texas corporation — even though BP was permitted by American authorities to buy Amoco and Atlantic Richfield in years past. Washington, too, might fear the creation of a company so big it would be difficult for the government to put its “boot on their neck,” to use the language of the interior secretary, Ken Salazar, in relation to BP’s cleanup efforts. A merged BP-Exxon would effectively reconstitute a substantial part of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. But times have changed. In 1911, when the government broke up Standard, oil was a domestic business. Today, private Western members of the oil fraternity operate on a global stage facing well-off competitors. A weakened BP could struggle in that environment anyway. If rivals start circling, the company — and interested governments — may need to contemplate even bigger oil giants.

Broder.PORT FOURCHON, La. — For weeks, it was a disaster in abstraction, a threat floating somewhere out there. Not anymore. In the last week, the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico has revealed itself to an angry and desperate public, smearing tourist beaches, washing onto the shorelines of sleepy coastal communities and oozing into marshy bays that fishermen have worked for generations. It has even announced its arrival on the Louisiana coast with a fittingly ugly symbol: brown pelicans, the state bird, dyed with crude. More than a month has passed since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blew up, spewing immeasurable quantities of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and frustrating all efforts to contain it. The billowing plume of undersea oil and water has thwarted the industry’s well-control efforts and driven government officials to impotent rage. It has demonstrated the enduring laxity of federal regulation of offshore operations and has shown the government to be almost wholly at the mercy of BP, the company leasing the rig, to provide the technology, personnel and equipment to stop the bleeding well. Senators and administration officials visiting the southern Louisiana town of Galliano lashed out again at BP on Monday, saying they were “beyond patience” with the company. The day before, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who early in the crisis vowed to “keep the boot on the neck” of BP, threatened to push the company out of the way. But on Monday, Mr. Salazar backed off, conceding to the reality that BP and the oil companies have access to the best technology to attack the well, a mile below the surface, even though that technology has proved so far to have fallen short of its one purpose. The government’s role, he acknowledged, is largely supervisory and the primary responsibility for the spill, for legal and practical reasons, remains with the company. “The administration has done everything we can possibly do to make sure that we push BP to stop the spill and to contain the impact,” Mr. Salazar said. “We have also been very clear that there are areas where BP and the private sector are the ones who must continue to lead the efforts with government oversight, such as the deployment of private sector technology 5,000 feet below the ocean’s surface to kill the well.” Oil industry experts said they did not take seriously the sporadic threats by the administration that the federal government might have to wrest management of the effort to plug the well from BP. The experts said that the Interior and Energy Departments do not have engineers with more experience in deepwater drilling than those who work for BP and the array of companies that have been brought into the effort to stem the leak. “It’s worse than politics,” said Larry Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which is partly financed by the oil industry. “They have had the authority from Day 1. If they could have handled this situation better, they would have already.” As the verbal warfare between officials and company executives escalated, the slick from the April 20 well blowout continued to spread in billowing rust-colored splotches in the gulf, raising urgent questions about what lay beneath. On land, shrimpers were stuffing their catch into coolers in hopes of having some in store if the season ends altogether. Hotel owners all along the gulf were trying to persuade tourists to keep their vacation plans. But as they looked to BP and the authorities for help, or at least direction, there has only been frustration. “I never thought it would come to this,” said Ryan Lambert, a charter boat operator in Buras, La., who spoke to the federal delegation on Monday. “My guys look to me and say ‘What do I do, boss?’ And I don’t have an answer.” Several things have become clear over the past month. Neither BP nor the government was prepared for an oil release of this size or at this depth. The federal Minerals Management Service, charged with overseeing offshore oil development, has for too long served as a handmaiden of industry. Laws governing deepwater drilling have fallen far behind the technology and the attendant risks. And no one can estimate the extent of the economic and environmental damage, or how long it will last. “Just under 70 miles of our coast have been hit by oil,” said Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a Republican, who criticized the disjointed response effort that he said has allowed oil to come ashore unnecessarily. “Let’s make no mistake that what is at threat here is our way of life.” The crude has been flowing at a rate still unknown nearly a mile below the surface, escaping in quantities far greater than the small amount of oil that has been burned off, collected with booms or sucked from the broken drill pipe lying on the ocean floor.</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/us/06alaska.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Recovery Still Incomplete After Valdez Spill<date>Published: May 5, 2010</date><text>CORDOVA, Alaska — As the oil spill spreads ominously in the Gulf of Mexico, its impact uncertain, communities here beside Prince William Sound are still confronting the consequences of March 24, 1989, the day of the wreck of the Exxon Valdez.The tanker Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil, staining 1,500 miles of coastline, killing hundreds of thousands of seabirds, otters, seals and whales, and devastating local communities. The spill stopped after just a few days. Recovery may not have an end date. Fishing here is far from what it was. Suicides and bankruptcies and bitterness surged. Many people left even as a few became “spillionaires,” getting paid to clean up. A new industry took hold: environmental groups, scientific organizations, experts in the psychological trauma of oil spills. A network of fishermen is now trained and paid by the oil industry to respond if another disaster strikes. Lawyers, fishermen and environmentalists in the gulf are now calling, looking for guidance in areas like how to harness political anger over the spill and the most effective ecological triage. National news crews are chartering planes to nearby islands to see how oil still coats rocks just below the surface all these years later. Fishermen recount once again their complicated journeys from the spill to the payments they received just last year from a punitive damages judgment of about $500 million against Exxon in 1994. People here say they want to move on. “You’ve got one jaded group of people in this town,” Sylvia Lange, who worked her first fishing boat at 14 and now runs a hotel overlooking the water. “First it was the 10th anniversary, then the 20th and now this.” Cordova is a reluctant touchstone, still trying to figure out how to respond to the event that defines it for much of the outside world. This year, officials hope to break ground on an ambitious new museum that will replace the frayed scrapbooks of news clippings that now rest on a table near dugout canoes and tools used for gold mining in a room connected to the local library. “We don’t even have an exhibit about the spill, and yet it’s the most-asked question we get,” said Cathy Sherman, who runs the current museum and library. “Nobody even wanted to be reminded of it here.” Ms. Sherman said the new museum, which has secured about $18 million in financing from the state and other sources, will tell the story of the spill through objects, including a piece of the Valdez hull. But it will also try to show “what we learned,” she added. The lessons continue, even after books and dissertations have been written, documentaries made, songs composed and case studies completed. The mountain views are still stunning but the herring fishery is gone, the king and Dungeness crabs, too. Prawns are coming back, but just barely. The loss of the herring industry over the years since the spill has cost the region about $400 million, said R. J. Kopchak of the Prince William Sound Science Center, although some blame cyclical patterns or other factors for the change, not the spill. Much of a generation chose paths other than fishing, though some younger people have decided to take their chances. Makena O’Toole, 24, said his earliest memory from childhood was of the paralyzing moment his father, a fisherman, heard that the Valdez tanker had crashed into Bligh Reef. Now, even with the famed Copper River sockeye that spawn here, Mr. O’Toole said, “This is still not a place to be a fisherman.” Mr. O’Toole said he plans to move south in September, to fish out of Sitka, where he said the fishery was more abundant “because there wasn’t an oil spill there.” In December, Exxon sent the last of a nearly $500,000 payment to John Platt, but Mr. Platt said he never saw it. Straight to the state and the bank it went, to clear the liens on his boats and his fishing permits, to dig out of the debt he accumulated, some through his own admitted missteps, in the two decades since the wreck of the Valdez. The payments were initially supposed to be much higher, before Exxon successfully fought, all the way to the Supreme Court, to have them reduced. “The money was supposed to bring closure,” Mr. Platt said. “Deep down inside I was really banking on it, but it didn’t happen.” Most people received far less money than Mr. Platt and other fishermen who were able to document strong catches in the years before the spill. Others opted out of the sprawling class-action suit. Ms. Lange said her family dropped out of the suit and moved to western Alaska to work in the fishing industry there for several years after the spill. “We made the conscious decision that we were no longer going to be victims,” she said. “I could see my whole life going into the spill.” Empathy is high here for those closest to the spill in the gulf. Perhaps economic disaster still can be averted, some say. Maybe the fact that the Gulf Coast is so much more accessible than Prince William Sound will help. Maybe its economies will prove diverse enough to handle whatever hit comes. Maybe the warmer water will help disperse the oil. Maybe the fact that, unlike here, the oil spilling in the gulf is being emulsified somewhat as it rises from 5,000 feet below. But most people here said they thought that at least some communities in the gulf would begin a painful journey with no clear conclusion. Two years ago, Mike Webber, a fisherman here who also does native carvings, unveiled a “shame pole” he had made to protest Exxon’s actions during and after the spill. The pole depicted dead eagles, herring with lesions, the head of an Exxon executive, upside down. Now, Mr. Webber said, “People keep telling me to do a healing pole, but I can’t come up with any characters for it.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E7DF113FF937A35756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=exxonmobilcorporation">NEWS ANALYSIS; Bad. But an Apocalypse?<date>Published: May 4, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON -- The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is bad -- no one would dispute it. But just how bad? Some experts have been quick to predict apocalypse, painting grim pictures of 1,000 miles of irreplaceable wetlands and beaches at risk, fisheries damaged for seasons, fragile species wiped out and a region and an industry economically crippled for years. President Obama has called the spill ''a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.'' And some scientists have suggested that the oil might hitch a ride on the loop current in the gulf, bringing havoc to the Atlantic Coast. Yet the Deepwater Horizon blowout is not unprecedented, nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history. And its ultimate impact will depend on a long list of interlinked variables, including the weather, ocean currents, the properties of the oil involved and the success or failure of the frantic efforts to stanch the flow and remediate its effects. As one expert put it, this is the first inning of a nine-inning game. No one knows the final score. The ruptured well, currently pouring an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the gulf, could flow for years and still not begin to approach the 36 billion gallons of oil spilled by retreating Iraqi forces when they left Kuwait in 1991. It is not yet close to the magnitude of the Ixtoc I blowout in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico in 1979, which spilled an estimated 140 million gallons of crude before the gusher could be stopped. And it will have to get much worse before it approaches the impact of the Exxon Valdez accident of 1989, which contaminated 1,300 miles of largely untouched shoreline and killed tens of thousands of seabirds, otters and seals along with 250 eagles and 22 killer whales. No one, not even the oil industry's most fervent apologists, is making light of this accident. The contaminated area of the gulf continues to spread, and oil has been found in some of the fragile marshes at the tip of Louisiana. The beaches and coral reefs of the Florida Keys could be hit if the slick is captured by the gulf's clockwise loop current. But on Monday, the wind was pushing the slick in the opposite direction, away from the current. The worst effects of the spill have yet to be felt. And if efforts to contain the oil are even partly successful and the weather cooperates, the worst could be avoided. ''Right now what people are fearing has not materialized,'' said Edward B. Overton, professor emeritus of environmental science at Louisiana State University and an expert on oil spills. ''People have the idea of an Exxon Valdez, with a gunky, smelly black tide looming over the horizon waiting to wash ashore. I do not anticipate this will happen down here unless things get a lot worse.'' Dr. Overton said he was hopeful that efforts by BP to place containment structures over the leaking parts of the well will succeed, although he said it was a difficult task that could actually make things worse by damaging undersea pipes. Other experts said that while the potential for catastrophe remained, there were reasons to remain guardedly optimistic. ''The sky is not falling,'' said Quenton R. Dokken, a marine biologist and the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, a conservation group in Corpus Christi, Tex. ''We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.'' Engineers said the type of oil pouring out is lighter than the heavy crude spilled by the Exxon Valdez, evaporates more quickly and is easier to burn. It also appears to respond to the use of dispersants, which break up globs of oil and help them sink. The oil is still capable of significant damage, particularly when it is churned up with water and forms a sort of mousse that floats and can travel long distances. Jacqueline Savitz, a senior scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit environmental group, said that much of the damage was already taking place far offshore and out of sight of surveillance aircraft and research vessels.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EEDC153AF933A05757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Higher Oil Prices Raise Profits For Exxon and ConocoPhillips<date>Published: April 30, 2010</date><text>Higher oil prices raised quarterly profits for the Exxon Mobil Corporation and ConocoPhillips, but Exxon's earnings were hurt by weak refinery performance, higher-than-expected exploration costs and recently enacted health care legislation. Exxon's earnings fell below Wall Street forecasts, in stark contrast to BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which both exceeded market expectations when they released quarterly figures this week. Oil prices averaged nearly $79 a barrel in the first quarter, about $3 more than the previous quarter and sharply higher than the $43 average of the first quarter of 2009. That strength offset weak margins from Exxon and Conoco's refinery operations, which have been hurt by slow demand for fuels like gasoline and diesel because of the soft global economy. A steady rebound in many regions, however, is expected to pull up fuel demand later this year. ''Our results reflect higher crude oil realizations and stronger chemical margins while the downstream industry margins remained weak,'' Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday. Exxon's profit in the quarter rose 38 percent to $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a share. Wall Street analysts had expected Exxon to report a profit of $1.41 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Jason Gammel, oil analyst at Macquarie Research, characterized Exxon's first-quarter profit as a ''pretty big miss,'' and attributed the bulk of the shortfall to Exxon's accrual for the health care legislation. A charge the company took against the health care legislation cut earnings by $200 million, or about 4 cents a share. The company's oil equivalent production rose 4.5 percent from a year ago, helped by its liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar, it said. But Exxon's downstream arm, which includes its refining and marketing operations, posted profits of $37 million, well off the $1.1 billion it earned a year ago. Shares of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., fell 53 cents, to $68.66. Conoco's profits rose to $2.1 billion, or $1.40 a share, from $800 million, or 54 cents a share, but oil and gas output in terms of oil equivalent per day during the quarter fell to 1.83 million barrels, from 1.93 million barrels a year earlier. Revenue rose to $45.8 billion, from $31.2 billion. Conoco, which is in the middle of a plan to shore up returns and reduce debt by selling $10 billion in assets, said in its conference call that it expected oil and gas output to be lower for the next several quarters. Shares of Conoco, which is based in Houston, rose 55 cents, to $59.10. Conoco's chief executive, Jim Mulva, said the company may increase its 2010 spending plan from about $11 billion to $12 billion, with investments in assets like the Eagleford and Bakken Shales that bring higher returns.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/business/global/18views.html?ref=exxonmobilcorporation">Barrels in Reserve but Harder to Get<date>Published: February 17, 2010</date><text>With oil majors given the cold shoulder in many developing countries, it is no mean feat that Exxon Mobil managed to replace 100 percent of last year’s production with new reserves.

And clearing the crucial 100 percent hurdle by S.E.C. standards should be child’s play in 2010. With reserves of more than two billion barrels of oil equivalent, Exxon’s latest acquisition, XTO Energy, will replace more than a year of Exxon’s output at a stroke.

Recent reserve additions have been in politically placid areas, notably Canada and Australia. But economic risks may offset fewer political ones.

Hopes are high that cleaner-burning natural gas will grow in popularity. The trouble is that gas still trades at a discount to its liquid cousin crude, especially in the United States, where it is worth about half the price of a barrel of oil. Liquids, about 57 percent of Exxon’s reserves 10 years ago, are now just half, according to IHS Herold. And squeezing energy from oil sands, an increasingly important source for Exxon, is often economical only when oil trades above $60 a barrel. Conventional wells are generally profitable at just half that level. Exxon has done well in replacing reserves. But investors would be wise to focus on the nature, as well as the number, of Exxon’s replacement barrels. No Van Buren Several American states have a variant of Greek flu. While they don’t have imbalances on the scale afflicting Greece, some states’ weak fiscal management has been badly exposed by the downturn. Defaults aren’t unthinkable. But as with the European Union’s backing for Greece, the federal government would probably ride to the rescue. States in America are far more economically integrated than the euro zone economies, where a lower degree of integration means major imbalances can develop. For instance, during the boom, wage costs in Greece and Spain grew much more rapidly than in Germany, without corresponding increases in productivity, making those countries uncompetitive. Something similar happened in the early United States, leading to the defaults of eight states in the downturn of 1837-43. Further, all states except Vermont must balance their budgets, requiring tax increases and spending cuts during recessions, particularly late in recessions when contingency funds have been spent. European Union governments’ budgets aren’t constrained in that way and are much larger in relation to their economies. Consequently, more significant deficits can accumulate. For instance, Greece’s 2009 budget deficit was 13 percent of its gross domestic product, while California’s projected 2011 financing gap of $14.4 billion is only 0.8 percent of 2008 gross state product. Even Nevada’s projected gap, while 55 percent of the 2010 state budget, is only 1.3 percent of its gross state product in 2008. Nevertheless, states do have serious financial problems, and the fiscal history of some of them, including California, Illinois and New Jersey, is replete with opaque accounting and fanciful budgeting, also seen in Greece. Moreover, states like Michigan and Rhode Island have experienced prolonged recessions. Only one state has defaulted during the 20th century: Arkansas in 1933. But with today’s stresses, the potential is there again. The market effect would be severe, particularly as one default could set the dominoes falling.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » Exxon, the top Western oil company, took advantage of the weak climate to bolster its operations, buying smaller rivals and attractive assets as it sought to lay the foundation for growth once the economy rebounds. In December, it announced the $31 billion purchase of XTO Energy, a leader in natural gas production in the United States. It gained a major foothold in Iraq, the holder of the third-biggest proven oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Iran. In Africa, it bid $4 billion for a major field off Ghana. It approved a multibillion-dollar project in Papua New Guinea to export gas to China and Japan. The plan follows Exxon’s longstanding strategy of investing during market declines. Because of its substantial cash reserves, the company spent a record $27.1 billion on its exploration and development programs last year, a 4 percent increase from 2008. While most of its big rivals have been restructuring and cutting expenses, Exxon has repeatedly said that it would stick with plans to spend $25 billion to $30 billion a year over the next few years to develop new supplies. Still, like most major oil companies, Exxon was hurt by lower oil prices, and a drop in demand for oil and refined fuels as consumers cut spending and businesses shed jobs. In the fourth quarter, Exxon Mobil’s profit dropped 23 percent, to $6.05 billion, or $1.27 a share, compared with $7.82 billion, or $1.54 a share, in the period a year ago. The earnings, however, beat analysts’ expectations, helping drive up shares, which rose 2.72 percent on Monday, to $66.18. Revenue was up 6 percent, to $89.84 billion in the quarter. “The industry trends in 2009 reflect a challenging environment over all,” the company’s vice president for investor relations, David Rosenthal, said during a conference call. “Certainly a tough year. Tough for everyone. But we feel our competitive strengths have helped us a bit.” In 2008, Exxon became the world’s most profitable corporation with earnings over $45 billion as oil averaged $100 a barrel. Last year, its profit dropped 57 percent, to $19.28 billion. The company was also displaced by PetroChina as the world’s largest publicly traded company by market value, according to yearly rankings by PFC Energy, a consulting firm. Oil prices, which collapsed when the financial crisis began, have since regained ground and settled above $74 a barrel on Monday in New York. Exxon’s oil production averaged 2.39 million barrels a day in 2009, essentially flat from 2008 as lower output from mature fields was offset by increases from new projects in Qatar. Gas production grew 2 percent and averaged 9.3 billion cubic feet a day. The plans to buy XTO, which are subject to approval, reflected Exxon’s enthusiasm for unconventional gas resources, where reserves have swelled because of innovations in producing gas from a type of rock called shale. The estimated reserves in the United States are now expected to last more than 100 years at current consumption rates. Exxon has been building a global portfolio of shale reserves in the United States, Germany, Hungary and Canada in recent years. It hopes that XTO’s drilling expertise will help it expand its gas production rapidly. Exxon was also the first American company to gain access to Iraq’s oil fields after winning the bidding for the West Qurna Phase 1 field with Royal Dutch Shell. The companies pledged to increase the field’s output to 2.325 million barrels a day, up from 279,000 barrels a day. Few countries offer oil companies as much potential growth as Iraq does. That explains why foreign companies, which initially complained about the Iraqi government’s onerous terms, have all agreed to slash their profits in exchange for access to the country’s reserves. Exxon beat a group led by the Russian giant Lukoil that included ConocoPhillips, and another led by the China National Petroleum Corporation. It will receive $1.90 for each barrel of extra production from the field, less than half of the $4 a barrel that Exxon had originally bid. The field holds 8.7 billion barrels in proven oil reserves. For most oil companies, the last year has been tough. On Friday, Chevron disappointed analysts with a forecast that its oil and gas production would grow just 1 percent this year, much less than expected. The lackluster forecast illustrates the difficulty some of the world’s biggest oil companies are having as they try to expand output. Chevron’s fourth-quarter profit dropped 37 percent, to $3.07 billion. Separately, Shell said on Monday that it had signed an agreement with Cosan to form an ethanol joint venture in Brazil valued at $12 billion. Both companies will contribute some of their existing Brazilian assets to the venture, and Shell would, in addition, contribute a $1.625 billion in cash over two years. Shell reports its earnings later this week.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » Exxon, the top Western oil company, took advantage of the weak climate to bolster its operations, buying smaller rivals and attractive assets as it sought to lay the foundation for growth once the economy rebounds. In December, it announced the $31 billion purchase of XTO Energy, a leader in natural gas production in the United States. It gained a major foothold in Iraq, the holder of the third-biggest proven oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Iran. In Africa, it bid $4 billion for a major field off Ghana. It approved a multibillion-dollar project in Papua New Guinea to export gas to China and Japan. The plan follows Exxon’s longstanding strategy of investing during market declines. Because of its substantial cash reserves, the company spent a record $27.1 billion on its exploration and development programs last year, a 4 percent increase from 2008. While most of its big rivals have been restructuring and cutting expenses, Exxon has repeatedly said that it would stick with plans to spend $25 billion to $30 billion a year over the next few years to develop new supplies. Still, like most major oil companies, Exxon was hurt by lower oil prices, and a drop in demand for oil and refined fuels as consumers cut spending and businesses shed jobs. In the fourth quarter, Exxon Mobil’s profit dropped 23 percent, to $6.05 billion, or $1.27 a share, compared with $7.82 billion, or $1.54 a share, in the period a year ago. The earnings, however, beat analysts’ expectations, helping drive up shares, which rose 2.72 percent on Monday, to $66.18. Revenue was up 6 percent, to $89.84 billion in the quarter. “The industry trends in 2009 reflect a challenging environment over all,” the company’s vice president for investor relations, David Rosenthal, said during a conference call. “Certainly a tough year. Tough for everyone. But we feel our competitive strengths have helped us a bit.” In 2008, Exxon became the world’s most profitable corporation with earnings over $45 billion as oil averaged $100 a barrel. Last year, its profit dropped 57 percent, to $19.28 billion. The company was also displaced by PetroChina as the world’s largest publicly traded company by market value, according to yearly rankings by PFC Energy, a consulting firm. Oil prices, which collapsed when the financial crisis began, have since regained ground and settled above $74 a barrel on Monday in New York. Exxon’s oil production averaged 2.39 million barrels a day in 2009, essentially flat from 2008 as lower output from mature fields was offset by increases from new projects in Qatar. Gas production grew 2 percent and averaged 9.3 billion cubic feet a day. The plans to buy XTO, which are subject to approval, reflected Exxon’s enthusiasm for unconventional gas resources, where reserves have swelled because of innovations in producing gas from a type of rock called shale. The estimated reserves in the United States are now expected to last more than 100 years at current consumption rates. Exxon has been building a global portfolio of shale reserves in the United States, Germany, Hungary and Canada in recent years. It hopes that XTO’s drilling expertise will help it expand its gas production rapidly. Exxon was also the first American company to gain access to Iraq’s oil fields after winning the bidding for the West Qurna Phase 1 field with Royal Dutch Shell. The companies pledged to increase the field’s output to 2.325 million barrels a day, up from 279,000 barrels a day. Few countries offer oil companies as much potential growth as Iraq does.

The deal will significant expand Shell’s Brazilian ethanol operations and follows in the footsteps of rival BP, which in 2008 took a stake in a Brazilian biofuel project and unveiled $1 billion in investments. Shares of Cosan jumped more than 6 percent in Sao Paulo, while Shell rose nearly 1 percent in London. “It’s a vote of confidence from an oil major for the Brazilian ethanol industry — one of the most ecological and sustainable alternative fuels,” Jonathan Kingsman, managing director of Kingsman, a Swiss ethanol and sugar consulting firm, told Reuters. “I expect more interest from the oil companies in Brazilian ethanol, both in production and distribution,” he added. The deal will extend Cosan’s fuel distribution business in Brazil after the company took over Exxon Mobil‘s Esso unit in 2008 for nearly $1 billion. Cosan last month also agreed to buy a local chain of filling stations called Petrosul for an undisclosed sum. Oil companies and major global investors have been searching for partnerships in Brazil’s ethanol sector, which is still largely dominated by family firms with complex ownership structures. Shell has been looking for opportunities in Brazil’s ethanol industry for years. Bunge struck a deal in December to buy sugar and ethanol producer Moema for $452 million, while French commodities company Louis Dreyfus said in October that it would take over Santelisa Vale for an undisclosed sum. Cosan said the Shell deal would help it gain greater access to Brazil’s thriving ethanol retail market as the combined company would be the country’s third-largest fuel distributor, with 4,500 filling stations around the country. The combined entity will have about 40 billion reais in annual sales, Cosan’s chief financial officer, Marcelo Martins, said on a conference call with analysts and investors. Cosan said it had 180 days to discuss the nonbinding memorandum of understanding exclusively with Shell International Petroleum Company. As part of the transaction, Cosan will transfer its sugar, ethanol, fuel distribution and energy generation business to the merged entity, with assets valued at $4.93 billion and debt of $2.52 billion. Cosan said Shell would contribute its retail fuel and aviation distribution business and inject about $1.63 billion into the merged company in up to two years. Cosan will contribute another $300 million in cash over five years. Cosan and Shell will have the option of buying each other’s stake in the venture after 10 years, with the price to be determined at the time of purchase.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Royal Dutch Shell Plc ConocoPhillips Inc Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » The $15.4 billion Mackenzie Valley project, which involves Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, would connect natural gas fields in the Arctic with the rest of Canada and potentially with the United States. Some Indian communities and environmental groups have called the 750-mile pipeline a threat to local species and native cultures and have expressed concern about the greenhouse emissions created if the gas is used to heat and upgrade oil sands into usable fuels. Greenhouse emissions from oil sands are substantially higher than from conventional oil and gas production. But the joint review panel, after five years of study, concluded late Wednesday that the project “would deliver valuable and lasting overall benefits and avoid significant adverse environmental impacts.” It continued, “The project itself, as long-term infrastructure, provides a key basis for future economic development.” The National Energy Board and federal cabinet still need to approve the project, but they are expected to follow the recommendations of the review panel. The board is scheduled to hold hearings in April. If the project is approved, the oil companies would then have to decide whether to build the pipeline, given the current low gas prices, the prospects for competing gas fields in western Canada and the uncertainty of financial support from the Canadian government. Furthermore, a competing and also delayed gas pipeline project in Alaska might overtake the Canadian project. “If the oil companies think prices are firming on gas, they will go ahead with this,” said Donald Hertzmark, a consultant who advises energy companies on international projects. “It could still be important for the United States and Canada, especially if gas takes off as a transportation fuel or if environmental issues slow down or derail the development of shale gas resources.” The oil companies originally filed applications for the project in 2004, and hoped to begin operations five years later. But the review panel took longer than expected to complete its study. Now gas industry experts say operations could start in 2014 at the earliest. The review panel, which assessed the environmental and socioeconomic impacts, concluded that the pipeline would not harm fish in the Mackenzie River. But it called for regional planning to protect many species including polar bears, caribou and beluga whales. It also recommended that the gas be used to replace coal-fired electrical generation to control greenhouse gas emissions that have been linked to global climate change. The three gas fields that the pipeline would connect have reserves that are estimated at six trillion cubic feet  an amount equal to more than two years of total Canadian consumption of gas. The pipeline would initially supply about one billion cubic feet a day, which could be expanded after future offshore and onshore drilling. The United States Energy Department has projected that Canadian annual gas consumption will increase from 3.3 trillion cubic feet in 2006 to 4.7 trillion cubic feet in 2030, largely because of the expanding needs of the oil sands industry. Production in Canada’s conventional natural gas fields have been in decline, along with exports to the United States.

Skip to next paragraph Charles Pertwee/Bloomberg News Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which is acquiring XTO Energy. Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp ConocoPhillips Inc Deutsche Bank AG Go to your Portfolio » Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, appears already to have side-stepped Conoco’s pivotal error: timing. Just a day after the Burlington deal was announced, gas prices hit a record $15.78 per thousand cubic feet.

Fast forward a few years and natural gas trades at roughly a third of its peak price in 2005. Saddled with debt taken on to buy Burlington, Conoco is now trying to dispose of $10 billion of assets in what appears to be a buyer’s market. The deal ultimately led to more than $30 billion in write-downs for Conoco, by Deutsche Bank’s tally. Contrast that with Exxon’s swoop on XTO. Even including Exxon’s healthy premium, XTO shares are still more than 30 percent below their June 2008 high. Meanwhile, XTO’s shrewd hedging will shield Exxon from the grim outlook for gas prices at least until 2011, by which time demand may have picked up. Infelicitous timing isn’t the only factor that sabotaged the Burlington deal. Conoco failed to keep key managers like Randy Limbacher, the highly regarded chief operating officer, and the heads of production in the United States and Canada. Many of them drifted back to independent explorers. By setting up a separate unconventional gas unit at XTO’s home base in Fort Worth, Tex., Exxon seems determined not to squeeze out talent. In any event, given Exxon’s track record in the industry, it seems odd that investors are not giving its management the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, they can thank Conoco for handing them some valuable lessons in what not to do. A Lehman Ruling Lehman Brothers’ creditors are being sorted into haves and have-nots. Fifteen months after the investment bank collapsed, London’s High Court has ruled that cash held on behalf of clients can be returned only if it was properly segregated from Lehman’s own money. Clients whose money should have been separated, but wasn’t, have been left out in the cold. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the firm administering the bankruptcy of Lehman’s British arm, has identified $2.1 billion of cash that was definitely ring-fenced. But former clients and affiliates of Lehman argued that a further $3 billion should have been segregated under the British financial regulator’s rules. That claim has been dismissed. A collection of hedge funds that lost out will appeal. If they fail, they will have to join the queue of unsecured creditors. Goldman Sachs and the hedge fund firm GLG Partners are among the winners from the ruling. It is not clear whether that was a result of luck or shrewd renegotiation of their agreements with Lehman as it got into trouble. The fact that two of Europe’s most powerful fund managers have ended up on the right side of the judgment suggests the latter. But even clients whose money was properly segregated may not be repaid in full. PricewaterhouseCoopers has warned of a $1 billion shortfall if German administrators refuse to release funds transferred to Lehman’s German subsidiary shortly before its demise. The Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, does not emerge well from this episode. It had rules in place that should have protected client money, but they were not properly enforced. Still, there are encouraging signs that the British authorities have learned from the Lehman events.

Project in Papua New Guinea<date>Published: December 8, 2009</date><text>MELBOURNE — Exxon Mobil and its partners approved Tuesday the development of a $15 billion liquefied natural gas venture in Papua New Guinea to supply fuel to China, Japan and Taiwan. The project is to be the country’s biggest natural resource development. Construction is to begin in 2010 after the companies complete agreements with their customers and financing arrangements with lenders, said Exxon, which is the largest U.S. oil company. The project will probably award five construction contracts worth “several billion dollars” within two days, according to Oil Search, a partner in the venture based in Papua New Guinea’s capital, Port Moresby. The plant is one of more than 12 planned in Australia and Papua New Guinea to meet growing Asian demand for less-polluting alternatives to coal and oil. The project could double the size of Papua New Guinea’s economy, Oil Search estimates. “We are seeing a move to gas,” said Peter Arden, a senior mining analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase, in Melbourne. “China can’t meet its energy needs. Countries are also trying to diversify away from coal.” L.N.G. sales from the project are expected to exceed $100 billion over 20 years, said Tony Regan, a consultant at Tri-Zen International. The partners have not disclosed financial terms of supply agreements. Asian demand for the gas is driving the development of projects in the region. Chevron and Tokyo Electric Power said last week that the Japanese utility had agreed to buy L.N.G. for 20 years from the proposed Wheatstone project in Western Australia. Wheatstone is among the ventures that could make Australia “the Saudi Arabia” of the gas world, the country’s energy minister, Martin Ferguson, said Tuesday. He said the Tokyo Electric agreement could be worth 90 billion Australian dollars, or $82 billion. In September, Chevron and two partners, Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell, approved construction of their 43 billion dollar Gorgon venture, also in Western Australia. Exxon and its Papua New Guinea partners will build a plant near Port Moresby with capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of the fuel a year. Gas will be piped 710 kilometers, or 441 miles, from fields in Papua New Guinea’s highlands for processing into liquid form and transportation by ship to Asian customers. Fuel exports are scheduled to begin by late 2013 or 2014. The partners said they must sign off on agreements with customers and lenders. “We wouldn’t be progressing this without a high level of certainty,” Peter Botten, managing director of Oil Search, said during a conference call Tuesday. “We’re extremely confident the remaining aspects will come into place.” The project will triple Papua New Guinea’s exports and more than double its gross domestic product, Oil Search said in a statement. The country of 6.2 million, whose people speak more than 800 languages, has a gross domestic product of $8.2 billion, according to the World Bank. About 40 percent of the population lives in poverty, with income of less than $1 a day, according to AusAID, the Australian government agency responsible for managing overseas aid. Its economic growth was 6.5 percent in 2007 and 6.6 percent in 2008, AusAID says. Exxon’s partners in the venture are Oil Search, with a 29 percent stake; Santos, based in Adelaide, Australia, with 13.5 percent; and Nippon Oil, with 4.7 percent. Exxon has a 33.2 percent, the Papua New Guinea government owns 16.6 percent and landowners own 2.8 percent.

The plunge in profits occurred amid a recovery in oil prices, which had fallen as low as $34 a barrel in December from their peak of $147 a barrel last summer. On Thursday, oil closed at $79.87 a barrel in New York trading, up $2.41. The rebound has been a relief for producers. While prices remain historically high, the industry has been squeezed because of investment decisions made while oil was rising. Today, few petroleum executives imagine returning to a world where oil trades at $20 a barrel, the average throughout the 1990s. In fact, a level of $65 to $75 a barrel is increasingly viewed as a new minimum for the industry. If prices settle below that range, many oil executives say they will find it difficult to expand production or invest in new exploration projects. While most of its big competitors have been restructuring operations and cutting expenses, Exxon said it would stick with its plans to spend $25 billion to $30 billion a year over the next few years to develop new energy supplies. The company said that its profits in the third quarter declined 68 percent, to $4.73 billion, or 98 cents a share, falling short of analysts’ expectations. That compared with earnings of $14.83 billion a year ago, the company’s best quarter. “We’re not in a panic mode,” said Kenneth P. Cohen, Exxon’s vice president for public affairs, in a conference call with reporters. Exxon became the world’s most profitable corporation in 2008, earning $45 billion as oil averaged $100 a barrel. Exxon’s shares traded down for much of the day on Thursday after the company’s profit came in below forecasts of $1.06 a share. But the stock ended the day up 12 cents at $73.96. Exxon posted a loss at its American refining business for the second consecutive quarter. The company said that its spending in the quarter fell by 5 percent compared with last year, to $6.5 billion. Its oil and gas production in the period rose by 3 percent. “Despite ongoing global economic weakness and reduced demand for products, we continued our robust investment program and delivered strong results,” Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Shell’s net income fell to $3.25 billion from $8.45 billion in the same period last year. In London, Shell shares fell 55 pence, or 2.9 percent, to 1,856 pence. “We see some indications that energy demand and pricing are improving but the outlook remains very uncertain, and we are not expecting a quick recovery,” Peter Voser, Shell’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. Shell has outlined a sharp cost-cutting program in recent months. It is eliminating 5,000 jobs, about 10 percent of its work force, and merging some units. The company said that as part of its restructuring efforts, it would take a charge in the fourth quarter that might total “several hundred millions of dollars” because of the job cuts. The company said it had reduced operating costs by about $1 billion in the first nine months of the year. Similar efforts are already paying off at BP, the British oil giant. The company reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday after beating its own cost-reduction targets and increasing output. Higher oil prices in recent years meant that oil companies increased their spending on more expensive exploration efforts, such as oil sands, to increase production. They were also forced to raise spending as costs throughout the industry doubled from 2004 to 2008. But as prices fell, oil majors as well as independent producers across the country have struggled to adapt. They have capped wells that have become uneconomical, for example, and in Canada, heavy oil projects have been put on hold. While oil prices have dropped 45 percent since their peak last summer, costs have fallen by only 15 to 20 percent since last year’s peak, said Patrick de la Chevardière, chief financial officer of the French oil giant Total. Conoco Phillips, for example, said it would reduce its capital expenses by 12 percent next year, and planned to sell assets worth $10 billion over the next two years. Conoco said on Wednesday that its third-quarter profits fell 71 percent, to $1.5 billion. Eni, the giant Italian oil company, slashed its dividend by 23 percent over the summer, in part to protect its spending program, but the move stunned investors who have long been accustomed to the industry’s policy of paying high dividends. Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, will report earnings on Friday. The picture is not entirely grim. Companies have made large discoveries this year. BP announced a major offshore find in the Gulf of Mexico last month, while Anadarko Petroleum and its partners said they had identified a major offshore petroleum basin running from Ghana to Sierra Leone. But oil companies must run faster just to stand still. More than 3.5 million barrels a day of new capacity must be added each year to offset the normal decline of old fields around the world. Some of that can be done by stimulating existing fields to pump more oil; some by investing in new capacity in already-discovered reserves, such as in Saudi Arabia; and some through well-head exploration.

The city had sought $250 million in damages to finance construction of a treatment plant to make the water in five wells in southeastern Queens drinkable. But lawyers for the city called the jury’s decision a “total victory” for their side. Dozens of similar cases are pending against oil companies nationwide over the contamination of groundwater by the additive M.T.B.E., which is highly soluble in water and has leaked from underground storage tanks across the country. The city’s lead lawyer, Vic Sher, hailed the decision. “It sends a clear signal that juries have no tolerance for big oil companies whose products pollute drinking water and that these companies have an obligation to take steps to make sure this kind of pollution doesn’t happen,” said Mr. Sher, whose San Francisco firm is handling several of the cases brought by cities and water suppliers in other states. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil, Kevin M. Allexon, said company officials were disappointed and were exploring “all our legal options.” Exxon Mobil lawyers have denied that the company was responsible and pointed at other sources of contamination. “We do not believe we should be required to compensate the City of New York for someone else’s contamination,” Mr. Allexon said. But the jury, which had been hearing the case since August and had already found against Exxon in two earlier stages of the trial, determined that Exxon knew of the potential for groundwater contamination when it added M.T.B.E. to gasoline and failed to warn government agencies, gas station owners and the public about the danger. Like ethanol, M.T.B.E., or methyl tertiary butyl ether, helps gasoline burn more cleanly and reduces tailpipe emissions. But the Environmental Protection Agency says M.T.B.E. can make water undrinkable because of its taste and odor. There is limited data on its health effects on humans, but it is considered a carcinogen in high doses in animals, and 25 states, including New York, now ban or restrict its use. In 2003 the city sued 23 oil companies over M.T.B.E. contamination from fuel leaks from gas station storage tanks. It reached settlements totaling $15 million with all of the companies except for Exxon. The jury, which heard the case before Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sought in its deliberations to calculate what percentage of fault Exxon bore compared with other oil companies that also polluted the groundwater. Exxon lawyers contended that extra warnings about the risks of M.T.B.E. were not necessary and said that the wells were contaminated by other industry. City officials said the money would go toward installing and upgrading water treatment stations to remove M.T.B.E. and make drinking water available to Queens residents when parts of the upstate reservoir system that supplies the city’s water are out of service during repairs, droughts and other emergencies. Some environmental groups said the verdict was good news for consumers because ratepayers would not have to bear the cost of cleaning the water. “Particularly in view of recent increases in water rates, the decision could have a significant beneficial impact on ratepayers,” said Eric Goldstein, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. In a statement, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, “Our water supply is one of our most vital resources, and we will work to protect it and go after those who damage it.” More Articles in Science » A version of this article appeared in print on October 20, 2009, on page A27 of the New York edition.A federal jury on Monday found Exxon Mobil liable for contaminating groundwater in New York City and awarded the city $104.7 million in compensatory damages.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » A blog about energy, the environment and the bottom line. Go to Blog » Exxon’s acquisition of 23.49 percent of the Jubilee oil field underscored the interest that energy companies have shown in the 700 miles of Western African coastline that stretches from Sierra Leone to Ghana. Last month, the Italian oil giant Eni agreed to buy two fields off Ghana from the Vitol Group, a major oil-trading firm. The Jubilee stake, which was owned by Kosmos Energy, a company based in Dallas and backed by major private equity firms, had attracted several companies and had started a bidding war between international and state-owned players, including Chinese companies. But in a letter sent to the other bidders on Monday, Kosmos said it had “entered into a binding agreement with an exclusive bidder,” said the person, who declined to be identified because the negotiations were private. Because of higher oil prices since the beginning of the decade, companies have increased their spending on exploration. While major companies like Exxon have focused on developing large oil and gas projects, much of the riskier and more prospective exploration has been undertaken by smaller, independent producers like Anadarko Petroleum, Tullow Oil and Kosmos. Last month, for example, Anadarko announced that it had made a major discovery after drilling the first deepwater well off the coast of Sierra Leone. The company, along with Tullow Oil, owns the rest of the Jubilee field. Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, said that Exxon was paying a steep price for the reserves at a time when oil companies were struggling to gain access to resources in traditional regions, like Russia or Venezuela. Exxon needs to find 1.5 billion barrels of reserves each year to replace the oil and gas it pumps annually. “The world is getting smaller in terms of access,” Mr. Gheit said. “And Exxon has to run harder just to stay in place.” A representative from Kosmos did not return calls or respond to e-mail messages seeking comment. Exxon also declined to comment about its bid. “Exxon Mobil routinely evaluates potential development opportunities around the world,” Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon, said. Kosmos, along with Anadarko and Tullow, have been particularly successful in Ghana where they have found oil in all of the eight wells they drilled in recent years. The partners have found four major fields  Jubilee, Odum, Tweneboa and Mahogany  and have identified four more potential prospects. Jubilee, which was discovered in 2007, should start producing oil by the end of next year, and is expected to eventually pump about 120,000 barrels a day. Kosmos has estimated that Jubilee could hold recoverable oil and gas reserves of as much as two billion barrels. That puts the field in the same class of discoveries that have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years. The purchase also guarantees a big payday for the private equity companies that own Kosmos  Warburg Pincus, with 55 percent, and the Blackstone Group, with 45 percent. Since 2004, Blackstone and Warburg have invested $1.1 billion in Kosmos. The acquisition still requires approval from the government of Ghana.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Oil and Gasoline Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp BP Plc Go to your Portfolio » A blog about energy, the environment and the bottom line. Go to Blog » These discoveries, spanning five continents, are the result of hefty investments that began earlier in the decade when oil prices rose, and of new technologies that allow explorers to drill at greater depths and break tougher rocks. “That’s the wonderful thing about price signals in a free market  it puts people in a better position to take more exploration risk,” said James T. Hackett, chairman and chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum. More than 200 discoveries have been reported so far this year in dozens of countries, including northern Iraq’s Kurdish region, Australia, Israel, Iran, Brazil, Norway, Ghana and Russia. They have been made by international giants, like Exxon Mobil, but also by industry minnows, like Tullow Oil. Just this month, BP said that it found a giant deepwater field that might turn out to be the biggest oil discovery ever in the Gulf of Mexico, while Anadarko announced a large find in an “exciting and highly prospective” region off Sierra Leone. It is normal for companies to discover billions of barrels of new oil every year, but this year’s pace is unusually brisk. New oil discoveries have totaled about 10 billion barrels in the first half of the year, according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If discoveries continue at that pace through year-end, they are likely to reach the highest level since 2000. While recent years have featured speculation about a coming peak and subsequent decline in oil production, people in the industry say there is still plenty of oil in the ground, especially beneath the ocean floor, even if finding and extracting it is becoming harder. They say that prices and the pace of technological improvement remain the principal factors governing oil production capacity. While the industry is celebrating the recent discoveries, many executives are anxious about the immediate future, fearing that lower prices might jeopardize their exploration drive. The world economy is weak, oil prices have tumbled from last year’s records, corporate profits have shrunk, and global demand for oil remains low. After falling to $34 in December, oil prices have doubled, stabilizing near $70 a barrel. But if the world economy does not pick up, some analysts believe the price could fall again. Oil companies contend that is not a prospect they can afford. Despite reaping record profits in recent years, many executives have warned that they need prices above $60 a barrel to develop the world’s more challenging reserves. In fact, some exploration activity has already slowed this year, as producers seek better terms from service companies and contractors. It is not just oil that is benefiting from the exploration boom. Repsol, Spain’s biggest oil company, said this month that it had discovered what could turn out to be Venezuela’s biggest natural gas field. In recent years, companies have found substantial natural gas reserves in the United States, from shale rocks once believed to be impossible to drill. “The No. 1 question that exploration teams have right now is, Where do we go next?” said Robert Fryklund, who ran the operations of ConocoPhillips in Libya and Brazil, and is a vice president in Houston at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Exploration spending swelled in recent years, partly to offset a doubling of costs throughout the industry  from steel prices to the cost of renting deepwater drilling rigs. A big issue confronting the industry now is how to drive down costs while maintaining a high level of exploration. On average, costs have fallen by 15 to 20 percent from their peak, according to petroleum executives. Exploration remains a risky, and costly, business, where some deepwater wells can cost up to $100 million. From 30 to 50 percent of exploration wells find oil. Some executives are also worried the world might face a shortfall in supplies in coming years if another decline in oil prices causes exploration to falter. The chief executive of the French oil giant Total, Christophe de Margerie, has warned that such a supply crunch is possible by the middle of the next decade. “There could be a shortage of capacity,” he said. His concerns echoed those of Abdullah al-Badri, the secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who said that lower oil prices also threatened investments by OPEC nations. Saudi Arabia is also unlikely to expand its production in coming years because of the uncertainty clouding future oil demand, Ali al-Naimi, the kingdom’s oil minister, signaled earlier this month. Saudi Arabia is just completing a $100 billion program to increase its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day, from around 9 million barrels a day just a few years ago. Although they are substantial, the new finds do not match the giant fields discovered in the 1970s, like Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, Ekofisk in the North Sea, or Cantarell in Mexico. They are also dwarfed by the last enormous discovery, the Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea, discovered in 2000 and estimated to hold over 20 billion barrels of oil. “We have not seen another Kashagan, but still these finds are very material,” said Alan Murray, the exploration service manager at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm in Edinburgh. Since the early 1980s, discoveries have failed to keep up with the global rate of oil consumption, which last year reached 31 billion barrels of oil. Instead, companies have managed to expand production by finding new ways of getting more oil out of existing fields, or producing oil through unconventional sources, like Canada’s tar sands or heavy oil in Venezuela. Reserve estimates typically rise over the life of a field, which can often be productive for decades, as companies find new ways of getting more oil out of the ground. The industry’s record has improved in recent years, thanks to high prices. According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, oil companies have found more oil than they produced for the last two years through a combination of exploration and field expansions. “The appetite for opening new frontiers when prices were low in the 1990s was very small,” said Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Italy’s oil giant Eni. “Today, the biggest discovery of all is technology.” One of the largest finds this year was made by a small producer, Heritage Oil, at the Miran West One field in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. It found nearly two billion barrels of oil and plans to drill a second well before the end of the year. While the central government of Iraq has had a hard time attracting investors to develop its huge fields, local authorities in Kurdistan have been successfully wooing foreign producers. Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Mexico, BP’s discovery proves that the area remains one of the most promising oil regions in the United States. BP has estimated that the Tiber field holds four billion to six billion barrels of oil and gas, which would be enough, in theory, to meet domestic consumption for more than a year. “In 30 years I’ve been in the business, the Gulf of Mexico has been called the Dead Sea countless times,” said Bobby Ryan, the vice president of global exploration at Chevron. “And yet it continues to revitalize itself.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 24, 2009, on page A1 of the New York edition.The oil industry has been on a hot streak this year, thanks to a series of major discoveries that have rekindled a sense of excitement across the petroleum sector, despite falling prices and a tough economy. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Oil and Gasoline Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp BP Plc Go to your Portfolio » A blog about energy, the environment and the bottom line. Go to Blog » These discoveries, spanning five continents, are the result of hefty investments that began earlier in the decade when oil prices rose, and of new technologies that allow explorers to drill at greater depths and break tougher rocks. “That’s the wonderful thing about price signals in a free market  it puts people in a better position to take more exploration risk,” said James T. Hackett, chairman and chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum. More than 200 discoveries have been reported so far this year in dozens of countries, including northern Iraq’s Kurdish region, Australia, Israel, Iran, Brazil, Norway, Ghana and Russia. They have been made by international giants, like Exxon Mobil, but also by industry minnows, like Tullow Oil. Just this month, BP said that it found a giant deepwater field that might turn out to be the biggest oil discovery ever in the Gulf of Mexico, while Anadarko announced a large find in an “exciting and highly prospective” region off Sierra Leone. It is normal for companies to discover billions of barrels of new oil every year, but this year’s pace is unusually brisk. New oil discoveries have totaled about 10 billion barrels in the first half of the year, according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If discoveries continue at that pace through year-end, they are likely to reach the highest level since 2000. While recent years have featured speculation about a coming peak and subsequent decline in oil production, people in the industry say there is still plenty of oil in the ground, especially beneath the ocean floor, even if finding and extracting it is becoming harder. They say that prices and the pace of technological improvement remain the principal factors governing oil production capacity. While the industry is celebrating the recent discoveries, many executives are anxious about the immediate future, fearing that lower prices might jeopardize their exploration drive. The world economy is weak, oil prices have tumbled from last year’s records, corporate profits have shrunk, and global demand for oil remains low. After falling to $34 in December, oil prices have doubled, stabilizing near $70 a barrel. But if the world economy does not pick up, some analysts believe the price could fall again. Oil companies contend that is not a prospect they can afford. Despite reaping record profits in recent years, many executives have warned that they need prices above $60 a barrel to develop the world’s more challenging reserves. In fact, some exploration activity has already slowed this year, as producers seek better terms from service companies and contractors. It is not just oil that is benefiting from the exploration boom. Repsol, Spain’s biggest oil company, said this month that it had discovered what could turn out to be Venezuela’s biggest natural gas field. In recent years, companies have found substantial natural gas reserves in the United States, from shale rocks once believed to be impossible to drill. “The No. 1 question that exploration teams have right now is, Where do we go next?” said Robert Fryklund, who ran the operations of ConocoPhillips in Libya and Brazil, and is a vice president in Houston at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Exploration spending swelled in recent years, partly to offset a doubling of costs throughout the industry  from steel prices to the cost of renting deepwater drilling rigs. A big issue confronting the industry now is how to drive down costs while maintaining a high level of exploration. On average, costs have fallen by 15 to 20 percent from their peak, according to petroleum executives. Exploration remains a risky, and costly, business, where some deepwater wells can cost up to $100 million. From 30 to 50 percent of exploration wells find oil. Some executives are also worried the world might face a shortfall in supplies in coming years if another decline in oil prices causes exploration to falter. The chief executive of the French oil giant Total, Christophe de Margerie, has warned that such a supply crunch is possible by the middle of the next decade. “There could be a shortage of capacity,” he said. His concerns echoed those of Abdullah al-Badri, the secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who said that lower oil prices also threatened investments by OPEC nations. Saudi Arabia is also unlikely to expand its production in coming years because of the uncertainty clouding future oil demand, Ali al-Naimi, the kingdom’s oil minister, signaled earlier this month. Saudi Arabia is just completing a $100 billion program to increase its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day, from around 9 million barrels a day just a few years ago. Although they are substantial, the new finds do not match the giant fields discovered in the 1970s, like Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, Ekofisk in the North Sea, or Cantarell in Mexico. They are also dwarfed by the last enormous discovery, the Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea, discovered in 2000 and estimated to hold over 20 billion barrels of oil. “We have not seen another Kashagan, but still these finds are very material,” said Alan Murray, the exploration service manager at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm in Edinburgh. Since the early 1980s, discoveries have failed to keep up with the global rate of oil consumption, which last year reached 31 billion barrels of oil. Instead, companies have managed to expand production by finding new ways of getting more oil out of existing fields, or producing oil through unconventional sources, like Canada’s tar sands or heavy oil in Venezuela. Reserve estimates typically rise over the life of a field, which can often be productive for decades, as companies find new ways of getting more oil out of the ground. The industry’s record has improved in recent years, thanks to high prices. According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, oil companies have found more oil than they produced for the last two years through a combination of exploration and field expansions. “The appetite for opening new frontiers when prices were low in the 1990s was very small,” said Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Italy’s oil giant Eni. “Today, the biggest discovery of all is technology.” One of the largest finds this year was made by a small producer, Heritage Oil, at the Miran West One field in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. It found nearly two billion barrels of oil and plans to drill a second well before the end of the year. While the central government of Iraq has had a hard time attracting investors to develop its huge fields, local authorities in Kurdistan have been successfully wooing foreign producers. Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Mexico, BP’s discovery proves that the area remains one of the most promising oil regions in the United States. BP has estimated that the Tiber field holds four billion to six billion barrels of oil and gas, which would be enough, in theory, to meet domestic consumption for more than a year. “In 30 years I’ve been in the business, the Gulf of Mexico has been called the Dead Sea countless times,” said Bobby Ryan, the vice president of global exploration at Chevron. “And yet it continues to revitalize itself.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E1DE1430F937A2575BC0A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=exxonmobilcorporation">NATIONAL BRIEFING | ENVIRONMENT; Exxon To Pay In Deaths of Birds<date>Published: August 14, 2009</date><text>Exxon Mobil has agreed to pay $600,000 in penalties for the deaths of dozens of migratory birds from exposure to hydrocarbons at the company's facilities across the Midwest, the Justice Department said.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Exxon Mobil Corporation The trial, which began on Tuesday before Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of United States District Court in Manhattan, is one of hundreds of cases that have been presented around the country against oil companies over the additive, M.T.B.E., a chemical compound that replaced lead in gasoline as an octane enhancer. Such enhancers boost engine performance and help prevent knocking. New York City’s case against Exxon Mobil arose from the contamination of groundwater wells in Jamaica, Queens, that are designated as part of a backup system for drinking water in emergencies or droughts. In 2003, the city sued 23 oil companies over the contamination; it has reached settlements with 22, for a combined $15 million. The Environmental Protection Agency says that even low levels of M.T.B.E. can make water undrinkable because of its taste and odor. While researchers have limited data on its health effects on humans, it is considered a carcinogen in high doses in animals. Like ethanol, M.T.B.E., methyl tert-butyl ether, helps gasoline burn more cleanly and reduces tailpipe emissions. But it is also highly soluble in water, and fuel leaks from storage tanks and other sources have contaminated groundwater that is often a source of drinking water. Twenty-five states, including New York, have restricted or banned M.T.B.E. In opening statements on Tuesday, the lawyer for the city, Victor Sher, argued that Exxon, which started using M.B.T.E. in the 1980s, ignored evidence from its own scientists of a strong risk of groundwater contamination should the compound be added to gasoline. Mr. Sher argued that the company could have used ethanol, a more expensive octane enhancer that does not pose the same hazard. But Exxon Mobil’s lawyer, Peter John Sacripanti, told jurors that oil companies initially used more M.T.B.E. than ethanol as a substitute for lead because the supply of ethanol was limited and car manufacturers had serious concerns that it would diminish vehicles’ performance. The company denies any liability. Mr. Sher said 39 of 68 wells in Queens show M.T.B.E. contamination. But the focus of the trial is five contaminated wells that can yield about 10 million gallons a day to supplement water sources in cases of failure in the upstate reservoir system that provides New York City’s drinking water. City officials say a $250 million treatment facility would have to be built to make the water in the wells drinkable. The company says that the wells are contaminated by other industry in the area. It adds that the city does not intend to build the treatment plant and has other projects under way to provide other backup sources of water. The jury must rule on several elements of the case, including whether the city intends to build the treatment plant, the extent of M.T.B.E. contamination and the size of any punitive damages.

But the extent of the earnings decline at Exxon, the West’s biggest company, hints at a longer-term conundrum for the oil giant and its private sector rivals. Oil is getting much harder to find and costlier to extract, and that won’t change. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » Exxon’s earnings fell 66 percent from a year earlier, while revenue slid 46 percent. The problem, however, is that the company  so revered in the industry for tight cost control  failed to produce a corresponding reduction in the expense line, which fell just 42 percent. This is partly explained by Exxon’s capital spending. While down 6 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, so far this year the company has spent about as much as it did in the first half of last year to discover new hydrocarbon sources. That gets to the heart of Exxon’s long-term strategic challenge. Governments are increasingly guarding their fossil fuels for the home team. At the same time, rivals like PetroChina  whose $385 billion market cap trumps Exxon’s $345 billion  have become more competitive in bidding for assets around the world. This reduces the potential profit margins in existing oil-producing regions, while requiring the majors to operate in difficult new places. To wit, Exxon’s production fell 3.3 percent, to 3.68 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. The only places where it reported significant increases in production were in the United States, Africa and Russia. In the United States, that has meant pursuing costly sources like deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and, of course, aggressive lobbying to expand offshore drilling. In addition, the rising dependence on Africa and Russia exposes Exxon shareholders to greater political risk. This challenge is nothing new. But it becomes more pressing and obvious when Big Oil’s results are no longer masked by the outsize profits that accompany a sky-high oil price. Aiming Too High? Efforts to rein in the $600 trillion derivatives market are gaining momentum. On Thursday, lawmakers including Collin Peterson, Democrat of Minnesota, released an outline for legislation that would require standardized contracts to be centrally cleared and traded on exchanges. The European Commission also backs central clearing. It may make sense for many products, but there is a danger that the new rules could go too far. For one thing, there is still little consensus over what “standardized” means. If regulators try to herd very complex products into clearinghouses, it could bog down legislation  or backfire by increasing risk. That’s because clearinghouses, where liability for losses is shared among members, are most effective when they’re used for products with large, liquid markets  like the $325 trillion bazaar for interest-rate swaps. That makes it easier for the clearing firm to find buyers for the contracts caught on its books when a member goes bust. This is a big task. When Lehman Brothers imploded, the clearinghouse it used in London alone had to unwind trillions of dollars worth of trades. It’s much harder to find buyers for customized contracts that, by definition, are at best thinly traded. If these quirkier derivatives were included, the other members of the clearinghouse might have to take a bigger hit if one of their fellow members failed. The clearinghouse would still spread the risk of a member’s failure among many other firms, lowering the chance that one failure could cause dangerously large follow-on losses at other institutions. But forcing too many idiosyncratic contracts onto a clearinghouse will reduce its effectiveness. Watchdogs may want to require as many types of contracts as possible to be centrally cleared. But they can vastly reduce systemic risk by addressing the huge markets for plain-vanilla  and easily cleared  products like credit- and interest-rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. Beginning with derivatives that everyone agrees are standard is also a way to avoid bogging down the legislation in details of definition.

Related Times Topics: Exxon Mobil Corporation Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp Royal Dutch Shell Plc Go to your Portfolio » Exxon Mobil said Thursday that its second-quarter profit tumbled 66 percent, a sign the company was not immune to lower oil prices and weaker demand. The company reported that its net income fell to $3.95 billion, or 81 cents a share, from $11.68 billion, or $2.22 a share, in the period a year ago. The results were well below market estimates of $1.02 a share and the weakest for the company since the third quarter of 2003, reflecting lower oil and gas production and losses at the company’s domestic refining business. Exxon’s shares fell 1 percent, or 71 cents, on Thursday to close at $70.72. Long accustomed to outshining its peers, Exxon’s weaker performance reflects the severity of the economic downturn throughout the energy industry. Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s biggest oil company, said on Thursday that its second-quarter profits also tumbled by 67 percent, while BP and ConocoPhillips also reported big drops in profits earlier in the week. It is the third consecutive quarterly fall in earnings at Exxon. Last year was the company’s most profitable ever, with full-year earnings of $45.22 billion thanks in large part to record high prices. “They’ve definitely been growth-challenged for a few quarters,” said Brian M. Young- berg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “They have a good portfolio of projects, but until they start delivering, investors are generally skeptical of their guidance. It’s also hard to grow when you’re as big as Exxon.” The global recession is expected to reduce oil consumption worldwide for a second year, the first time that has happened since the early 1980s, hurting the demand for gasoline or jet fuel. Oil companies, which are struggling to adapt to a new environment of lower prices and weaker demand, have responded by slashing costs, paring drilling activities and shutting some operations. “Our results show that no one is immune from global economic conditions,” Kenneth P. Cohen, the company’s vice president for public affairs, said in a conference call with reporters. Exxon’s combined oil and gas production fell 3 percent in the quarter, because of restrictions imposed by OPEC producers and lower output from mature fields. Exxon’s oil production in the quarter averaged 2.35 million barrels a day and gas production was about 8.01 billion cubic feet a day. The company said it increased its output from new projects in Qatar and in the United States. Output has dropped at most oil companies in recent years, as big projects have been delayed and OPEC nations have restricted production to help prop up prices. But given the company’s size, some analysts are concerned that Exxon will have trouble meeting its self-imposed target to increase production by 2 percent this year. The company’s lower output in the past quarter might limit this year’s overall growth, according to Macquarie Securities analysts. Exxon is about to start up the latest phase of its huge liquefied natural gas project in Qatar, and so far this year has begun production at four of its nine major projects planned for the year. Profit at the company’s production and exploration unit fell to $3.81 billion in the second quarter, down $6.2 billion compared with a year earlier. In its refining business, Exxon’s profit dropped to $512 million, down $1.05 billion from a year ago. That included a loss of $15 million at Exxon’s domestic refining business. Despite the lower profit, Exxon continued its program to reward shareholders by buying back shares and paying dividends. The company spent $5.2 billion in the second quarter to buy back 75 million shares. Its capital spending program, one of the largest in the industry, fell by 6 percent, to $6.6 billion in the past quarter, but it still on track to reach about $29 billion this year. “Global economic conditions continue to impact the energy industry both in the volatility of commodity prices and reduced demand for products,” the company’s chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, said in a statement. Exxon’s report caps a week of lower earnings across the energy industry after oil prices tumbled from last year’s record levels and the global economy slowed down. Oil prices, which had reached a record closing price of $145.29 a barrel last July, recently traded around $63 a barrel. Also on Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell reported that its net profit fell 67 percent in the second quarter, to $3.82 billion, from $11.6 billion in the period a year ago. Shell said that it planned to reduce capital spending by more than 10 percent next year to about $28 billion and that it would cut jobs. Earnings at Shell’s exploration and production unit dropped 77 percent, to $1.33 billion, from $5.9 billion a year ago, mostly on lower oil prices. Production declined 6 percent, to 2.9 million barrels of oil and equivalents a day, while prices were $52.62 a barrel, down from $111.92 in the period a year ago. “Our second-quarter results were affected by the weak global economy,” said Peter R. Voser, Shell’s chief executive. “This weakness is creating a difficult environment both in upstream and downstream.” On Wednesday, ConocoPhillips, the third-largest American oil company after Exxon and Chevron, said that its quarterly profits tumbled 76 percent, to $1.3 billion, after a loss in its refining business. Chevron reports its earnings on Friday. The British oil giant BP said earlier this week that its profit declined 53 percent, to $4.39 billion. The company said it would reduce its costs by $3 billion this year, $1 billion more than it had initially planned. The company’s chief executive, Tony Hayward, also signaled that he expected oil prices to hover in a range of $60 to $90 a barrel. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

Tillerson, said in a statement. Exxon’s report caps a week of lower earnings across the energy industry after oil prices tumbled from last year’s record levels and the global economy slowed down. Oil prices, which had reached a record closing price of $145.29 a barrel last July, recently traded around $63 a barrel. Also on Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell reported that its net profit fell 67 percent in the second quarter, to $3.82 billion, from $11.6 billion in the period a year ago. Shell said that it planned to reduce capital spending by more than 10 percent next year to about $28 billion and that it would cut jobs. Earnings at Shell’s exploration and production unit dropped 77 percent, to $1.33 billion, from $5.9 billion a year ago, mostly on lower oil prices. Production declined 6 percent, to 2.9 million barrels of oil and equivalents a day, while prices were $52.62 a barrel, down from $111.92 in the period a year ago. “Our second-quarter results were affected by the weak global economy,” said Peter R. Voser, Shell’s chief executive. “This weakness is creating a difficult environment both in upstream and downstream.” On Wednesday, ConocoPhillips, the third-largest American oil company after Exxon and Chevron, said that its quarterly profits tumbled 76 percent, to $1.3 billion, after a loss in its refining business. Chevron reports its earnings on Friday. The British oil giant BP said earlier this week that its profit declined 53 percent, to $4.39 billion. The company said it would reduce its costs by $3 billion this year, $1 billion more than it had initially planned. The company’s chief executive, Tony Hayward, also signaled that he expected oil prices to hover in a range of $60 to $90 a barrel.

Go to Blog » On Tuesday, Exxon plans to announce an investment of $600 million in producing liquid transportation fuels from algae  organisms in water that range from pond scum to seaweed. The biofuel effort involves a partnership with Synthetic Genomics, a biotechnology company founded by the genomics pioneer J. Craig Venter. The agreement could plug a major gap in the strategy of Exxon, the world’s largest and richest publicly traded oil company, which has been criticized by environmental groups for dismissing concerns about global warming in the past and its reluctance to develop renewable fuels. Despite the widely publicized “moonshine” remark a few years ago by Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, the company has spent several years exploring various fuel alternatives, according to one of its top research officials. “We literally looked at every option we could think of, with several key parameters in mind,” said Emil Jacobs, vice president for research and development at Exxon’s research and engineering unit. “Scale was the first. For transportation fuels, if you can’t see whether you can scale a technology up, then you have to question whether you need to be involved at all.” He added, “I am not going to sugarcoat this  this is not going to be easy.” Any large-scale commercial plants to produce algae-based fuels are at least 5 to 10 years away, Dr. Jacobs said. Exxon’s sincerity and commitment will almost certainly be questioned by its most galvanized environmentalist critics, especially when compared with the company’s extraordinary profits from petroleum in recent years. “Research is great, but we need to see new products in the market,” Kert Davies, the research director at Greenpeace, said. “We’ve always said that major oil companies have to be involved. But the question is whether companies are simply paying lip service to something or whether they are putting their weight and power behind it.” But if it proves a bona fide effort, Exxon’s move into biofuels, long the preserve of venture capital firms and biotech start-ups, could provide a big push to the Obama administration’s policy of encouraging more renewable energy. Currently, about 9 percent of the nation’s liquid fuel supply comes from biofuels  most of it corn-based ethanol. And by 2022, Congress has mandated that biofuel levels reach 36 billion gallons. But developing biofuels has been tricky, and Mr. Tillerson has not been alone in his skepticism. Many environmental groups and energy experts have been critical of corn-derived ethanol, because of its lower energy content and questionable environmental record. According to Exxon, algae could yield more than 2,000 gallons of fuel per acre of production each year, compared with 650 gallons for palm trees and 450 gallons for sugar canes. Corn yields just 250 gallons per acre a year. Exxon’s partnership with Synthetic Genomics is also a vote of confidence in the work of Dr. Venter, a maverick scientist best known for decoding the human genome in the 1990s. In recent years, he has focused his attention on a search for micro-organisms that could be turned into fuel. “Algae is the ultimate biological system using sunlight to capture and convert carbon dioxide into fuel,” Dr. Venter said. Algal biofuel, sometimes nicknamed oilgae by environmentalists, is a promising technology. Fuels derived from algae have molecular structures that are similar to petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and would be compatible with the existing transportation infrastructure, according to Exxon. Continental Airlines, for example, has demonstrated the fuel’s viability in a test flight of an airplane powered in part by algae-based fuel. The Pentagon has also been looking at alternative fuels, including algae, to reduce the military’s dependence on oil. And while cost-effective mass production of algae has eluded researchers so far, it holds potential advantages over other sources of biofuels. Algae can be grown in areas not suited for food crops, using pools of brackish water or even farming them in seawater. Algae also has another benefit, which could eventually help cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. Like any plant, it needs carbon dioxide to grow. But Exxon and Synthetic Genomics hope to genetically engineer new strains of algae that can absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide  like that emitted by power plants, for example. Exxon’s investment includes $300 million for in-house studies and “potentially more” than $300 million to Synthetic Genomics “if research and development milestones are successfully met,” Exxon said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on July 14, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.The oil giant Exxon Mobil, whose chief executive once mocked alternative energy by referring to ethanol as “moonshine,” is about to venture into biofuels.

In a public auction it largely failed to attract the lucrative offers it sought from dozens of international oil companies invited to the bidding. Skip to next paragraph Related As Iraq Stabilizes, China Bids on Its Oil Fields (July 1, 2009) Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp BP Plc ConocoPhillips Inc Go to your Portfolio » After the daylong event, which was broadcast live on national television, the government came away with just a single deal struck from among the six giant oil fields and two gas fields it had put up for bid. The single successful contract went to a joint venture of BP and the China National Petroleum Corporation for the largest field offered: Rumaila, near the southern city of Basra, which has proven reserves of more than 17 billion barrels. The auction, celebrated by the Iraqi government as a milestone for the fledgling democracy, came on the same day as the deadline for American combat troops to pull out of Iraqi cities. It is the most significant attempt to open up the country’s oil industry since it was nationalized by Saddam Hussein in 1972, and the centerpiece of a plan to raise oil production to 6 million barrels a day by 2015, from the current level of 2.4 million. Instead of garnering an infusion of foreign cash to rebuild and to prop up its limping economy, however, the auction of fields that contain about 80 percent of Iraq’s oil output appeared to further polarize the country. Four of the eight oil and gas fields offered Tuesday received only a single bid from oil corporations, and an undeveloped gas field in violence-plagued Diyala Province in northwest Iraq received none. “These oil companies want to make as much money as they can, so they submitted low bids,” Hussain al-Shahristani, the country’s embattled oil minister, said during a news conference following the auction. “But I sent them a message that there are people in Iraq who are protecting Iraq’s wealth.” But observers said the event could be deemed a success only if viewed strictly in populist political terms, because foreign presence in Iraq’s oil industry is a contentious issue. Many believe the 2003 American-led invasion was carried out to wrest away Iraq’s enormous oil reserves, the third largest in the world after Saudi Arabia’s and Iran’s. Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum Web site, which covers the country’s oil industry, said what remained unresolved was how Iraq was to modernize its oil industry without giving in to the desires of oil companies, which prefer owning a share of the oil they pump. Iraq has so far rejected such arrangements, which are known as production sharing agreements. Iraq has an estimated 9 percent of the world’s crude oil, but its pipelines and other infrastructure are aging. Many of its most productive fields, laced with water because of mismanagement, are no longer able to produce as much oil as they once did. The country lacks the money to rebuild the industry, which accounts for almost all of its foreign earnings. The auction on Tuesday, held in a heavily secured ballroom at the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad’s Green Zone, was reminiscent of a professional sports draft lottery. Bids were placed inside a large plastic box that had been set up on a stage. The oil companies were given 20 minutes to mull over each oil and gas field, with the time shown counting down on a giant video screen. The sight of executives walking onstage to drop sealed bids in the plastic box brought cheers of delight from Oil Ministry employees in the audience. The executives themselves, representing Exxon Mobil, Lukoil, Japex, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and the Korea Gas Corporation, among others, then stood aside as their offers were displayed on a screen before the bids were compared to those of rival companies seeking the same contract. The Oil Ministry said it chose to conduct its business on television and in front of an audience of reporters and others to combat allegations of widespread corruption in the ministry, which led it to cancel a group of no-bid oil contracts last year. Major oil companies had little interest in the terms of those contracts, either. Because the financial risk of a 20-year investment in Iraq was considered to be too great for even the largest oil corporations, the companies for the most part formed joint ventures. Throughout the day, clusters of men in dark suits spoke to each other in their common language: broken English, with Dutch, Chinese, Russian and Thai accents. A member of a Korean delegation wore a flak vest inside the hotel ballroom. The only successful bidders, BP and the China National Petroleum Corporation, will negotiate with the Oil Ministry through the summer to complete a contract to revive the Rumaila oil field. Iraq says only about a million barrels of oil a day are pumped from Rumaila  far less than the 1.75 million barrels the government believes that the field should be producing, and little more than one-third of the 2.85 million barrels that BP and the Chinese company say they can extract. The companies had originally requested a premium of $3.99 for every barrel of oil they produced over an Iraqi government-established baseline, but the government offered only $2. While the companies finally agreed to the government’s price, it was the only time all day that the usually wide gaps between what the government was willing to pay and what the companies said they needed to be paid were bridged. Reporting was contributed by Campbell Robertson, Alissa J. Rubin and Abeer Mohammed from Baghdad, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

Skip to next paragraph Related 7 Bombs Strike in Iraq as Violence Spreads (June 26, 2009) Premier Casting U.S. Withdrawal as Iraq Victory (June 26, 2009) Yet, there are widespread doubts about whether Iraq is ready for a sudden infusion of capital from international oil corporations. The country is still not safe. Parliament has not approved a law regulating the oil industry. And oil companies are wary of corruption within Iraq’s Oil Ministry. The oil companies are also somewhat disgruntled, being forced to compete for 20-year service contracts and not the more lucrative production sharing agreements they would prefer. Such agreements would allow them to share directly in the profits from oil production, rather than getting fixed fees. Still, all sides want to move ahead for one simple reason: money. “Asking why oil companies are interested in Iraq is like asking why robbers rob banks: because that’s where the money is,” said Larry Goldstein, director of special projects at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that studies energy economics. “You can’t choose where the resources are. The risks are substantial, but everybody has to play by the same risks.” The Iraqi government says that in order to maintain security and pay the salaries of the hundreds of thousands of its employees hired during the past two years, it has to try to exponentially raise oil production, which accounts for about 95 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings. “We are determined to develop our massive hydrocarbon resources as quickly as possible to finance the reconstruction of the country,” Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq’s oil minister, said recently. Mr. Shahristani said his goal was to increase production from the current level of about 2.4 million barrels a day to 6 million barrels in six years. To do that, the government has estimated that its oil sector needs $50 billion in investment on top of the more than $8 billion it has spent during the past several years to try to increase capacity. But production has been declining for years in southern Iraq, which contains about 80 percent of Iraq’s oil. Government officials blame crumbling infrastructure there, while others cite mismanagement. Under the government of Saddam Hussein, many oil-sector employees who held technical jobs were members of the Baath Party. After the American invasion, many of them fled abroad, were arrested or were killed, leaving the ranks severely depleted. Iraqi oil officials acknowledge that as a result of that and mismanagement, oil production and the current bidding process have suffered. Oil corporations have complained quietly about the corruption, mismanagement and continuing violence in Iraq, as well as rules that force them to become partners with Iraqi oil companies. Another contractual requirement dictates that the oil companies that win fields in the auction make payments totaling $2.6 billion to the government. The Iraqi government has described the money as loans that will be paid back once production begins. More ominously for the oil companies, stiff resistance to the coming auction has been building among members of Parliament, oil unions and even officials in the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. “The service contracts will put the Iraqi economy in chains and shackle its independence for the next 20 years,” said Fayad al-Nema, director of the South Oil Company, the state-owned company that produces most of the country’s crude oil. Mr. Nema’s opinion is important because the South Oil Company is likely to be chosen as one of the partners in the joint ventures that will be created with foreign companies to operate the six oil fields and two gas fields that are up for bid. Despite the drawbacks, international oil companies see Iraq as critical for business because few other places have as much oil that is untapped and relatively close to the surface, so it can be extracted relatively cheaply. With 115 billion barrels, the country has the world’s third largest proven reserves, trailing only Saudi Arabia and Iran. Indeed, after months of lobbying by Mr. Maliki and other government officials, most of the world’s big oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum and Chevron, are expected to submit bids. The companies were expelled from Iraq in 1972, after Mr. Hussein nationalized the oil industry. “My guess is that every international oil company in the world, knowing Iraq is blessed with terrific God-given natural resources, is interested in Iraq,” Daniel Nelson, a former ExxonMobil vice president, said recently. “I’m not giving any competitive secrets away here.” Last year, an Iraqi plan to award six no-bid contracts to Western oil companies was voided amid sharp criticism from several United States senators. In the meantime, the Kurdistan Regional Government signed about 30 contracts of its own with international oil companies, though the central government refuses to recognize them. Each of the six fields open for bidding has more than five billion barrels of oil. Four of the fields are in the south and two are in the northern province of Kirkuk. The auction is scheduled to begin on Monday, and the government hopes to finish subsequent contract negotiations by the end of August. Abeer Mohammed contributed reporting.

The huge profits of the past years have mostly vanished, leaving companies to confront a difficult readjustment to a world of lower prices and uncertain demand. Between 1998 and 2008, oil prices swung from lows of $10 a barrel to highs reaching nearly $150. But as the global recession last year pushed down oil consumption for the first time in 25 years, prices collapsed. Since the beginning of the year, oil futures have traded in a range around $50 a barrel. As a result of the market’s slide in the second half of 2008, many small and midsize producers — though not the giants like Exxon, Total or Shell — have posted big losses, oil exporting nations are suffering crippling revenue declines, and even the major oil companies are seeing substantially lower profits this year. In response, many companies are sharply curtailing investments, reducing costs and firing workers in a frantic bid to drive down expenses. To the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for shrunken economies and stuttering global growth has recently been added the specter of a global flu pandemic, prompting fears of a repeat of the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which curtailed international travel in 2003. A recent note by analysts at Raymond James began with the following warning: “Short term, oil prices could go either direction.” A similar feeling was echoed by Peter Voser, the chief financial officer at Royal Dutch Shell, who is to become chief executive in July. “This is a very difficult environment for the oil industry, and we need to be clear about that,” he said on a conference call with analysts last month. Beyond the short-term fog, many executives expect that the world will face a new spike in prices once the global economy rebounds. The International Energy Agency, a forecasting agency, has repeatedly warned of a “supply crunch” as companies cut back on investments, which in turn could lead to fresh price surges. “We know that as the global economy rebounds, demand for petroleum will also grow — and in the absence of such investments, the world is likely to face another vicious cycle of price spikes,” Khalid A. Al-Falih, the chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said at a recent conference in Washington. Yet these warnings belie a startling new trend. Oil producing countries, which had been reticent to allow foreign investors access to their oil fields when prices were rising, have started to loosen up the rules again. The sudden drop in oil prices has hurt countries where petroleum exports account for the bulk of government revenues. Venezuela is holding its first exploration licensing round since 2000, and President Hugo Chávez, who nationalized chunks of the country’s oil sector in recent years, is suddenly eager to strike deals with foreign investors to pump more oil. The country’s cash-strapped government, for example, is seeking a complex three-way deal involving China National Petroleum Corp. and Total, of France, to produce and refine heavy oil reserves. Admittedly the signals from Venezuela are cryptic: the government also threatened to take over the operations of foreign oil-field service companies after the Venezuelan national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, fell behind on its payments. Another cash-starved country, Iraq, which has been negotiating for more than a year with foreign investors, recently told them that it would seek multibillion-dollar loans from oil companies as a condition for granting them access to its formidable reserves. Outside the 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, other oil producers like Russia, Mexico and Norway are also struggling to reverse declining output trends. The I.E.A. and other forecasters expect non-OPEC supplies to fall this year because of insufficient investments and slowing flows from mature oil fields. Still, some analysts say that a period of lower oil prices does not necessarily lead to declining overall production. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »NEW YORK — As its most prosperous decade screeches to a halt, the oil industry is confronting a far tougher and more hazardous future.

Skip to next paragraph Scott Olson/Getty Images Prices posted at an Exxon Mobil station in Chicago. Despite the recent collapse in prices, Exxon earned $4.55 billion in the first quarter, down 58 percent from $10.89 billion in the period last year. Profit fell to 92 cents a share in the quarter, from $2.02 in the year-earlier period. Exxon, whose operations stretch from Nigeria to Siberia, managed to wring out bigger profits than any of its rivals because of its size and its obsessive attention to controlling costs. These industry costs, which had doubled in the last few years, have been falling lately as companies cancel projects or delay investments. Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months as a global recession drastically slowed economic activity around the world. Crude oil futures contracts traded in New York have averaged about $43 in the first quarter of this year, compared with nearly $100 a barrel in the first quarter of 2008. On Thursday, oil settled at $51.12 a barrel, up 15 cents. “This volatility over such a short period of time is a supreme test of a company’s business model,” said Kenneth P. Cohen, the company’s vice president for public affairs. Exxon said that the drop in prices would not change its spending plans for the year. The company said it still expected to spend a record $29 billion this year to expand production and develop new projects. But in a bid to preserve some of its cash, it also signaled that it would reduce its share buyback program by $2 billion in the second quarter. “In spite of the dramatic changes to the global economic environment, Exxon Mobil is maintaining its long-term focus and disciplined approach to capital investment,” the company said in a statement. While other oil companies are trimming or ending their share-buyback programs, Exxon spent $7 billion in the first quarter to purchase shares. In the second quarter, it plans to spend $5 billion buying back shares. Exxon had $25 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, down from $31 billion at the end of last year. Despite the market’s decline and the drop in gasoline consumption, Exxon recently regained its position as the largest American corporation in the Fortune 500 list of companies, overtaking Wal-Mart. The company’s shares have lost 25 percent of their value in the last year, compared with a 37 percent drop on the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. Exxon’s report caps a week of weaker earnings for major oil companies. Royal Dutch Shell and BP both reported lower profits in recent days. Shell’s net income for the first quarter fell 62 percent, to $3.49 billion. At BP, profits fell by 64 percent, to $2.56 billion, prompting the company’s chief executive, Tony Hayward, to scale back spending this year by 9 percent, to $20 billion. “This is a very difficult condition for the oil industry, and we need to be clear about it,” Shell’s chief financial officer, Peter Voser, said on a conference call on Wednesday. ConocoPhillips said last week that its profit plunged by 80 percent, to $840 million. Chevron is scheduled to report its results for the quarter on Friday. Even as it outperforms its peers, Exxon faces stark strategic questions about its future. The Obama administration’s goals of cutting carbon emissions and reducing oil consumption threaten Exxon’s profits and its business model. The cap-and-trade policy, which is being considering by the administration, would raise production costs and increase energy prices. Exxon, which has long fought policies to reduce carbon emissions, has recently championed the idea of setting a carbon tax to reduce emissions, a measure favored by some economists. Many analysts do not consider a carbon tax to be politically realistic, while environmental advocates prefer the certainty offered by a declining cap on carbon emissions.

A blog about energy, the environment and the bottom line. Go to Blog » But the world’s oil giants are not convinced that it will work. Even as Washington goes into a frenzy over energy, many of the oil companies are staying on the sidelines, balking at investing in new technologies favored by the president, or even straying from commitments they had already made. Royal Dutch Shell said last month that it would freeze its research and investments in wind, solar and hydrogen power, and focus its alternative energy efforts on biofuels. The company had already sold much of its solar business and pulled out of a project last year to build the largest offshore wind farm, near London. BP, a company that has spent nine years saying it was moving “beyond petroleum,” has been getting back to petroleum since 2007, paring back its renewable program. And American oil companies, which all along have been more skeptical of alternative energy than their European counterparts, are studiously ignoring the new messages coming from Washington. “In my view, nothing has really changed,” Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said after the election of President Obama. “We don’t oppose alternative energy sources and the development of those. But to hang the future of the country’s energy on those alternatives alone belies reality of their size and scale.” The administration wants to spend $150 billion over the next decade to create what it calls “a clean energy future.” Its plan would aim to diversify the nation’s energy sources by encouraging more renewables, and it would reduce oil consumption and cut carbon emissions from fossil fuels. The oil companies have frequently run advertisements expressing their interest in new forms of energy, but their actual investments have belied the marketing claims. The great bulk of their investments goes to traditional petroleum resources, including carbon-intensive energy sources like tar sands and natural gas from shale, while alternative investments account for a tiny fraction of their spending. So far, that has changed little under the Obama administration. “The scale of their alternative investments is so mind-numbingly small that it’s hard to find them,” said Nathanael Greene, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “These companies don’t feel they have to be on the leading edge of this stuff.” Perhaps not surprisingly, most investments in alternative sources of energy are coming from pockets other than those of the oil companies. In the last 15 years, the top five oil companies have spent around $5 billion to develop sources of renewable energy, according to Michael Eckhart, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, an industry trade group. This represents only 10 percent of the roughly $50 billion funneled into the clean-energy sector by venture capital funds and corporate investors during that period, he said. “Big Oil does not consider renewable energy to be a mainstream business,” Mr. Eckhart said. “It’s a side business for them.” Shell, for example, said it spent $1.7 billion since 2004 on alternative projects. That amount is dwarfed by the $87 billion it spent over the same period on its oil and gas projects around the world. This year, the company’s overall capital spending is set at $31 billion, most of it for the development of fossil fuels. Industry executives contend that comparing investments in oil and gas projects with their research efforts in the renewable field is misleading. They say that while renewable fuels are needed, they are still at an early stage of development, and petroleum will remain the dominant source of energy for decades. In its long-term forecast, Exxon says that by 2050, hydrocarbons  including oil, gas, and coal  will account for 80 percent of the world’s energy supplies, about the same as today. “Renewable energy is very real,” David J. O’Reilly, the chief executive of Chevron, said in a speech in New York last November. “We need it. It will be an essential part of the future I envision. But it’s not realistic to suppose we can replace conventional energy in a timeframe that some suggest.” Chevron has spent about $3.2 billion since 2002 on “renewable and alternative energy and energy efficiency services,” according to Alexander Yelland, a spokesman. It plans to spend $2.7 billion in the three years through 2011 on a variety of projects, including a business that helps improve energy efficiency for companies and government agencies, he said. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on April 8, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.The Obama administration wants to reduce oil consumption, increase renewable energy supplies and cut carbon dioxide emissions in the most ambitious transformation of energy policy in a generation.

The Exxon Valdez slammed into Bligh Reef in Alaska’s Prince William Sound, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil, damaging 1,300 miles of shoreline, disrupting the livelihoods of thousands of Americans and fouling one of the country’s richest fishing grounds. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (1989) More than $2 billion has been spent on cleanup and recovery. Exxon has paid at least $1 billion in damages. Supertankers have been made safer with double hulls, emergency teams given better equipment. Some fish species, though not all, have recovered. Yet the Exxon Valdez still sends a powerful cautionary message: oil development, however necessary, is an inherently risky, dirty business  especially so in the forbidding waters of the Arctic. The White House should keep that in mind as it maps out its energy strategy. While rightly emphasizing conservation, efficiency and renewable energy, President Obama has said that oil and gas drilling in America’s coastal waters will be part of the mix. The challenge is to do it right, and do it carefully. Mr. Obama’s interior secretary, Ken Salazar, has said he won’t be rushed into offshore drilling  a refreshing contrast to the “drill baby drill” mania of the 2008 G.O.P. campaign. He has already pulled back a Bush administration plan opening up huge swaths of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to drilling. He promises a more measured proposal by the end of the year. Mr. Salazar must also make decisions about the waters of Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, which hold the bulk of America’s untapped reserves and have always been open to drilling. Drilling in the gulf has caused relatively few environmental problems and is widely accepted. Drilling in Alaskan waters is another issue altogether. The unforgiving Arctic environment is far riskier; icy, turbulent waters would make oil spills hard to contain. And the ecological damage could be staggering; Alaska’s waters contain some of the richest fisheries and most varied wildlife on earth. One fairly easy call for Mr. Salazar would be to restore protections for Alaska’s Bristol Bay. President George H. W. Bush declared the bay off-limits to drilling after the Exxon Valdez disaster  a move reversed by his son George W. Bush in 2007. Bristol Bay contributes heavily to the area’s $2.2 billion annual fish catch  about 40 percent, in dollar terms, of all the seafood caught in America’s coastal waters. Oil and gas development, according to Interior’s Minerals Management Service, would yield total revenues of less than $8 billion over 20 to 40 years. The Bush administration had even more ambitious plans for other waters in the Arctic  opening 40 million acres in the Chukchi Sea and 33 million acres in the Beaufort Sea for possible development. It sold one lease, now under court challenge, covering 2.3 million acres in 2008. Unless the Obama administration changes course, other leases within these areas are sure to be offered. These plans, too, cry out for reconsideration. Mr. Salazar has spoken of harnessing energy from the tides and winds. Given the fragility of the environment, the country’s long-term energy needs and the threat of another Exxon Valdez disaster, these avenues would seem to offer safer passage than punching holes in the Arctic.

Exxon Mobil put on a show of strength on Thursday, pledging to increase investments in coming years, chiding rivals for mistimed acquisitions and reminding everyone it had the financial strength to make headway even as other companies pulled back. “The question now becomes who can be successful in more challenging times,” Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, said at the company’s annual investor presentation at the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Tillerson had a ready answer for his own question. Exxon, based in Irving, Tex., earned $45 billion in 2008, gave back $40 billion to its shareholders, invested $26 billion around the world, and managed to find more oil than it produced. It also outperformed all of its rivals, like Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell. Undaunted by a collapse in oil prices and the most severe global financial crisis since the 1930s, Exxon said it would dial up its investments over the next five years. It plans to spend as much as $150 billion through 2014. Its oil and gas production, which was stagnant recently, is expected to grow 2 to 3 percent a year in the next five years, thanks in part to the company’s big natural gas projects in the Middle East. Since 2004, Exxon has distributed $146 billion to its shareholders, either through dividend payments or share buybacks, more than was given back by Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron combined. Exxon recently said it would back a carbon tax instead of the current proposal in Washington for an emissions trading system to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that are warming the planet. Mr. Tillerson said a carbon tax would be easier to collect and would allow businesses to make faster decisions on how to reduce emissions. “A cap-and-trade system is going to be opaque to consumers and, I would argue, even to investors,” Mr. Tillerson said, using jargon for an emissions trading plan. “A carbon tax is a transparent cost.” He said one of the biggest challenges that Exxon had faced in recent months was to protect its cash hoard of more than $31 billion from the market’s gyrations. “We had to move very quickly on where we placed the cash,” he said. Oil prices have dropped more than $100 a barrel since their peak last summer, but Mr. Tillerson seemed unmoved. “We told our people to ignore all this noise about $100 oil,” he said. “We were not planning for a world of $100 oil, or $200 oil. We’re not having to huddle up or get on special meetings every other day. We really are making no adjustments to our business strategy. Around the house it feels pretty much business as usual.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 6, 2009, on page B2 of the New York edition.Wall Street is trading at its lowest level in more than a decade, some American automakers are on the verge of bankruptcy and the government is bailing out the nation’s biggest banks.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Exxon Mobil Corporation | Oil and Gasoline Exxon News Release Add to Portfolio Exxon Mobil Corp Go to your Portfolio » Exxon earned $45.2 billion in 2008, beating the record it set in 2007 for most profitable corporation, at $40.6 billion. That came despite a fourth quarter in which income fell 33 percent, owing to the steepest drop ever in oil prices, as the economy went into a tailspin. After riding a tide of swelling earnings in recent years, the once high-flying oil sector is scrambling to adjust to a sharp downturn. Oil consumption is falling in all major developed nations as economies shrink and consumers cut back on spending. As a result, oil prices have dropped more than 70 percent since peaking above $145 a barrel in July. On Friday, they traded at about $42 a barrel. Because of its close attention to cost reduction and efficiency, Exxon is weathering the drop in oil prices better than most rivals. As most companies trim spending and scale back some operations, Exxon signaled it would stick with its strategy. More than any other oil company, managers at Exxon emphasize a strict attention to containing costs, and are disciplined about their investments. As a result, the company manages to extract more dollars than its rivals out of each barrel that it pumps or refines. The method has served the company well when times were good, and is likely to provide some shelter in a long downturn, analysts said. The company has more than $30 billion in cash that could provide it with a strategic war chest to make acquisitions, according to analysts. Many have forecast a wave of buyouts in the sector as companies struggle to finance their projects or even to survive. At a conference last month, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, also signaled the company would increase its capital spending program by 20 percent this year. Exxon spent $26 billion in 2008 to increase production and develop new projects, 25 percent more than in 2007. It has outlined plans to spend an average of $25 billion a year through 2012. “These results reflect the strength of our business model,” David Rosenthal, Exxon’s vice president for investor relations, said during a conference call. Despite falling prices, the company still earned $7.8 billion in the last quarter, down from $11.7 billion in the year-earlier period. Earlier this week both Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips reported large quarterly losses as asset values dropped because of the fall in oil prices. Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, said Friday that its net income rose 1 percent, to $4.9 billion, in the fourth quarter. For the year, Chevron’s earnings rose 28 percent, to $24 billion. Shares of Exxon closed at $76.48, down 52 cents, on Friday, and Chevron fell 10 cents, to $70.52 a share. Exxon said that it gave back $40.1 billion to its shareholders in 2008, 12 percent more than in 2007, through either dividends or share buybacks. On Friday, the company signaled that its share buyback program, which totaled $8 billion in the fourth quarter, would be trimmed slightly to $7 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Exxon pumped about 2.47 million barrels of oil a day in the fourth quarter and produced 9.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day. Over all, oil and gas production decreased 3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the year-earlier period. (In some countries, Exxon is entitled to fewer barrels of oil when prices rise.) The company started eight major projects last year, including Thunder Horse, a huge offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico. In recent months, projects have been canceled or deferred in Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. In the United States, several oil and refinery companies in recent days have told investors that they intended to respond to the falling oil and natural gas prices by laying off workers, writing down asset values and reducing capital spending. With gasoline demand down, refineries have been particularly squeezed. As a sign that the days of extraordinary profit growth are over, Baker Hughes, a Houston oil service company, announced that it would cut 1,500 of its 40,000 employees. Schlumberger, another service company, reported a nearly 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings. The company said it would reduce its 19,000 North American employees by almost 5 percent. Refining margins have been so weak that Valero announced this week it would close its Texas City refinery while it underwent maintenance for the next six weeks. As it has been many times in the past, Exxon was the exception to the sudden turn of fortune in the oil patch. “Exxon kept its head when everyone else was going crazy going to alternatives and drilling more,” said Phil Flynn, a vice president and oil analyst at Alaron Trading. “But Exxon knew after every boom comes a bust, and focused on the future.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 31, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.Despite collapsing oil prices in recent months, Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, still managed to set a record for last year as the most profitable American corporation ever.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Cracking Down Enlarge This Image Yves Logghe/Associated Press Neelie Kroes, the European Unions commissioner for competition. But the discreet European luxury hotel, about 40 minutes outside Paris, was one in a circuit of hotels that served as bases for more than a dozen years for executives from some of the biggest names in oil to fix prices of paraffin, the wax byproduct of crude oil that is used in candles, paper cups, lip balm and chewing gum. Nine companies  including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Sasol of South Africa, and Repsol YPF of Spain  controlled 75 percent of the European paraffin market, and the other 25 percent often fell in with the pricing structure they had engineered. The scheme drove up prices to consumers in a plot that probably touched most households in Europe, according to the European Union’s commissioner for competition, Neelie Kroes, whose office levied penalties of more than 675 million euros, or $900 million. In levying the fines in October, Ms. Kroes released a two-page statement and no supporting documentation, but The International Herald Tribune has reviewed dozens of pages of confidential legal documents that offer an unusual look inside the workings of a price-fixing cartel. Most cartels operate in secrecy, destroying documents, encrypting e-mail messages or using prepaid phone cards to erase communication traces. But the paraffin cartel was rare in that some members kept minutes, and attendance lists. Cartel members e-mailed invitations and sought R.S.V.P.’s. They booked each other’s rooms and played host to open bars. Documents found when investigators first raided the companies in April 2005 included handwritten notes on stationery from hotels on the cartel’s itinerary: the five-star Kempinski in Budapest or Château de Montvillargenne in the bucolic horse country of Chantilly, France. “Next price increase May/June 2000,” a Shell executive scribbled in a note after a meeting in Paris. Tibor Toth, a manager with the Hungarian oil company MOL, and the executive who often kept minutes and attendance, also recorded the prices agreed on in German marks, “Raise in January unless first-quarter quantities are reduced, otherwise raise in season, DM 120.” The relaxed clubiness of the paraffin conspirators stokes worries about the hold that price-fixing cartels have on European commerce. With Ms. Kroes taking action against cartels involving elevators, cement, automotive glass and drugs, total annual fines in the past five years have more than tripled, reaching 2.27 billion euros ($2.95 billion) this year. In the paraffin case, as in others, some of the biggest offenders walked off with no, or relatively small, fines because they were first in the door with information implicating less-involved conspirators. And, unlike in the United States, in the Europe Union price fixers do not face the prospect of criminal prosecution. Over all, the number of international cartels has been rising nearly every year since the 1980s, according to John Connor, a Purdue University economist whose studies show that global cartels are bigger and more plentiful in Europe. The paraffin cartel involved at least 35 sales or product managers. In internal memorandums they used nicknames for themselves and their meetings: the Blue Saloon, after a favorite bar in Hamburg; the Appetizer Meetings; even, for one participant, the Paraffin Mafia. At meetings, they fixed prices and carved up markets for their distinct product lines: extruder, coating wax, liquid slabs, tea-light candles and grave lights used for tombstones. Most cartels last five years, according to studies, then sputter out amid recriminations over cheating. European regulators suspect this one may date as far back as the 1970s, based on files plucked from some companies involved. Investigators said that they believed they had firm evidence to form a case starting with a Sept. 3, 1992, meeting of five participants at an unknown location, according to the European Commission’s confidential 200-page report laying out the evidence. In the months that followed, a ritual developed, according to the documents. Sasol, the market leader, based in South Africa and with an office in Hamburg, played ringleader and club booster. A product manager, Michael Matthäi, issued invitations by telephone, fax and e-mail. Usually it was for a half-day meeting, with dinner the night before along with a cocktail hour, often with Holger Schröder, sales manager for Shell Deutschland, playing host. At Sasol, where the club was known as “Blauer Salon,” or Blue Saloon, after the Hamburg bar, participants would report back on the gatherings to other executives who kept notes. The companies “tried to protect their home markets by creating an atmosphere of mutual trust and good will among themselves,” according to a file obtained from Sasol by commission investigators. The documents show that they shared information about customers, production capacities, sales volumes and even plant maintenance. They talked prices, agreeing on absolute numbers. 1 2 Next Page » Stephen Castle reported from Brussels.
