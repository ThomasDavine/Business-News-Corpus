Services Practice at Korn/Ferry International. American chief executives fall into two camps: those who relish opportunities to engage with Washington and those who engage only when threatened with a subpoena. This notion of engagement is even more relevant at a moment when the United States is struggling with high unemployment, slow economic growth and yawning budget deficits. In the coming months, Washington will be making decisions about federal spending and tax policy that will reshape the government’s fundamental role in the American economy for years to come. At the same time, both Congress and the Obama administration are under increasing pressure to find ways to create jobs and kick-start growth as the 2012 election approaches. As a result, chief executives and business leaders from companies of all shapes and sizes will almost certainly find their local representatives and senators eager to hear a private-sector perspective from outside the Beltway. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Ivan Seidenberg, the former chief executive and chairman of Verizon, fits the archetype of the corporate leader who sees the long-term benefit of having a presence in the capital. As chief executive, he frequently met with regulators, members of Congress and White House officials (including invitations to speak with the president with other chief executives). President Obama named him to the President’s Export Council in July 2010, and he served for three years as chairman of the Business Roundtable, the Washington-based group that advocates pro-business policies. Among the senior executives working for him at Verizon are a former congressman and Verizon executive vice president for public affairs, Thomas Tauke; and a former general counsel for the United States trade representative, Peter Davidson, now senior vice president for government relations at Verizon. Also among them, until 2008, was William B. Barr, a former attorney general of the United States. “I’ve focused on Washington because it’s essential to the long-term health of Verizon, but also because I want to help develop solutions to the nation’s pressing problems,” Mr. Seidenberg said. As the White House, policy makers and legislators grapple with issues like deficit reduction, spending cuts and tax changes, engaging Washington is critical for corporate leaders, given the ramifications of regulation, taxation, global trade and more. While this is understood by top executives like Mr. Seidenberg and others, there is a clear need for leaders from outside the Fortune 500 to similarly ratchet up their efforts to have their voice heard and address what Mr. Seidenberg has characterized as “a growing disconnect between Washington and the business community.” Why Washington Engagement Matters The federal government and, to a lesser extent, state government are deeply entwined in sectors throughout the American economy. Regulation, in particular, can affect companies significantly and in unexpected ways, given that statutes are regularly being modified in a range of areas, including environmental protection, consumer privacy and workplace conditions. It is far preferable to try to influence the process than be stuck responding to the result. “If you’re not engaged, you can wake up one morning and find a big problem on your hands,” said Jim McNerney, chairman, president and chief executive of Boeing, who is acutely aware of the need to develop relationships in Washington, given that the company is consistently the second-largest recipient of United States government contracts after Lockheed Martin. There is some evidence that companies increasingly recognize the likelihood of public policy’s affecting their operations, based on the findings of a McKinsey global survey of business executives in February. Among survey respondents from companies in North America, 71 percent said they expected increased involvement from both government and regulators — the highest percentage of any region in the world. Another indicator is that membership in the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of leading American companies, has increased to 205 from 143 over the past 12 months. How Chief Executives Should Engage The engagement of chief executives with Washington can take many forms. The traditional steps of making campaign contributions, joining trade associations and hiring government relations staff members remain important. But they are no longer sufficient. Mr. McNerney of Boeing recommends that work on public policy issues become one of the experiences expected of executives as they rise through ranks toward the chief executive’s office. “It is more important than ever to have experience with Washington built into the background of people who run companies,” he said. Reinforcing the importance of chief executive involvement is the proliferation of advocacy efforts by those who are not chief executives. In 2010, there were nearly 13,000 registered lobbyists in Washington. The large number of lobbyists creates more competition for companies as they seek to deliver their message to policy makers. “You can’t outsource the Washington knowledge to external lobbyists or your in-house government relations people,” says Bill Green, chairman and former chief executive of Accenture. “As a C.E.O., you have to have some level of depth on the issues of the day and the issues that could affect your company in the future. Relying solely on the government relations folks to raise the red flag is not sufficient and does not serve your shareholders well. In today’s world, you have to be part of the ongoing dialogue.” But even with their stature and mastery of issues, chief executives must be prepared for challenges and frustrations, said David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. “There’s generally no one person you can talk to who can make the decision.” “Because Washington has 536 independent subcontractors, you have to do a lot of talking and a lot of participating to get buy-in,” Mr. Cote said, referring to the president and all members of Congress. “That can be frustrating for us who are used to talking to one person and getting a problem solved. But that’s the way it works, and you have to participate.” The Benefits of Engagement Washington engagement is undeniably a form of risk management — developing the relationships with officials that can help a chief executive to resolve differences (policy or otherwise) before they strike at the heart of a company’s brand or balance sheet. But engagement should not be viewed entirely as a defense mechanism. Being positioned to shape policies as they develop, and to seize opportunities emanating from policy changes, can also be a catalyst for corporate growth. And a healthy, vibrant relationship between chief executives and Washington, resting on communication and cooperation, will ultimately translate to a stronger, more dynamic economy that can deliver higher levels of job creation and greater prosperity for the American people.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/honeywell-to-buy-ems-technologies/?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Honeywell to Buy EMS Technologies<date>June 13, 2011, 8:51 am</date><text>Honeywell International said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire EMS Technologies, a maker of systems for mobile networks and satellites, for $506 million in cash.

Twenty-seven smaller crosses symbolize workers who have survived the disease.The memorial is a fitting backdrop for the contentious labor dispute that has shaken Metropolis — the self-proclaimed hometown of Superman, which sits on the Ohio River at the southern edge of Illinois. Many workers believe that the plant contributed to their fellow employees’ illnesses, which is a central reason the union is refusing to accept the plant operator’s plan to reduce pensions for newly hired workers and health benefits for retirees. On June 28, Honeywell, the plant operator, locked out its 220 union employees after negotiations stalled, accusing the union of refusing to give the company 24 hours’ notice of a strike. The union has picketed ever since. “We deal with hydrofluoric acid,” said Darrell Lillie, president of United Steelworkers Local 7-669, which represents the union workers. “We make fluorine. This is bad stuff. The least we feel like we could have is good medical benefits when we retire.” Honeywell rejects the notion that its facility makes workers more susceptible to cancer and maintains that its labor proposal would raise the average overall salary for employees. The company says that is fair given that the plant, which converts milled uranium into uranium hexafluoride for nuclear reactors, is projected to lose $20 million this year. “Unfortunately, the union has demonstrated very little desire to reach a mutually beneficial and workable agreement that acknowledges the economic realities of the plant,” said Peter Dalpe, a spokesman for Honeywell. In Metropolis, a blue-collar community of 6,500, Clark Kent has long been the main draw. A 15-foot tall Superman keeps solemn watch outside the county courthouse, and the local newspaper is called The Metropolis Planet. The Chamber of Commerce used to hand out packets of “kryptonite” candy to children. But this summer everyone is concerned about uranium, not kryptonite. Workers have long feared that the plant poses dangers. According to Honeywell’s quarterly financial filings, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department are investigating whether the plant complied with federal law in its storage of sludge. A grand jury has been convened in the matter, the filings said. Mr. Dalpe said Honeywell was cooperating with the E.P.A. investigation, “which resulted from a company self-disclosure more than two years ago.” Federal inspectors have been on-site monitoring the situation, said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “At this point, we’re satisfied they’ve met all safety regulations, and that they have a continued emphasis on safety,” he said. In December 2003, an accidental release of uranium hexafluoride sent a plume of gas into the air, and nearby homes were evacuated. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency sued Honeywell over the accident, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued two safety violations, which led to increased oversight. With the union workers locked out, 152 salaried Honeywell employees have been running the plant and 203 contract workers were brought in from a Louisiana company to help. “They’re trying to bring in old recruits who have been retired and train them to run the plant,” said Jerry Baird, whose restaurant, Diamond Lil’s, has been hauling barbecue, lemonade and ice to the picket line. “If they remember everything, it’ll probably run. If they don’t, they’ll probably kill us all.” Mr. Dalpe said Honeywell was not aware of any evidence that pointed toward a higher rate of illness at its Metropolis plant than other facilities. “Publicly available and independent government health data, including from the Centers for Disease Control, demonstrate conclusively that the cancer incidence rates in counties where our Metropolis employees reside are at or below those of the state of Illinois and the U.S. over all,” he said. But because the plant, then called Allied Chemical, produced atomic material for the cold war effort, it is part of the federal government’s Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. Under the program, the government has paid out $15.2 million in compensation and medical benefits to former workers at the plant or their families. Those workers were determined to have become ill from radiation exposure while working between 1959 and 1976 or suffered residual radiation exposure between 1977 and 2009. Mr. Dalpe said those payments included claims from more than 30 years ago and do not “reflect health and safety practices at our Metropolis Works Plant, nor do they indicate a high level of risk for our current employees.” Meanwhile, labor negotiations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday. But union workers and their families continue to picket around the clock, and a rally was held Saturday. “In Metropolis, there are friendships and personal ties between company and union employees,” said Billy McDaniel, the town’s mayor. “It makes it hard, because it splits those relationships. We certainly don’t want to lose Honeywell. And we don’t want to lose any of our workers.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/business/08road.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">A New Twist in Talking the Plane Down<date>Published: June 7, 2010</date><text>MESA, Ariz.THE private jet approached the runway over the dusty hills of the central Arizona desert. It was not in ideal landing configuration. “Too high! Too high!” a recorded female voice called out in the cockpit. The pilot, Markus A. Johnson, nodded. This was actually the reaction he had been seeking from the warning system. Pulling up, the airplane surfed over the runway at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, now used mostly for business jets and other general aviation. At noon, with the temperature already pushing past 100 degrees, the airport looked sleepy. Mr. Johnson and the co-pilot, Steven T. Kilbourne, climbed to 1,600 feet. “We’ll go around, because I didn’t fly it bad enough this time,” Mr. Johnson said with a chuckle. The airplane, a vintage Sabreliner NA265 twin-engine business jet, made a big sweep around the airport and again approached the long, empty runway. In the right seat, Mr. Kilbourne deliberately set the flaps wrong. “Flaps! Unstable!” the recorded voice called out as the runway loomed. Again the airplane pulled up. From the jump seat in the cockpit, I saw the skyline of Phoenix shimmering in the distance. In a few minutes, we had made a normal landing and were taxiing around the airport while Mr. Kilbourne studied a taxiway chart and spoke with controllers in the tower. As we trundled along, the recorded voice, urgency gone, called out locations of intersecting runways. “Approaching 1-2 center,” it said. “Approaching 3-0 left.” Mr. Johnson and Mr. Kilbourne are both test pilots for Honeywell, which has an aerospace headquarters in Phoenix. They were demonstrating a new Honeywell technology that provides aural alerts to pilots as they approach runways and as they land and roll through the maze of taxiways. Being reminded where you are when approaching the runway is crucial because pilots have leeway on where to put the plane down. Last month, an Air India Express flight crashed in Mangalore, killing 158 on board, and investigators are trying to determine whether the accident was caused by a pilot miscalculation on the approach to the runway. In general, pilots need to pay close attention to a wide variety of visual signals, beyond cockpit instruments, when landing an airplane or moving around the airport. They look out the window, study maps, peer at signs. Occasionally they make mistakes and their planes wander into one another’s paths, sometimes with disastrous results. Skill and acute awareness are required to land a plane safely, whether it’s a midsize business jet like the Sabreliner, or a lumbering giant crammed with hundreds of passengers like a 747. But far more than most passengers realize, pilots have options on their approach, among them, just where to slide that plane down on that vast and fast-looming concrete runway. Within overall safety guidelines, airlines set what they call correct landing procedures for pilots. But airports, weather, terrain and other factors vary, as do company procedures. In general, airlines like pilots to strive for soft landings, gliding the aircraft gently onto the runway, rather than hard landings, in which the plane comes down with a thump or a bang that alarms passengers. Hard landings are jarring, but not necessarily unsafe. On the other hand, if the pilots are not fully aware of exactly how much runway they have in front of them on approach, a soft landing can be unsafe. Last week, for example, a directive by aviation regulators in India warned airlines about overemphasizing soft landings. “A good landing is not one that the passengers perceive as a soft landing, but one that is made at the correct point on the runway, with correct flight parameters,” the directive said. It was issued after the Air India Express accident. The question is whether the pilots, in calculating their runway position, decided incorrectly that they had enough room for a full soft landing. “Situational awareness” are the two most important words that pilots know, even before “when’s lunch?” Honeywell’s new product, called SmartLanding, augments the company’s Runway Awareness and Advisory System, introduced almost a decade ago to remind pilots exactly where they were on the ground. SmartLanding “has more to do with approaching the runway,” Mr. Johnson said. As we rolled to a stop on an airport apron last week, Mr. Johnson said that adding to pilots’ situational awareness was invaluable — even if it required an audible nag from a disembodied voice amid all the other distractions of a cockpit. “It’s easy to trigger a warning announcement,” he said as the engines shut down. “The tricky thing is to not trigger one.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/business/24bizbriefs-HONEYWELLPRO_BRF.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Honeywell Profit Tops Wall Street Forecasts<date>Published: April 24, 2010</date><text>Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer, posted a first-quarter profit that topped Wall Street forecasts on Friday and raised its income outlook for the full year.

For years, the United States has been pressing other nations to join its efforts to squeeze the Iranian economy, in hopes of reining in Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Now, with the nuclear standoff hardening and Iran rebuffing American diplomatic outreach, the Obama administration is trying to win a tough new round of United Nations sanctions. But a New York Times analysis of federal records, company reports and other documents shows that both the Obama and Bush administrations have sent mixed messages to the corporate world when it comes to doing business in Iran, rewarding companies whose commercial interests conflict with American security goals. Many of those companies are enmeshed in the most vital elements of Iran’s economy. More than two-thirds of the government money went to companies doing business in Iran’s energy industry — a huge source of revenue for the Iranian government and a stronghold of the increasingly powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a primary focus of the Obama administration’s proposed sanctions because it oversees Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. Other companies are involved in auto manufacturing and distribution, another important sector of the Iranian economy with links to the Revolutionary Guards. One supplied container ship motors to IRISL, a government-owned shipping line that was subsequently blacklisted by the United States for concealing military cargo. Beyond $102 billion in United States government contract payments since 2000 — to do everything from building military housing to providing platinum to the United States Mint — the companies and their subsidiaries have reaped a variety of benefits. They include nearly $4.5 billion in loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that underwrites the export of American goods and services, and more than $500 million in grants for work that includes cancer research and the turning of agricultural byproducts into fuel. In addition, oil and gas companies that have done business in Iran have over the years won lucrative drilling leases for close to 14 million acres of offshore and onshore federal land. In recent months, a number of companies have decided to pull out of Iran, because of a combination of pressure by the United States and other Western governments, “terrorism free” divestment campaigns by shareholders and the difficulty of doing business with Iran’s government. And several oil and gas companies are holding off on new investment, waiting to see what shape new sanctions may assume. The Obama administration points to that record, saying that it has successfully pressed allied governments and even reached out directly to corporate officials to dissuade investment in Iran, particularly in the energy industry. In addition, an American effort over many years to persuade banks to leave the country has isolated Iran from much of the international financial system, making it more difficult to do deals there. “We are very aggressive, using a range of tools,” said Denis McDonough, chief of staff to the National Security Council. The government can, and does, bar American companies from most types of trade with Iran, under a broad embargo that has been in place since the 1990s. But as The Times’s analysis illustrates, multiple administrations have struggled diplomatically, politically and practically to exert American authority over companies outside the embargo’s reach — foreign companies and the foreign subsidiaries of American ones. Indeed, of the 74 companies The Times identified as doing business with both the United States government and Iran, 49 continue to do business there with no announced plans to leave. One of the government’s most powerful tools, at least on paper, to influence the behavior of companies beyond the jurisdiction of the embargo is the Iran Sanctions Act, devised to punish foreign companies that invest more than $20 million in a given year to develop Iran’s oil and gas fields. But in the 14 years since the law was passed, the government has never enforced it, in part for fear of angering America’s allies. That has given rise to situations like the one involving the South Korean engineering giant Daelim Industrial, which in 2007 won a $700 million contract to upgrade an Iranian oil refinery. According to the Congressional Research Service, the deal appeared to violate the Iran Sanctions Act, meaning Daelim could have faced a range of punishments, including denial of federal contracts. That is because the law covers not only direct investments, such as the purchase of shares and deals that yield royalties, but also contracts similar to Daelim’s to manage oil and gas development projects.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D61530F933A05752C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=honeywellinternationalinc">BUSINESS BRIEFING | EARNINGS; Profit And Sales Fall at Honeywell International<date>Published: January 30, 2010</date><text>Honeywell International, the manufacturing conglomerate, said Friday that fourth-quarter profit slipped 1 percent on lower sales from its aerospace and automation units.

I’d like to put an inexpensive wireless laptop in the kitchen for looking up recipes. What should I do to protect the machine on the countertop? A. Kitchen laptops can be incredibly helpful, not only for displaying recipes from the Internet and other electronic cookbooks, but for entertaining the cook between prep sessions with music, news and video. With so many substances in liquid and powder form potentially flying around, it is important to shield the laptop’s screen and keyboard. A clear plastic screen protector can help defend the laptop’s LCD against batter splatters, and a thin silicone keyboard cover can help keep loose ingredients from clogging up the machine. The NexTag comparison-shopping site can offer a general idea of what’s available for screen shields (bit.ly/6CZOMW) and keyboard covers (bit.ly/5bYzH3). Putting electrical tape over the computer ports can keep out clouds of flour or sugar. Just be sure to leave the laptop’s air vents unblocked so that heat doesn’t build up inside and cause crashes and other problems. Heat and consumer electronics don’t often mix well, so keep the laptop away from the stove, too. Although more expensive than a cheap laptop or netbook, a tablet or touch-screen computer may be more convenient for the kitchen. The community site TouchSmart Dev Zone has an article praising the Hewlett-Packard TouchSmart as a viable kitchen computer at bit.ly/6LYhus. The idea of a kitchen computer has been around since at least 1969, with the expensive Honeywell H316 (pictured on the Computer History Museum’s site at bit.ly/6vEiXG). A French touch-screen PC called the Qooq (qooq.com) is one of the more recent attempts at a dedicated kitchen computer. Turning Windows 7 Into a DVR Q. How do you record TV shows with Windows 7 Home Premium? A. The Media Center software included in some versions of Windows 7 lets you manage music, video and audio libraries  and even watch on a television connected to the computer. And if you have a television tuner card for the computer, you can attach the TV cable or an antenna to it and record live shows. Tuners can be either internal cards for desktop computers or external cards and U.S.B.-based devices for laptops; There are examples of both types on Microsoft’s site at bit.ly/6xLkMK. Several companies make tuners, including ADS Technologies (adstech.com) and AVerMedia (avermedia-usa.com). Once the TV tuner is installed, Media Center can record live television. To record a show in real time in Windows Media Center, go to the Start screen, to TV + Movies. Click on Live TV, find a program to record and click the Record button to start recording the show as a file on the hard drive. Microsoft has specific instructions on scheduling recordings, playing recorded shows and managing your TV collection at bit.ly/8pi9WN. TIP OF THE WEEK If you need reminders and don’t want to clutter up your computer monitor with paper Post-it notes, consider electronic sticky notes instead.

I’d like to put an inexpensive wireless laptop in the kitchen for looking up recipes. What should I do to protect the machine on the countertop? A. Kitchen laptops can be incredibly helpful, not only for displaying recipes from the Internet and other electronic cookbooks, but for entertaining the cook between prep sessions with music, news and video. With so many substances in liquid and powder form potentially flying around, it is important to shield the laptop’s screen and keyboard. A clear plastic screen protector can help defend the laptop’s LCD against batter splatters, and a thin silicone keyboard cover can help keep loose ingredients from clogging up the machine. The NexTag comparison-shopping site can offer a general idea of what’s available for screen shields (bit.ly/6CZOMW) and keyboard covers (bit.ly/5bYzH3). Putting electrical tape over the computer ports can keep out clouds of flour or sugar. Just be sure to leave the laptop’s air vents unblocked so that heat doesn’t build up inside and cause crashes and other problems. Heat and consumer electronics don’t often mix well, so keep the laptop away from the stove, too. Although more expensive than a cheap laptop or netbook, a tablet or touch-screen computer may be more convenient for the kitchen. The community site TouchSmart Dev Zone has an article praising the Hewlett-Packard TouchSmart as a viable kitchen computer at bit.ly/6LYhus. The idea of a kitchen computer has been around since at least 1969, with the expensive Honeywell H316 (pictured on the Computer History Museum’s site at bit.ly/6vEiXG). A French touch-screen PC called the Qooq (qooq.com) is one of the more recent attempts at a dedicated kitchen computer. Turning Windows 7 Into a DVR Q. How do you record TV shows with Windows 7 Home Premium? A. The Media Center software included in some versions of Windows 7 lets you manage music, video and audio libraries  and even watch on a television connected to the computer. And if you have a television tuner card for the computer, you can attach the TV cable or an antenna to it and record live shows. Tuners can be either internal cards for desktop computers or external cards and U.S.B.-based devices for laptops; There are examples of both types on Microsoft’s site at bit.ly/6xLkMK. Several companies make tuners, including ADS Technologies (adstech.com) and AVerMedia (avermedia-usa.com). Once the TV tuner is installed, Media Center can record live television. To record a show in real time in Windows Media Center, go to the Start screen, to TV + Movies. Click on Live TV, find a program to record and click the Record button to start recording the show as a file on the hard drive. Microsoft has specific instructions on scheduling recordings, playing recorded shows and managing your TV collection at bit.ly/8pi9WN.

In fact — because of the pressure on companies, and even governments, to reduce costs — many outsourcing businesses are booming. And a mood that was deeply uncertain just six months ago has turned much more optimistic.Unemployment has risen to 8.9 percent in the United States, a 26-year high, increasing longstanding pressures to “keep jobs in America.” But managers of companies big and small, squeezed between political pressures and the necessity of slimming down to survive, are choosing the bottom line. J. Brandon Black, president and chief executive of the Encore Capital Group, a debt collection company based in San Diego, said he planned to significantly increase his work force in India in the next few years, in part because of the tough economic times. “The thing it boils down to is the supply of well-trained educated labor at reasonable prices is just too great to ignore,” said Mr. Black. In India, “we’re hiring college-educated people.” The company is not doing that in the United States, where it would incur greater infrastructure and health care costs. “Outsourcing is here to stay,” Mr. Black said. Some of America’s biggest companies continue to invest in India, even as they trim costs at home. Hewlett-Packard said last month that it would cut an additional 6,400 jobs, on top of the 24,000 it said it was eliminating in September after a merger with Electronic Data Systems. About half of the September cuts are expected to come from the United States. In March, the computer giant said it was opening “HP Software University” in eight cities in India to train software testers. Last month, Honeywell International, the manufacturing behemoth based in Morristown, N.J., said it would invest $50 million in a new research and development facility in Bangalore that would employ 3,000. The move comes after Honeywell began a reorganization, closing some operations and trimming hundreds of jobs recently in the United States. The company declined to comment for this article, but when it initially announced its India plans, its chairman and chief executive, David M. Cote, said about half of Honeywell’s employees and half of its business were outside the United States. “Anything that creates any kind of protectionism, anything that stops the globalization activity, will be harmful,” he said. Many in India say they believe that demographics are on their side in the long run. “In most developed economies, the work force is aging,” said Ranjit Tinaikar, a partner with McKinsey, a consulting firm. The health care costs associated with employing those Western workers will continue to increase, he said, creating a “big opportunity” for India. A decade ago, McKinsey and India’s powerful information technology and outsourcing trade group, Nasscom, predicted that revenue from outsourcing by foreign companies would reach $50 billion in India in 2010. The global economic slowdown has delayed that by three or four quarters — revenue is predicted to reach $47 billion this year. And in April, Nasscom and McKinsey predicted that by 2020, outsourcing would yield $175 billion in revenue here. Growth will slow this year at many of India’s biggest outsourcing companies, however, because of the implosion of some of their largest clients: banks, mortgage servicing companies and Wall Street firms. But that does not mean revenue is no longer growing. “People who have never looked at outsourcing before are saying they have to do it,” said Amitabh Chaudhry, the chief executive of Infosys BPO, the outsourcing arm of one of the largest Indian information technology companies. He expects his unit to grow 25 to 30 percent this year, compared with 40 to 50 percent in the past. But political pressures are making a difference in how business is done. One growing trend, many outsourcing executives say, is placing more Indian employees in offices in the client’s home country. That way the job, ostensibly, does not move abroad. But over the long term, many are likely to be moved across the globe. “Our view is we start work onshore, then move it to Poland or Morocco, and then over time to India,” said Sachdev Ramakrishna, director of marketing for Steria, an information technology and outsourcing company. Steria is based in Paris, but one-quarter of its employees are in India, and it has offices in Morocco and Poland. “It’s like opening the tap in bits.” Since Steria’s clients include public utilities and governments in Europe, getting them comfortable with the idea of moving jobs abroad can take time. “Everyone recognizes that this is a changed world order, and the focus is more on preservation of jobs,” Mr. Ramakrishna said. And yet, new business is coming from all over: insurance companies with a growing number of elderly clients to monitor; pharmaceutical companies looking for more efficient ways to conduct drug trials and handle customer calls (even emergency inquiries, like overdose concerns); corporate legal teams balking at $350-an-hour fees to outside law firms. Even companies based in once union-friendly countries like France and Germany, as well as once-flush Middle Eastern firms, struggling media companies and companies that have been taken over by private equity firms are looking to outsource. Indian companies that relied on Wall Street and big banks for much of their business are aggressively learning new skills. East of New Delhi, on a corporate campus that was once farmland, dozens of Indian doctors, nurses and pharmacists are scheduling checkups for patients in the United States and monitoring clinical trial data for some of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. Thirty miles to the southwest, in the town of Gurgaon, hundreds of Indian lawyers in a glass high-rise are conducting due diligence on deals, combing through contracts and studying intellectual property rights for Western clients. In the legal field, “there’s been a sea change in awareness of what’s possible” in the last 12 months, said Daniel Reed, the chief executive of UnitedLex, which has its headquarters in Atlanta but has the bulk of its employees in Gurgaon. More and more sophisticated work is coming to India, he said. Matthew Fawcett, the general counsel of JDS Uniphase, a fiber optics company in California, started looking at outsourcing some legal work to India two years ago and is now a UnitedLex client. “When you run a legal department of a publicly traded company,” he said, “you care about cost and overhead.” Patni Computer Systems, which employs doctors and nurses in Noida, is working with health insurance companies in the United States whose policies provide home care for elderly patients. Patni’s doctors and nurses call the patients regularly for checkups, and if the patient needs a physical examination, they call the insurance company, which dispatches a nurse. “It’s a proactive measure, rather than reactive” said Sanjiv Kapur, the head of Patni’s outsourcing business, intended to prevent the patient from falling ill and winding up in the hospital. “It’s less costly for the insurance company.”  </text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E1D9143CF937A1575AC0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Corrections: For the Record<date>Published: September 24, 2008</date><text>An article on Tuesday about a new compound that eliminates the explosive potential of ammonium nitrate fertilizer misstated, in some editions, the year of the deadly bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.

The company, Honeywell, of Morris Township, N.J., has patented a method for combining ammonium nitrate fertilizer with a second type of fertilizer, ammonium sulfate. Ammonium nitrate can be soaked in diesel fuel to produce a powerful bomb and is a favorite of terrorists, but when chemically tied to the ammonium sulfate, its chemical structure is changed so that it is no longer explosive. Chemists had been looking for ways to render ammonium nitrate nonexplosive since the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was destroyed by a truck bomb in 1995, killing 168. In 2006, Canadian authorities arrested 17 people who they said were planning to use such bombs in Ontario. The Department of Homeland Security has certified the new fertilizer, which Honeywell calls ammonium sulfate nitrate, under a federal program devised to encourage such innovations by offering the manufacturers immunity from liability, according to Honeywell. The Homeland Security Department has been experimenting with diluting ammonium nitrate with coal dust. Growmark Inc., a cooperative based in Bloomington, Ill., distributes a fertilizer that blends ammonium nitrate and calcium. An agriculture expert not affiliated with Honeywell, Jack Rabin, associate director for farm programs at the Rutgers New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, said many companies were looking for ways to render ammonium nitrate inert, because the Department of Homeland Security requires that farmers safeguard their stockpiles of the widely used fertilizer and report their inventories to the government. “We are not going to replace ammonium nitrate fertilizer in the U.S. and around the world,” Mr. Rabin said. “It’s too good, too important and too valuable.” One problem, Mr. Rabin said, was that if nitrogen is the essential chemical in the fertilizer, then diluting it with other materials raises the number of tons that must be carried to the fields to get the desired amount of nitrogen. A fertilizer incorporating sulfur, as the Honeywell material does, would be helpful in the western United States, where sulfur is commonly used to lower pH values toward neutral, he said. But, he said, “in much of the world, the soils are too acid already.” But Mark Murray, director of strategic marketing for Honeywell’s resins and chemical business, said, the market was very broad. “Anywhere where ammonium nitrate is used today, this alternate form could be used effectively,” Mr. Murray said. Honeywell is already a large producer of ammonium sulfate fertilizer. The new fertilizer has less sulfur than ammonium sulfate, making it more widely usable, Honeywell said, and includes a mixture of nitrogen that is released promptly and nitrogen that becomes available slowly, making it a superior fertilizer.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Farnborough Air Show But manufacturers at the Farnborough International Airshow said this week that they were seeing signs that private jet sales in the American market were beginning to soften. The American market, traditionally the world’s biggest for business jets, has slipped well below 50 percent of global sales in recent months, according to Honeywell, the world’s largest maker of avionics, the electronic systems that are used to operate planes. At the end of 2007, American sales made up just 30 percent of global jet sales, Honeywell’s data showed. That slump is attributed to worries about the American economy and the growth of other markets, like Russia, South Asia and the Middle East. Interestingly, manufacturers say the price of jet fuel, which has nearly doubled from a year ago, is not much of a factor. To be sure, the drop is a recent development for the American market, which dominated jet sales for a decade. Makers of private jets  Bombardier of Canada, Dassault Aviation in France and Embraer of Brazil  are watching the market carefully. “Already we are seeing a slowdown in business jets in the United States,” Federico Curado, the chief executive of Embraer, said at the Farnborough air show, outside London. Pierre Beaudoin, the chairman of Bombardier, which makes the Learjet and the longer-range Global Express private jet, said he noticed a “softening” of the American market in April, though he stopped short of calling it a slowdown. “The United States is still growing, but its significance as a market has been reduced,” David Dixon, head of business aircraft for the Asia-Pacific region at Bombardier, said. “The initial indicator is in the charter market  that is increasing; discretionary calls to charters have shown some change,” Mr. Dixon said. In times of economic uncertainty, customers may hold off buying an aircraft, choosing to charter a plane or sign up with a fractional ownership company like NetJets, which allows them to buy travel time on corporate jets. The situation is a sharp contrast to past air shows, where customers flocked to see the latest technology and cabin features. At the Paris air show in 2005, executives stood in line in the rain to see Bombardier’s Global 5000, a luxury jet likened to a Porsche among Volkswagens. Back then, private jet sales were thriving and manufacturers boasted of billion-dollar backlogs. Private jet sales have softened once before in this decade. In 2000, many buyers canceled orders after the technology bubble burst, causing double-digit declines for jet sales. They began to rebound after the September 2001 attacks, when tightened security led many companies to put their executives on private planes. Executives at Farnborough said the business jet market was less directly susceptible to oil price fluctuations, since customers were typically wealthy and chief executives of corporations  though cost-cutting could eventually hit them also. But Mr. Curado said that financing was becoming more difficult for private plane purchases, which could be a concern given that Embraer is bringing out more business jets. At Farnborough, Embraer showed its Legacy 600 executive jet that can carry 14, as well as a mock-up for a new jet, the Phenom, and a cross-section of another plane, the Lineage, a bigger luxury jet. “The first signal of a downturn is demand for new jets,” Mr. Curado said. “The second is financing for planes already on order, and the third level of problems is cancellations or deferrals.” “So far credit today is much more selective than a year ago,” he said. “It’s not as easy as six months ago to finance new aircraft.” That could benefit companies able to pay cash or arrange their own financing, especially those in growth markets like the Middle East and Russia. Even so, American companies will continue to use private jets for ferrying executives whose time is valuable, said Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst in Port Washington, N.Y. “Scheduled airline travel no longer meets their needs,” Mr. Mann said.

Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst in Port Washington, N.Y. “Scheduled airline travel no longer meets their needs,” Mr. Mann said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/us/10coal.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">King Coal Country Debates a Sacrilege, Gas Heat<date>Published: June 10, 2008</date><text>POTTSVILLE, Pa.  Over the last 150 years, Schuylkill County has been famous for a rare hard coal called anthracite that fed the explosive growth of the East Coast during the Industrial Revolution, fostered the rise of the United Mine Workers union and powered many of the factories that supplied troops through both world wars. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Coal Enlarge This Image Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Schuylkill County officials are considering using natural gas to heat the prison and courthouse instead of locally mined coal. Enlarge This Image Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Anthracite coal burns longer and pollutes less, but bituminous is easier and cheaper to extract, making it more popular. Enlarge This Image Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Coal is part of us, said William Liptok, the director of the public works department in Schuylkill County in eastern Pennsylvania. Now county officials here are considering the unthinkable: converting from homegrown anthracite to natural gas at the county courthouse and prison. The proposal has led to outrage and soul-searching from state lawmakers and county residents who say it insults local history and sends the wrong message about the area’s leading export, which has been in decline for years. “Heritage should account for something,” said James J. Rhoades, a Republican state senator from Schuylkill County. But Mantura M. Gallagher, chairwoman of the Schuylkill County commissioners, which last month took up the proposal from Honeywell International Inc. to replace two coal-fired boilers that heat the courthouse and prison, said the commission could not spend “taxpayer money sentimentally.” The Honeywell bid, which also includes a new energy-efficient lighting system and an updated telephone system, would save the county a projected $3.2 million over 15 years. “You can’t pay millions of dollars for nostalgia,” Ms. Gallagher said. Under pressure from coal companies, the county gave them until last Friday to submit a counterproposal. Only one company, Reading Anthracite, made a submission, though details were not available Monday. “I’d call this the last of the last gasps for anthracite,” said Walter Licht, co-author of “The Face of Decline: The Pennsylvania Anthracite Region in the Twentieth Century.” For decades, local officials have tried to block natural gas pipelines from crossing Pennsylvania and passed ordinances requiring public buildings to use anthracite, but the recent debate has raised a thorny question about how much is too much to pay to protect local industry and history. The natural gas proposal is especially bitter for a region that has been in slow decline for more than 50 years as the rest of the nation has shifted to bituminous coal, which is easier to extract and, unlike anthracite, is enjoying a renaissance. It all started in 2006, when the county asked for proposals to replace the heating systems and Honeywell was the only company to respond. Honeywell also offered to pay for the difference if its cost-saving estimates were incorrect. Even if the price is not better, Mr. Rhoades said, an anthracite company should get the county contract if it is close to competitive, to ensure that the jobs, taxes and heritage stay in the county. He declined, however, to set a number on how “close” the anthracite bid should be. Mr. Rhoades said it would not be the first time the county had considered local culture in making financial decisions. He cited the recent sale of a historic building to Pennsylvania State University, rather than to the highest bidder, because the university could better preserve the building’s history. Nearly all of the nation’s anthracite deposits are in eight counties in eastern Pennsylvania between the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers. The coal is prized because it burns longer and produces less acid-rain pollutants since it has a high carbon and low sulfur content. But what makes this brittle and lustrous rock, often known as black diamond, so hard and pure is that it is often deeper and under greater pressure than other forms of coal, which also explains why it is expensive and dangerous to extract. The anthracite mines in this area have seen more than 30,000 deaths since 1870, and were the site of the great anthracite strike of 1902, which propelled the United Mine Workers of America to ascendancy and required the intervention of President Theodore Roosevelt as most of the East Coast’s major cities were on the brink of losing heat. With the shift to bituminous coal, however, domestic anthracite production has fallen to 1.5 million tons in 2006, from 46 million tons in 1950. Since most of the mines in the area have closed and been flooded, local leaders have shifted their efforts in recent years to attracting prisons, landfills and casinos to the area. The skyrocketing cost of home heating has created a niche market for small anthracite-burning stoves to supplement home heating, but oil prices would have to rise a lot more for that demand to make a real financial difference to the region, said Mr. Licht, the author. Brian R. Rich, president of the Reading Anthracite Company, has bigger hopes. He said anthracite was poised to make a broader comeback as the price of oil had made all forms of coal more competitive. “These people have it exactly backwards,” Mr. Rich hollered over the dragging rumble of a four-story-tall dragline shovel at his anthracite strip mine in Wadesville, Pa., about three miles from Pottsville. Mr. Rich said he had seen a 20 percent growth in revenue in the last five years as the price of anthracite rose to about $150 a ton, up from $70. “What the county is doing,” he said, “is damaging the esprit de corps of all anthracite workers at a time when those officials should be doing the opposite.” Downtown here, anthracite’s impact is unmistakable. A five-foot-tall boulder of the shiny rock sits in front of the Reading Anthracite building. At the Sovereign Bank, formerly known as Miners National Bank, the cast-bronze doors depict scenes of deep mining operations. “Coal is part of us,” said William Liptok, director of the county’s public works department. Not only does nearly every family in town have roots in mining, Mr. Liptok said, but virtually everyone breathes in coal dust, since it wafts into the air in the winter when trucks remove the boilers’ ashes. Lisa M. Mahall, the Schuylkill County engineer and real estate director, said shifting from anthracite was not a decision made lightly, but she remained skeptical that anthracite companies could compete. Even though anthracite is cheaper per unit of energy than natural gas, the coal boilers are more expensive to operate and repair than gas boilers, Ms. Mahall said. Asked if the cost savings by shifting to gas would involve layoffs, Ms. Mahall said no, adding, however, that it would involve cutting back on overtime. Roy Manbeck, 61, who draws a quarter of his income by hauling 400 tons of anthracite to the prison and courthouse each year, said he found himself caught between two unattractive prospects. “If I don’t have anthracite to haul, I’m out of work and in big trouble,” he said. “I’m also not thrilled with the idea of seeing taxes keep going up to pay for heating.” More Articles in US »POTTSVILLE, Pa.  Over the last 150 years, Schuylkill County has been famous for a rare hard coal called anthracite that fed the explosive growth of the East Coast during the Industrial Revolution, fostered the rise of the United Mine Workers union and powered many of the factories that supplied troops through both world wars.

That is partly because domestic commercial airlines are performing worse than ever, especially in terms of customer service in the air and on the ground. “I will do anything to avoid airports or being wedged into a seat on an airline with no food,” said Cheryl Tiegs, who has been flying for business on all sorts of commercial and private planes since she began appearing as a model in the mid-1960s. Ms. Tiegs, who lives in Los Angeles and flies almost weekly, does not own a jet. But her work  she owns a skin-care and beauty products company and does corporate-sponsored appearances  sometimes allows her to travel by private jet. While Ms. Tiegs usually flies commercially, if business-jet transportation is available she will “hop right on board,” she said. “If not, I’ll drive if I can. I’ve even looked into taking a train halfway across the country.” The business-jet market may well slow as the economy weakens further, but industry analysts say there is no sign yet of its decline. According to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, a record 1,138 business jets were delivered in 2007, compared with 886 in 2006. Passengers can fly on jets in many categories, from small-capacity light cabins to midsize and supermidsize cabins to so-called heavy-metal jets. The private-jet market has experienced “little discernible effect” from the current economy, said Rob Wilson, president for business aviation at Honeywell Aerospace. Honeywell predicts that with manufacturers’ backlogs exceeding two and a half years, this will be another record year for deliveries, and that sales of 14,000 new business jets from 2007 through 2017 will exceed $233 billion. The business-jet market is heavily segmented, with the most visible users being corporate and private owners, and those who buy shares in jets for an annual number of on-demand flight hours. But in recent years, sales have been helped by companies that guarantee a specific number of annual flight hours without ownership requirements, and by a rapidly growing market in charter flights. The business-jet market faces challenges, among them mounting congestion at general aviation airports that cater to big markets. The airline industry is also campaigning to mark business jets as contributors to congestion and therefore delays. Meanwhile, a new segment of the market has emerged around new very light jets, also known as microjets, which are compact, short-range, four- to six-seat aircraft priced at the lowest end of the market. The Federal Aviation Administration has estimated that as many as 4,000 may be in the skies by 2015. And the parsing of the market continues. Last week, a group headed by Alex Wilcox, who was a founding executive at JetBlue, announced the start-up of a private-jet company called JetSuite, which has ordered 50 new Embraer Phenom 100 very light jets with options to order 50 more. The company’s business plan is based on its partners’ buying the jets and allowing them to be used part time by JetSuite for charter flights, starting next year in Southern California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah, Mr. Wilcox said. The lower cost and fuel efficiency of using the Phenom 100s will halve the cost of chartering a small jet to about $3,500 an hour from the typical $7,000, he said. The price is comparable to flying first class on commercial airlines’ regional routes in the Southwest  with a big difference in time saved and other conveniences, like the use of small, conveniently located airports, he added. “If you’re traveling with three or four people who would otherwise have flown domestic first class, and you want to go on your own schedule, we’ll be in the same ballpark,” he said.

Net income climbed to $643 million, or 85 cents a share, from $526 million, or 66 cents, a year earlier, the company, based in Morris Township, N.J., said. Sales rose 11 percent, to $8.9 billion, with two-thirds of the increase coming from outside the United States. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) SCHLUMBERGER MISSES MARK Schlumberger, the world's largest oil field services company, reported a nearly 14 percent rise in first-quarter income Friday, but results missed Wall Street forecasts and were seen as largely lackluster. Still, the company predicted growth for the remainder of the year as long as the global economy avoids a severe recession. The Houston-based company said income in the January-March period was $1.34 billion, or $1.09 a share, versus $1.18 billion, or 96 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding discontinued operations, earnings amounted to $1.06 a share. Revenue rose to $6.29 billion from $5.46 billion. (AP) MORE INTEREST IN EXPRO The American oil field services company Halliburton said on Friday that it was considering a counterbid for the Expro International Group of Britain. Any offer would be in cash, it said, and at a premium to that made by the private equity firm Candover and Goldman Sachs. Expro, which is also an oil services company, has agreed to a bid of £1.61 billion ($3.2 billion) from funds managed by Candover and Goldman Sachs. (REUTERS) BID FOR INSURER WITHDRAWN The American buyout group J. C. Flowers has formally withdrawn its £3.5 billion ($7 billion) pursuit of the British life insurer Friends Provident, leaving the company to press ahead alone with a planned overhaul and asset sales. The private equity group, which owns 2.7 percent of Friends, had been widely expected to pull out on Friday, having failed to bring Friends' management to the negotiating table. (REUTERS)WENDY'S REJECTS 2 OFFERS Trian Partners, an investment company controlled by the billionaire Nelson Peltz, said in a regulatory filing Friday that Wendy's International had rejected two offers to be purchased, prompting it to seek a special shareholder meeting. Peter May, president of Trian, said it learned Thursday that Wendy's had rejected two offers: One a combination of Wendy's and Arby's, which Mr. Peltz owns through another company, and the other a cash offer of more than $900 million and stock. In its own regulatory filing Friday, Wendy's said it rejected both offers as inadequate. (AP) NO RAISE AT AMAZON.COM Despite a blockbuster year in which Amazon.com's profit more than doubled, compensation for its chief executive officer, Jeffrey P. Bezos, was unchanged from the previous year. Mr. Bezos, above, received a salary of $81,840 for 2007. His compensation also included $1.2 million for personal security and business travel -- the same amount as in 2006. He was not granted a bonus or awarded any stock or options. Amazon said Mr. Bezos, who founded the company and holds a 23.8 percent stake, has never received stock-based compensation.

Shares of Sears fell 3 percent in after-hours trading after it said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the secured credit agreement would end in July. Sears said the termination of the agreement, a 364-day secured facility for a commitment of up to $1 billion, was not expected to have any effect on its liquidity.

One of the companies, United Technologies, said it expected 2008 earnings to grow by 10 percent to 14 percent. It saw global growth and reaffirmed its profit forecast for the current year. The other, Honeywell International, forecast profit growth of 16 to 21 percent, broadly above Wall Street estimates, with strength in its aerospace business and continued growth in emerging markets. Honeywell, of Morris Township, N.J., said its outlook, which called for stronger growth than some other blue-chip conglomerates have forecast, was achievable even in the face of a slowing economy. The company said it expected 2008 profit of $3.65 to $3.80 a share. That was largely ahead of analysts’ forecasts of $3.67, according to Reuters Estimates. “Over all, we’re planning for a softening global economy, and we expect some spillover of the weakening in the U.S. residential and credit markets,” Honeywell’s chief financial officer, David J. Anderson, told investors. “But on the other hand, we expect that to be offset by the relative strength that we’re experiencing in emerging regions.” The company reiterated its 2007 earnings outlook of $3.14 to $3.16 a share, in line with analysts’ estimates of $3.16. United Technologies, based in Hartford, is the world’s largest maker of elevators and air-conditioners as well as a leading producer of armaments systems. It said it expected a profit of $4.65 to $4.85 a share next year on revenue of $59 billion. The projected profit increase matched a forecast the company provided in October, but on Thursday the company offered greater detail. Analysts tabulated by Reuters Estimates had looked for $4.85 a share, on sales of $57.7 billion. United Technologies also reiterated a full-year estimate for 2007 earnings of $4.22 to $4.25 a share. The company said it expected more than 60 percent of its sales to come from outside the United States. United Technologies, whose subsidiary companies include Sikorsky helicopters, Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners, said it expected sales from existing businesses to grow in the mid-single digits and predicted higher operating profit in all six business units. The company has benefited from global aviation demand and investment in infrastructure projects, particularly in China and India. “It’s been a very good aero cycle and we see that continuing,” the president, Louis R. Chenevert, said. Mr. Chenevert is expected to become chief executive next year, succeeding George David, who has said he will stay on as chairman for two to three years. “Commercial construction looks robust at this time,” Mr. Chenevert said, adding that the housing market is softer than the company thought a year ago and was likely to experience “continuing stress.” More Articles in Business »Two big manufacturers said Thursday that they expected stronger growth next year despite the slowing economy.

Analysts tabulated by Reuters Estimates had looked for $4.85 a share, on sales of $57.7 billion. United Technologies also reiterated a full-year estimate for 2007 earnings of $4.22 to $4.25 a share. The company said it expected more than 60 percent of its sales to come from outside the United States. United Technologies, whose subsidiary companies include Sikorsky helicopters, Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners, said it expected sales from existing businesses to grow in the mid-single digits and predicted higher operating profit in all six business units. The company has benefited from global aviation demand and investment in infrastructure projects, particularly in China and India. “It’s been a very good aero cycle and we see that continuing,” the president, Louis R. Chenevert, said. Mr. Chenevert is expected to become chief executive next year, succeeding George David, who has said he will stay on as chairman for two to three years. “Commercial construction looks robust at this time,” Mr. Chenevert said, adding that the housing market is softer than the company thought a year ago and was likely to experience “continuing stress.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/realestate/18njzo.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Coming Soon: Affordable Views<date>Published: November 18, 2007</date><text>BAYONNE NOW heres something different: condominiums that will offer panoramic water views, clubhouse amenities, adjacent parks, and ferry or train commutes to Manhattan, but are not characterized by their developer as ultraluxury. They are not going to be ultraexpensive, either: the Hudson Bay Club here, which has sales opening in January, plans to ask under $300,000 for one-bedroom units, and start in the mid-$300,000s for two- or three-bedroom condos. The condos are on the Newark Bay side of Bayonne, where a modest revitalization has taken hold over the last few years. The city, once an industrial powerhouse, is pinning dreams of a more expansive makeover on the other side of its peninsula, facing New York City. There, it plans to redevelop a huge former naval base; builders have already been chosen for projects that are to create a total of 6,700 housing units, 750 hotel rooms, 340,000 square feet of retailing, 465,000 square feet of cultural space, and 242,000 square feet of civic space. The scale of the project is even more massive than what has taken place in neighboring Jersey City and Hoboken. But city authorities estimate that transforming Bayonne in such fashion could take 15 to 30 years. In the interim, small-scale progress is occurring on the citys west side, where public improvements have attracted private developers. Near the Hudson Bay Club condo site, there is a new wetlands park with a biking trail, and a boardwalk meandering through a marshy area. Also, a pocket park was created on the tip of the point of land where construction vehicles are now busily at work, preparing the property for construction. And the city has spruced up and polished a beautiful older park, the rambling Stephen R. Gregg.

The Hudson Bay Clubs builder, Baker Residential, a company based in Pleasantville, N.Y., that likes to focus on urban infill projects with waterside access, has already completed two condo projects not far away in its Newark Bay-side development. The first, in 2004, was the Boatworks, a community of 160 town homes built on the site where John F. Kennedys World War II PT-109 was assembled and launched; a refurbished marina there now berths private crafts. Next came Bay Harbor Club, 31 condos in a four-story building right on the bay; the project went up on what had been an empty acre sandwiched between houses in a long-established neighborhood. The Bay Harbor building served as a model for the five condo structures that will rise at Hudson Bay Club, housing a total of 158 units, said Clark D. Atwood, Bakers general manager in New Jersey. The elevator-equipped buildings all have abundant windows and balconies, and assigned parking spaces in an underground garage. It took longer than expected to get the Hudson Bay Club project under way because of an arduous cleanup of chromium-contaminated soil that had to be completed by the former landowner, Honeywell International, Mr. Atwood said. State environmental authorities certified that the land was safe several months ago, he added. The Hudson Bay Club condos, which are offered in 27 different floor plans, will range in size from 1,000 to 1,700 square feet, he said. The penthouse units will have two levels. Mimicking what has become routine in buildings in Gold Coast communities, the Hudson Bay clubhouse will offer a fitness center, an entertainment hall, a kitchen and an outdoor pool. Each building will also have its own landscaped terrace.

In its annual forecast, released yesterday in Atlanta at the National Business Aviation Association convention, Honeywell Aerospace reported that for the first time international buyers  led by Europeans  would account for slightly over half the purchases in business jets over the next five years. The industry is expected to sell more than 1,000 jets this year, also a record. The sector is in the midst of a major global expansion, as cultural opposition to private jets wanes in Europe, as business generally expands around the world and as the weak dollar makes purchasing a private jet more attractive. Prices range from about $4 million to $50 million. In Europe, cultural attitudes have long been hostile to business jets, given the association with vulgar tycoons flying their poodles to the Côte dAzur. That has changed. Part of the shift can be explained by the growth of NetJets. The company, founded by Richard T. Santulli and now a Berkshire Hathaway holding, started a European subsidiary in 1996. It sells fractional ownership of business jets and also markets per-hour flying in increments of 25 hours. The European venture wasnt an instant success, Berkshire Hathaways chairman, Warren E. Buffett, said in his annual letter to investors for 2006. After five years of operation there, we had acquired only 80 customers, he said. And by midyear 2006, our cumulative pretax loss had risen to $212 million. But European demand has now exploded, with a net of 589 customers having been added in 2005-6. NetJets, he said, is now operating profitably in Europe. In the business jet industry, where sales have been growing annually since 2003, Honeywells annual forecast, considered a bellwether, is eagerly anticipated. The forecast said that deliveries of business jets next year were expected to be around 1,300, or 300 more than this year. Rob Wilson, the president of Honeywell Aerospaces business and general aviation division, said he thought hard-nosed business decisions were driving growth abroad. A weak dollar against the euro is part of the reason, he said. But most of the European sales are because of the rapidly growing number of charter operations, rather than sales of company planes. In Europe, he said, a businessperson often has the need now to be in several cities or countries in the same day. Although ground transportation and air transport is efficient in Europe, this really opens up new waves of productivity for these people. Business jets can fly into more than 1,000 airports in Europe, compared with about 100 airports for commercial airlines. In Asia, sales are being driven partly by growing demand for trans-Pacific flights on long-range planes. Across the board, long-range business jets will account for more sales than any other segment of the market, Honeywell said. Over the five years of the forecast, the United States will take about 49 percent of deliveries; Europe 22 percent; Asia 15 percent; Latin America 10 percent; and the Middle East and Africa region 4 percent. In a recent interview, Mr. Santulli of NetJets marveled at the vast wealth driving this growth. He also said that not all of the big long-range luxury jets, like Gulfstreams, are ferrying teams of executives across the seas. Take a wild guess.

The company was accused of helping to topple President Salvador Allende Gossens of Chile and was the focus of numerous investigations, and the conglomerate as a business model faded over the years. Instead, the new mantra became one of stressing core competencies  in other words, concentrating on a relatively few businesses in which the companies excelled. But among the flood of companies reporting second-quarter earnings, there is a largely unheralded trend: the conglomerates are back, and back in a big way. And investors are noticing. I.T.T., now a $7.8 billion-a-year company based in a modest office park in White Plains, reported a 52 percent surge in earnings on the basis of sales in water treatment systems and military and surveillance systems. The companys chief executive, Steven R. Loranger, says the company is on track for a fifth consecutive year of record profitability. Its stock trades at very rich price-to-earnings ratio of about 20, based on current-year earnings. Weve reinvented ourselves, Mr. Loranger said. Other revitalized conglomerates include Textron, based in Providence, R.I., and the owner of companies like Cessna and Bell Helicopter. Textron beat earnings forecasts by 24 cents a share, according to a Cowen &amp; Company analysts report that called the period a blowout quarter. And Honeywell International, a diversified industrial company based in Morristown, N.J., recorded a 17 percent rise in second-quarter profit, largely on the strength of its aerospace holdings. This universe of 25 to 30 companies is outperforming the market as a whole and would be doing even better if not for the fact that General Electric, which pioneered many of the management techniques they are using, has performed relatively poorly. Still, C. Stephen Tusa Jr., an analyst at JPMorgan Securities, estimates that even after recent volatility, the financial markets are giving the 13 diversified industrial companies he covers a P/E ratio of 18 for the current year, compared with about 15.5 for the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index. Its a 15 percent premium, Mr. Tusa said. This class of companies includes such well-known giants as United Technologies, 3M and Siemens, but also a raft of smaller companies like Danaher, Emerson Electric and Illinois Tool Works. Warren E. Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway also owns diverse industrial companies, but because it does not seek to actively manage its holdings in an integrated fashion, it isnt generally included as part of this category. To some extent, the new conglomerates have simply become lucky. They are riding a global infrastructure spending boom for airports and airlines, power systems, waste water and environmental projects, and hospitals and health care systems, not to mention record government spending on military projects and security surveillance. Their ability to assemble product offerings from different industries is a source of strength, they say. Ken Cornelius, president and chief executive of Siemens One, an Atlanta-based subsidiary of the German parent company, says Siemens can provide up to 40 percent of the goods and services needed to build a new hospital, for example, ranging from medical imaging equipment and information technology systems to power systems and building automation equipment. Many of the diversified industrial companies are well positioned to take advantage of global opportunities because their offshore sales are typically 35 to 50 percent of their total revenue. But the chief executives of these companies (as well as many Wall Street analysts) say that theres more to it than just luck  that they have largely transformed how they do business over the past five years. Gone are the days when C.E.O.s bought largely unrelated companies and held them in nearly passive portfolios of assets without seeking to transform their managements, processes or products. When you look back at the history, the companies were put together without any real integration, said David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell. They were really just holding companies. They didnt try to do anything to make the businesses better. This new breed of C.E.O. has embraced many of the techniques of John F. Welch Jr. at G.E. and borrowed liberally from the lean production techniques of Toyota Motor as well. Technological systems, like enterprise resource planning software, allow them to manage their companies more tightly. They are training top executives to think about their whole enterprises, not just about small pieces of the whole. And rather than being sleepy backwaters, some of these conglomerates have become innovators. Weve had to radically change every aspect of how we make decisions, how we behave and how we execute, said Lewis B.

After the crash, which killed all 154 people on the airliner, the Americans, Joseph Lepore, 42, of Bay Shore, N.Y., and Jan Paul Paladino, 35, of Westhampton, N.Y., were held in Brazil until December, then allowed to return to the United States and their Long Island homes. They were flying for ExcelAire Service Inc. of Ronkonkoma, N.Y. They had picked up a new Embraer Legacy from a Brazilian factory and were flying it back to the United States. The airliner that went down was a Boeing 737 operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes. A Brazilian federal judge in Sinop, a small Amazon town, agreed with the results of a Brazilian Federal Police inquiry and ruled that the case against Mr. Lepore and Mr. Paladino should move forward. The judge ordered the Americans to appear before him on Aug. 27 for questioning. Four Brazilian air traffic controllers were also charged. I came to this conclusion because it was the only conclusion available to me, Judge Murilo Mendes said in a brief telephone interview. He said the two would not be permitted to give evidence in the United States. But the pilots lawyer, Joel R. Weiss, said that endangering an aircraft was not one of the crimes listed in the extradition treaty between the United States and Brazil. He said he had not seen the judges charge and could not say what the next step would be until he had read it. The Federal Police said that the two Americans and three of the four Brazilians had not knowingly caused the crash, but that their negligence had contributed to Brazils worst air disaster. If found guilty of the charge against them, which is akin to involuntary manslaughter, they could face between two and five years in jail, a court official, Fábio Paz, said. The fourth air traffic controller faces a stiffer charge because he had been aware that the two planes were flying at the same altitude in the same area but did not take the necessary steps to warn them of the impending collision, the police said. The United States National Transportation Safety Board last month attributed the crash partly to the cockpit systems failure to alert the American crew that the jets anticollision equipment had failed. The equipment also helps ground-based radar to recognize the airplane; those signals were received only intermittently by the Brazilian system. Honeywell, which built the system on the corporate jet, said that it did alert the pilots if it failed, and that it met all American requirements. Families of victims have filed suit in New York and Miami against the charter company, ExcelAire, and Honeywell. Lockheed-Martin and Raytheon, which provided the air traffic control system, and Embraer, which built the airplane, are also being sued. Andrew Downie reported from Rio de Janeiro. Correction: June 4, 2007 An article on Saturday about charges being brought in Brazil against two American pilots, whose corporate jet was involved in a mid-air collision last year over the Amazon with a Brazilian airliner that went down with 154 people aboard, misstated a Brazilian judges position on the case. He said in a statement issued in Portuguese on Friday that the two pilots, Joseph Lepore and Jan Paul Paladino, should be charged with exposing an aircraft to danger; he did not say they were guilty of having done so. More Articles in International »Correction Appended WASHINGTON, June 1  A Brazilian judge on Friday indicted the two American pilots of a corporate jet that collided with an airliner over the Amazon on Sept. 29, along with four Brazilian air traffic controllers. After the crash, which killed all 154 people on the airliner, the Americans, Joseph Lepore, 42, of Bay Shore, N.Y., and Jan Paul Paladino, 35, of Westhampton, N.Y., were held in Brazil until December, then allowed to return to the United States and their Long Island homes. They were flying for ExcelAire Service Inc. of Ronkonkoma, N.Y. They had picked up a new Embraer Legacy from a Brazilian factory and were flying it back to the United States. The airliner that went down was a Boeing 737 operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes. A Brazilian federal judge in Sinop, a small Amazon town, agreed with the results of a Brazilian Federal Police inquiry and ruled that the case against Mr. Lepore and Mr. Paladino should move forward. The judge ordered the Americans to appear before him on Aug. 27 for questioning. Four Brazilian air traffic controllers were also charged. I came to this conclusion because it was the only conclusion available to me, Judge Murilo Mendes said in a brief telephone interview.

The device, a transponder, is crucial to the functioning of anticollision warning systems. Brazilian officials said it had ceased working on an Embraer Legacy business jet before it had its encounter with the Boeing and resumed functioning afterward. Some transponders built by Honeywell, an American company, have been ordered repaired by the Federal Aviation Administration because they have stopped broadcasting unexpectedly in some cases.

The Boeing 737, operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes, crashed in the jungle, killing all 154 people aboard. Experts said that if the planes collided in flight, it would be the second time in the quarter-century since anticollision systems came into common use that two planes with the systems had done so.

Skip to next paragraph Map of the Site Enlarge This Image Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times An area examined for chromium residues. The forlorn stretch of fallow land  an area the size of 34 football fields  is a casualty of Jersey City's industrial past, poisoned by a half-century's worth of residues from the processing of chromium, the versatile substance used in paints, stainless steel and automobile bumpers. In its most dangerous form  called hexavalent chromium  the wastes can cause cancer and other health problems. No one is allowed on the site now, but before the dangers of chromium were known, the Roosevelt Drive-In operated here, and later there was a Valley Fair department store. Built on top of the crumbly gray, green and yellow cinders of the chromium slag  more than 25 feet deep in spots  the buildings had to be abandoned long ago because the ground beneath them buckled and heaved so badly that they broke apart. If ever there was unloved land, this was it, and for years the city was willing to just let it lie there. But Jersey City's recent revival as a less expensive alternative to Manhattan has brought town house developments practically up to the edge of the chromium field. City officials are impatient for the site to be cleaned up, redeveloped, and put back on the tax rolls. But there also is a broader question at stake, one that old industrial cities across the country have grappled with: Must every last bit of contamination be removed, at great expense, before land can be reused? Or can pollution just be covered over so blighted neighborhoods can be redeveloped more quickly? Most cities and states, including New York and New Jersey, have adopted what are called brownfield laws, which allow certain types of pollution to be left in place and capped. Developers, protected from future liability by these laws, have opened up vast stretches of urban wasteland to new construction. For their part, environmentalists say they have a "preference for permanence," meaning that they would rather see pollution completely removed, especially if housing is going to be built there. The cleanup question is particularly important in Jersey City, which for years was one of the world's biggest processors of chromium ore. Millions of tons of residue from three plants were used to fill in wetlands and construction sites all over the city and in nearby towns. Besides forming the former drive-in's foundation, the hazardous material lies beneath stores, houses, schools, even the municipal incinerator. Honeywell Corporation, the high-tech giant with headquarters in Morristown, is responsible for the drive-in site even though it never produced chromium in Jersey City. In 1954, its corporate predecessor, Allied Signal, bought the stock of the Mutual Chemical Company  which operated one of the world's largest chromium processing plants on land across Route 440 from the drive-in. For every pound of chromium ore Mutual processed, it created two pounds of slag, which it just dumped on the banks of the Hackensack River, eventually creating a chromium waste field covering more than 30 acres. The slag also became fill in other parts of Jersey City. Honeywell has cleaned some of the smaller sites, but until recently it was slow to do anything about the former drive-in, in part because it insists that capping is appropriate. Honeywell argues that chromium's main danger is through inhalation, and capping with clean fill eliminates the chance of any chromium dust becoming airborne. However, some scientists also believe that ingesting chromium-contaminated water could be dangerous if it somehow leaked into weakened underground water pipes. Honeywell probably would have capped the drive-in site and moved on long ago had it not been for a coalition of residents, church groups and environmental advocates who thought capping was inadequate, especially if the land was to be used for housing. They sued in 1995 under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to force the company to haul off everything. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in New York Region &gt;JERSEY CITY  Just past the old municipal incinerator, near the car lots, strip malls and fast-food joints heaped on this city's far west side, a long fence juts into the shoulder of busy Route 440.

But even as it backed the Commission's ruling, the long-awaited decision from the Court of First Instance appeared to make it somewhat harder in the future for Brussels to reject merger proposals. Ruling on an appeal by the companies, the court backed the commission's 2001 veto of the merger, saying that the companies' "pre-existing dominant position on the market for jet engines for large regional aircraft would be strengthened." The court also said that "dominant positions would be created" by a G.E. and Honeywell combination in engines for corporate jet aircraft and for small marine gas turbines. But the ruling rejected elements of the commission's veto of the takeover. In particular, the court found the commission had not solidly proved that the merger would create "conglomerate effects," or advantages based on a company's ability to bundle many services into one package, offering better deals and undercutting competition. Each of the parties - the commission, Europe's top competition authority, General Electric and Honeywell - found things to like in the ruling. Neelie Kroes, the current competition commissioner, said the companies did not sufficiently address the overlap in their businesses that the commission objected to. "It illustrates that in such complex transactions it is crucial for merging parties to come up with adequate remedies for all competition concerns identified by the commission," she said in a statement, sidestepping the commission's failure to make its technical arguments. G.E. said it was pleased with the ruling, noting the court's rejection of the speculative nature of the commission's conglomerate effects argument. "The ruling means the hurdle the commission must jump when challenging these types of deals will be higher," said Hendrik Bourgeois, G.E.'s senior counsel in Europe. Others agreed that G.E. had scored a victory on that point. "It is a good outcome for companies like General Electric with a wide range of products because it drives a stake through the heart of the conglomerate effects theory," said David Wood, a competition lawyer in the Brussels office of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. Mr. Wood was a competition official at the European Commission at the time of the merger ruling in 2001, but he was not directly involved in the case. The commission conceded defeat on that aspect of the case. "We will take today's ruling into account in the ongoing review of how to deal with mergers like this," said Jonathan Todd, a commission spokesman on competition issues. He noted, however, that other case law from Europe's top court, the European Court of Justice, gave the commission grounds to use the conglomerate effects argument. Honeywell said in a statement that it was glad the court found the commission's theory on bundling to be "flawed" and "incorrect." One of the commission's arguments for blocking the merger was that G.E. could pressure aircraft builders to take a bundle of products, including Honeywell's avionics equipment, which would give Honeywell an unfair advantage over its competitors. Mr. Bourgeois said G.E. did not fully address the overlap between the companies because during eleventh-hour talks it was led to believe it had to overcome the conglomerate effects argument to get approval. "That tainted the negotiating process," he said. "Had the overlaps been the real issue during the negotiations, that would have been solved." If the commission had blocked the deal purely on the basis of conglomerate effects arguments, the court would have overturned the commission's veto, he said. But the commission's victory in the case left G.E. branded as a dominant player, which some lawyers argued here could pose a problem if it ever found itself involved in a controversial merger in Europe again. Mr. Bourgeois dismissed this. "I am not too concerned about being defined as dominant," he said. "Any decision, claim or case today would have to look at market positions today, not at what the market looked like before 2001." More Articles in Business &gt;BRUSSELS, Dec. 14 - In a verdict that offered something to both sides, Europe's second-highest court supported the European Commission's rejection of the $42 billion merger of General Electric and Honeywell. But even as it backed the Commission's ruling, the long-awaited decision from the Court of First Instance appeared to make it somewhat harder in the future for Brussels to reject merger proposals. Ruling on an appeal by the companies, the court backed the commission's 2001 veto of the merger, saying that the companies' "pre-existing dominant position on the market for jet engines for large regional aircraft would be strengthened." The court also said that "dominant positions would be created" by a G.E. and Honeywell combination in engines for corporate jet aircraft and for small marine gas turbines. But the ruling rejected elements of the commission's veto of the takeover. In particular, the court found the commission had not solidly proved that the merger would create "conglomerate effects," or advantages based on a company's ability to bundle many services into one package, offering better deals and undercutting competition. Each of the parties - the commission, Europe's top competition authority, General Electric and Honeywell - found things to like in the ruling. Neelie Kroes, the current competition commissioner, said the companies did not sufficiently address the overlap in their businesses that the commission objected to. "It illustrates that in such complex transactions it is crucial for merging parties to come up with adequate remedies for all competition concerns identified by the commission," she said in a statement, sidestepping the commission's failure to make its technical arguments. G.E. said it was pleased with the ruling, noting the court's rejection of the speculative nature of the commission's conglomerate effects argument. "The ruling means the hurdle the commission must jump when challenging these types of deals will be higher," said Hendrik Bourgeois, G.E.'s senior counsel in Europe. Others agreed that G.E. had scored a victory on that point. "It is a good outcome for companies like General Electric with a wide range of products because it drives a stake through the heart of the conglomerate effects theory," said David Wood, a competition lawyer in the Brussels office of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. Mr. Wood was a competition official at the European Commission at the time of the merger ruling in 2001, but he was not directly involved in the case. The commission conceded defeat on that aspect of the case. "We will take today's ruling into account in the ongoing review of how to deal with mergers like this," said Jonathan Todd, a commission spokesman on competition issues. He noted, however, that other case law from Europe's top court, the European Court of Justice, gave the commission grounds to use the conglomerate effects argument. Honeywell said in a statement that it was glad the court found the commission's theory on bundling to be "flawed" and "incorrect." One of the commission's arguments for blocking the merger was that G.E. could pressure aircraft builders to take a bundle of products, including Honeywell's avionics equipment, which would give Honeywell an unfair advantage over its competitors. Mr. Bourgeois said G.E. did not fully address the overlap between the companies because during eleventh-hour talks it was led to believe it had to overcome the conglomerate effects argument to get approval. "That tainted the negotiating process," he said. "Had the overlaps been the real issue during the negotiations, that would have been solved." If the commission had blocked the deal purely on the basis of conglomerate effects arguments, the court would have overturned the commission's veto, he said. But the commission's victory in the case left G.E. branded as a dominant player, which some lawyers argued here could pose a problem if it ever found itself involved in a controversial merger in Europe again. Mr. Bourgeois dismissed this. "I am not too concerned about being defined as dominant," he said. "Any decision, claim or case today would have to look at market positions today, not at what the market looked like before 2001."</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/business/yourmoney/27boss.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">No Boundaries, Please<date>Published: November 27, 2005</date><text>I GREW up on a dead-end street in Philadelphia.

The transaction gives full control to Honeywell, a major supplier to the petrochemical refinery industry. UOP's technologies are used to process petrochemicals. Honeywell said it expected the transaction to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval. The final value of the deal may be adjusted for cash and outstanding debt in the venture at closing. The deal is the first major acquisition for Honeywell's specialty materials business, which has spent much of the last four years divesting mature, slow-growth operations in an effort to increase profitability. Honeywell, based in Morris Township, N.J., forecast sales of more than $4 billion in 2006 for its specialty materials business, which rang up revenue of $3.5 billion in 2004 before divesting its industrial wax and its American nylon carpet fibers business. UOP, whose technologies are mainly used in oil-derived products and chemicals, had revenue of about $1.2 billion in 2004. The company expects growth of up to 5 percent a year, with the Middle East and Asia providing the most potential.

PETERSBURG, Fla., Sept. 20 - The Belleview Biltmore Hotel still exudes some of the grandeur of a time when tycoons like its builder, the railroad magnate Henry Plant, spared little expense to entertain visitors. There is a ballroom with a stained-glass ceiling, a hidden stairway for children and their nannies, and hallways wide enough for hoop skirts. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Rob Mattson for The New York Times The Belleview Biltmore Hotel is in Belleair, a wealthy town of 4,500 on the Gulf Coast. Enlarge This Image Rob Mattson for The New York Times The Belleview Biltmore Hotel in Florida, built in 1897 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, is for sale. But the romance of the hotel has faded, replaced by an acrimonious fight over whether it should be saved. "This has become a lightning rod for this community," said Ed Armstrong, a local real estate lawyer who represents surrounding homeowners in Belleair, a wealthy city of about 4,500 near St. Petersburg. A yearlong fight over the fate of the Biltmore has led to the resignation of a city attorney, divided preservationists and created an even wider gulf between groups that advocate a new Florida and those who want to protect the old one. City Commission meetings have drawn overflow crowds, and yard signs championing "Save the Biltmore" dot the lush, tidy yards of Belleair. The dispute began with reports that DeBartolo Development, which had an option to buy the 388-room hotel, intended to replace it with condominiums. At a City Commission meeting last week, a lawyer for DeBartolo publicly revealed the plans: razing two wings of the building and erecting 180 condominiums, while maintaining the Biltmore's original 145 rooms as a hotel. That was not enough to satisfy preservationists, who wanted the whole structure saved and who summarily booed the proposal at the meeting. DeBartolo's option has since expired, opening the door for others, said Vincent Sanfilippo, chief investment officer of the Urdang Group, which manages the Honeywell pension fund, the current owner of the hotel. What that means for the future of the Biltmore is unclear. "Our parameters are entirely economic," Mr. Sanfilippo said. "What the next buyer does or doesn't do with it is up to them." The fate of the Biltmore has placed Belleair officials in the center of a fight being played out around the country: preservationists attempting to protect the vestiges of the past versus developers in need of real estate to meet current and future housing demands. The problem is especially acute in Florida, which gets about 900 new residents every day and where undeveloped coastline is becoming a mere memory. "As land values increase, it makes sense for owners to convert their property to maximize its value," said Lawrence Yun, an economist with the National Association of Realtors. "The soaring trend is condo development." Having arisen from the wilds of 1,000 undeveloped acres along the Gulf of Mexico in 1897, the Belleview Biltmore, with its white siding and green-shingled roof, is the bedrock of Belleair. In 1980 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. With 875,000 square feet, the hotel is touted by local historians as the nation's largest occupied wooden structure. But it was ravaged by last year's Hurricane Jeanne. Many of its steep peaks are covered with tarps ragged from this year's storms. Richard Wilhelm, the hotel's chief executive officer, said the Biltmore did not bring in enough money to cover its debt. Martin Smith, the Biltmore's manager, said that "like any property of its age, it has its challenges." He said repairs to the roof would be made once a settlement had been reached with the hotel's insurance company. The uncertainty surrounding the Biltmore has landed it on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of 11 most endangered properties. "It would be a tragic and a great loss to Florida to lose this hotel," said Richard Moe, president of the trust. "There are very few of these 19th-century hotels left, even though they may still be successful financially." But developers and many property owners argue that historic hotels like the Biltmore are often money pits, and their preservation for only overnight rentals is too costly. "We've had national experts and architects who say it's not economically viable," Ron Weaver, a lawyer for DeBartolo, said last week. Controversy over the city's handling of the Biltmore dilemma resulted in the resignation earlier this year of the city attorney, Joel Tew. He stepped down after The St. Petersburg Times revealed that he had secretly met with DeBartolo to discuss their plans and had failed to tell city officials that he had previously worked for DeBartolo. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in National &gt;ST.

United Technologies, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and Carrier air-conditioners, said first-quarter net income climbed 18 percent, to $651 million, or $1.28 a share, from $551 million, or $1.08, a year earlier. Sales increased 8.8 percent, to $9.41 billion. Advertisement The earnings beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share. The Otis elevator unit benefited from rising orders in Asia, while more airline travel helped Pratt &amp; Whitney sell spare parts for engines. Profit this year will climb to $5.90 to $6.15 a share, from $5.29 in 2004, George David, the chief executive, said. The previous forecast, given March 16, was $5.85 to $6.10. Mr. David also raised the revenue forecast to $43 billion from $41 billion to include the purchase of Kidde. Profit at Carrier, United Technologies' biggest business, more than doubled as sales rose 21 percent, to $2.71 billion. Profit at Otis jumped 40 percent on a 10 percent sales increase, while Pratt's profit soared 65 percent as sales rose 3.8 percent. At Honeywell, net income rose 22 percent, to $359 million, or 42 cents a share, up from $295 million, or 34 cents, a year ago. Sales were up 4.5 percent, to $6.45 billion. Analysts had expected profit of 40 cents a share. Sales increased 9 percent at the aerospace unit, the largest of the company's four main businesses, on orders from customers like Singapore Airlines and the United States Air Force. Operating profit rose by 15 percent as a result of reduced costs, while pension expenses declined 17 percent. Honeywell expects second-quarter profit of 49 cents to 51 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call expect 50 cents. General Dynamics, which makes Gulfstream business jets, said quarterly profit rose 25 percent on higher sales of aircraft and a tax benefit. Net income increased to $336 million, or $1.66 a share, from $269 million, or $1.34, in the period a year earlier. General Dynamics' sales rose 3.7 percent, to $4.82 billion, the smallest increase in more than four years and less than analysts expected. Sales and profit rose at the business jet unit as corporations bought more planes. Resolution of a tax audit resulted in a tax that was $63 million less than the $132 million set aside a year earlier. Without that, the company would have missed its forecast, mainly because of rising costs for a commercial oil tanker program, said Eric Hugel, an analyst with Stephens Inc. in New York. "It looked like a pretty weak quarter," said Mr. Hugel, who rates the shares equal weight and does not own them. Other than the tax benefit, "they were pretty light, with weaker margins in the marine unit and combat systems." "People were looking for increasing sales and margins in combat systems and it's not clear why that didn't happen." General Dynamics was expected to earn $1.53 a share, the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/12/nyregion/12indian.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Tribe Lays Claim to 3,100 Square Miles of New York State<date>Published: March 12, 2005</date><text>he Onondaga Nation, an Indian tribe based in upstate New York, filed a lawsuit yesterday claiming that it owns 3,100 square miles of land stretching from the St. Lawrence Seaway to the Pennsylvania border and including Syracuse. The tribe contends that the State of New York illegally acquired the land in a series of treaties between 1788 and 1822 and has asked the Federal District Court in Syracuse to declare that it still holds title to the land, which is now home to hundreds of thousands of people and includes all or part of 11 counties. It is the largest Indian land claim ever filed in the state. The tribe said that it does not want all of that land, however, but that its principal intent is to gain leverage to clean up polluted sites in the land claim area. The lawsuit names as defendants the State of New York, the City of Syracuse and Onondaga County, as well as five corporations that, the nation contends, have damaged the environment in the claim area. Todd Alhart, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said late yesterday that the governor's office had not yet received a copy of the claim. "We will take whatever steps may be necessary to protect the interests of property owners and taxpayers in central New York, the Southern Tier and the northern New York region," Mr. Alhart said. Unlike other Indian tribes that have filed land claims against the state, the Onondaga Nation, which has about 1,500 members, is not seeking monetary damages or the right to operate casinos in New York. Instead, tribal representatives said, the Onondagas want a declaratory judgment saying the land, which they consider ancestral territory, was taken illegally. They then hope to use such a ruling to force the cleanup of sites in the claim area, particularly Onondaga Lake, a federal Superfund site and one of the most contaminated bodies of water in the nation. The Onondaga Nation has made the cleanup of the lake, which is 4.5 miles long and one mile wide, one of its priorities. The tribe has lived near the lake for centuries and regards it as sacred land. Tribal representatives said yesterday that the nation would not sue individual property owners or try to evict them. "The nation has said flat-out that individuals have nothing to worry about," said Dan Klotz, a spokesman for the nation. The Onondagas, he said, "will not waver from that." Other pending Indian land claims in New York have not interfered with property transactions, experts on Indian law said. "They don't plan to press for eviction as a remedy and I don't think there's ever been a court that has seriously considered eviction," said John Dossett, general counsel for the National Congress of American Indians, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group for tribal governments. "I think that homeowners can rest easy." At the same time, however, tribal authorities said they were in the market for more land. The nation's reservation is an 11-square-mile parcel south of Syracuse. Joseph J. Heath, an attorney who represents the Onondaga Nation, said if the court rules in the tribe's favor, he expected that settlement talks with the state to follow, including discussions about expanding the nation's reservation and protecting ancestral burial grounds threatened by development. Mr. Heath said the tribe would try to buy land only from "willing sellers" and the government. Still, Mr. Heath and other tribal representatives emphasized that the tribe's main intent was to gain more influence over state environmental policy and push for environmental cleanups in their region. "They're sick of being ignored on environmental issues," Mr. Heath said. The tribe's elders have discussed filing suit for more than 50 years, they said in interviews yesterday. But as the pollution in the lake increased - and their own population expanded - they felt compelled to take legal action. Decades of industrial dumping left a layer of toxic sludge on the lake bottom and drove the federal government to place it on the Superfund list of toxic waste sites in 1994. Last November, state regulators announced a plan to require Honeywell International to conduct a $448 million cleanup of the lake, including extensive dredging of the lake bottom to remove much of the 165,000 pounds of mercury and other toxins that have collected there. Honeywell is one of five companies named in the Onondaga lawsuit. It is responsible for the cleanup because in 1999 it merged with Allied Chemical, which owned a plant that was accused of being one of the lake's main polluters. The Onondagas have called the cleanup plan inadequate and say the state was legally obligated to consult with the tribe's chiefs but did not. Mr. Alhart, the governor's spokesman, rejected the nation's assertion that the state was being lax on the cleanup of Lake Onondaga or that it had ignored the nation. The lawsuit also names four other companies that operate a gravel mine, limestone quarry and coal-burning power plant in the region. In the lawsuit, the Onondagas also named Clark Concrete Company and a subsidiary, Valley Realty Development, which own a gravel mine in Tully, N.Y. The nation has accused the mine of polluting the Onondaga Creek, which runs into the lake. The nation also named Hanson Aggregates North America, the owners of a limestone quarry in DeWitt, and Trigen Syracuse Energy Corporation, a coal-burning power plant in Geddes. Attempts made late yesterday to reach officials with those companies were unsuccessful. Tribal representatives said yesterday that they were not seeking a casino as part of a settlement of the claim. Casinos are a central component of five Indian land claim settlement agreements that Gov. George Pataki announced in recent months.

Diagramming sentences - picking out subject, verb, object, adjective and other parts of speech - has been a staple of middle and high school grammar lessons for decades. Now, with financing from the Central Intelligence Agency, a California firm is using the technique to comb through e-mail messages and chat room talks, which can be a rich lode of corporate and government information, and a tough one to mine. Figuring out the connections among people, places and things is something computer algorithms do pretty well, as long as that information is structured, or categorized and put into a database. Looking through a company's customer file for a person named Bonds, for example, is fairly simple. But if the data is unstructured - if the word "bonds" hasn't been classified as the name of a ballplayer or as an investment option - searching becomes much more difficult. For people in business or in public service, only 20 percent or so of their information is kept in formal databases, noted Nick Patience, an analyst with the 451 Group, a technology research firm. The rest is unstructured, tucked away in e-mail messages, call logs, memos and instant messages. Attensity, based in Palo Alto, Calif., and financed in part by In-Q-Tel, the C.I.A.'s investment arm, has developed a method to parse electronic documents almost instantly, and diagram all of the sentences inside. ("Moby-Dick," for instance, took all of nine and a half seconds.) By labeling subjects and verbs and other parts of speech, Attensity's software gives the documents a definable structure, a way to fit into a database. And that helps turn day-to-day chatter into information that is relevant and usable. "They take the language that people use every day and compile it in a way that a machine can use," Mr. Patience said. "And that allows people to start using this tremendous amount of intelligence which has gone untapped." Whirlpool, the home appliance manufacturer, is now using Attensity software to help cull information from the 400,000 customer service calls the company receives each month. Tom Welke, a Whirlpool general manager, said the company realized it needed help in March 2002, during a microwave oven recall. The machines were arcing, producing electrical sparks, which caused the food inside to smoke. Mr. Welke decided to pore through records of recent customer calls by searching for the words "arcing" and "smoke." His team found 18,500 records that matched. Six people then spent a weekend reading the results, eventually coming up with 700 calls from customers potentially related to the problem. As a comparison, Mr. Welke then ran the same records through a program from Attensity, which had recently paid him a sales call. "It could tell if the microwave was smoking or if the chicken was smoking hot or if the customer was eating smoked chicken," he said. "It came up with 542 instances in about 10 seconds." Whirlpool is now spending a quarter-million dollars a year on Attensity's expertise, joining companies like John Deere, General Motors and Honeywell as Attensity customers. But wringing profits out of unstructured data for corporate America is only about 40 percent of the software maker's business. The rest is in government work, for groups like the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The software helps federal researchers look for clues to terrorist and criminal activities in "the text from the dispatches from around the world, the field reports, the newspaper articles and the chat rooms," said David L. Bean, Attensity's co-founder. "The intelligence community has plenty of systems for doing six degrees of separation, for putting two and two together," Dr. Bean said. "But they need structured data in order to do it. We give them that structure." The intelligence agencies declined to discuss whether they use the software. But Kris Alexander, a former intelligence analyst for the United States military's Central Command, noted that "putting unstructured information into anything that would organize it would be very helpful."

Its engineers designed the original monitor. But when it comes out with the next version, another company will design it. "We'd rather use our in-house people on really new core products," said Reggie Groves, vice president of patient management. Lots of manufacturers are sounding that note these days. And that has given rise to a whole new industry, dedicated to designing products and parts for companies that once considered every aspect of the process as sacrosanct. This is not because companies are trying to tap foreign sources of cheap labor. The new design firms are not in India or China, but in New York, California - all over the United States. But their clients have the same overall goal as those that ship jobs to Bangalore: to churn out products - even ones that look much like the competition's - at high speed and low cost. "Manufacturers are all asking whether the cost of product differentiation exceeds the benefits," said Cliff Waldman, an economist with the Manufacturers Alliance, a policy research group in Arlington, Va. The push is too new to yield hard data, but anecdotal evidence is mounting. Honeywell just contracted with I.B.M. to design many of the core processors that go into its fighter jet displays. Boeing Commercial Aircraft has contracted out parts of the design of the wing structure and fuselage on its Boeing 7E7. General Motors Shanghai asked Visteon to design much of the interior of a high-end car it now sells in China. The trend does raise some thorny questions. Who owns the patents on outsourced designs? Will equipment manufacturers turn their innovative instincts to marketing rather than invention? And if they do, are competing products going to look alike, as more companies turn to the same players in the new design-for-hire game? "Whenever suppliers get the edge on innovation," warned George Stalk, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, "the ability to differentiate is lost." That fear is not stopping the flow of design work to third parties, though. "More and more manufacturers are forcing innovation down to their supplier base," said David Bleustein, an industrial analyst with UBS Investment Research. For many manufacturers, that represents a cultural sea change. Ed Wheeler, vice president of defense and space electronic systems for Honeywell, readily concedes that, just a few years back, Honeywell would have considered product design a core strength, and would have scoffed at outsourcing it. But these days, "organic development takes time and huge investments," he said, "so it makes sense to leverage other people's technology." Boeing has grown similarly flexible. "We'll always design the airplane's basic shape, but we now realize we don't have to design every detail," said Michael J. Denton, vice president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes Engineering. Design help is getting ever easier to find. Two years ago I.B.M. formed its Engineering and Technology Services unit, which has designed components like chips for Sony PlayStations and processors for Honeywell aircraft instruments. The operation, which I.B.M. executives have publicly referred to as an area of "hypergrowth," already has 1,200 people and had $160 million in revenues in 2003. Contract manufacturers also are adding to their design staffs. "Design work is clearly where our market is going," said Craig London, an executive vice president at Solectron, which makes electronic products that sell under other companies' brand names. Mr. London said that last year more than a dozen clients, hoping to extend the life of older products without devoting research dollars to them, hired Solectron to redesign them to be cheaper to make. Even parts suppliers are getting into the arena. Visteon, an automotive supplier that originated as an engineering division at Ford, recently designed special headlamps for G.M.'s Corvette. For G.M. Shanghai, it surveyed affluent Chinese businessmen about their car preferences and translated the results into rear-seat temperature controls and front-seat holders for tea jars. "Car companies used to say, 'Here's a drawing, turn it into a high-quality, low-cost product,' " said Richard Vaughan, director of North American design at Visteon. "Now they are saying, 'What can you design that will sell more cars?' " Car companies are not alone in asking such questions. More manufacturers now view their branded equipment as mere conduits to sales of lucrative consumable products (say, the inks and papers used by printers) and services (maintaining a fleet of jetliners, or managing data centers).

Novar, a small conglomerate, had faced a hostile takeover of £745 million from Melrose, a smaller rival based in London. Novar executives had rejected the Melrose offer and had sought another buyer. As part of its defensive strategy, earlier reports said that Novar would consider selling shares in the United States of its check-printing business if it was unable to sell the group. The Sunday Telegraph in London said that Honeywell had been one of four contenders for Novar, which included the German industrial giant Siemens; the French group Schneider Electric; and General Electric, the American industrial giant. Novar makes aluminum parts and bank checks for the American market and electrical control devices for homes and businesses. The company has struggled because of declining profits and competition in its North American markets.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/11/business/11honey.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Honeywell Increasing Dividend by 10%<date>Published: December 11, 2004</date><text>y Bloomberg News Honeywell International, the world's No. 1 maker of cockpit electronics, raised its annual dividend by 10 percent, the first increase in almost five years, as rising sales of parts for aircraft and cars bolster profit. The annual dividend will climb to 82.5 cents a share from 75 cents, Honeywell said yesterday. The first quarterly payment of 20.625 cents a share will be made on March 10 to shareholders as of Feb. 18. Advertisement In the first nine months of this year, profit at the aerospace business, the company's largest, jumped 24 percent, to $1.05 billion, on a 12 percent increase in sales, to $7.22 billion. Fourth-quarter net income will rise to as much as 50 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier, and profit for the year will climb to $1.66 to $1.69, from $1.54, David Anderson, the chief financial officer, said in October. The company is expected to earn 49 cents in the quarter and $1.68 for the year, the average estimates of at least 14 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Honeywell last raised its annual dividend in March 2000, from 68 cents. The current payout costs the company about $161 million a quarter.

The plan, which will be open for public comment until March 1, 2005, requires Honeywell International to conduct extensive dredging of the lake bottom over the next seven years to remove much of the 165,000 pounds of mercury and other toxins that the state says have been dumped in the lake over the past decades. Honeywell is responsible for the cleanup because in 1999 it merged with Allied Chemical, which owned a plant that the state says dumped the toxins in the years before the plant closed in 1988. The state sued Allied Chemical in 1989 for polluting the lake. Advertisement Advertise on NYTimes.com Honeywell has suggested a more limited cleanup approach that would cost closer to $237 million. On the other hand, the Onondaga Indian nation has expressed its concerns that the state's proposed plan is insufficient. "The nation is deeply concerned that the Department of Environmental Conservation's preferred alternative for the cleanup of the bottom of the lake is not adequate and will leave substantial amounts of dangerous toxins throughout the lake bottom," Joseph J. Heath, a lawyer for the Onondaga nation, wrote in a letter on Wednesday to the commissioner of environmental conservation, Erin M. Crotty. The letter also said that state regulators did not consult with the nation's 14 chiefs about the plan it would propose, as is required by federal law because of the Onondagas' spiritual, historical and archaeological ties to the lake. "We have had a constructive dialogue with all the interested parties in this effort," said a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Michael Fraser. "We met with the Onondaga nation only a week ago and outlined our plans. We feel that that action was consistent with the federal requirements." Victoria Streitfeld, a spokeswoman for Honeywell International, which is based in Morristown, N.J., said, "The company's proposal submitted in the feasibility study takes into consideration years of scientific and technical analysis and we will continue to refine the plans during D.E.C.'s public comment period." She added, "We are committed to continuing to work with the state to finalize an approach and implement a remedy once the proposed plan is released." The Onondaga nation, which has about 2,500 remaining members, most of whom live on a reservation roughly eight miles south of Syracuse, have lived near the lake for centuries, Mr. Heath said. The lake is about four and a half miles long and a mile wide. A federal court ruling in the lawsuit involving the lake's pollution required the Department of Environmental Conservation to announce by today the cleanup plan it will require of Honeywell. State regulators want Honeywell to dredge up about 2.65 million cubic yards of mercury-contaminated sediments at lake depths ranging up to 30 feet, and to put a cap made mostly of sand and gravel on other contaminated areas of the lake bottom, Mr. Fraser said. Honeywell has proposed dredging 508,000 cubic yards. Pollution levels in the lake put it on the federal Superfund list of toxic waste sites in 1994. "The state's plan hardly seems like a permanent solution to the lake's massive pollution problems," said Walter L. T. Hang, president of Toxics Targeting, an environmental research firm. The cost of a full remediation of the site, which would involve dredging and placing a permanent cap across the entire 2,329 acres of lake bottom, would be about $2.33 billion, according to department officials. The state's plan for Onondaga Lake is far less stringent than what federal regulators should require, Mr. Hang said. In the case of the Hudson River cleanup of PCB's, for example, which is being overseen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency rather than state regulators, the most contaminated areas of the river bottom will be completely removed. "Capping is not allowed on the Hudson and should be avoided on Onondaga Lake because it is a Band-Aid approach that will surely fail," he said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E3DD113AF932A15753C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Technology Briefing | Hardware: Honeywell Posts 8% Rise In Profit<date>Published: October 21, 2004</date><text>Honeywell International posted an 8 percent increase in profit for the third quarter on strong demand for aerospace equipment and car parts.

Rest Easy, America. The Company Jet Is Back.<date>Published: October 19, 2004</date><text>spent the latter part of last week in Las Vegas at the annual convention and trade show of the National Business Aviation Association, the group that represents the corporate-aircraft industry. I'd flown there from Denver, where I spent the earlier part of the week at the annual forecast conference for the commercial aviation industry sponsored by the Boyd Group, a Colorado-based research company. Loath as I am to drag Charles Dickens into any discussion of the current state of air travel in the United States, I need to say this of my two-city experience: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. The good times have clearly descended again on the corporate aviation industry - the people who manufacture, sell, service, fly and own the nearly 10,000 corporate aircraft in use in the United States. (Of that number, about 2,000 are so-called heavy-metal corporate jets, which can cost upward of $40 million. There are also about 3,350 light and medium-size corporate jets in use. Turboprop airplanes and corporate helicopters make up most of the rest of the fleet, the trade group says.) After a few lean years, the bloom is back on the company jet. The convention in Las Vegas last week was spread out over a million square feet of exhibition space at the Las Vegas Convention Center, as well as a big expanse of space at the nearby Henderson Executive Airport, where 87 models of corporate planes were on display for anyone eager to kick some tires and explore the luxuries. Attendance at the convention was more than 31,000 - a 10 percent increase over last year. Ed Bolen, the president and chief executive of the organization, said that "buzz and energy" had returned to the industry, and he said he expected that "the next century of flight" would be "powered by business aviation." The optimism was buoyed by the release of the annual report on the business-jet market by Honeywell Aerospace, which predicted "continued recovery in delivery levels over the next 12 to 18 months" and said that "new jet deliveries will increase significantly next year." In the report, Bob Johnson, the president and chief executive of Honeywell Aerospace, said that "improved order rates, established new model backlogs and continuing expansion in fractional ownership in North America and Europe" are driving the rebound, which follows a 30 percent drop in deliveries after 2001. Last year, the trade group said, there were 6,217 holders of fractional shares, in which companies or individuals purchase what are essentially time-shares in a plane rather than buying it outright. That compares with 110 fractional owners in 1993. That's the gist of the recovery. Issues remain, among them the corporate aviation industry's complaint that its wings are too often clipped when the government orders temporary flight restrictions in various parts of the nation's airspace for security purposes. In fact, such a restriction was in effect over Las Vegas for several hours last Thursday because both President Bush and Senator John Kerry were flying in for political appearances. And general aviation aircraft have been prohibited since 9/11 from Reagan National Airport in Washington, once a popular destination for the corporate jet set, which is now reduced to using distant Dulles International for forays to the capital. O.K., not to be a wise guy, but really, boo-hoo. Try looking at the air transportation system from the vantage point of domestic commercial airlines - which transported 650 million people last year in this country. This was the perspective just a few days earlier in Denver at the Boyd Group forecast conference, which was wrapping up the same day that Delta Air Lines, the nation's third-largest carrier (more than 104 million passengers flown to 496 cities in 88 countries last year) was filing a sad report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "We reported a net loss of $773 million, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion" in 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively, Delta said. Then things got worse. "Our unaudited net loss was $2 billion for the June 2004 quarter and $2.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2004." And Delta, unlike US Airways and United, isn't even in bankruptcy - yet. Two days earlier, the Business Travel Coalition issued a statement calling on Congress to start making policy plans for an unprecedented air transport crisis, as soaring oil prices knock out whatever chance any major airline had for a turnaround this year. "There is increasing probability that the U.S. airline industry, a critical infrastructure, will experience a catastrophic failure in the next 12 months" because of the possibility of "two or three major network-airline liquidations," it said. Michael Boyd, the president of the airline research group, wasn't alarmist, but he and others said that a fundamental restructuring in the commercial air transport system was under way - and accelerating. I'll devote more space to the Boyd forecasts in a future column. But one prominent prediction was that as airlines struggle to consolidate capacity on high-revenue routes, some secondary airports will lose all or most air service. Also, the major network carriers will "get through the next six months" at least, though at least one major carrier could potentially disappear after that. And the commercial airport experience - with incessant pat-downs and wandings - remains an unpleasant ordeal, to the point where it is adversely affecting air travel. Alternatives like fleets of private air taxis, which are now under development using small jets that can be dispatched like taxicabs from general aviation airports, are no longer considered pie-in-the-sky dreaming, Mr. Boyd and others said. "People are sick and tired of the hassle" at the airport, said David Forbes, the president of BoydForbes Inc. While private air taxis, like corporate jets, will never approach the airline system as a viable major transportation system, "the indication is that we're going to see more general-aviation activity" as business travelers who can do so find alternatives.

Attacks European Ruling on Honeywell Merger<date>Published: May 28, 2004</date><text>Lawyers representing General Electric made a stinging attack on the European Commission on Thursday during an appeal of the commission's veto of General Electric's $43 billion acquisition of the avionics company Honeywell in 2001.That deal will not be revived even if General Electric's legal team persuades the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg to annul the three-year-old order. G.E. and Honeywell are appealing the ruling in order to clarify European law on mergers.For the commission, however, Thursday's appeal was anything but academic.Two years ago, the commission suffered a string of defeats during appeals of merger decisions, but none of those was as damaging to its authority as a defeat in the G.E. appeal would be, said one commission competition official who worked on the case three years ago. ''For us, the stakes are extremely high,'' he said, on condition of anonymity.The lead lawyer for General Electric, Nicholas Green of the London-based firm Brick Court Chambers, said, ''The commission hid evidence, ignored warnings from its own economist about the strength of its case, and changed its arguments at every stage of the merger review.'' Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, is part of the company's legal team.Mr. Green said that the commission had failed to make public 14 letters, mostly from G.E. customers like airlines and aircraft makers, which informed the commission that the deal did not pose serious problems to competition. The letters were submitted to the court this month, and Mr. Green said the commission's disregard of evidence was ''cavalier.''The commission admitted it was wrong not to submit the letters to G.E. lawyers earlier, and the commission's senior lawyer, Richard Lyal, said that withholding the letters was ''regrettable.'' But Mr. Lyal played down the importance of the letters, saying they did not undermine the commission's arguments.Referring to one sent to the commission by Airbus, Mr. Lyal said Airbus was not concerned about the effects of a merger between G.E. and Honeywell because ''it was confident it could secure remedies'' to undo any anticompetitive effects of the deal.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/business/ex-analyst-fined-over-research.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Ex-Analyst Fined Over Research<date>Published: May 26, 2004</date><text>NASD, the regulator of the Nasdaq market, said yesterday that it had fined Phua Young, a former analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, $225,000 and suspended him from the industry for a year for ''a series of rule violations'' related to his research coverage of two large companies.Mr. Young, who was fired by Merrill Lynch in April 2002, issued positive reports on Tyco International and Honeywell International despite privately harboring negative views on them, NASD said.Last May, the agency accused Mr. Young of issuing misleading reports on Tyco and of improper conduct, including flying on Tyco corporate jets.

James E. McGreevey announced on Wednesday.The legal agreement with the companies -- Honeywell International, Tierra Solutions and PPG Industries -- ends a 20-year legal battle between them and local communities where acres of land have been rendered unusable and groundwater has been tainted by chromium waste dumped from the 1890's to the 1950's.Although the settlement provides only a fraction of the amount local officials had sought as compensation for the lost tax revenue and the cost of coping with the pollution, many environmentalists said they were heartened that the agreement would avoid further litigation and hasten the cleanup.Mr. McGreevey went out of his way to congratulate the three corporations for agreeing to the settlement and warned other industrial companies that his attorney general was beginning an aggressive initiative to file civil lawsuits to recover damages from corporate polluters.''We are holding corporate America responsible,'' the governor said. ''This should send a message to corporate polluters that you can run, but you can't hide.''During its industrial heyday, North Jersey was home to at least three chemical plants that produced coatings for machine parts and created huge amounts of the byproduct hexavalent chromium, which can cause an assortment of health problems including lung and liver cancer. Some of the chromium-tainted material was pumped directly into the Hackensack River; and millions of tons of chromium-tainted earth was sold as landfill, and homes, businesses and even a drive-in theater were built on the sites, leaving Jersey City with some of the most polluted soil in the nation.Last year, a federal judge ordered Honeywell to pay to clean up one 34-acre site, which will cost an estimated $400 million.The payments in the settlement announced Wednesday will be in addition to that court-ordered cleanup, and will allow the communities to clean other polluted sites, create parks and wetlands and buy open space. One of the sites eligible for cleanup is a segment of Liberty State Park in Jersey City, where the governor and his advisers announced the settlement.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/technology/gadget-knows-grandma-inside-out.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Gadget Knows Grandma Inside Out<date>Published: October 23, 2003</date><text>BEBE FARIDA RAOUF lives alone in Manhattan and, like many elderly people, fears a sudden injury or illness. When she recognized the symptoms of a heart attack four years ago, she called for help, lay down on pillows on her floor and left the front door ajar for paramedics.Today Mrs. Raouf, 74, a former nursing assistant, is taking part in a test of a new home monitoring system that uses motion detectors to record her daily habits and, once a pattern is established, reports any unusual activities. Initially skeptical of the devices, Mrs. Raouf says the only change she has noticed is the occasional modem noise on her phone line when the system dials in to update her reports, she said.''I feel a bit more secure,'' she said of the test. ''A lot of seniors live alone and die alone, but this gives me a little peace of mind.''Mrs. Raouf is part of a demographic segment highly sought after by General Electric, Intel, Honeywell and other companies that want to deliver security and better quality of life for senior citizens without using high-cost nursing services or other paid companions. These companies view online tools as a way to move beyond the ''call for help'' pendants or bracelets that were popularized two decades ago but go unused in an estimated 75 percent of emergencies -- and to head off problems before they become emergencies.The heart of the motion-sensor system Mrs. Raouf is helping to test is software from Living Independently (www.livingindependently.com), a start-up company in New York. Data from the sensors is used to create a baseline for activity: waking time, ordinary visits to the bathroom, time spent in the kitchen or on the couch. A small white base station contains a modem that dials in every two hours when the phone line is available and posts the data to a private, secure Web site maintained by Living Independently.The reports are color-coded: normal conditions are in green and changes, which may be cause for concern, are reported in yellow or red. The system can also be set to notify an attendant by phone if there is a change in conditions.George Boyajian, executive vice president of Living Independently, said the automated system did more than help older people maintain their independence. ''There are people who are resentful of having a baby sitter,'' he said. ''It's old technology but smart programming that allows early detection and warning, instead of notification after an accident.''</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/26/business/automakers-sue-over-asbestos-maneuver.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Automakers Sue Over Asbestos Maneuver<date>Published: September 26, 2003</date><text>The three largest United States automakers have sued to block Honeywell International Inc. from transferring its Bendix brake unit to the bankrupt Federal-Mogul Corporation, contending the transaction would unfairly saddle the car companies with increased asbestos liabilities.Honeywell seeks to use the transaction to extricate itself from more than 50,000 asbestos lawsuits against Bendix. Federal-Mogul filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2001 to resolve about 360,000 asbestos suits and future claims by establishing a trust to pay victims. Claims against Bendix would be channeled into the trust, possibly freeing Honeywell from liability.The three car companies, General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, are defendants with Bendix in suits by people who say asbestos used in auto parts made them sick. Such suits will cost the carmakers as much as $1.2 billion, UBS estimated last year. As companies block asbestos suits in bankruptcy court, claims against solvent companies have risen.''This appears to be the first challenge to the expansive use of an asbestos-channeling injunction and it will be closely watched,'' said Janice Grubin, a bankruptcy lawyer with Golenbock, Eiseman, Assor, Bell &amp; Peskoe in New York.The automakers filed the suit Wednesday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.''Honeywell cannot comment at this time,'' a company spokesman, Michael Holland, said.

Weight-related ailments are taking ''amazingly large portions'' of the $3 billion that Ford spent on health care benefits last year, he said.Michigan, Ford's industrial base, is among the worst states for obesity and tobacco use, Dr. Kerr said.He said the company's employees mirrored the general population in the growing incidence of diabetes and other diseases that often overlap with weight problems.Ford is a founding board member of the Institute on the Costs and Health Effects of Obesity, organized by the Washington Business Group on Health, a group of 175 large employers that provide benefits for 40 million people.The institute plans to draw on research financed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. The centers and the Institute of Medicine have also joined the new obesity institute board.High obesity rates among children, older workers and retirees, and spiraling medical costs will push employers' costs even higher ''unless we take concerted action to support workers' efforts to reduce obesity and choose healthier lifestyles,'' said Helen Darling, president of the Washington Business Group.New research may help. ''Science is moving faster than most people realize,'' Ms. Darling said. ''For example, we are learning a lot about the way the brain works that has an effect on when people want to eat and when they need to eat.''You can be almost as satisfied with a cup of soup as with a whole meal,'' she said.''Even small, inexpensive initiatives such as posting nutritional information in company cafeterias or encouraging workers to take the stairs contribute to worker health,'' Ms. Darling said.''We want to partner with all the entities that touch these problems,'' she added. ''For example, employers can work with communities to establish safe places for kids to walk and bike.''</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/17/business/company-news-honeywell-selects-chief-financial-officer.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; HONEYWELL SELECTS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER<date>Published: June 17, 2003</date><text>Honeywell International Inc., the manufacturer of airplane brakes and cockpit electronics, said yesterday that it had named the chief financial officer of ITT Industries Inc.

Torricelli, who returned to private life in New Jersey after abandoning his re-election campaign last fall, has received a court appointment to oversee an environmental cleanup project in Jersey City.Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh of United States District Court in Newark made the appointment in an order on Tuesday, five days after he ordered Honeywell International to clean up a 34-acre waterfront site contaminated by chromium.Mr. Torricelli is to be paid by Honeywell on an hourly basis at a fee to be determined by the court. He said in a phone interview today that, ''I just told the judge I would do it no matter what the compensation was.''Mr. Torricelli withdrew from the United States Senate race on Sept. 30, amid persistent questions about gifts he had accepted from a campaign contributor. The Senate ethics committee had rebuked him after hearings in the summer, but an earlier federal investigation had not led to any charges of wrongdoing.He has since moved to Delaware Township in Hunterdon County and has an office in Lambertville, where, he said, he has been working on real estate development projects in New Jersey and doing business consulting.He said he did not expect the special-master assignment to become a full-time job, but that ''it will be time-consuming.''''It will be the largest cleanup in the nation,'' Mr. Torricelli said. ''It is staggering in scope, but this has been delayed for more than 20 years, and it is vitally important to the people of Jersey City.''Capt. Bill Sheehan, the head of Hackensack Riverkeeper, one of the plaintiffs in the long-running suit, said he was surprised but pleased by Mr. Torricelli's appointment. ''He's a senior statesman from New Jersey and he definitely has the resources to get the job done,'' Mr. Sheehan said.Richard Silverman, a spokesman for Honeywell in Morris Plains, N.J., said the company had no comment on Mr. Torricelli's appointment.Mr. Torricelli's first job will be to estimate the cost of the project, which is expected to exceed $400 million. The judge's order also authorizes him to hire professional and technical personnel, who will also be paid by Honeywell. The site was contaminated by a chemical plant that pumped waste into a wetlands area along the Hackensack River, which Honeywell must also clean up.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/17/nyregion/court-orders-honeywell-to-clean-up-34-acre-site.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Court Orders Honeywell To Clean Up 34-Acre Site<date>Published: May 17, 2003</date><text>Correction AppendedA federal district judge in Newark ordered Honeywell International to clean up a 34-acre site along Jersey City's waterfront that was created more than 100 years ago as a dumping ground for chromium, a byproduct of manufacturing that has been found to cause cancer.The cleanup, which would involve digging up about a million tons of contaminated waste and replacing it with clean soil, could cost the Morris Township-based company more than $400 million, experts testified. The company will also have to remove the contaminants from the Hackensack River near the dump.In the decision, Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh of Federal District Court said that chromium at the dump, which closed years ago but became the site of a drive-in movie and a furniture store in the densely populated neighborhoods of south Jersey City, presented ''a substantial risk of imminent damage to public health and safety and imminent and severe damage to the environment.''The decision is expected to pave the way for the cleanup of other chromium-contaminated parcels of land in North Jersey, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said.''This is the biggest one, the most egregious one, but it is by no means the only one,'' said Steven German, a lawyer with the Washington firm of Terris, Pravlik &amp; Millian, which specializes in public-interest law. He said there were about 120 other sites in the area -- most in Hudson County -- contaminated with chromium.A Honeywell spokesman, Michael Holland, said the company would appeal the decision.The contamination began decades ago, when this part of New Jersey was an industrial powerhouse. The Mutual Chemical Company operated a chromate chemical plant on this site and pumped the waste through a pipeline, now Route 440, to a wetlands area along the Hackensack River, according to court documents.AlliedSignal Corporation bought Mutual Chemical in 1954, and when Honeywell merged with AlliedSignal in 1999, it inherited the liability.Honeywell eventually accepted responsibility for the cleanup, and had been working with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection since the 1980's on a plan to clean up the contamination. But after decades of what they thought was foot-dragging, a small group of community and church activists, led by the Interfaith Community Organization of Jersey City, brought the civil lawsuit against the company to force it to do what the government seemed unable to make it do.Correction: May 24, 2003, Saturday A map last Saturday with an article about a judge's order requiring Honeywell International to clean up a 34-acre site along Jersey City's waterfront included an outdated reference for an area south of it.

Eight of the companies assumed that their pension funds would have returns of 10 percent or more. In fact, though, almost all the pension funds examined lost money last year.The companies that used the highest estimates included Northwest Airlines, General Motors and Honeywell International.The optimistic assumptions about returns on fund investments translated into billions of dollars for corporate America's collective bottom line in 2002, according to the study, by the actuarial firm of Milliman USA.During the stock market boom, when pension funds were growing steadily each year, these assumptions did not prompt much concern. Because such funds invest for the long term, and may experience short-term fluctuations, an assumed rate of return provides a way to smooth out the impact on the company's financial performance.''I've had more questions on the assumed rate of return in the last six months than I had for 15 years before that,'' said John W. Ehrhardt, a consulting actuary and principal of Milliman and author of the new study. ''The auditors are looking at this much more closely. Nobody, in the post-Enron environment, wants to have any questions asked about their financial statements.''The Milliman survey showed that America's biggest companies last year assumed an average rate of return of 8.92 percent for their pension investments. Mr. Ehrhardt said many companies are lowering their assumptions for 2003.''I wouldn't be surprised to see an average of 8.5 percent,'' he said, adding that he considered that rate ''reasonable,'' given long-term investment trends.Accounting rules do not offer companies detailed instructions for picking each year's rate, but the rates should reflect the long-term investment performance of the types of assets in their pension funds.Berkshire Hathaway, which has been widely praised for its realistic pension accounting techniques, used an assumed rate of return of just 6.5 percent, the second lowest of the 100 companies surveyed. Only Merrill Lynch was lower, at 6 percent.Correction: April 24, 2003, Thursday A chart in Business Day last Thursday showing the investment returns assumed by eight large corporate pension funds, as compared with their actual returns in 2002, referred incompletely to the actual figures. They were estimates, calculated by the actuarial firm of Milliman USA, using information from the pension footnotes of annual reports. After the chart was published, one company, Delphi, said its annual report disclosed that its fund lost 8.9 percent, not 9.9.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/13/nyregion/c-corrections-757691.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Corrections<date>Published: March 13, 2003</date><text>A headline in Business Day yesterday about changes by Honeywell International in Ireland misstated its plans.

Sales rose less than 1 percent, to $5.86 billion, Honeywell said.The chief executive, David Cote, who has been in the job almost a year, said today that the revamping process was completed provided the economy did not lapse into recession. Mr. Cote inherited a company with thousands of asbestos claims just as demand for aircraft equipment plunged. Honeywell has taken $4.5 billion in charges since 2000 to settle lawsuits, has eliminated jobs and has written down the value of assets.''This would be the end of three years of massive restructuring at Honeywell,'' said Mark Demos, an analyst with Fifth Third Investment Advisors, which has about 554,000 Honeywell shares. ''They can stop restructuring and start focusing on growth. We view this as a big positive.''Honeywell had $1.9 billion in charges in the fourth quarter, resulting in its second consecutive annual loss. Earnings in 2003 will be $1.60 to $1.70 a share, including a 36-cent pension expense, Honeywell said. Sales will be little changed from last year, at about $22.2 billion.Shares of Honeywell rose 94 cents, to close at $24.44.Honeywell's profit has been hurt the last two years as sales to factories and to plane manufacturers declined. Fourth-quarter profit at Honeywell's aerospace unit, its biggest, fell 11 percent, to $349 million.

The expenses will total $2.30 a share, leading to a fourth-quarter net loss of about $1.80 a share, Honeywell said. Excluding those costs, the company said it would have profit of 50 cents, at the low end of a forecast it gave in October. Honeywell will reserve $900 million this quarter to cover asbestos claims, contributing to a loss of about 28 cents a share for the year, a spokesman said. It will write down assets in its chemical and friction-materials businesses by $700 million and will have $300 million of costs for severance payments related to the previously announced layoff of 5,000 workers, and for the closing of 17 facilities.

Honeywell will take a $1.7 billion charge against equity because of losses in its pension plans. Its board authorized contributions of $900 million to replenish the fund, a ''substantial portion'' of which will consist of Honeywell stock, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said. The company has about $2 billion in insurance left to pay for asbestos lawsuits involving its former North American Refractories unit, an amount that may not cover settlement costs, the filing said.

The company rebounded from a net loss of $308 million, or 38 cents a share a year earlier, when it recorded charges of $1.01 billion.Honeywell said that it had net income of $412 million, or 50 cents a share, in the quarter.That matched the consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. That forecast was revised downward from 61 cents a share after Honeywell executives warned on Sept. 12 that sales and profits would be lower.The chief executive, David M. Cote, told analysts today that while cash flow had set a record of $608 million, the fourth quarter would probably bring another 3,000 to 5,000 layoffs. That will bring another restructuring charge, he said.''It's not going to be anything mind-boggling,'' Mr. Cote said, but will be ''a decent size.''Revenues in the third quarter declined 4 percent, to $5.57 billion, from $5.79 billion a year earlier. Sales in three of Honeywell's four divisions slipped 3 percent to 7 percent, while the smallest division, specialty materials, posted a 3 percent increase in revenues, to $797 million.The chief financial officer, Richard F. Wallman, said the company, based in Morris Township, N.J., increased sales in some areas, like turbochargers, military and space products, specialty chemicals, and security and fire protection.Shares closed down $1.01, to $21.33.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/25/business/many-concerns-settle-8000-asbestos-suits.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Many Concerns Settle 8,000 Asbestos Suits<date>Published: September 25, 2002</date><text>Hundreds of corporations swept into a huge asbestos trial in West Virginia have settled claims brought by some 8,000 people over the last week, lawyers for each side said yesterday.Perhaps a dozen companies, including Exxon Mobil and Union Carbide, a unit of Dow Chemical, still plan to go to trial, lawyers said. But pressure on the remaining defendants has increased as companies, including Honeywell International, have dropped out.The companies would not provide information on how much money had been paid to settle the claims. Lawyers for each side said they could not determine the total amount the companies had agreed to pay.Even so, lawyers representing individual plaintiffs said some settlements with people claiming injuries from exposure to asbestos, a carcinogenic fireproofing material, reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Corporations have already appealed to the United States Supreme Court to intervene in the West Virginia trial because of the large number of plaintiffs and defendants. Lawyers for the companies say that the defendants should not be tried together because their connections to asbestos are different and plaintiffs have various injuries from different sources.''Before any group of defendants can be tried together, there must be a determination that the claims are sufficiently common and that they can be tried together without prejudice,'' said Walter Dellinger, a lawyer at O'Melveny &amp; Myers in Washington, which is representing Exxon Mobil. ''There has been no such determination about any number of these defendants.''The West Virginia trial is unusual because it involves plaintiffs who argue that they were exposed to asbestos in different ways, Mr. Dellinger said. For example, they could have been exposed in contaminated buildings or by products like brake linings, by companies that were manufacturers, owners of buildings or had some other connection to asbestos.Even some lawyers for the plaintiffs said the trial was somewhat unusual.It is normal to have 10 to 100 defendants in a case, not 250, said Perry Weitz of Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, which has represented thousands of asbestos plaintiffs. ''Because they have so many different plaintiffs with different exposures, that's why you have 250.''Jury selection in the case began yesterday and lawyers said that opening statements could begin as early as this afternoon.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/24/business/company-news-honeywell-says-it-settled-asbestos-claims.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; HONEYWELL SAYS IT SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS<date>Published: September 24, 2002</date><text>Honeywell International said it had settled asbestos claims brought against it in West Virginia, as the trial began in a state court.

About half of the 259 defendants have appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the cases are so dissimilar that consolidating them infringes on the defendants' constitutional rights.''The trial plan does not appear to be in the same universe as the due process clause in the Constitution,'' said Walter Dellinger, a primary lawyer for the companies. ''What gets lost in a mass trial with this number of defendants and this number of plaintiffs is that a lot of plaintiffs aren't sick and a lot of the companies have nothing to do with asbestos.''The defendants include manufacturers, building owners and groups of employers, and there are so many cases that the trial is to be split into separate but simultaneous proceedings -- one for companies being sued over product liability claims; the other for those being sued for on-premises exposure to asbestos.Jury selection is to begin Tuesday, with oral arguments starting as early as Wednesday before Judge Arthur Recht of Ohio County Circuit Court for product liability cases and Judge Booker Stevens of McDowell County Circuit Court for exposure cases.Asbestos was widely used for fireproofing and insulation until the 1970's, when its use was curtailed after scientists concluded that inhaled asbestos fibers could be linked to lung cancer and other diseases.But asbestos-related sicknesses take years to materialize. In the last three years, the number of asbestos lawsuits has been increasing, forcing about 50 corporations into bankruptcy because of related liabilities.Nationwide, about 200,000 asbestos claims are pending.Last week, the plaintiffs scored a victory when the chief justice of the United States, William H. Rehnquist, rejected requests to postpone the trial from ExxonMobil, Honeywell and Owens-Illinois.The companies wanted trial proceedings delayed until the Supreme Court could rule on their appeal. The court, now in recess, is expected to consider the appeal just before the start of its new term on Oct. 7.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/17/business/delay-in-asbestos-trial-is-denied.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Delay in Asbestos Trial Is Denied<date>Published: September 17, 2002</date><text>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist of the United States rejected two requests today by companies seeking to delay the start of a huge asbestos trial in West Virginia while the Supreme Court considers their appeal in the case.In one request, the Exxon Mobil Corporation and the industrial conglomerate Honeywell International asked the court to stay the Sept. 23 trial in Charleston, W. Va., pending a decision on whether it would hear the appeal.Owens-Illinois filed a second, similar request with the court.In the appeal, the companies are challenging as unfair the single mass trial in which about 8,000 people who say that they were exposed to asbestos are suing about 250 defendants, including groups of employers, building owners and manufacturers.Although Chief Justice Rehnquist denied the two applications for a stay without any comment, the companies could resubmit the requests to another Supreme Court justice.One of the main lawyers for the companies, Walter Dellinger, was not immediately available for comment on Chief Justice Rehnquist's action.As an alternative to a stay of the trial, the companies urged the Supreme Court to speed up consideration of the appeal so that a decision would be made on it before next Monday. The Supreme Court is now in recess, but it is expected to consider the appeal before its new term starts on Oct. 7.At issue in the appeal is a decision by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia that endorsed the consolidation of thousands of product-liability claims into a single proceeding.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/14/business/company-news-honeywell-settles-asbestos-claims-of-5-mechanics.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; HONEYWELL SETTLES ASBESTOS CLAIMS OF 5 MECHANICS<date>Published: September 14, 2002</date><text>Honeywell International Inc. said yesterday that it had settled asbestos claims with five mechanics who contended they got sick after installing the company's Bendix brakes.

In many instances, younger workers with less experience were retained or offered the positions of the terminated workers, the lawsuit claims.Honeywell acquired AlliedSignal through a 1999 merger. The merged company is based in Morris Township, N.J.The car care unit manufactures Prestone and Fram automotive products. The lawsuit was filed in District Court in New Jersey by the E.E.O.C.'s Philadelphia district Office.A Honeywell spokesman, Tom Crane, said he was ''confident that there was no discrimination against any of the individuals bringing the allegation against us, or any of the other individuals who were part of the restructuring at the time.''Jacqueline McNair, an E.E.O.C. lawyer, said senior management at AlliedSignal encouraged a pattern of discrimination against older workers.The suit alleges that the vice president for sales said of workers with 20 or more years' service: ''Those people will be bugs on AlliedSignal's windshield. Most of the older workers make too much money for a 'sales rep' and we have to address that.''The E.E.O.C. said it filed suit after efforts to reach a voluntary settlement failed.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/05/business/company-news-halliburton-and-honeywell-win-asbestos-claims-delay.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; HALLIBURTON AND HONEYWELL WIN ASBESTOS CLAIMS DELAY<date>Published: June 05, 2002</date><text>The Halliburton Company and Honeywell Inc. won a 30-day extension of a stay on more than 250,000 asbestos-related claims against former units.

The asbestos claims involve the Harbison-Walker Refractories Company, formerly owned by the Dresser unit of Halliburton, and the North American Refractories Company, a former Honeywell subsidiary.

The system, called Swift 64, is fast enough to handle streaming video or video conference calls using standard equipment.The first market is corporate jets, but the builders hope to sell the system to airlines, too. The companies did not give a price but said it would depend partly on how much equipment was already on board. Many planes already have some satellite communication gear for passenger seat-back telephones and for the cockpit crew to use to communicate with the airline or maintenance base.Boeing has a competing product that is in service on 11 corporate planes, and Lufthansa is hoping to offer it on a Boeing 747 late this year or early next year. Boeing and Lufthansa have not worked out how they will charge customers. Communications experts say they could charge by the minute or the bit.A spokesman for Connexion by Boeing, the subsidiary that produces the system, said it would allow the use of palmtop-based e-mail service in addition to laptops, and speeds far higher than the Swift 64 system, 20 gigabits per second.Tenzing Communications, a Seattle company partly owned by the European plane maker Airbus, also provides a slower satellite-based service on a handful of airlines.Honeywell's demonstration plane, a Cessna Citation, a twin-engine business jet that carries two crew members and as many as eight passengers, carries an antenna about the size and shape of a surfboard.Planes with long over-water routes often carry satellite antennas; older antenna models are steered mechanically to keep them pointed toward the satellite as the plane banks, climbs and descends. The one on the Honeywell plane is steered electronically. On a recent demonstration flight from Dulles Airport near Washington, the antenna was pointed at a satellite in orbit over Brazil that transmitted back to a ground station in Connecticut.On the demonstration flight, a user of a Dell Latitude CPx found that the Web site of the Federal Aviation Administration popped up on the screen so fast that the system's performance was nearly indistinguishable from that of a desktop in a corporate office.Such speed offers white-knuckle fliers new possibilities: for example, it took no time at all to download a 238-kilobyte aviation safety manual.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/18/business/honeywell-says-asbestos-verdict-was-more-than-it-had-disclosed.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">Honeywell Says Asbestos Verdict Was More Than It Had Disclosed<date>Published: April 18, 2002</date><text>Honeywell International appears to have misinformed analysts and shareholders about how much of a $53.5 million verdict it is responsible for paying in the case of a man who died of a cancer caused by asbestos.When the judgment was announced on Feb. 8 in a Manhattan court, Honeywell's stock dove as much as 11 percent during the day, shaving $3 billion off its market value. Honeywell's shares quickly rebounded after the company said it had been found liable for less than $1.1 million of the verdict, a figure that made its way into Wall Street analysts' reports. But the company's statement immediately raised questions among lawyers who had followed the case but were not involved in it. Those lawyers, who included both plaintiff and defense attorneys, said the company's true responsibility was much greater.Honeywell now says that it must pay at least $11 million of the judgment, according to Peter M. Kreindler, its general counsel. Mr. Kreindler said Honeywell planned to appeal the verdict and had not misled investors about its size. The company does not face financially significant liability from asbestos cases, he said, and has $2 billion in asbestos insurance.Although $11 million is minor for a company Honeywell's size, investors are nervous about Honeywell's asbestos liabilities. Last winter, investors punished the stocks of several major companies like Halliburton and 3M after a series of multimillion-dollar asbestos verdicts. The companies generally say that they do not expect the litigation to damage their financial health, but most have not discussed their liabilities in detail.Honeywell faces about 50,000 asbestos injury claims, including nearly 1,000 claims from people suffering from the cancer in this case, mesothelioma. The North American Refractories Company, a former unit of AlliedSignal, which merged with Honeywell in 1999, made bricks that contained asbestos. That business faces an additional 116,000 asbestos claims and filed for bankruptcy in January.In addition, Honeywell may be an especially ripe target for plaintiffs because a manager at Bendix, the Honeywell subsidiary that is the target of the suits because it makes brake linings that once contained asbestos, wrote in a 1966 letter that his response to concerns about asbestos was: ''If you have enjoyed a good life while working with asbestos products why not die from it.''</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/27/business/company-news-honeywell-wins-contracts-worth-nearly-2-billion.html?ref=honeywellinternationalinc">COMPANY NEWS; HONEYWELL WINS CONTRACTS WORTH NEARLY $2 BILLION<date>Published: February 27, 2002</date><text>Honeywell International Inc., the nation's leading maker of cockpit electronics for aircraft, said it won aerospace and military contracts valued at about $2 billion.
