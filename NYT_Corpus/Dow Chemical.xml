The Small Business Administration announced on Tuesday that it had formed a $130 million venture capital fund to invest in high-growth companies in Michigan. The fund is the first of what Karen Mills, the S.B.A. administrator, said is a $1 billion commitment over five years through what the agency calls Impact Investment funds, part of the Obama administration’s Startup America initiative announced in January. In Michigan, the S.B.A. has joined forces with the State of Michigan Retirement Systems, which will contribute $35 million through its own investment fund, and Dow Chemical, which will invest $15 million. The S.B.A. will provide up to $80 million in debt financing. In the next three or four years, the fund, called the InvestMichigan! Mezzanine Fund, will invest between $5 million and $15 million in about 20 companies that either do business or have a substantial presence in Michigan or are poised to relocate there. Speaking on a conference call that included the chief executive of Dow and Rick Snyder, Michigan’s Republican governor, Ms. Mills said the state’s dire economic situation made it a logical starting point for the program. “This is an economy in transition,” she said. “But the good news is the opportunity is also there. Many of the high-growth firms in Michigan simply need more capital to grow, scale up, and hire.” (As it happens, the state is certain to be a battleground in the 2012 presidential election.) The Impact Investment Fund initiative is a new variation on the agency’s longstanding, and grossly under-utilized, investment program. As currently constituted, the program allows funds, called small-business investment companies, to borrow money from the S.B.A. and in turn re-loan that money to their portfolio companies. The S.B.A. then pools the money lent to the small-business investment companies and sells the debt as debentures on Wall Street; because the investment is guaranteed by the government, the interest rate is low. According to Kelly Williams, a managing director of Credit Suisse and a manager of the InvestMichigan! fund, the interest rate on these debentures is presently about 4 percent — much lower than a bank loan. The program, which is self-financed through the interest payments and fees charged to the investment companies, is authorized to loan $3 billion each year; last year, Ms. Mills said, it committed only half that. But the initiative does have limitations. Though the program is called Startup America, Invest!Michigan will not invest in start-ups. Because small-business investment company investment is typically more debt than equity — in the case of Invest!Michigan, about 70 percent debt, according to S.B.A. spokeswoman Hayley Meadvin — the companies receiving the investment must have enough cash flow to make regular interest payments to their backers. Indeed, according to Ms. Williams, the fund will seek companies that have already proven themselves, generating revenue of at least $20 million a year and profit of $3 million to $5 million. Until 2004, the S.B.A. also licensed small-business investment companies that took pure equity stakes in portfolio companies, and so could invest in risky early-stage companies. However, the Bush administration, convinced that losses in that program would cost the government billions of dollars, stopped issuing new licenses for those types of investment companies. The program’s authorization eventually expired, and Congress has not renewed it. The Obama administration has not sought to renew the equity program, either, though the S.B.A. says it is developing a $1 billion fund for early-stage companies, set to be launched in late 2011 or early 2012. In the meantime, the administration has channeled more private-sector dollars into the debenture program. And with the Impact Investment initiative, it has taken a decidedly more hands-on approach. Unlike a typical S.B.I.C., where an investment manager would first organize the fund and then approach the S.B.A. for a license, this fund was in fact organized by the agency itself. While many newly elected Republican governors have taken pains to distance themselves from Obama administration initiatives that they view as heavy-handed federal intervention, Gov. Snyder had no such qualms on Thursday. “We’re pleased that you look upon Michigan as a great opportunity, because we want to be a pioneer on an opportunity like this,” he said to Ms. Mills on the conference call. “It’s very exciting to be part of this process.” Ms. Williams said the fund has already started scouting for prospective investments. The first deal, she said, would close within a month or so. 10:37 a.m. | Correction A previous version of this post reported, incorrectly, that the Michigan fund was announced on Thursday.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/business/global/08bribe.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Liu Wen, Ex-Dow Scientist, Guilty of Selling Secrets in China<date>Published: February 7, 2011</date><text>A jury in Baton Rouge, La., on Monday found a former Dow Chemical scientist guilty of conspiring to steal company secrets and sell them to firms in China, the Justice Department said.Evidence at the three-week trial showed that the scientist, Liu Wen, 74, also paid a $50,000 bribe to a Dow employee to supply materials about how the company made a polymer used in automotive hoses, jackets for electrical cables and vinyl siding. The conviction illustrates what federal authorities have described as a growing threat in the competition with China for an economic edge. As nations like China broaden efforts to obtain technology, they have increasingly been able to buy secrets from current and former insiders at big American companies. Another former Dow Chemical scientist, Huang Kexue, is awaiting trial in Indiana on more serious charges that he engaged in economic espionage in sharing some of Dow’s insecticide secrets with Chinese researchers. Over the last year and a half, charges involving the theft of trade secrets have been filed against former engineers from General Motors and Ford Motor. Scientists at DuPont and Valspar, a Minnesota paint company, recently pleaded guilty to stealing their employers’ secrets after taking jobs in China. Justice Department officials said the conspiracy led by Mr. Liu, of Houston, unfolded over at least eight years. Trial testimony indicated that Mr. Liu, also known as David W. Liou, began the conspiracy in 1995 and that it ran through 2003. Justice Department officials said he sold the secrets for more than $500,000 and was negotiating to sell them for $4 million before authorities uncovered the scheme. Justice Department officials said Mr. Liu was a research scientist at Dow from 1965 until he retired in 1992. He worked with the polymer, Tyrin CPE, at a company plant in Plaquemine, La. Mr. Liu’s lawyer, C. Frank Holthaus, said his client had not stolen anything and witnesses had lied about his activities. The government presented evidence that after Mr. Liu left the company, he paid the $50,000 bribe to a Dow worker to obtain a manual describing Dow’s process for making the polymer. He also made payments to two other co-conspirators that prosecutors did not describe as bribes. Prosecutors said Mr. Liu traveled extensively in China to sell the information. Dow executives testified that the company had spent substantial money to develop the technology and had taken steps to protect it.A jury in Baton Rouge, La., on Monday found a former Dow Chemical scientist guilty of conspiring to steal company secrets and sell them to firms in China, the Justice Department said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/business/04dow.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Dow Chemical’s Earning Nearly Triple<date>Published: February 3, 2011</date><text>The Dow Chemical Company posted fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that rose more than analysts estimated, helped by its caustic soda and plastics products.

Profit excluding some items was 54 cents a share, topping the 41-cent average estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Dow bought the Rohm and Haas Company last year to add specialty chemical units that deliver higher, consistent earnings. Adjusted profit rose 30 percent in the company’s performance systems and performance products units, which make auto plastics and foams, construction cable and heat-transfer fluids. Profit also rose in basic chemicals and plastics. Net income in the quarter was reduced by 9 cents a share from costs to integrate Rohm and Haas, an adjustment on the sale of the Styron unit, labor litigation in Latin America and debt refinancing costs, said Bob Plishka, a spokesman for Dow. Asset sales and other one-time items increased earnings in the third quarter of last year by 39 cents a share. Overall sales rose 23 percent, to $12.9 billion. Excluding divestitures, revenue gained in all of Dow’s operating segments, as the company raised average prices 9 percent and volumes rose 14 percent from a year earlier. Higher prices more than made up for a $585 million increase in costs for energy and raw materials, Dow said. Sales gains were led by a 27 percent increase in North America, a 24 percent rise in Latin America and a 23 percent increase in the region that includes Europe. Sales in emerging economies climbed 19 percent to more than $4 billion, a company record, Dow said. “A sustained global economic recovery, led by emerging economies, is firming,” Andrew N. Liveris, the chief executive, said in a statement. “We are also encouraged to see signs of improved growth in North America and Europe, especially Germany.” Shares of Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich., fell 35 cents, to $30.86. End markets like electronics, coatings and packaging “continue to show strength” in the face of high unemployment and weak construction spending, Mr. Liveris said. Growth in developed markets will slow “slightly” from the first half, he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/us/politics/22chamber.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Top Corporations Aid U.S. Chamber of Commerce Campaign<date>Published: October 21, 2010</date><text> Prudential Financial sent in a $2 million donation last year as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce kicked off a national advertising campaign to weaken the historic rewrite of the nation’s financial regulations. Dow Chemical delivered $1.7 million to the chamber last year as the group took a leading role in aggressively fighting proposed rules that would impose tighter security requirements on chemical facilities. And Goldman Sachs, Chevron Texaco, and Aegon, a multinational insurance company based in the Netherlands, donated more than $8 million in recent years to a chamber foundation that has been critical of growing federal regulation and spending. These large donations — none of which were publicly disclosed by the chamber, a tax-exempt group that keeps its donors secret, as it is allowed by law — offer a glimpse of the chamber’s money-raising efforts, which it has ramped up recently in an orchestrated campaign to become one of the most well-financed critics of the Obama administration and an influential player in this fall’s Congressional elections. They suggest that the recent allegations from President Obama and others that foreign money has ended up in the chamber’s coffers miss a larger point: The chamber has had little trouble finding American companies eager to enlist it, anonymously, to fight their political battles and pay handsomely for its help. And these contributions, some of which can be pieced together through tax filings of corporate foundations and other public records, also show how the chamber has increasingly relied on a relatively small collection of big corporate donors to finance much of its legislative and political agenda. The chamber makes no apologies for its policy of not identifying its donors. It has vigorously opposed legislation in Congress that would require groups like it to identify their biggest contributors when they spend money on campaign ads. Proponents of that measure pointed to reports that health insurance providers funneled at least $10 million to the chamber last year, all of it anonymously, to oppose President Obama’s health care legislation. “The major supporters of us in health care last year were confronted with protests at their corporate headquarters, protests and harassment at the C.E.O.’s homes,” said R. Bruce Josten, the chief lobbyist at the chamber, whose office looks out on the White House. “You are wondering why companies want some protection. It is pretty clear.” The chamber’s increasingly aggressive role — including record spending in the midterm elections that supports Republicans more than 90 percent of the time — has made it a target of critics, including a few local chamber affiliates who fear it has become too partisan and hard-nosed in its fund-raising. The chamber is spending big in political races from California to New Hampshire, including nearly $1.5 million on television advertisements in New Hampshire attacking Representative Paul W. Hodes, a Democrat running for the United States Senate, accusing him of riding Nancy Pelosi’s “liberal express” down the road to financial ruin. “When you become a mouthpiece for a specific agenda item for one business or group of businesses, you better be damn careful you are not being manipulated,” said James C. Tyree, a former chairman of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, who has backed Republicans and Democrats, including Mr. Obama. “And they are getting close to that, if not over that edge.” But others praise its leading role against Democrat-backed initiatives, like health care, financial regulation and climate change, which they argue will hurt American businesses. The Obama administration’s “antibusiness rhetoric” has infuriated executives, making them open to the chamber’s efforts, said John Motley, a former lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, a rival. “They’ve raised it to a science, and an art form,” he said of the chamber’s pitches to corporate leaders that large contributions will help “change the game” in Washington. As a nonprofit organization, the chamber need not disclose its donors in its public tax filings, and because it says no donations are earmarked for specific ads aimed at a candidate, it does not invoke federal elections rules requiring disclosure. The annual tax returns that the chamber releases include a list of all donations over $5,000, including 21 in 2008 that each exceed $1 million, one of them for $15 million. However, the chamber omits the donors’ names. But intriguing hints can be found in obscure places, like the corporate governance reports that some big companies have taken to posting on their Web sites, which show their donations to trade associations. Also, the tax filings of corporate foundations must publicly list their donations to other foundations, including one run by the chamber.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/business/global/18espionage.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">New Breed of Spy Steals Employer’s Secrets U.S. Companies at Risk of Spying by Own Workers<date>Published: October 17, 2010</date><text>Huang Kexue, federal authorities say, is a new kind of spy.For five years, Mr. Huang was a scientist at a Dow Chemical lab in Indiana, studying ways to improve insecticides. But before he was fired in 2008, Mr. Huang began sharing Dow’s secrets with Chinese researchers, authorities say, then obtained grants from a state-run foundation in China with the goal of starting a rival business there. Now, Mr. Huang, who was born in China and is a legal United States resident, faces a rare criminal charge — that he engaged in economic espionage on China’s behalf. Law enforcement officials say the kind of spying Mr. Huang is accused of represents a new front in the battle for a global economic edge. As China and other countries broaden their efforts to obtain Western technology, American industries beyond the traditional military and high-tech targets risk having valuable secrets exposed by their own employees, court records show. Rather than relying on dead drops and secret directions from government handlers, the new trade in business secrets seems much more opportunistic, federal prosecutors say, and occurs in loose, underground markets throughout the world. Prosecutors say it is difficult to prove links to a foreign government, but intelligence officials say China, Russia and Iran are among the countries pushing hardest to obtain the latest technologies. “In the new global economy, our businesses are increasingly targets for theft,” said Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s criminal division. “In order to stay a leader in innovation, we’ve got to protect these trade secrets.” Mr. Huang, 45, who says he is not guilty, is being prosecuted under an economic espionage provision in use for only the seventh time. Created by Congress in 1996 to address a shift toward industrial spying after the cold war, the law makes it a crime to steal business trade secrets, like software code and laboratory breakthroughs. The crime rises to espionage if the thefts are carried out to help a foreign government. Economic espionage charges are also pending against Jin Hanjuan, a software engineer for Motorola, who was arrested with a laptop full of company documents while boarding a plane for China, prosecutors said. Over the last year, other charges involving the theft of trade secrets — a charge less serious than espionage — have been filed against former engineers from General Motors and Ford who had business ties to China. And scientists at the DuPont Company and Valspar, a Minnesota paint company, recently pleaded guilty to stealing their employer’s secrets after taking jobs in China. In two past espionage cases involving American computer companies, defendants said they saw a chance to make money and acted on their own, knowing that the information would be valuable to Chinese companies or agencies. In several cases, Chinese government agencies or scientific institutes provided money to start businesses or research to develop the ideas; that financing is what gave rise to the espionage charges. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, appointed by Congress to study the national security issues arising from America’s economic relationship with China, said in a report last year that even in instances without direct involvement by Chinese officials, China’s government “has been a major beneficiary of technology acquired through industrial espionage.” China has denied that its intelligence services go after American industries. China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the subject, but spokesmen for the Chinese foundation and the university that worked with Mr. Huang said they were not aware of any espionage. “If it’s true, we will start our own investigation into it,” said Chen Yue, a spokesman for the Natural Science Foundation of China, which gave Mr. Huang grants to conduct research there. American officials and corporate trade groups say they fear economic spying will increase as China’s quest for Western know-how spreads from military systems to everyday commercial technologies. After focusing for decades on low-cost assembly operations, China “feels it really needs to turn the corner and become a technology power in its own right,” said James Mulvenon, the director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis in Washington, which tracks Chinese activities for federal agencies and corporate clients. Mr. Mulvenon said China is trying to woo back thousands of ethnic Chinese scientists who have trained or worked in the United States. “They basically roll out the red carpet for these guys,” he said. As economic crimes become easier to commit — in some cases as simple as downloading data and pressing “Send” — security analysts say some American companies must share the blame for thefts because they do not adequately monitor employees.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/business/04chemical.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Dow Chemical’s Profit Misses Forecasts<date>Published: August 3, 2010</date><text>The Dow Chemical Company posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit Tuesday after idling several plants to retool for higher production rates, and its shares fell nearly 10 percent.The temporary closing of three plants overshadowed higher sales across all businesses and regions, cutting profit by 7 cents a share and revenue by $300 million, the company said. The plants, one in Argentina and two in Texas, had been operating at low levels during the recession and Dow needed extra time to ramp up production, it said. The Argentina factory, Dow’s largest polyethylene plant in Latin America, was closed for 30 days, roughly a third of the quarter. It also had a water supply problem, the chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris, said in a call with investors. Mr. Liveris told investors the plant shutdown did not extend into the third quarter and that there would be no major closings the rest of the year. In a positive sign, Dow said its advanced materials business reported a 13.6 percent increase in sales, to $2.73 billion. Dow hopes to increase annual sales at the unit, which makes parts for solar panels, televisions and Apple’s iPhone, to $16 billion by 2015. Dow reported net income of $566 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $486 million, or 47 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, Dow earned 54 cents a share, falling short of the 56 cents expected by analysts. Revenue rose 20.3 percent to $13.62 billion from $11.32 billion. Dow cited bad weather in North America and Europe for lower-than-expected results in its agricultural business, where operating income rose 40 percent. On the conference call, executives said demand for agricultural chemicals remained strong. As in the first quarter, Dow’s basic plastics unit posted strong results, with sales up 26 percent. The unit’s products are used in a wide range of consumer goods, including diapers. Stock in Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich., fell $2.83, or almost 10 percent, to $25.5 a share.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E0DB163FF934A25754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=dowchemicalcompany">SPORTS BRIEFING | OLYMPICS; Dow An Olympic Sponsor<date>Published: July 17, 2010</date><text>Dow Chemical announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with the International Olympic Committee.

The subsequent rally has benefited nearly all investors, but for a select group of C.E.O.’s who were fortunate enough to get options, it has created a windfall. And while much of the attention has focused on the pay for executives at banks, a sector that enjoyed a back-from-the-dead performance last year, many of the biggest winners from options were C.E.O.’s at nonfinancial companies. Some executives on the top rungs of corporate America, including Alan Mulally of Ford Motor, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, have seen the value of their 2009 options packages double, triple and quadruple — and, in Mr. Mulally’s case, jump nearly 10 times in value, to more than $50 million. In most cases, they can’t cash in now: options typically take three to four years to fully vest. But the gains have set off renewed criticism that C.E.O. compensation is out of control, especially in a year plagued by the recession and high unemployment. “You’re going to see big numbers and people are going to squawk about it, as they should,” said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “There was concern at the time about unjustified returns, and that’s what happened. They clearly took advantage of the timing.” Not so fast, say other pay experts, who argue that the first quarter, and occasionally the fourth quarter, are typically the time when stock and option grants are made, regardless of how the stock market is performing. “They had no way to know the market would begin to recover in March,” said Carol Bowie, head of the governance institute at the RiskMetrics Group, a financial analytics company. “The fact of the matter is that many, many companies grant awards at the beginning of the year. It turned out to be an opportune time, but it’s not necessarily untoward.” Nevertheless, the outsize gains from stock and options last year are likely to fuel what’s already a fierce debate about executive pay levels. What’s more, companies like Ford, Starbucks, Dow, Whirlpool and American Express were making deep job cuts even as they showered options on their chief executives. “It reinforces the view that the rules of the game are rigged and that no matter what these guys do, they always come out ahead,” said Sarah Anderson, who tracks executive pay at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research group in Washington. “In a time of national crisis, it wasn’t appropriate to be giving out boatloads of new stock options.” For all the criticism of the options windfall, it’s worth noting that some pay experts have argued for years that chief executives should receive more options and stock, rather than cash, in order to link their pay to long-term corporate performance. But in a twist, the options packages have proved incredibly lucrative in the short term. The gains, Mr. Elson said, weren’t based on corporate performance but simply reflect the broad market rebound. AMONG 200 C.E.O.’s of companies tracked by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm that analyzed data for The New York Times, the biggest beneficiary of an options grant and subsequent stock market rally was Mr. Mulally at Ford. On March 11, 2009, two days after the Dow Jones industrial average hit a 12-year low of 6,547, Mr. Mulally received options to buy five million shares of Ford at $1.96, which the company estimated would be worth just over $5 million, using a complicated formula to predict their eventual value. The company usually grants options in March. A year later, the market is up more than 60 percent, but Ford shares are worth nearly 10 times what they were then, making Mr. Mulally’s options worth an estimated $53.3 million, according to Equilar. Mr. Mulally was eligible to receive the first batch on March 27 — worth more than $17 million — and is set to receive the rest within two years. Defenders of Mr. Mulally argue that Ford was the only one of the Big Three automakers not to file for bankruptcy last year; it actually earned a profit for the full year. But critics say an award of that size is still inappropriate, especially given the huge job cuts at Ford over the last few years. “The sector is going through hard times,” Ms. Anderson said. “For workers, it’s demoralizing to see that kind of money going into executives’ pockets when jobs are being cut.” A spokesman for Ford, Mark Truby, said Mr. Mulally’s options award was based on Ford’s long-term performance. “The ultimate value of these options will depend on how Ford’s stock performs over the next two years,” he said. Mr. Mulally, he added, took a 30 percent cut in salary in 2009 and 2010, and did not receive a cash bonus for 2008 and 2009. “The vast majority of his compensation is at risk and tied directly to the performance of the company and the stock,” Mr. Truby said. A corporate comeback and great timing also drove gains of the second-biggest options winner among the executives in the survey: Mr. Schultz of Starbucks.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/business/03chemical.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Emerging Markets Help Dow Beat Expectations<date>Published: February 2, 2010</date><text>Dow Chemical posted a higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, but said demand in the United States and Europe remained weak.

Go to Blog » Best known for its sales of natural gas and crude oil, which produce heat-trapping carbon dioxide, Gazprom is an emerging player in the market for credits that companies can buy or trade to comply with national or international rules on greenhouse gas emissions. Under the memorandum, Gazprom and Dow agreed to look at opportunities where Dow technologies could be used to reduce carbon emissions, thus generating the emission credits. The companies agreed to look at opportunities worldwide. Dow could then use some of the credits to offset its own industrial activities while Gazprom’s trading arm in Britain could market any excess.

Skip to next paragraph Related Executive Suite: Dow Chemical Folds (March 9, 2009) Add to Portfolio Dow Chemical Co Go to your Portfolio » The two chemical companies were expected to begin trial in Delaware Chancery Court on Tuesday, but agreed to settle out of court after talks last weekend. Under the terms of the settlement, Dow will pay Rohm’s shareholders $78 a share in cash and will close the merger by April 1. The settlement is a victory for investors in Rohm, who watched their shares skyrocket 40 percent over the last two trading days as a resolution to the contested deal appeared more likely. Dow first made an offer to buy Rohm &amp; Haas, a specialty chemical maker, in July at the same price of $78 a share. But since then, the economy has slumped, and demand for chemicals has declined along with it. In addition, Dow’s joint venture with a Kuwait-owned company fell through in December, erasing a $9 billion cash infusion that was going to help finance the transaction. Andrew N. Liveris, Dow’s chief executive, sought to delay or renegotiate the terms of the merger with Rohm, arguing that a deal would be financially disastrous for both companies. But Rohm sued the company for breaching the contract and asked a Delaware judge to force Dow to go through with the deal. The first step toward a settlement came on Friday when Dow said that it had renegotiated the terms of a bank bridge loan to give it additional financial flexibility. Under the new deal, Rohm’s two largest shareholders  the founding Haas family and the hedge fund Paulson &amp; Company  have agreed to buy up to $2.5 billion in preferred stock in Dow as part of the deal. The company also has an option to solicit another $500 million in common stock from the two shareholders if they need it to cushion their debt load. Dow will pay interest of 15 percent to the two largest shareholders instead of taking on additional debt. The company hopes the addition of equity capital along with about $4.1 billion in near-term asset sales will be enough to maintain their investment-grade credit rating. The company will also pay a fee of about 99 cents a share to Rohm’s shareholders for failing to close the takeover by the original January deadline. Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren E. Buffett, and the Kuwaiti Investment Authority have already agreed to make a combined $4 billion convertible preferred stock investment in Dow after the deal closes. Dow is also in talks with potential buyers of several business units, including the Morton Salt division of Rohm, which are expected to yield total proceeds of about $4.1 billion. Dow has been in discussions to sell its agricultural chemicals business, which analysts have said could fetch $7 billion, but Mr. Liveris has indicated that he would rather keep the business than sell it in the current market. Under the new terms, Dow will have an additional year to pay off the bank bridge loan, and the amount has been reduced by $500 million, to $12.5 billion. The company was also able to adjust some covenants of the loan, which would give it the ability to rework some of the terms if its business continues to deteriorate. The deal represents a big risk for Mr. Liveris, who now has to cut costs and sell assets amid the global financial crisis while operating under a heavy debt burden, analysts say. Dow plans to cut an additional 3,500 job cuts after the merger and will close 10 to 15 plants. Investors pushed shares of Dow down about 11 percent on Monday, to $6.33 on worries about the company’s outlook after it acquires Rohm. “We question the sustainability of Dow’s investment-grade credit rating and its dividend given cyclical weakness and the potential need to refinance a bridge loan,” Kevin W. McCarthy, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on Monday. The deal has already been approved by antitrust regulators and shareholders.

Dow had earlier refused to close the merger, saying its business would be hurt if it had to draw heavily on risky short-term debt. The deal came as a lawsuit Rohm filed against Dow for trying to pull out of the acquisition was about to get under way. Had the court ruled against Rohm or forced a compromise deal, Mr. Paulson’s 18-million-share bet on Rohm  which represented about 4 percent of Paulson’s assets under management at the end of December  would not have looked so clever. Rohm’s share price was drifting down toward $50 a share before hopes of a settlement resurfaced in recent days. As it stands, the other shareholders will get the $78 a share in cash that Dow originally offered. And it looks as if Mr. Paulson is essentially reinvesting his proceeds in Dow. The deal allows Mr. Paulson to move upward in the capital structure  where he’ll sit alongside Warren Buffett  providing him a margin of protection against further deterioration in Dow’s business. While he has been quite bullish on the company’s prospects, it faces significant challenges. After all, the rationale of Dow’s chief, Andrew Liveris, for walking away from the Rohm deal was that the combined company would not be viable. And despite the new equity financing and other emollients just announced, like additional potential synergies and the extension of the term of much of the $12.5 billion in debt financing, Dow isn’t out of the woods. The economic downturn has crimped its business and may do so for some time. Mr. Paulson has rescued his bet for the time being, but the game isn’t over yet. A Few Good Chairmen European companies increasingly have resorted to playing musical chairs to fill the chairman’s seat, dragging grandees out of retirement or hiring executives who feel a grudging sense of duty. The crisis has discredited many candidates and scared away still more. But the biggest problem is that shareholders and boards have come to expect too much from chairmen. It used to be that independence was the role’s core competence. The chairman brought broad business wisdom to judgments. But now companies want a chairman who also brings industry experience  especially after Royal Bank of Scotland’s failed experiment with a scientist in the top seat. Along with a sound and skilled mind, a suitable chairman should also have skin thick enough to tolerate rambunctious shareholders and media, a stomach strong enough to tackle a deep recession and a nose that has been squeaky clean. This kind of superhero might expect supersized rewards. But the average chairman gets a modest pay package for the effort. These high demands have made the latest round of chairman searches difficult. Swiss Re, the troubled insurer, on Monday plucked its former chief executive, Walter Kielholz, from the chairman’s seat at Credit Suisse to be its own. Philip Hampton reluctantly stepped into the role at RBS, when no one else would accept the thankless task. HSBC persuaded a Goldman Sachs veteran, John Thornton, to return to banking as chairman of its embattled American arm. He had been teaching in China. UBS pulled the former Swiss finance minister, Kaspar Villiger, 68, out of retirement. The oil major BP is still hunting for a new chairman. The talent pool is especially limited for industrial companies because finance has taken in so many bright minds in the last few decades and tarnished so many reputations in the last few years. As memories fade and new reputations are made, the pool will be replenished. But if shareholders and companies continue to expect such broad credentials and lofty ideals, supply will continue to fall well short of demand. Greater incentives will tempt more top-notch candidates. Mr. Hampton, for example, was given a generous options package that allows him to benefit from a successful RBS turnaround. Alternatively, boards and shareholders need a clear  and more modest  job description for the chairman’s job. Perfection is not available at any price.

In agreeing to acquire this Philadelphia-based company, Dow beat out its chief rival in the chemical industry, BASF of Germany. The price it agreed to pay was high: $78 a share in cash, a 74 percent premium, for a total of about $15.3 billion. Skip to next paragraph Readers’ Opinions Post a Comment on the Executive Suite blog Add to Portfolio Dow Chemical Co Go to your Portfolio » As it was described to me this week by David Bernick, a lawyer at Kirkland &amp; Ellis who is Dow Chemical’s chief outside counsel, the deal was part of a two-pronged strategy by Dow Chemical’s board and management to reconfigure the company. At the same time it was cutting the deal for Rohm &amp; Haas, it was also entering into a joint venture agreement with the Kuwaiti government that would put more than $9 billion into Dow Chemical’s coffers. The new venture was called K-Dow Petrochemicals, or K-Dow for short. The idea was to “monetize” Dow Chemical’s traditional commodity chemical business, while moving more aggressively into higher-margin, higher-profit specialty chemicals. The idea was also to use some of that $9 billion to help pay for the Rohm &amp; Haas acquisition. Dale Oesterle, a law professor at Ohio State University who writes a business law blog, has described the deal struck by Rohm &amp; Haas and Dow Chemical as a “very seller-biased contract.” And why wouldn’t it be? When a long-admired company puts itself up for auction, it is going to hold most of the cards. To land Rohm &amp; Haas, Dow Chemical agreed to terms that made it nearly impossible to back out if anything went wrong. The deal was not contingent on financing, for instance  not that Dow Chemical was worried about financing because it had the Kuwaitis in its back pocket. It couldn’t back out if the deal threatened its investment-grade credit rating. It was not dependent on the stock price. Indeed, it included something called a “specific performance” clause. That meant that if Dow Chemical tried to back out, Rohm &amp; Haas could go to court and insist that the deal be completed, at $78 a share, as specified in the contract. Monetary damages was not an adequate remedy. Even if you haven’t been following this deal closely, you can probably figure out what happened next. In September, Lehman Brothers defaulted, setting off a global financial collapse. The Kuwaiti stock market started to fall as tumbling oil prices sent fear through all the oil-producing economies. In November, the Kuwaitis brought Dow Chemical back to the negotiating table and revised the deal downward  now Dow Chemical would receive $7.5 billion in cash from the joint venture. And just a month after that  three days after Christmas, and despite having signed a pretty ironclad contract itself  the Kuwaitis stunned Dow Chemical by backing out entirely. Meanwhile, the chemical business was falling off a cliff. In announcing the company’s earnings on Tuesday, Andrew Liveris, Dow Chemical’s chief executive, called the fourth quarter “something none of us have ever experienced.” Revenue dropped 23 percent, and the company went from a third-quarter profit of 46 cents a share to a fourth-quarter loss of $1.68 a share. Not surprisingly, Mr. Liveris also said he didn’t expect things to get better anytime soon. And what of the Rohm &amp; Haas acquisition? A few weeks ago, with the deadline just days away, Dow Chemical informed Rohm &amp; Haas that it needed to delay the deal, at least until June. Although Mr. Liveris insisted in a news release that the Rohm &amp; Haas acquisition was still “consistent” with the company’s strategy, he conceded that Dow Chemical’s ability to finance the deal had been hurt by the pullout of the Kuwaitis. Dow Chemical feared that if it went ahead with the $15.3 billion deal  using a bridge loan that had to be paid off in a year  the combined entity could be badly damaged, saddled with high-priced debt in a horrible business environment, and a junk bond credit rating. Mr. Bernick said it could resemble one of those highly leveraged private equity deals that were done during the bull market of a few years ago, which are now struggling under the weight of their immense debt. How did Rohm &amp; Haas react to this bad news? It sued for “specific performance,” demanding that Dow Chemical complete the deal it had agreed to. After all, Rohm &amp; Haas noted in a statement, it had a duty “to protect its shareholders’ interests.” As it happens, its biggest shareholder is the trust for the Haas family, which owns nearly a quarter of the stock.

In agreeing to acquire this Philadelphia-based company, Dow beat out its chief rival in the chemical industry, BASF of Germany. The price it agreed to pay was high: $78 a share in cash, a 74 percent premium, for a total of about $15.3 billion. Skip to next paragraph Readers’ Opinions Post a Comment on the Executive Suite blog Add to Portfolio Dow Chemical Co Go to your Portfolio » As it was described to me this week by David Bernick, a lawyer at Kirkland &amp; Ellis who is Dow Chemical’s chief outside counsel, the deal was part of a two-pronged strategy by Dow Chemical’s board and management to reconfigure the company. At the same time it was cutting the deal for Rohm &amp; Haas, it was also entering into a joint venture agreement with the Kuwaiti government that would put more than $9 billion into Dow Chemical’s coffers. The new venture was called K-Dow Petrochemicals, or K-Dow for short. The idea was to “monetize” Dow Chemical’s traditional commodity chemical business, while moving more aggressively into higher-margin, higher-profit specialty chemicals.

Add to Portfolio Bank of America Corp Dow Chemical Co Go to your Portfolio » Who needs the government to create a new “bad bank” when it has Bank of America? Deal-making by the chief executive, Ken Lewis, has made the institution a de facto repository for all manner of toxic assets. For this and a stunning lack of candor over the Merrill Lynch mess, Bank of America’s board should show Mr. Lewis the door. Sure, the government may have egged Mr. Lewis on to close his acquisition of Merrill, and even winked at his takeover of the troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial. But as details emerge about his oversight of Bank of America’s purchase of the largest stockbroker, it has become clear that Mr. Lewis failed to sufficiently protect the interests of his shareholders from any such external pressures. The bank has not merely had to ask for a second, dilutive helping of the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program and suspend its dividend. It has led to one of the greatest destructions of shareholder value in financial history. The 85 percent decline in Bank of America’s share price over the last year has cost shareholders some $250 billion. Other banks, like Citigroup, have seen analogous losses. But most of the problems at Citi occurred under previous management. Bank of America’s current problems happened under Mr. Lewis’s gaze, which the Merrill fiasco suggests was far from steely. Within weeks of closing, Bank of America revealed a $15.3 billion loss and said Merrill had paid out compensation that totaled only 6 percent less than in 2007, and did so a month earlier than usual. Bank of America says it had no legal right to challenge the payouts. But Mr. Lewis should have thought of that when he cut the deal. That he didn’t exhibits how little flair he has for the due diligence required of a serial deal maker. Then there’s his handling of the news. In the ensuing public ruckus, Bank of America did little to disabuse investors of their assumption that the losses had occurred as a result of new positions, or that Merrill had pulled one over on its new owner regarding bonuses. Only after Mr. Lewis dismissed John Thain did the former Merrill chief publicly state that the losses “were incurred almost entirely on legacy positions” and the bonuses “were all determined together with” Bank of America. Corporate executives must accept responsibility for failures if they are to keep their shareholders’ trust. When they don’t, it is up to the board to make sure blame is apportioned appropriately. Mr. Lewis hasn’t come clean. Bank of America’s board must. No Buyout Victim Dow Chemical doesn’t want to close its $19 billion acquisition of Rohm and Haas  at least not yet. It could try a few private-equity-like moves to escape or renegotiate the deal. But with different legal and market circumstances, Rohm may be in the driving seat. If the deal closes as it stands, Dow will be stuck with a $13 billion loan that comes due in a year or so. It had hoped to use only part of that loan since it anticipated having $7 billion of cash from a deal in Kuwait, but that fell through. This predicament is similar in some ways to that of private equity firms, which planned to use large amounts of debt to buy companies. When the credit crisis struck, they found themselves faced with the prospect of buying companies that could no longer support that debt. Some renegotiated deals, while others walked away and paid little or nothing to the target companies. But Rohm may have a stronger hand than many buyout targets. First, the deal was struck only last July. The credit crisis was already well under way at that point, so Dow can’t really use it as an excuse, as some private equity firms have. Unlike many private equity firms, Dow may not be able to simply pay its $750 million termination fee and walk away. It appears to kick in only if regulators block the deal, and they have already blessed it. On top of that, Dow is a big company, not the kind of empty shell that private equity firms use in acquisitions. It has a greater ability to pay lawsuit damages, if it comes to that. In the end, Rohm may not want to force a deal that would combine it with a dangerously overindebted Dow. But it should have more negotiating power than the typical jilted buyout target.

But now that oil costs are plunging, other prices are not following them lower -- not yet, anyway. Even though oil prices have fallen closer to $100 a barrel, from $147 about two months ago, many companies that cited higher energy costs for increasing prices are resisting a rollback, saying they still need to recover money lost in the run-up. Crude oil prices slid Tuesday by $5.75, to $109.71 a barrel, down 25 percent from the high on July 11, as Hurricane Gustav passed near New Orleans without damaging oil production facilities. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 220 points before falling as energy company shares lost ground. As oil tumbles, prices at the gas pump come down. But the costs of many other products have not. Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, has raised by 7 percent to 10 percent the prices it charges retailers for items made with ingredients derived from oil. The company is planning to maintain the increase ''to recover costs already incurred,'' Paul Fox, a spokesman, said. Such decisions will come as little relief for thousands of retailers and wholesalers that have been forced to squeeze margins instead of passing their elevated costs to consumers, who have cut back on consumption of finished goods as their bills for groceries and gas jumped. P.&amp; G., Dow Chemical, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, as well as other big users of oil-based raw materials, are waiting to see if oil prices will stay down or continue to fall before they commit to price cuts. ''Everybody still feels there is too much uncertainty to be clear about what action they should take,'' said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who specializes in companies that use oil-based raw materials in making a variety of consumer products. ''They won't immediately drop their prices.'' Until recently, robust growth in Europe and a seemingly endless thirst for petroleum in China and developing nations lifted global demand for oil, and the price with it. But now some economies, especially in Europe, are weakening almost more rapidly than America's, lifting the dollar. That should help relieve price pressures over all by making imports -- as well as oil prices -- cheaper. This uncertainty helps to explain why Dow Chemical, for example, which had raised prices this year by nearly 50 percent for the oil-based raw materials that go into the manufacture of products like diapers and polystyrene, does not want to give up those increases until the company recovers its old profit margins. ''Our prices continue to lag our cost increases,'' the spokesman, David Winder, said. And Goodyear Tire and Rubber, which has raised tire prices by 15 percent this year, said it was still making synthetic rubber tires from oil-based feed stocks bought at relatively high prices more than three months ago. Keith Price, a Goodyear spokesman, said Goodyear could not consider canceling the price increase until it knew whether oil prices were going to stay down. The decline in oil prices has also dragged the cost of other commodities sharply lower since early summer. Corn, in particular, has slumped: it settled on Tuesday at $5.69 a bushel, down 29 percent since June 27. Soybean prices are down 21 percent in the same period. Despite the steep declines in the cost of raw ingredients, prices for packaged foods sold at supermarkets are likely to remain higher than they were last year, said Ephraim Leibtag, an economist who studies food markets for the Agriculture Department. With oil prices in sharp decline, the nation's millions of car owners are a little better off. The average price of a gallon of gas settled at $3.68 on Tuesday, down from a record $4.11 in mid-July. ''That's a 43-cent decline,'' said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, chief economist for the Ford Motor Company. ''It's almost like a tax cut for consumers.'' Just the opposite holds for commuters who travel on the nation's airlines. The major carriers have pushed through 15 price increases since the beginning of the year, with 11 of them depicted as fuel surcharges. None of the domestic airlines has stated how or when the surcharges might be removed, making them the equivalent of price increases, said Rick Seaney, who runs FareCompare.com, a Web site offering information on plane fares. Like Procter &amp; Gamble, Dow Chemical and Goodyear, the airlines suggest that what they do with fares depends on what happens to the price of oil over the long run. ''We would love to see it come down and stay down,'' said Betsy E. Talton, a Delta spokeswoman. Interest rates were slightly lower with the rate on the 10-year Treasury note at 3.73 percent, down from 3.81 percent late Friday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 21/32, to 102 6/32.

The acquisition, the biggest in Dow's 101-year history, is being financed with equity investments of $3 billion by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's holding company, and $1 billion by the Kuwait Investment Authority. The deal, expected to close by early 2009, will create one of the nation's largest specialty chemical companies at a time when the industry is struggling and commodity prices are at record highs. Dow said it would pay $78 for each share of Rohm &amp; Haas, a 74 percent premium over the company's closing price of $44.83 a share on Wednesday. The deal is already raising eyebrows as analysts worry that Dow may have unrealistic growth expectations. ''It's going to be a challenging environment for Dow,'' said Frank Mitsch, an analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, which downgraded its rating of Dow shares to hold, from buy on Thursday. ''It's a heck of a premium, especially at a time when industry fundamentals are suffering.'' Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich., will also assume $3.5 billion of Rohm &amp; Haas debt. ''There are many jewels out there, and this is one of them,'' Andrew N. Liveris, the chairman and chief executive of Dow, said in a conference call. ''The bottom line is, this is a powerful new Dow.'' But Wall Street is not so sure. Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said Thursday that Dow's A rating has a 50 percent chance of being downgraded in the next three months. Edward Yang, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Company, said he was ''very surprised'' by the deal. ''Given the macro environment, they could have bided their time,'' he said. ''But they must think it's going to work.'' Mr. Yang added that he was particularly surprised by Dow's ''generous concessions.'' For example, Rohm &amp; Haas will continue to do business under its own name and will maintain its headquarters in Philadelphia. Two of the company's directors will join Dow's board. Dow said it would ''contribute complementary businesses'' to Rohm &amp; Haas in overlapping areas including coatings, biocides and personal care products. As a result, Rohm &amp; Haas said it expected annual revenue of $13 billion, compared with last year's revenue of $8.9 billion. Its products include electronics technologies, coatings, and packaging and building materials. ''I have relentlessly talked to our employees, customers and stockholders about the imperative to seek opportunities for transformative change,'' said Raj L. Gupta, the chairman and chief executive of Rohm &amp; Haas. ''In its 100-year history, Rohm &amp; Haas has constantly reinvented itself, and this agreement offers outstanding potential to do the same yet again.'' The deal, unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, must be approved by Rohm &amp; Haas shareholders. A spokeswoman at Berkshire Hathaway said the company was unavailable for comment. Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley also provided debt financing for the transaction. Shares of Rohm &amp; Haas closed up $28.79, or 64 percent, to $73.62, while shares of Dow were down $1.44, or 4.2 percent, to $32.52. PHOTO: A Rohm &amp; Haas plant in Pennsylvania.

The increase of as much as 25 percent -- the largest in the company's history -- comes after a 20 percent rise last month that the company said did not go far enough given the continuing surge in energy prices. Dow, which makes products ranging from pesticides to plastic wraps, also said it would impose freight surcharges of $300 for each truck shipment and $600 for each rail shipment beginning Aug. 1 in the United States. In addition, it will scale back production in plants across North America and Europe. Andrew N. Liveris, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the changes were ''extremely unwelcome but entirely unavoidable'' as oil and natural gas continue to set records. Oil prices are up more than 40 percent this year and have risen $9 a barrel since Dow's earlier price increase. Natural gas is up more than 70 percent this year. ''There came a point where the surge became so ridiculous that we had to raise prices,'' Chris Huntley, a company spokesman, said, adding that the latest price increase would affect everything from fabric and cushions to CD cases, Styrofoam and car parts. Analysts said they expected other companies to follow suit. When Dow announced last month's increases, it spurred a series of similar increases by other chemical manufacturers, including DuPont and BASF. Dow's announcement is the latest indication that companies are beginning to pass along the burden of high energy prices to consumers. Until now, those prices had largely been absorbed by company profits because market competition prevented retailers from increasing prices at their stores even as skyrocketing costs continued to strain earnings. But extreme pressure is building in the production chain. For example, Lowe's, the home improvement company, has been receiving ''unprecedented requests'' for price increases from its suppliers, Robert F. Hull Jr., the chief financial officer, said at a conference. Mr. Hull added that the company had been absorbing price increases itself ''to maintain the supply of product,'' which has put a strain on gross margins, but he forecast that some of that increase would be passed along later this year. In addition to soaring energy costs, companies are also having to deal with the increase in the cost of raw materials. Posco of South Korea, one of the world's largest steel producers, said Tuesday that it was raising prices by more than 20 percent. That followed an agreement Monday between the global mining company Rio Tinto Group and the biggest steel maker in China, Baosteel, to raise the price Baosteel pays for Australian iron ore by as much as 97 percent. ''It's clearly a global trend that the higher costs of raw materials are being passed on along the production chain,'' said Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at the London office of Bank of America. ''Companies have no alternative but to pass that along to their customers.'' Producer prices in the United States rose 7.2 percent in May from a year earlier, while comparable euro zone prices rose 6.1 percent in April, the latest month for which data were available. Chinese producer prices are rising at nearly a 12 percent annual rate. The rise in prices also partly reflects the weakness of the dollar, as producers outside the United States demand more of the currency for their goods as its buying power declines. In addition, a ripple effect has been created in which the rise in crude oil costs has carried over into other sectors. Economists say the $664 billion chemical industry has been among the hardest hit by soaring energy prices. Every $1 increase in crude oil prices costs the industry $660 million a year, said Kevin Swift, chief economist at the American Chemistry Council. For Dow Chemical, its feedstock and energy costs, which are up more than 40 percent since last year, have increased fourfold in the last five years, to more than $32 billion this year. Dow, whose shares fell nearly 3 percent on Tuesday, has been steadily increasing prices for the last several years, but it is only in the last month that consumers have been directly hit. ''These costs have surged so much that the middle guys say they can't absorb any more,'' Mr. Liveris said in an interview this month. ''There is no reason the middle of the supply chain should have to absorb it.'' PHOTO: A Dow Chemical complex in Midland, Mich. The company, which increased prices by 20 percent last month, now says costs are forcing a second increase, this time by up to 25 percent.(PHOTOGRAPH BY STEVEN SIMPKINS/ASSOCIATED PRESS)(pg.

That was the code name given to their secret plan for a $50 billion takeover of Dow Chemical last year. The planners were two of the company’s top executives and they were trying to orchestrate this huge deal behind the backs of Dow Chemical’s chief executive and board. You might recall this sordid tale because the two executives were unceremoniously fired  with the executives claiming to have known nothing about the takeover talks. An acrimonious fight in court followed. On Monday, dueling lawsuits ended in a settlement, and the gentlemen who said they categorically denied having tried to take over Dow Chemical changed their story: the men  Romeo Kreinberg, a former Dow executive vice president, and J. Pedro Reinhard, the company’s former chief financial officer (and board member) who had been passed over for the top job  acknowledged “participating in discussions which were not authorized by nor disclosed to Dow’s board concerning a potential L.B.O. of Dow.” It’s quite an about-face. But more important, the case and its juicy depositions weren’t just about two rogue employees. It pulled the curtain back on a netherworld of deal makers on various continents who had become wrapped up in this plot. And it exposed just how some billion-dollar buyouts might have been done when credit was still easy and fees were plentiful. An enormous cast of characters from Wall Street worked for months  some behind the backs of their own clients  to pursue a deal. The list of big names may surprise you: Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Peter A. Weinberg of Perella Weinberg (formerly of Goldman Sachs), Martin Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and yes, the man of the moment, James Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. As with most fables about money and power, this one starts with greed. As Dow Chemical tells the story  at this point, its version is the more credible  the plot started in the fall of 2006. The plan was to overthrow Dow Chemical’s chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris, and replace him with Mr. Reinhard and Mr. Kreinberg after the buyout. In the space of several months, the plotters lined up financing from the Sultanate of Oman. JPMorgan Cazenove signed on to act as an adviser and financier and Allen &amp; Overy was retained as legal counsel. Even before that, the men had tried to interest Leonard Blavatnik, the Russian-American businessman, in backing them; he initially turned them down, but then met with Mr. Kravis and Mr. Weinberg at his office in London to discuss the possibility of a takeover. (Notes from that meeting said that “Henry will go meet with Liveris but not mention Len” and that it would be best “to do it low key at a Business Council meeting.” The roles and compensation packages for the two plotters were apparently constant topics. Eddie Wilson, a consultant working with the men and JPMorgan, testified “that Kreinberg would be in charge of the day-to-day operation of the company, while Reinhard would serve as chairman.” Mr. Reinhard sought $5 million from Oman to resign from Dow Chemical to work on the buyout. In addition, “there was a discussion around dividing the banking fee allocation” among the men, Mr. Wilson said. JPMorgan, which long considered Dow Chemical a client, seems to be in a terrible spot in this story. Perhaps the bank was duped  as it now claims. But it sure doesn’t seem that way from the now-disclosed documents. They show that the bank eagerly pursued the deal even though at least some of its top bankers knew full well that Dow Chemical’s board was not on board. The deal even went through the bank’s conflicts committee. After the conflicts committee gave its approval, William T. Winters, co-head of JPMorgan’s global investment banking division, wrote in an e-mail message: “Buyout team led by former Dow C.F.O. Not all members of the current senior Dow management team are involved.” At another point, a firm memo said that the two men were “deliberately keeping low profile until further down track” and that they wanted “plausible deniability at this stage.” JPMorgan executives met with Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard in secret at a hotel, the Compleat Angler, 40 miles outside London. A JPMorgan e-mail message said the participants had “hired entire hotel for confidentiality.” It was only after that meeting that Mr. Winters determined that “‘management’ is not on board but rather a potentially rogue element.” And still JPMorgan continued to work on the transaction, and “pitched the transaction to K.K.R. on March 13 and to TPG on March 14.” It was only once news reports about a possible deal emerged  and Dow contacted JPMorgan  that it stopped working on the deal. That is also when everything unraveled. To give him his due, it was Mr. Dimon of JPMorgan who identified the two men to Mr. Liveris.

Liveris, Dow Chemical’s chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement. Dow Chemical’s spiraling costs are “forcing difficult discussions with customers,” he said. The company, based in Midland, Mich., supplies a broad swath of industries, from agriculture to health care, and any sizable price jumps would likely affect almost all of them. The price increases will take effect Sunday and will be based on a product’s exposure to rising costs. Dow Chemical said it spent $8 billion on energy and hydrocarbon-based feedstock, or raw materials, in 2002 and that could climb fourfold to $32 billion this year. Dow Chemical makes products ranging from the propylene glycols used in antifreeze, coolants, solvents, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to acrylic acid-based products used in detergents, wastewater-treatment and disposable diapers. It makes crucial ingredients used in paints, textiles, glass, packaging and cars. The company, whose products are sold in 160 countries, last month reported a 3 percent decline in quarterly earnings amid a 42 percent increase in energy and raw materials costs. Its profit margins shrank to 7.6 percent in 2006, from 9.8 percent in 2005, and to 5.4 percent last year. During the 12-month period that ended March 31, the margin narrowed to 5.1 percent, according to Capital IQ. Crude oil prices surpassed $135 a barrel last week, more than double the price from a year ago. Rising energy and transportation costs have been blamed for higher food prices, which rose 5 percent last year, the highest gain in 17 years. Kevin McCarthy, a Banc of America Securities analyst, said in a note to investors there was “a growing unwillingness among chemical producers to function as an energy shock absorber.” “To be sure, cost inflation is not new; it has been an ongoing battle for Dow and others in recent years,” he wrote. “However, we are seeing a new sense of urgency at Dow, and its competitors, to pass along escalating and volatile costs in an environment of decelerating demand.” Price increases from major suppliers significantly affect the cost of manufacturing, said Angie Chaplin, a spokeswoman for the Solo Cup Company. The company, based in Highland Park, Ill., is a customer of Dow Chemical. “We absorb as much of these increases as we can through greater efficiency in our own operations, but we have no choice other than to pass on some of the increased cost to our customers,” she said. More Articles in Business »The Dow Chemical Company, the chemical giant, said Wednesday that it would raise its prices by up to 20 percent almost immediately to offset the soaring cost of energy, and the company’s chief executive criticized Washington for failing to develop a sound energy policy. “For years, Washington has failed to address the issue of rising energy costs and, as a result, the country now faces a true energy crisis, one that is causing serious harm to America’s manufacturing sector and all consumers of energy,” Andrew N. Liveris, Dow Chemical’s chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement. Dow Chemical’s spiraling costs are “forcing difficult discussions with customers,” he said. The company, based in Midland, Mich., supplies a broad swath of industries, from agriculture to health care, and any sizable price jumps would likely affect almost all of them. The price increases will take effect Sunday and will be based on a product’s exposure to rising costs. Dow Chemical said it spent $8 billion on energy and hydrocarbon-based feedstock, or raw materials, in 2002 and that could climb fourfold to $32 billion this year. Dow Chemical makes products ranging from the propylene glycols used in antifreeze, coolants, solvents, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to acrylic acid-based products used in detergents, wastewater-treatment and disposable diapers. It makes crucial ingredients used in paints, textiles, glass, packaging and cars. The company, whose products are sold in 160 countries, last month reported a 3 percent decline in quarterly earnings amid a 42 percent increase in energy and raw materials costs. Its profit margins shrank to 7.6 percent in 2006, from 9.8 percent in 2005, and to 5.4 percent last year. During the 12-month period that ended March 31, the margin narrowed to 5.1 percent, according to Capital IQ. Crude oil prices surpassed $135 a barrel last week, more than double the price from a year ago. Rising energy and transportation costs have been blamed for higher food prices, which rose 5 percent last year, the highest gain in 17 years.

The headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, located across from Lafayette Park in Washington, is a limestone structure that looks almost as majestic as the Supreme Court. The similarity is no coincidence: both buildings were designed by the same architect, Cass Gilbert. Lately, however, the affinities between the court and the chamber, a lavishly financed business-advocacy organization, seem to be more than just architectural. The Supreme Court term that ended last June was, by all measures, exceptionally good for American business. The chamber’s litigation center filed briefs in 15 cases and its side won in 13 of them  the highest percentage of victories in the center’s 30-year history. The current term, which ends this summer, has also been shaping up nicely for business interests. I visited the chamber recently to talk with Robin Conrad, who heads the litigation effort, about her recent triumphs. Conrad, an appealing, soft-spoken woman, lives with her family on a horse farm in Maryland, where she rides with a fox-chasing club called the Howard County-Iron Bridge Hounds. Her office, playfully adorned by action figures of women like Xena the Warrior Princess and Hillary Rodham Clinton, has one of the most impressive views in Washington. “You can see the White House through the trees,” she said as we peered through a window overlooking the park. “In the old days, you could actually see people bathing in the fountain. Homeless people.” Conrad was in an understandably cheerful mood. Though the current Supreme Court has a well-earned reputation for divisiveness, it has been surprisingly united in cases affecting business interests. Of the 30 business cases last term, 22 were decided unanimously, or with only one or two dissenting votes. Conrad said she was especially pleased that several of the most important decisions were written by liberal justices, speaking for liberal and conservative colleagues alike. In opinions last term, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and David Souter each went out of his or her way to question the use of lawsuits to challenge corporate wrongdoing  a strategy championed by progressive groups like Public Citizen but routinely denounced by conservatives as “regulation by litigation.” Conrad reeled off some of her favorite moments: “Justice Ginsburg talked about how ‘private-securities fraud actions, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively.’ Justice Breyer had a wonderful quote about how Congress was trying to ‘weed out unmeritorious securities lawsuits.’ Justice Souter talked about how the threat of litigation ‘will push cost-conscious defendants to settle.’ ” Examples like these point to an ideological sea change on the Supreme Court. A generation ago, progressive and consumer groups petitioning the court could count on favorable majority opinions written by justices who viewed big business with skepticism  or even outright prejudice. An economic populist like William O. Douglas, the former New Deal crusader who served on the court from 1939 to 1975, once unapologetically announced that he was “ready to bend the law in favor of the environment and against the corporations.” Today, however, there are no economic populists on the court, even on the liberal wing. And ever since John Roberts was appointed chief justice in 2005, the court has seemed only more receptive to business concerns. Forty percent of the cases the court heard last term involved business interests, up from around 30 percent in recent years. While the Rehnquist Court heard less than one antitrust decision a year, on average, between 1988 and 2003, the Roberts Court has heard seven in its first two terms  and all of them were decided in favor of the corporate defendants. Business cases at the Supreme Court typically receive less attention than cases concerning issues like affirmative action, abortion or the death penalty. The disputes tend to be harder to follow: the legal arguments are more technical, the underlying stories less emotional. But these cases  which include shareholder suits, antitrust challenges to corporate mergers, patent disputes and efforts to reduce punitive-damage awards and prevent product-liability suits  are no less important. They involve billions of dollars, have huge consequences for the economy and can have a greater effect on people’s daily lives than the often symbolic battles of the culture wars. In the current Supreme Court term, the justices have already blocked a liability suit against Medtronic, the manufacturer of a heart catheter, and rejected a type of shareholder suit that includes a claim against Enron. In the coming months, the court will decide whether to reduce the largest punitive-damage award in American history, which resulted from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. What should we make of the Supreme Court’s transformation? Throughout its history, the court has tended to issue opinions, in areas from free speech to gender equality, that reflect or consolidate a social consensus. With their pro-business jurisprudence, the justices may be capturing an emerging spirit of agreement among liberal and conservative elites about the value of free markets. Among the professional classes, many Democrats and Republicans, whatever their other disagreements, have come to share a relatively laissez-faire, technocratic vision of the economy and are suspicious of excessive regulation and reflexive efforts to vilify big business.

(AP)  Dow Chemical plans to sell a 50 percent interest in five of its global businesses to a Kuwaiti company for about $9.5 billion to form a joint petrochemicals venture, the company said Thursday. Dow said the transaction with the Petrochemical Industries Company, a subsidiary of the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, is expected to close in late 2008.

The modified corn that would be banned has been grown in America for years. The preliminary decisions are circulating within the European Commission, which has the final say. Some officials there are skeptical of a ban that would upset the powerful biotechnology industry and could exacerbate tensions with important trading partners like the United States. The seeds are not available on the European market for cultivation. In the decisions, the environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas, contends that the genetically modified corn, or maize could affect certain butterfly species, specifically the monarch, and other beneficial insects. For instance, research this year indicates that larvae of the monarch butterfly exposed to the genetically modified corn behave differently than other larvae. In the decision concerning the corn seeds produced by Dow and Pioneer, Mr. Dimas calls potential damage on the environment irreversible. In the decision on Syngentas corn, he says that the level of risk generated by the cultivation of this product for the environment is unacceptable. A decision by the European Union to bar cultivation of the genetically modified crops would be the first of its kind in the trade bloc, and would intensify the continuing battle over genetically modified corn. Since 1998, the commission has not approved any applications for the cultivation of genetically modified crops, but it has not actively rejected any applications, either, as would be the case with the genetically modified corn products. Banning the applications for corn crops also would mark a bold new step for European environmental authorities, who are already aggressively pursuing regulations on emissions from cars and aircraft, setting it at odds with the United States and angering industries. These products have been grown in the U.S. and other countries for years, said Stephen Norton, a spokesman for the United States trade representative. We are not aware of any other case when a product has been rejected after having been reviewed and determined safe by European food safety authorities, he said.

But in the draft decision, Mr. Dimas said that other studies had since come to light on the potential effects of the seeds and that further investigation was needed. Barbara Helfferich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dimas, declined to comment on the specifics of the procedure because commissioners had not yet made a final decision. But she said that the European Union was within its rights to make decisions based on the precautionary principle even when scientists had found no definitive evidence proving products can cause harm. The commission has the authority to be a risk manager when it comes to the safety and science of genetically modified crops, Ms. Helfferich said.

In the decisions, Mr. Dimas cited recent research showing that consumption of genetically modified corn byproducts reduced growth and increased mortality of nontarget stream insects and that these insects are important prey for aquatic and riparian predators and that this could have unexpected ecosystem-scale consequences. Although still preliminary, his decisions could drastically tilt the policy against future approvals of genetically modified crops, said Nathalie Moll, a spokeswoman for Europabio, an industry group with 80 members including Syngenta, Pioneer and Dow.

Liveris was rocky) in hopes of redeeming itself. Dow, the largest chemical company in the United States, has already sued Mr. Kreinberg and its former adviser and director, J. Pedro Reinhard, for damages. Both were dismissed after JPMorgans chief executive, James Dimon, told Mr. Liveris that the two men took part in the unauthorized sales talks. In the suit, Mr. Kreinberg contends that JPMorgan should be held accountable for its share of harm caused to the company. Elsewhere in the suit, he said that if Dow genuinely seeks to avenge a purported wrong, the bank should be a welcome addition to the case. A spokesman for JPMorgan said Tuesday that Mr. Kreinbergs claims were legally and factually unfounded. We are confident they will be dismissed, the spokesman said. A lawyer for Mr. Kreinberg, Stanley Arkin, said I have no comment for the moment. Mr. Kreinbergs role in the talks is in dispute. He says that he had one brief conversation with JPMorgans bankers about a possible buyout. Dow says that Mr. Kreinberg not only took part in the talks but did not tell Dow about them when asked. Sometime in late 2006, JPMorgan  without telling Mr. Liveris  contacted investors, including the government of Oman, to explore a possible deal for Dow. Reports about the talks kept appearing in the media, prompting Mr. Liveris to begin a search for the source. When it emerged that JPMorgan was the adviser behind the rumored talks, Mr. Liveris confronted the bank. What followed was a dinner on April 9 in Midland, Mich., where Dow is based. Mr. Kreinbergs complaint said that during the dinner, Mr. Liveris made it clear that Dow and he personally were out for scalps, and that the bank could curry favor by helping him implicate Kreinberg. Within a few days, Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard were fired.

Quarterly sales rose 6 percent, to $13.27 billion, outstripping Wall Streets expectations of $12.56 billion. But profit from Dows performance plastics and performance chemicals business fell, pressured by weak North American housing and automotive markets, coupled with the impact of high raw material costs that could not immediately be passed to customers.

The negotiations were prompted last week when the agency decided to order the cleanup. A spokesman for Dow said it was already working on cleaning up the highly toxic dioxin. Margaret Guerriero, director of the land and chemicals division for the environmental agency’s regional office in Chicago, said: “Our concern was that they were not moving fast enough, and this was going to get protracted because of the seasonal nature of the work. There is only a certain window every year when you can go in and do the work. We were worried that it was going to slip.” The areas were discovered in November, a Dow spokesman, John Musser, said yesterday. “A good bit of what they were asking us to do to  in their words, hurry the process up  we had already agreed to do, and to some extent gotten that work under way,” Mr. Musser said. The sites are within six miles of the plant in Midland, Mich. One is not far from the plant, 30 to 70 feet from the riverbank. The dioxin is in sediments 2 to 10 feet below the surface of the Tittabawassee River. Although there is no indication that residents or workers in the area are directly exposed to the sites, studies have found slightly elevated levels of dioxin in some people who frequently consume fish from the river. The river often overflows in heavy rains and the spring thaw. Dioxin, the popular name for a group of cancer-causing chemical compounds, was a standard byproduct of chemical and pesticide manufacturing and paper bleaching.

I was a tourist, though my trip was not a post-college vacation involving tanning oil and beach chairs and oozing hangovers suffered under the shade of palm trees. I traveled to Vietnam as the daughter of a veteran, a man who had spent a lifetime dealing with his experiences in the war. Making the journey to Vietnam was important for me, but at the time I couldnt quite formulate how. In the weeks I spent in Vietnam, I went to the places my father had seen action, mostly in the south, in Cu Chi and Tay Ninh, areas not far from Ho Chi Minh City. The region was so thick with foliage one would never suspect that in an effort to expose the Vietcong by destroying their environment, the United States sprayed about 19.5 million gallons of Agent Orange and other toxic herbicides over the jungles of South Vietnam. As I traveled the region, I knew about Agent Orange, just as I knew that an environmental cleanup effort was still under way, and yet it was hard to believe. The foliage was lush and green, seemingly untouched by the noxious chemicals of the war. I had seen a video of the C-123 cargo planes swooping low, just above a blanket of crenellated canopy, the fusillade of white clouds fanning out, pretty as powdered sugar. The chemicals worked through the top layers of foliage, moving down to the rice paddies and sinking into the red soil. In the video, the defoliant appeared almost tonic, like cool talcum powder falling from heaven. My father walked in the wake of those planes. He remembered the defoliants descent over the jungle, slow as snow. He recalled the white coated leaves, the way his throat burned when he breathed the humid air, the strange discoloration he found when he blew his nose. He remembered bathing in a bomb crater, dead birds floating on the surface. Last year, after five years fighting throat cancer that he and his doctors attributed to exposure to the dioxin in Agent Orange, my father died. He was 61. During my trip, I visited a museum dedicated to remembering what the Vietnamese call the American War. Exhibits on the effects of Agent Orange make up a significant part of the permanent collection. There were numbers and charts and statistics, run-of-the-mill data, but there were also pictures of babies born of parents exposed to Agent Orange. Their deformities were gruesome, making them appear bestial, inhuman. Years after my trip, these are the images I remember most vividly. Today the federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, is scheduled to hear oral arguments against Dow, Monsanto and 35 other companies that manufactured Agent Orange and related herbicides used during the Vietnam War. In addition, 16 appeals by American veterans will be heard, as well as an appeal by a group that represents Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange. The veterans and the Vietnamese are seeking the reinstatement of lawsuits dismissed in March 2005 by Judge Jack Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The plaintiffs are asking the court to acknowledge that Agent Orange has damaged the lives of thousands of people in both the United States and Vietnam. One of the Vietnamese civilians taking part in this appeal is a woman named Dang Hong Nhut, who lived in Cu Chi during the war, the very same part of Vietnam where my father spent his tour. After losing numerous babies to miscarriage and deformity, Dang Hong Nhut sent a biopsy abroad for analysis. The results showed that, years after the war, her body still retained traces of dioxin. In a television interview, she said: It doesnt matter if the companies wont admit their crimes.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Andrew N. Liveris, Dow Chemicals chief, fired an executive and a board member, accusing them of unauthorized buyout talks. Related Behind the Dow Chemical Firings, a Tangled Corporate Drama (May 9, 2007) Ex-Dow Officer Disputes Firing (April 17, 2007) Dow Chemical Fires 2, Citing Talks on a Buyout (April 13, 2007) Dow fired a senior executive and a board member last month, accusing the two men of engaging in unauthorized buyout talks. Shares of Dow had spiked on a number of occasions in the months before the dismissals on speculation about a deal, stoked by news reports that a buyout was in the works and possibly by leaks about talks the former executives were accused of holding. But the inquiry, still in the informal stage, may also look at a deal that the company actually pursued. Last fall, Dow made an overture to acquire DuPont in a deal worth more than $40 billion, according to people involved in the talks. If the approach had ultimately led to a deal, it would have combined the largest and third-largest chemical companies in the United States. ExxonMobil is No. 2. Shares of Dow and DuPont traded somewhat erratically at the time, though neither company disclosed the approach. From September to December, shares of DuPont climbed 15 percent. DuPont rebuffed Dows advances and never engaged in negotiations, these people said. Dows chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris, sits on the board of Citigroup with Alain J. P. Belda, the chief executive of Alcoa, who at the time of the overture was also a director of DuPont; Mr. Belda stepped down from DuPonts board in March. Dow declined to comment. A DuPont spokeswoman did not return a call last night seeking comment. In recent months, Mr. Liveris has denied that the company has held buyout talks. Dow said that all of the speculation about a deal was the result of two senior officials, Romeo Kreinberg and J.

JPMorgan Chase, one of Dows longtime banks, had been working on an unauthorized takeover proposal of Dow and had talked to the two men at least once. Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard have denied being involved in a plot to take over the company and have sued Dow, contending that they were defamed. The S.E.C. has sought information from Dow, Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard, people briefed on the inquiry said. It is unclear whether the S.E.C. plans to pursue civil actions against either Mr. Kreinberg or Mr. Reinhard. Nor is it clear whether the S.E.C. has identified any investors that may have improperly traded on information related to the possibility of a buyout of Dow. The S.E.C. is also seeking other information from JPMorgan Chase about the work the bank had done on the takeover proposal and the people and companies it had held discussions with, these people said. According to Dows lawsuit against the two men, JPMorgan Chase, which in the suit is referred to only as a major international financial institution, had been working for a client in the Middle East. JPMorgan had also reached out to several of the largest private equity firms in the nation to inquire about their interest in a buyout of Dow, people briefed on the matter said. Spokesmen for Dow, JPMorgan, Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard all declined to comment on the inquiry. A spokesman for the S.E.C. also declined to comment. The inquiries, and the dueling lawsuits between the company and the two men, are likely to turn on information provided by JPMorgan and its chief executive, James Dimon. Mr. Dimon had told Mr. Liveris that his firm was involved with Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard on a buyout of the company, according to Dows suit. The conversation between Mr. Dimon and Mr. Liveris was the basis for the firings of the men, Dow said. Still, other people and documents have suggested that Mr. Liveris had been seeking to oust Mr. Kreinberg before his dismissal and had several skirmishes with Mr. Reinhard. Both men had once been considered potential chief executives of Dow.

Shares of Dow had spiked on a number of occasions in the months before the dismissals on speculation about a deal, stoked by news reports that a buyout was in the works and possibly by leaks about talks the former executives were accused of holding. But the inquiry, still in the informal stage, may also look at a deal that the company actually pursued. Last fall, Dow made an overture to acquire DuPont in a deal worth more than $40 billion, according to people involved in the talks. If the approach had ultimately led to a deal, it would have combined the largest and third-largest chemical companies in the United States. ExxonMobil is No. 2. Shares of Dow and DuPont traded somewhat erratically at the time, though neither company disclosed the approach. From September to December, shares of DuPont climbed 15 percent. DuPont rebuffed Dows advances and never engaged in negotiations, these people said. Dows chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris, sits on the board of Citigroup with Alain J. P. Belda, the chief executive of Alcoa, who at the time of the overture was also a director of DuPont; Mr. Belda stepped down from DuPonts board in March. Dow declined to comment. A DuPont spokeswoman did not return a call last night seeking comment. In recent months, Mr. Liveris has denied that the company has held buyout talks. Dow said that all of the speculation about a deal was the result of two senior officials, Romeo Kreinberg and J. Pedro Reinhard, who, the company contended, held multiple meetings in multiple months in multiple locations, and with a number of different parties about such a takeover. JPMorgan Chase, one of Dows longtime banks, had been working on an unauthorized takeover proposal of Dow and had talked to the two men at least once.

A Dow Chemical spokesman yesterday acknowledged that the firings were based solely on a single source who had impeccable credentials. But JPMorgans involvement raises questions. As a longtime adviser to Dow Chemical, it had motive to try to prove its loyalty to the companys management. Yet the firm had also been working with an unidentified Middle Eastern client that was interested in making a bid for Dow Chemical, according to Dow Chemicals lawsuit. At the heart of the mystery is a rendezvous outside London worthy of a cold war spy novel. At the Compleat Angler, a luxury hotel overlooking the Thames, the two Dow Chemical officials met with two senior executives of JPMorgan Chase in early February, according to people who attended the meeting. In addition to Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard, the meeting was attended by William Winter, the co-head of investment banking of JPMorgan, and Ian Hannam, a managing director of JPMorgan Cazenove who was the point man on the discussions. The meeting was organized by Terrance J. Ruane, a consultant to Dow Chemical who had helped lead the companys deal making in Oman. JPMorgan declined to comment on the meeting. Reached on his mobile phone this week, Mr. Ruane said: I cant confirm or deny anything. I shouldnt be on the phone with you. According to people close to Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard, they met with Mr. Ruane to discuss gas prices in Oman, not knowing that the executives from JPMorgan would be joining them. Mr. Winter and Mr. Hannam showed up at the meeting and began badgering them with a series of questions about how receptive Dow Chemicals board would be to a takeover proposal, the people close to the two former Dow officials said.

After three months of hotly denying that it was involved in any takeover negotiations, the Dow Chemical Company discovered that, in fact, unauthorized talks had occurred. On Thursday, Dow fired J. Pedro Reinhard, a senior adviser to management, and Romeo Kreinberg, an executive vice president, saying they had held clandestine merger discussions with an unnamed third party. The company called their behavior ''highly inappropriate and a clear violation of Dow's Code of Business Conduct.'' But while the executives may be gone, the takeover rumors persist. Andrew Liveris, Dow's chief executive, has steadfastly denied that Dow has been approached. But three times this year -- most recently last weekend -- reports have surfaced in the British news media that Dow would be acquired. Few analysts expect that to happen. At $49.1 billion in revenue last year, it is too large for another chemical company to swallow. And with a market capitalization around $44 billion, it would be expensive for a buyout firm. Analysts also say that new owners would be foolish to try to recoup their money by splitting Dow up, because Dow's chemical businesses, which buy and sell to each other as well as to the outside world, are very much intertwined. Dow has been buying back shares, forming joint ventures and building up its overseas sales. And it is banking that, even if a buyout bid is made, its shareholders will vote it down. CLAUDIA H.

There was only one problem: Dow Chemical was never for sale and neither executive, one of whom was on the companys board, had told the company they were trying to put it into play. Yesterday, Dow Chemical, which had been the subject of a rash of buyout rumors, fired the two executives  J. Pedro Reinhard, a director and senior adviser to management, and Romeo Kreinberg, an executive vice president  saying they were engaged in business activity that was highly inappropriate involving unauthorized discussions with third parties about the potential acquisition of the company. The two men did not return calls for comment, but Mr. Kreinberg told The Associated Press that Dows accusations had no substance. The investigation of the director and the dismissals have faint echoes of the situation at Hewlett-Packard last year, when apparently unauthorized news leaks from the board led to a internal investigation of directors and to upheaval at the company. The firings also come at a time when deal making is rampant, and many executives and companies have succumbed to the allure of being bought out. It is uncertain whether the two executives had hoped simply to put Dow Chemical in play or had sought to be part of the management of an acquired company. The move by Dow Chemical came just two days after its chief executive, Andrew Liveris, publicly denied a report in a British newspaper that it was in talks about a sale. Frank J. Mitsch, an analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets who has covered Dow Chemical for years, said: Ive never seen anything like this in chemical land: Liveris making all these denials, while unbeknownst to him, two of his own heavy-hitters are holding talks. Shares of Dow Chemical jumped nearly 5 percent on Monday after the report on a possible buyout, only to fall 2 percent on Tuesdays denials, Yesterday, the shares rose 2 percent. How Mr. Reinhard, a Dow executive for more than three decades and once considered a contender for the chief executive job, and Mr. Kreinberg, who ran the companys most profitable business, plastics, engaged in covert negotiations over the fate of the company is likely to become a much talked about tale on Wall Street. People involved in the discussion said that both men engaged in talks with JPMorgan Chase about the prospect of a buyout and encouraged the bank to seek possible bidders. JPMorgan worked on the project for at least a month, running numbers on the business based on public filings and eventually reaching out to several private equity firms including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company and the Blackstone Group, these people said. The firms held meetings and briefly crunched some numbers, but their interest soon cooled. JPMorgan was never formally retained by Dow Chemical to pursue a sale, and it is unclear whether Mr. Reinhard and Mr. Kreinberg represented themselves to the bank as authorized to engage in such preliminary discussions. Yet the private talks soon became public on Feb 25, when The Sunday Express reported that three private equity firms  Kohlberg Kravis, Blackstone and the Carlyle Group  were ready to bid $54 billion for Dow. The report set off a firestorm at Dow Chemicals headquarters in Midland, Mich. Mr. Liveris called JPMorgans chief executive, James Dimon, to find out what was happening, people involved in the discussions said. When Mr. Dimon learned that Mr. Liveris was not interested in a buyout, it stopped work on the project. An executive from Blackstone called Mr. Liveris to tell him that the firm was not involved with a buyout proposal. On Sunday, however, The Sunday Express ran another report of a possible buyout, this one specifying that Dow Chemical was about to be bought for $50 billion, with much of the money coming from the Middle East, in particular Oman. The company had had enough. On Monday, Dow, which usually does not comment publicly on deal speculation, issued a statement denying that it was in play. And on Tuesday, the chief executive, Mr. Liveris, appeared on CNBC to reiterate the denial. Dow also decided that it was time it found out exactly why the talk persisted. This was becoming too disruptive, Christopher R. Huntley, a Dow spokesman, said. It was unsettling for our employees and for local communities, and the share price volatility was not good for shareholders. According to Mr. Huntley, high-level executives and directors started calling their contacts in the financial world, trying to trace the rumor to its source. One of them struck gold: Someone in a position to know pointed at Romeo and Pedro, Mr. Huntley said. Mr. Reinhard and Mr. Kreinberg did not return repeated phone calls. In a brief conversation with The Associated Press, Mr. Kreinberg said: The behavior of the company is very unusual, and the accusations have absolutely no substance and are highly damaging to my reputation after 30 years of employment. Representatives for JPMorgan, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Blackstone all declined to comment. Mr. Reinhard will remain on the board until a vote by shareholders, the company said yesterday. Mr. Reinhard is no stranger to deal making, As chief financial officer, he helped engineer a number of the companys deals, notably the $11.6 billion acquisition of Union Carbide in 1999. Yet the next year, he was passed over to be the successor to the chief executive, William Stavropoulos, in favor of Michael D. Parker. Both Mr. Reinhard, 55, and Mr. Kreinberg, 61, spent their entire careers at Dow Chemical and both are natives of Latin America: Mr. Reinhard is from Brazil and Mr. Kreinberg is from Argentina. Mr. Kreinberg is a director of Oman Petrochemical Industries, a joint venture Dow formed with the government of Oman and the Oman Oil Company. Mr. Huntley would not say whether the source said the two men had said they were talking with corporate authorization. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

Liveris, Dows chief executive, said, adding that water-related revenue went from less than $100 million in 2001 to hundreds of millions today. For now, the opportunities for would-be water industry players seem most ample outside the United States. The United Nations Population Fund projects that in 2025, if present rates of water consumption are maintained, 5 billion of the worlds 7.9 billion people will live in areas where safe water is scarce.

Siemens recently joined forces with Mekerot, Israels biggest water utility, to explore new technologies to reuse scarce water in Israel, and ultimately sell it to other parched nations. Eugene P. Corrigan Jr., an entrepreneur in Charleston, S.C., has mapped out the logistics for sending empty oil tankers back to the Middle East with their ballast tanks full of excess water. He has yet to get a Middle Eastern country to adopt his idea  I sense a real reluctance to be dependent on a source beyond their borders for a water supply, he said  but he continues to try. Rampant industrialization in the East is also attracting Western water players. Industrial complexes are igniting in China and Russia, and there is a huge need for companies to help them manage their water effectively, said William J. Roe, chief operating officer for the Nalco Company, a water treatment company in Naperville, Ill., that has stepped up sales efforts in emerging economies. The United States, too, has the potential to become a big customer for water technologies. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans use nearly 100 gallons of water per person per day. If that goes unchecked, 36 states will be enduring water shortages by 2013, the agency warned. You are going to see a growth in membrane technologies, in monitoring systems, in many parts of the water technology industry as we put in place stronger and more protective drinking water standards, said Benjamin H. Grumbles, assistant administrator for water at the E.P.A. For now the water industry remains fragmented, with no company commanding more than 5 percent of sales. But it is consolidating rapidly, as big companies like Siemens, G.E., Danaher and ITT continue their buying sprees. In 1999, there were 60 companies in the Palisades Water Index, a list of water company stocks put out by WaterTech Capital, an investment bank in Plano, Tex. Today, the list is pared to 38, and Stephen J. Hoffmann, president of WaterTech, expects it will soon be fewer. Paradoxically, as conglomerates snap up water companies, it has become harder for investors to capitalize on the water industrys growth. This industry has an awful lot of potential, but Pentair and Nalco are pretty much the only pure plays left, said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which owns shares of Pentair. 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Business »Everyone knows there is a lot of money to be made in oil.

Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, insists that Americans are facing the worst energy crisis in their history. They just don't know it yet. "American consumers worry about oil and the price of gasoline," he said. "They should worry that there may not be enough natural gas to heat and cool their homes." Chemical companies, which use gas as an ingredient as well as fuel, are not as oblivious. And Mr. Liveris, who is in line to be next year's chairman of the American Chemistry Council, has set himself up as his industry's public face on the issue. He has already appeared before both the House and the Senate, decrying American policies that encourage the use of gas even as they restrict the search for new gas sources. Mr. Liveris says that restoring balance to the gas supply is crucial for the American economy. Following are excerpts from a conversation in which he explained why. Q. Running Dow, the country's biggest chemical company, must be a full-time job. How can you justify spending so much time campaigning for better natural gas policies? A. Three years ago, Dow's annual bill for energy and hydrocarbon raw materials was $8 billion. Today that number approaches $22 billion. Put another way, in 2002, energy and feedstocks represented 29 percent of our costs. Today they are 50 percent. The high price of natural gas accounts for most of the rise. And it is a direct consequence of the failed energy policies of the 90's, which encouraged the overbuilding of power stations without increasing the availability of gas. Q. We had two severe energy crises in the 70's, yet the country and the chemical industry survived just fine. Why do you think this one is so much more dire? A. We operate in a truly global economy now. There is abundant natural gas in Venezuela, in Northern Australia, in the Middle East, which gives companies operating there a competitive edge. At the same time, American companies are moving their operations overseas to take advantage of lower energy prices. This country is losing jobs and intellectual capital to China, to India and to other emerging economies, and it will cause a tectonic shift in American competitiveness. Q. Half of Dow's assets are overseas, and half its revenues come from outside this country. So aren't you part of the problem? A. I have to do the right thing for our shareholders, so, yes, I go where the prices are lower. We had been planning to build a $4 billion chemical plant in Texas, and we built it in Oman instead. Other issues - health care costs, litigation, lack of tort reform - spur us to locate elsewhere, too, but 80 percent of the reason is the availability of natural gas. Q. If chemical companies like Dow can operate profitably overseas, why do you worry so much about gas prices at home? A. I'm an Australian citizen, a kid from the outback, but I've always loved the American business model. I've been with Dow 29 years, I've lived in the United States for 6, and I want manufacturing jobs and intellectual capital to stay in America. Q. Many companies talk about replacing petrochemicals with corn-based ingredients or about switching to wind or solar energy. Wouldn't that be a solution to soaring gas prices? A. Not yet. The world is not ready to pay the full cost of developing alternative fuels and ingredients. Ten years from now, wind and solar will still represent less than 1 percent of the world's energy input. Q. So what, exactly, do you want Congress to do? A. I want Congress to declare a national emergency, educate the American public about the crisis and unshackle industry. It should allow drilling in the outer continental shelf and elsewhere, and speed up the permitting process for building terminals that accept liquefied natural gas. There are only four terminals in the country. We need 20 or 30 times as many. Q. But wouldn't many of those policies wreak havoc with the environment? A. We long ago learned to explore for oil and gas in an environmentally responsible fashion. Even this year's hurricanes didn't cause the offshore drilling rigs to leak. The worries about environmental impact are based on emotion. We have to allay them with the facts. More Articles in Business &gt;Andrew N.

The transaction gives full control to Honeywell, a major supplier to the petrochemical refinery industry. UOP's technologies are used to process petrochemicals. Honeywell said it expected the transaction to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval. The final value of the deal may be adjusted for cash and outstanding debt in the venture at closing. The deal is the first major acquisition for Honeywell's specialty materials business, which has spent much of the last four years divesting mature, slow-growth operations in an effort to increase profitability. Honeywell, based in Morris Township, N.J., forecast sales of more than $4 billion in 2006 for its specialty materials business, which rang up revenue of $3.5 billion in 2004 before divesting its industrial wax and its American nylon carpet fibers business. UOP, whose technologies are mainly used in oil-derived products and chemicals, had revenue of about $1.2 billion in 2004. The company expects growth of up to 5 percent a year, with the Middle East and Asia providing the most potential.

Honeywell, based in Morris Township, N.J., forecast sales of more than $4 billion in 2006 for its specialty materials business, which rang up revenue of $3.5 billion in 2004 before divesting its industrial wax and its American nylon carpet fibers business. UOP, whose technologies are mainly used in oil-derived products and chemicals, had revenue of about $1.2 billion in 2004. The company expects growth of up to 5 percent a year, with the Middle East and Asia providing the most potential.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/28/business/28chemical.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">As Natural Gas Prices Rise, So Do the Costs of Things Made of Chemicals<date>Published: September 28, 2005</date><text>In one sense, chemical industry executives should be sighing with relief. Hurricane Katrina damaged some of their plants, but repairs are proceeding quickly. Hurricane Rita left barely a physical mark. For the next few months, orders will drop but, the executives say, demand will probably ratchet up quickly as rebuilding along the Gulf Coast begins. "Net-net, it will be a wash, because our industry's products will be used to rebuild the devastated areas," said Andrew N. Liveris, chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company. But while the industry may have dodged these immediate bullets, a thornier problem still interferes with executive sleep: natural gas prices that have been soaring since 2001. High prices are a double whammy for the chemical industry. Natural gas is both its main fuel and its main raw material, the starting point for the basic chemicals from which the fibers and compounds in shirts, eyeglasses and even the wrappers for single-serve soups are derived. "Chemical companies have been under assault for several years," said Robert Koort, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who has an attractive rating on the chemical sector. Diane H. Gulyas, chief marketing officer of DuPont, said that, if anything, the hurricanes "acted as a wake-up call." "It made us all realize how shocking the underlying fundamentals of our business have become," she said. The industry has passed along costs, and it is likely to continue doing so for now. Since Katrina, almost every chemical company has announced price increases. The trickledown effect to retail shelves is inevitable - soda and water come in plastic bottles, computers use plastic housings, even organic greenmarkets pack fruits and vegetables in plastic bags. "Consumers can expect to pay more for everything, from medicines to auto parts to computers to shampoo," said Kevin Swift, chief economist for the American Chemistry Council, a trade association. But industry specialists worry that if high gas prices curb consumer spending, the days of passing along constant price increases may end. "The uncompetitive natural gas price in the U.S. is a long-term problem," said Gordon E. Slack, business director for Dow energy business, who said that high gas prices had turned the chemical industry from a net exporter to a net importer. Those rising prices have effectively wiped out the American chemical industry's main competitive edge. Whereas most overseas chemical plants derive most of their raw materials from oil, gas has long been the feedstock of choice here. According to Mr. Swift, natural gas accounts for about 60 percent of the value of chemicals made here. Indeed, many chemical companies clustered their plants along the Gulf Coast, where so much gas is produced, to take advantage of what Mr. Slack called "the best natural gas prices in the world." As recently as 2000, natural gas was selling for $2 per million British thermal units. But since then, environmental regulations have impelled many companies to switch from burning oil or coal to gas, even as other rules restricted drilling for new sources of gas. Unlike oil, which is considered a global commodity, gas is generally moved through regional markets. Liquid natural gas can be shipped long distances, but the liquefaction process is expensive, and only about 3 percent of natural gas comes into the United States that way. Around 2001, demand began to exceed supply, and gas prices have soared since. On Aug. 26, the Friday before Katrina hit, gas prices had already topped $8 per million B.T.U.'s. Then Katrina knocked out natural gas rigs and otherwise stanched the flow of gas. Since then, gas prices have hovered around $12, the highest in the world. Few experts think they will drop again soon. "This unfortunate new reality of elevated oil and gas prices is going to be with us for at least the next 12 to 18 months," Ms. Gulyas predicted. The effect on chemical company costs has been huge. Most have already shuttered energy-guzzling plants and installed productivity-enhancing programs in the remaining ones. Yet the savings have not kept pace with the costs. Gas and oil accounted for 43 percent of Dow's costs this year; in 2002, they represented 29 percent. Jeff Worden, a spokesman for PPG Industries, which makes chemicals, glass and paints, described it another way. "We use between 60 trillion and 70 trillion B.T.U.'s of natural gas a year, so if the price goes up one dollar, our costs are up $60 or $70 million," he said. If the winter is severe, those costs could go even higher. In fact, the industry might even face shortages. "No utility will shut the gas off in someone's home to give it to a chemical company," Mr. Swift said. Few executives anticipate the situation to become that dire. "The industry's growth may be down a few percent this year, but it will increase by the same amount in 2006," said Klaus Peter Löbbe, chairman of BASF. William H. Joyce, chairman of Nalco Holdings, is similarly sanguine. Nalco, which makes water treatment and process chemicals, estimates that the effect of the storms will add $15 million to its costs, even as customers whose operations were hurt buy as much as $10 million less from them. Yet in a statement Mr. Joyce referred to the problems as a "short-term disruption" that will be resolved in 2006. Most analysts have lowered their estimates of chemical company profits this year, according to Thomson Financial, yet they still recommend that investors buy the shares. "Margins may be low now, but they'll be picking up by next quarter," said Frank J. Mitsch, a chemical industry specialist at Fulcrum Global Partners, an independent research firm.

Dede Wilsey, who sits on the boards of the San Francisco Ballet and the San Francisco Opera and is the president of the board of trustees of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, is portrayed as having manipulated the author's father, Al Wilsey, who made his fortune in food and real estate, into giving her the bulk of his $300 million estate. Among other vivid scenes, the book describes a Christmas morning when Al Wilsey, seriously ill, sat wanly by as his wife - who is known in San Francisco for her magnificent jewels - pinned one $200,000 brooch after another to her bathrobe. The day after Mother's Day, Ms. Wilsey woke up to the following excerpt from the book in The San Francisco Chronicle: "If you want a sense of her values, rent the movies 'Gaslight' and 'Sweet Smell of Success.' The scheming lead in 'Gaslight' who sweet-talks a wealthy heiress into marrying him and then drives her mad with drink and doubletalk, is her." The excerpts continued all last week. Sean Wilsey's mother, Pat Montandon, a former San Francisco society columnist and star hostess who was lampooned in Armistead Maupin's "Tales of The City," also takes a number of hits. "Meeting mom is like meeting a celebrity you've never heard of," Mr. Wilsey writes. The fallout has been huge. "The big talk around town is, What will Dede do about it?" said P. J. Corkery, a columnist for The San Francisco Examiner. "I do know one of her sons called at least one P.R. firm in L.A., hiring them to do spin control." Whether or not that was the case, Ms. Wilsey did seem to have a pronounced lilt in her voice that had been missing in earlier conversations when she spoke about the excerpts on Wednesday. "I am just so entertained by this thing, I cannot tell you," she said in a phone conversation from her home in Pacific Heights. "Yesterday Sean had his own birthday wrong. Sorry to laugh, but it's quite comical. I'm saving these Chronicles for my new puppy's bathroom, so they're becoming very valuable to me. Little Twinkle is going to tinkle on this." The amusement, however, did not appear to be boundless. On Thursday Karen Mayer, a lawyer at Penguin Press, said that Penguin had received a "claim letter" from Ms. Wilsey's lawyer. She declined to discuss it further, but Ms. Wilsey, in earlier conversations, was clearly considering action. "I could not imagine," she said, "that Penguin Press, which is supposed to be reputable, would allow libelous, false and defamatory statements to be published without any attempt to contact me." In San Francisco, meanwhile, a party to celebrate the book has been bounced from the prestigious San Francisco Art Institute in North Beach.

Victoria Cooper, a spokeswoman for the institute, wrote in an e-mail statement that when the party was first booked, the institute "had no knowledge of the nature of the book."

Wind energy makes up a small fraction of electric generation in this country, but the rising price of natural gas has made wind look like a bargain; in some cases, it is cheaper to build a wind turbine and let existing natural gas generators stand idle. Giant, modern wind farms like the New Mexico Wind Energy Center here may become more common if prices continue to rise. Advertisement The center, 150 miles east of Albuquerque, opened in the summer of 2003 and is one of the largest in the country. The power is bought by the state's largest utility, Public Service of New Mexico, and provides about 4 percent of that company's electricity over the course of a year. In March, when demand is low and winds are usually strong, the project generates 10 percent of the electricity the company supplies. The state has established a goal of using 10 percent renewable energy by 2011. The governor, Bill Richardson, a former secretary of energy, has said that New Mexico could become "the Saudi Arabia of renewables." Across the country, the increase in gas prices has made a fundamental difference in the purchasing decisions of utility companies, said Michael A. O'Sullivan, senior vice president of FPL Energy, which owns and operates the New Mexico center. "Gas prices helped get - pardon the pun - the wind at our backs," he said in a telephone interview from the company headquarters in Juno Beach, Fla. At $6 per million B.T.U.'s, the standard unit in which gas prices are quoted, the fuel needed to produce a kilowatt-hour costs more than 5 cents at an inefficient gas plant, and more than 4 cents at the most efficient plants. Last fall, Congress restored the Production Tax Credit, worth 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour after taxes, for wind energy projects completed by the end of 2005. Counting that credit, Mr. O'Sullivan said, his company sells wind energy for 3 to 5 cents a kilowatt-hour. The tax credit and steeper natural gas prices are driving the increased interest in wind energy. But there are problems, even supporters say. "One of the things the wind folks do not talk about is when the wind blows," said George E. Kehler, manger of alternative and renewable energy at Dow Chemical. West Texas, for example, is notoriously windy, but mostly at night and in the winter, when the electric market is glutted with cheap power from coal and nuclear plants. Peak electric load, and peak use of gas in electricity generators, occurs in summer, during the day. One solution, Mr. Kehler said, may be to put windmills on the Texas coast, which may not be quite as windy, but where the windiest periods happen during daylight hours. Dow is a strong supporter of wind-generated energy as one strategy to drive down the price of natural gas, which the company uses as a fuel and as an ingredient for chemical manufacturing. Another problem, if wind energy becomes more popular, is output reliability. The New Mexico Wind Energy Center output of up to 206 megawatts is 8 percent of what all the company's generators would produce if they were all running at full capacity. "That is enormous," said Don Brown, a spokesman for Public Service, who said it was a record among American utilities. But most of the year the wind is not blowing nearly hard enough to make 206 megawatts. Mr. Brown said his company was not certain how much more heavily it could depend on wind energy without the threat of blackouts. The variability was obvious here on Thursday morning, with wind that looked to be suitable for kite flying, but which the center's employees said was weak. A control room display showed the wind blowing at 5.5 meters a second (about 12 miles an hour) and the "swooshing" from the 110-foot-long blades was slow, turning at about 16 revolutions a minute instead of the optimum 20. The plant was producing only about 25 megawatts, or one-eighth of its capacity.

At 79, he stoops a little, but he is still well over six feet tall, with a mane of white hair, a matching beard and a wardrobe that runs toward sandals, slacks and short-sleeved shirts with vaguely ethnic patterns. He lives modestly, drawing income from a small stock portfolio supplemented by his Social Security and the rent that two phone companies pay him to put cell towers on his land. In many respects he might pass for a typical Contra Costa County retiree. It was an acquaintance of Shulgin's named Humphry Osmond, a British psychiatrist and researcher into the effects of mescaline and LSD, who coined the word ''psychedelic'' in the late 1950's for a class of drugs that significantly alter one's perception of reality. Derived from Greek, the term translates as ''mind manifesting'' and is preferred by those who believe in the curative power of such chemicals. Skeptics tend to call them hallucinogens. Shulgin is in the former camp. There's a story he likes to tell about the past 100 years: ''At the beginning of the 20th century, there were only two psychedelic compounds known to Western science: cannabis and mescaline. A little over 50 years later -- with LSD, psilocybin, psilocin, TMA, several compounds based on DMT and various other isomers -- the number was up to almost 20. By 2000, there were well over 200. So you see, the growth is exponential.'' When I asked him whether that meant that by 2050 we'll be up to 2,000, he smiled and said, ''The way it's building up now, we may have well over that number.'' The point is clear enough: the continuing explosion in options for chemical mind-manifestation is as natural as the passage of time. But what Shulgin's narrative leaves out is the fact that most of this supposedly inexorable diversification took place in a lab in his backyard. For 40 years, working in plain sight of the law and publishing his results, Shulgin has been a one-man psychopharmacological research sector. (Timothy Leary called him one of the century's most important scientists.) By Shulgin's own count, he has created nearly 200 psychedelic compounds, among them stimulants, depressants, aphrodisiacs, ''empathogens,'' convulsants, drugs that alter hearing, drugs that slow one's sense of time, drugs that speed it up, drugs that trigger violent outbursts, drugs that deaden emotion -- in short, a veritable lexicon of tactile and emotional experience. And in 1976, Shulgin fished an obscure chemical called MDMA out of the depths of the chemical literature and introduced it to the wider world, where it came to be known as Ecstasy. In the small subculture that truly believes in better living through chemistry, Shulgin's oeuvre has made him an icon and a hero: part pioneer, part holy man, part connoisseur. As his supporters point out, his work places him in an old, and in many cultures venerable, tradition. Whether it's West African iboga ceremonies or Navajo peyote rituals, 60's LSD culture or the age-old cultivation of cannabis nearly everywhere on the planet it can grow, the pursuit and celebration of chemically-induced alternate realms of consciousness goes back beyond the dawn of recorded history and has proved impossible to fully suppress. Shulgin sees nothing strange about devoting his life to it. What's strange to him is that so few others see fit to do the same thing. Most of the scientific community considers Shulgin at best a curiosity and at worst a menace. Now, however, near the end of his career, his faith in the potential of psychedelics has at least a chance at vindication. A little more than a month ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved a Harvard Medical School study looking at whether MDMA can alleviate the fear and anxiety of terminal cancer patients. And next month will mark a year since Michael Mithoefer, a psychiatrist in Charleston, S.C., started his study of Ecstasy-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. At the same time, with somewhat less attention, studies at the Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center and the University of Arizona, Tucson, have focused on the therapeutic potential of psilocybin (the active ingredient in ''magic mushrooms''). It's far from a revolution, but it is an opening, and as both scientist and advocate, Shulgin has helped create it. If -- and it's a big ''if'' -- the results of the studies are promising enough, it might bring something like legitimacy to the Shulgin pharmacopoeia.

The hoax, contradicting Dow Chemical's rejection of any responsibility, came on the 20th anniversary of the catastrophe, when waves of lethal gas escaped from a chemical plant in Bhopal, in central India, killing more than 3,500 people and injuring thousands more. At the time, the plant was owned by the Union Carbide Corporation, which was taken over by Dow Chemical Company three years ago. Survivors have long complained that they have received inadequate compensation. The interview with the fake spokesman was broadcast less than a year after an official inquiry criticized the BBC for inaccurate reporting and "defective" editorial supervision in asserting that Prime Minister Tony Blair and his aides had exaggerated the case for war in Iraq. Two of the broadcaster's top managers quit as a result of that inquiry. The BBC is also midway through a government review of its operations, carried out once every 10 years in preparation for the renewal of the Royal Charter under which it operates. The interview was broadcast on BBC World, a 24-hour television news channel broadcast globally. Twice on Friday, the channel broadcast the interview with a man identifying himself as Jude Finisterra, who said Dow Chemical had agreed to set up a $12 billion compensation fund, apparently reversing its previous insistence that such liabilities had been settled by Union Carbide before Dow took over the company. Later in the day, the BBC said in a statement that the interview was "part of an elaborate deception." "The person did not represent the company," it said, "and we want to make it clear that the information he gave was entirely inaccurate." "We apologize to Dow and to anyone who watched the interview who may have been misled by it," the statement said. "Of course, the BBC is investigating how the deception happened." Dow Chemical also said that Mr. Finisterra was not a company employee. Friday evening, BBC World reported that reporters preparing for the anniversary of the Bhopal disaster had gotten contact information for Mr. Finisterra on what appeared to be Dow Chemical's Web site. The person who identified himself as Mr. Finisterra had told the reporters there would be a significant announcement and offered to travel from Paris to London for an interview. Instead, the BBC set up a two-way interview, with the interviewer in London and the interviewee in a BBC studio in Paris. "He was incredibly plausible," a BBC executive said on condition of anonymity. In a separate BBC interview on a lunchtime radio news show after the hoax was uncovered, the same man said he represented an organization called "The Yes Men," whose Web site (www.theyesmen.org) says it engages in "identity correction." "Honest people impersonate big-time criminals in order to publicly humiliate them," the Web site says. "Targets are leaders and big corporations who put profits ahead of everything else." The man identified as Mr. Finisterra told BBC Radio that he was speaking "in a certain way" for Dow Chemical by setting out "the only reasonable thing for Dow Chemical to do."</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/business/worldbusiness/30bhopal.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Bhopal Victims Not Fully Paid, Rights Group Says<date>Published: November 30, 2004</date><text>ANGALORE, India, Nov. 29 - Almost 20 years after the world's worst industrial disaster, a gas leak from a Union Carbide pesticide factory in Bhopal that immediately killed 7,000 people and sickened several thousand others, the victims are poorly compensated and the companies have gone unpunished, a new study by Amnesty International said on Monday. In a report, "Clouds of Injustice," the human rights group said that a generation later, survivors still await proper compensation and adequate medical care. "Astonishingly, no one has been held to account for the toxic leak and its appalling consequences - over 20,000 people have died and 100,000 people are living with chronic illnesses," Amnesty said in its report. The Union Carbide Corporation, and the Dow Chemical Company, which acquired it, as well as the Indian government are evading human rights responsibilities, Amnesty charged. "Dow and Union Carbide both deny legal responsibility, with U.C.C. refusing to appear before Indian courts to face trial." An estimated 7,000 people perished after a leak of methyl isocyanate gas from the Union Carbide plant on the night of Dec. 2, 1984; thousands more died later from complications arising from inhaling the lethal gas, the group said. Amnesty as well as several survivors' groups urged Dow Chemical on Monday to clean up the contaminated water and soil, reimburse families for medical costs and face criminal trial in India. Two decades after narrowly escaping death, Batulan Bi, 62, said she had waged an endless struggle to be certified a bona fide victim. As the gas enveloped the neighborhood, her husband fell unconscious near her home as she fled with her children. Her husband died three years later, after a protracted illness from inhaling the gas. Lawyers and middlemen took about half the 100,000 rupees ($2,200) she was paid as compensation for her husband's death. Ms. Bi said her visits to doctors had become frequent as she suffers from breathlessness, panic attacks and joint pains. Her medical expenses are not paid nor does she receive compensation for not being able to work in construction as she previously did. "I do not want to be a living corpse; I want to live with dignity," she said in a phone interview. Union Carbide said in a statement on its Web site, "The 1984 gas leak in Bhopal, India, was a terrible tragedy which understandably continues to evoke strong emotions even 20 years later." The company said that its legal responsibility was met in the settlement reached with the Indian government in 1989 and that the state government of Madya Pradesh took responsibility for cleaning up the site. The statement added that a team of consultants it had hired had conducted an investigation and concluded that the explosion could have been caused only by sabotage, an assertion that environmental groups have rejected. According to Amnesty, neither Union Carbide nor Dow Chemical has cleaned up the site or stopped the subsequent pollution from the plant, which was abandoned in December 1984. Local residents continue to fall ill from drinking contaminated water, with respiratory disorders, gynecological problems, nerve damage and cancer, medical groups say. "Bhopal is a continuing disaster," said Satinath Sarangi, managing trustee of Sambhavna Trust, which provides health services for survivors. "In many ways, people are in a worse state than the morning after the disaster," he said. Most of the $470 million from the out-of-court settlement negotiated in 1989 by the Indian government with Union Carbide has yet to be disbursed to the victims. The government paid out $230 million from 1989 to 1998, intending to use the rest for cleanup and aid to residents. That plan was challenged by the survivors, who ultimately prevailed in court this year. The government began distributing the remaining $327 million - an amount enlarged by interest over the years - this month. More than 90 percent of the 570,000 victims will receive 25,000 rupees ($557) on top of the 25,000 rupees already paid in compensation. "The sum is so paltry when compared with compensation paid in cases such as Exxon Valdez oil spill or even the silicone breast implants or tobacco cancer victims," said Rachna Dhingra, coordinator of the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal. Even the legal fight is far from over, said Amnesty and other campaigners. On Dec. 6, a court in Bhopal will hear a criminal case filed by a support group for survivors against Dow to decide whether it can be held responsible for the disaster and whether its Indian assets can be seized. The Indian government is still pursuing Warren Anderson, the former chairman of Union Carbide. In its report detailing the failings of Union Carbide, Amnesty said the company had not only stored the hazardous chemicals in bulk, but also failed to set up an emergency warning system. Later, it withheld information critical to treat the victims of the gas leak, the report said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE6DF153CF936A35752C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=dowchemicalcompany">COMPANY NEWS; ASHLAND ACQUIRES DERAKANE FROM DOW CHEMICAL<date>Published: November 5, 2004</date><text>Ashland, a chemicals and refining company, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Derakane technology from the Dow Chemical Company for $92 million to expand its plastics business.

The Dow suit was the first by a customer against an asbestos supplier, and its failure will make similar complaints less likely, lawyers and analysts following the case said. The Angleton, Tex., jury decided by an 11-to-1 vote that Dow had not committed a fraud, Dow said.

The move clears a major hurdle for companies like ConocoPhillips and Dow Chemical that are seeking steady gas supplies.The commission ruled late Friday that a consortium formed by three companies, Freeport LNG Investments, Cheniere LNG and Contango Oil and Gas, can move forward with a plan to invest more than $500 million to build a complex in Quintana Island, Tex., capable of unloading 200 ships a year of liquefied natural gas.The project, known as Freeport LNG, is among the first of its kind to win federal regulatory approval in the United States in more than two decades. It is a major development in the debate between environmental advocates and energy companies over the safety of large liquefied natural gas terminals.Natural gas prices have remained high in the last year, sparking discussion of the need to import supplies from nations with ample domestic supplies, like Qatar, Nigeria, Angola, and Trinidad and Tobago.The Freeport venture, 70 miles south of Houston, is scheduled to receive its first shipments of natural gas from abroad by 2007.It is one of several projects proposed for Texas and Louisiana, where resistance from environmental advocates and community groups is not as strong as in places like California, New England and Florida. Opposition to gas terminals on both coasts has already led energy companies to cancel nearly half a dozen similar projects for large gas terminals.Michael S. Smith, the owner of Freeport LNG Investments, said in an interview that he expected construction of the terminal to begin by the end of the summer.''This is big news within the energy industry,'' Mr. Smith said, ''to have one of these projects that should get built right away. '' He added that the commission will have detailed oversight over the project, including several relatively minor licensing requirements that Freeport needs to meet in the weeks ahead.ConocoPhillips, the oil company, recently agreed to finance much of the construction of the Freeport terminal, partly in exchange for a large portion of the gas expected to be received there. Dow Chemical, with operations in Freeport, Tex., near Quintana Island, has also reserved a portion of the terminal's natural gas.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/business/office-space-the-boss-leaving-the-comfort-zone.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">OFFICE SPACE: THE BOSS; Leaving the Comfort Zone<date>Published: June 06, 2004</date><text>I WAS the son of immigrants. I grew up in a tiny town. I played baseball with Carl Yastrzemski long before he was a Hall of Famer. People always say they are the products of their upbringing, but I really am.My dad came here from Greece, by himself, when he was 16. He settled in the Hamptons, back before they were a fashionable weekend place, and soon owned his own coffee and confectionery store. He bought a little house, then went back to Greece to find a wife. As my mom tells it, the day their boat arrived from Greece, he dropped her off at the house and went straight to work.I remember, when I was 18 or so, coming home so late that my father was already leaving to open the store. I was supposed to work with him that day. He said simply, ''You'll be at the store in 10 minutes.'' It was his way of saying, ''You can play all you want, but not at the expense of work.'' I went up, changed my clothes and went to the store.There were only 15 kids in our high school graduating class. When there are so few of you, you have to participate in everything. For example, I felt uneasy on stage, but I had to be in school plays. It was a lot easier and more fun than I expected. It taught me that if you're willing to leave your comfort zone, you may see talents surface that you never knew you had.I've passed that lesson on many times. When my daughter was young, she was asked to model a dress at a local fund-raiser. She didn't want to do it, but I persuaded her. Afterward, she said, ''It wasn't so bad; I wish I could do it again.''That attitude served me well at Dow. I've managed research and worked in the labs. I ran a small diagnostic products business, and I ran a small plastics business. Dow didn't try to pigeonhole me, and I try not to pigeonhole others. I tell them, when you are given opportunities, you have to take them.In high school, I played all the sports -- basketball, football, baseball, everything. We all had to, because otherwise the school wouldn't have had a team.The Yastrzemskis lived two doors down, and we'd all play baseball on the local sandlot team. I played first base, Carl's dad played second base and Carl Jr. played shortstop. Yastrzemski to Yastrzemski to Stavropoulos -- as Carl later wrote, not the world's best double-play combination, but the hardest to pronounce. When he and his dad went away to talk to teams, I stayed at their house to take calls from agents.</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/14/business/company-news-dow-chemical-drops-95-lawsuit-against-monsanto.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">COMPANY NEWS; DOW CHEMICAL DROPS '95 LAWSUIT AGAINST MONSANTO<date>Published: May 14, 2004</date><text>The Dow Chemical Company's AgroSciences unit dropped a 1995 lawsuit that accused a rival, the Monsanto Company, of infringing a patent for genetic technology to protect plants against insect damage.

Congress addressed this category of cases, among others, in 1991 when it amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the basic federal employment discrimination law, to counter a series of pro-employer Supreme Court decisions.A 1989 Supreme Court ruling had made it difficult for plaintiffs to qualify for the favorable jury instructions that come with a mixed-motive case, under which the employer has the burden of proving that it would have made the same decision even in the absence of the improper factor. The court said then that the plaintiff must prove by direct, not circumstantial, evidence that discrimination had been ''a motivating factor'' in the employer's action.Direct evidence requires the equivalent of a smoking gun. While it is sometimes available to aggrieved employees, it often is not, particularly in the nuanced and complex situations reflected in many mixed-motive cases.In its 1991 legislation, Congress provided that an ''unlawful employment practice is established'' when the plaintiff ''demonstrates'' that race or any of the other prohibited categories ''was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.''Although Congress made no mention of a need for direct evidence, the lower federal courts continued to require it, with the exception of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court said today that the Ninth Circuit was correct.''On its face,'' Justice Thomas said, ''the statute does not mention, much less require, that a plaintiff make a heightened showing through direct evidence.''''Our precedents make clear,'' he added, ''that the starting point for our analysis is the statutory text.

Since then, according to the attorney general, the company has continued to say it is safe.''Consumers must not be lulled into a false sense of security by misleading safety claims,'' he said. ''They should be urged to use pesticides only with the utmost caution.''The company was sent a letter today, giving it five days' notice of the intent to sue. The lawsuit, which is expected to be filed next week in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, seeks a court order directing the company to halt the advertising, said a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, Marc Violette.The lawsuit also calls for monetary penalties.Dursban, once a common household pesticide, is still used in agricultural products. It contains chlorpyrifos, a synthetic compound linked to severe health problems in humans, including nerve damage, asthma and birth defects, Mr. Violette said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/business/dow-chemical-posts-loss-and-plans-job-cuts.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Dow Chemical Posts Loss and Plans Job Cuts<date>Published: January 31, 2003</date><text>The Dow Chemical Company expects to cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs this year and sell or trade $1.5 billion in assets as the company tries to overcome a dismal fourth-quarter performance.The company, which is based in Midland, reported a much wider loss today than expected for the fourth quarter of 2002, blaming a 35 percent increase in raw material and energy costs. The results fell short of Wall Street expectations.The job cuts, which could involve up to 8 percent of Dow's work force, will come through layoffs, attrition, plant closings and divestitures, company officials said. The company offered no specifics on where the cuts would come. Dow had 50,000 employees at the end of 2002, officials said.For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Dow Chemical lost $809 million, or 89 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of $37 million, or 4 cents a diluted share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $6.91 billion from $6.35 billion.The results included a pretax charge of $828 million connected with Union Carbide's potential asbestos liability and a pretax charge of $225 million for merger expenses and revamping, the company said. Dow bought Union Carbide in February 2001.Excluding unusual items, the company would have lost $172 million, or 18 cents a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had expected a break-even quarter.For all of 2002, Dow Chemical lost $338 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of $385 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, for 2001.

Years ago, he tried to start a family, he said, but the woman left him once she realized he was sterile.Like scores of men and women in this banana-growing region -- and thousands of field workers throughout Central America, the Caribbean, Africa and the Philippines -- Mr. Guido blames dibromochloropropane, or DBCP, for his medical problems. The pesticide was banned in much of the United States in 1977 when it was found to cause sterility, but continued to be used for years in the banana plantations that supply American supermarkets.For two decades, the workers say, their efforts to win compensation for the damage done by DBCP -- including sterility, cancer, and birth defects in children -- have been frustrated by the legal tactics of American chemical and fruit companies. But now they are getting their day in court.A ruling by a federal judge in New Orleans has opened the way for a lawsuit brought by 3,000 Central American banana workers seeking millions in damages, the first time one of these cases would be tried in the United States. The United States Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether or not to allow other DBCP lawsuits to be tried in state courts.And over the objections of the Bush administration, which has pressed the Nicaraguan government on behalf of the corporate defendants, courts here have begun awarding hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to banana workers.The companies facing lawsuits are giants of the chemical and fruit industries: Shell Oil, Dow Chemical and Occidental Chemical; Dole Food, Del Monte Fresh Produce and Chiquita Brands International.Earlier cases resulted in two major settlements. Starting in 1997, all of the companies except Dole settled with 26,000 former banana workers in Central America, Africa and the Philippines for $41 million. After lawyer fees were deducted, the workers received an average of $1,500 each. A 1992 settlement in Costa Rica netted $20 million for 1,000 workers.But tens of thousands of other workers still have suits pending in courts in Central America, the Philippines and the United States. ''Our fight is over whether we get to tell our story,'' said Scott Hendler, who represents more than 3,000 plaintiffs seeking trials in Louisiana and Hawaii.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/14/business/company-news-dow-chemical-replaces-its-chief-with-an-old-chief.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">COMPANY NEWS; DOW CHEMICAL REPLACES ITS CHIEF WITH AN OLD CHIEF<date>Published: December 14, 2002</date><text>The Dow Chemical Company removed Michael Parker as chief executive yesterday after a disappointing two years in which the company struggled with weak demand, high costs and worries over asbestos liability.

It was a fake, as was the Web site called up by a hyperlink in the e-mail.The release supposedly explained why Dow refuses to clean up Bhopal or help people who remain sick from the spill. The link was to dow-chemical.com, a Web site that looked much like Dow's real Dow.com site, but that included such fake items as a ''draft'' of a speech by Dow's chief executive, Michael D. Parker, disavowing Dow's responsibility for Bhopal.The hoax was the work of the Yes Men, a group of critics of business and government who gained attention in 2000 with Gatt.org, a bogus World Trade Organization site.This time the Yes Men were too clever by at least half: they registered the site with Gandi.com in the name of James Parker, Michael Parker's real son. So the younger Mr. Parker took ownership, and Dow took the site down last Wednesday night.''We thought it would be funny, but it turned out to be stupid,'' said Andrew Bichlbaum, a Yes Men volunteer in Paris who set up the site. ''We gave them the chance to claim the site as their property.''The Yes Men resurrected the site on Friday, as dow-chemical.va.com.au, whose host is Virtual Artists, an Australian company. Any visitor can download a copy of the site, Mr. Bichlbaum said, ''so that if Dow gets this one too, it will continue to exist.''Although no other environmental group has acknowledged participation in the hoax, at least one voiced approval. ''We support the people who published this site,'' said Casey Harrell, the Bhopal specialist at Greenpeace, one of Dow's most vocal critics.Dow, meanwhile, maintains that the Web site violated numerous cyberspace copyright laws.''It is ironic,'' said John Musser, a Dow spokesman, ''that groups that position themselves as public defenders against companies that act irresponsibly, unethically or unlawfully are turning out to be the poster children for those very behaviors.''

A trio of decisions by the United States Supreme Court in the 1980's established that principle and held that state regulators were constitutionally barred from designating a particular percentage of receipts that had to reach a charity in order for the fund-raising to be considered legitimate.In the appeal today, which was backed by a brief from 18 other states, Illinois is arguing that the state court misinterpreted those precedents in a manner that ''transformed the First Amendment into a license for unscrupulous fund-raisers to defraud the public in the name of raising money for charity.'' The state said the question for the justices was ''whether a professional fund-raiser has a First Amendment right to mislead people into giving money by representing that it will be used for charitable purposes, when actually the fund-raiser keeps the vast majority of all money donated.''While high fund-raising costs alone could not establish fraud, the state said, neither should the costs be deemed irrelevant. In its brief, Ryan v. Telemarketing Associates Inc., No. 01-1806, the state noted that the earlier cases challenged various fund-raising regulations ''on their face,'' without regard to specific applications, while the Illinois case presented facts and figures of a particular dispute.The telemarketing firm's contract called for it to retain 85 percent of the money it raised on behalf of VietNow, an Illinois-based charity with the mission of providing food, shelter and financial support for needy Vietnam War veterans. The telemarketer revealed this arrangement in the disclosure form it filed with the state, but did not pass the information on to potential donors.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/25/business/divergent-rulings-in-2-asbestos-liability-cases.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">Divergent Rulings in 2 Asbestos Liability Cases<date>Published: October 25, 2002</date><text>Two asbestos liability cases took divergent turns in court proceedings yesterday.In West Virginia, a jury found that the Dow Chemical Company's Union Carbide unit had exposed workers to asbestos poisoning from 1945 to 1980, opening the door to millions of dollars in potential damages.But in Wilmington, Del., a bankruptcy court judge agreed to exclude the testimony of an expert witness in a case against Armstrong World Industries.The verdict by the six-member jury in Charleston, W. Va., will allow about 1,000 plaintiffs to pursue cases that will determine whether they suffered injuries or health problems because of asbestos exposure at Union Carbide operations.If the plaintiffs are found to have suffered injuries, the courts will then decide on damages against Union Carbide. But the jury found Union Carbide was not part of any conspiracy to deceive or harm the public. A Union Carbide spokesman said the company would probably appeal the decision.In another asbestos case, Randall J. Newsome, a bankruptcy judge in Wilmington, granted a motion by Armstrong to exclude evidence offered by expert witnesses called by the plaintiffs.Armstrong World Industries is the main operating subsidiary of the floor covering maker Armstrong Holdings Inc., which has been in bankruptcy proceedings in Wilmington since December 2000 to resolve its liability for asbestos personal injury claims.''The court has accepted Armstrong's argument that a significant group of asbestos claims are based on speculation and not sound science,'' Ken Jacobs, Armstrong's deputy general counsel for litigation, said in a statement.Attempts to reach the plaintiff, the Asbestos Property Damage Committee, were unsuccessful.Armstrong said it faced about 600 claims seeking more than $852 million in damages related to floor tiles containing asbestos.About 50 companies facing asbestos claims have filed for Chapter 11 since the early 1980's.Asbestos was widely used as a fire retardant and insulation, but scientists found in the 1960's and 1970's that the inhalation of its fibers could cause lung cancer and other diseases.</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/business/company-news-judge-dismisses-2600-claims-against-exxon.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">COMPANY NEWS; JUDGE DISMISSES 2,600 CLAIMS AGAINST EXXON<date>Published: October 11, 2002</date><text>Exxon Mobil said yesterday that it had won a judge's dismissal of about 2,600 asbestos complaints, ending its role in a West Virginia trial that once involved 8,000 plaintiffs and hundreds of company defendants.

In dismissing the 2,600 claims on Tuesday, a state court judge ruled that the workers did not have enough evidence to prove that asbestos in an Exxon caulk caused their lung illnesses, the lawyer said.

But pressure on the remaining defendants has increased as companies, including Honeywell International, have dropped out.The companies would not provide information on how much money had been paid to settle the claims. Lawyers for each side said they could not determine the total amount the companies had agreed to pay.Even so, lawyers representing individual plaintiffs said some settlements with people claiming injuries from exposure to asbestos, a carcinogenic fireproofing material, reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Corporations have already appealed to the United States Supreme Court to intervene in the West Virginia trial because of the large number of plaintiffs and defendants. Lawyers for the companies say that the defendants should not be tried together because their connections to asbestos are different and plaintiffs have various injuries from different sources.''Before any group of defendants can be tried together, there must be a determination that the claims are sufficiently common and that they can be tried together without prejudice,'' said Walter Dellinger, a lawyer at O'Melveny &amp; Myers in Washington, which is representing Exxon Mobil. ''There has been no such determination about any number of these defendants.''The West Virginia trial is unusual because it involves plaintiffs who argue that they were exposed to asbestos in different ways, Mr. Dellinger said. For example, they could have been exposed in contaminated buildings or by products like brake linings, by companies that were manufacturers, owners of buildings or had some other connection to asbestos.Even some lawyers for the plaintiffs said the trial was somewhat unusual.It is normal to have 10 to 100 defendants in a case, not 250, said Perry Weitz of Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, which has represented thousands of asbestos plaintiffs. ''Because they have so many different plaintiffs with different exposures, that's why you have 250.''Jury selection in the case began yesterday and lawyers said that opening statements could begin as early as this afternoon.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/24/business/company-news-honeywell-says-it-settled-asbestos-claims.html?ref=dowchemicalcompany">COMPANY NEWS; HONEYWELL SAYS IT SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS<date>Published: September 24, 2002</date><text>Honeywell International said it had settled asbestos claims brought against it in West Virginia, as the trial began in a state court.

Putin's Russia these days.Today, the European Union said it would recognize Russia as a market economy, an upgrading of its status under the union's trade regulations and a designation that Moscow had sought for years. In a statement, Romano Prodi, president of the union's executive body, the European Commission, called it ''fit and proper'' that the 15-nation union ''reward the considerable efforts'' Russia has made to remake its economy.Just last week, President Bush was spreading smiles and handshakes in Moscow and talking approvingly of expanding commercial ties and American investment in Russia.These developments both ratify and give new impetus to a business trend that has been gathering speed recently: American and other Western companies doing business in Russia as if it were part of Europe and not outer space.''For investors, it's very important to feel comfortable with the country as a whole,'' said Kiril Dmitriyev, an investment manager at Delta Capital Management, with $200 million invested in Russia. Recent events ''raised confidence,'' he added. ''Russia is becoming integrated into the world economy instead of staying alien.''Beyond confidence, there are also practical pluses of improved trade status. With more access to foreign markets, Russia is a more desirable place to invest. Fewer trade barriers would allow multinational companies to use Russia, where labor is cheap, as a production base for exporting to Europe. So far, however, foreign companies are setting up shop here to sell to the undeveloped Russian market with its 147 million people.The Frito-Lay unit of PepsiCo is tending new acres of green potato fields just south of Moscow. General Motors and Ford Motor are each due to complete work on new car plants in Russia this summer. The American candy maker Mars recently bought a factory near Moscow to expand its food lines. Even Wal-Mart Stores has sent executives to look around, though the company is silent about particulars.''We have far more meetings now,'' said Andrew Somers, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow, adding that he recently helped Nike, Dow Chemical and even a midsize American kitchen fixtures maker get the lay of the land here.''They were looking at Russia not as an exotic planetary phenomenon but as an integral part of the European market,'' Mr. Somers said.
